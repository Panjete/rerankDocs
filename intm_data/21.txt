currently the worlds attention is focused on the news of the coronavirus pandemic right now it is difficult to assess the true extent of this pandemic since the number of infected people depends on the number of tests performed and the number of deaths from coronavirus depends on the specifics of cause-of-death registration in each particular country or even region for this reason many researchers analyzing the influenza epidemics do not analyze mortality from a specific cause but rather mortality from all causes since it is almost impossible to make a mistake in the fact of death the coronavirus pandemic is not the first pandemic in human history or even the first pandemic in the last 200 years the most famous and deadly is the 1918 spanish flu pandemic viboud and lessler 2018 in the post-war years the 196970 influenza pandemic was also causing significant losses not only among the elderly which are usually observed during regular influenza epidemics but also at middle ages rizzo et al 2007in this paper we consider the patterns of mortality during the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 using the data for italy and the usa these countries are currently leading in the number of persons infected with covid-19 an analysis of mortality in 1918 and the adjacent years may help us to better understand the course and scale of the current pandemic statistical yearbooks published shortly after 1918 in the respective countries were used as a data source for italy these are primarily ministro di agricultura industrie e commercio maic direzione generale della statistica dirstat maic 1924 1925a 1925b for the us data we used vital statistics rates in the united states 19001940 edition bureau of the census 1943 the age-specific mortality rates for the italian population are taken from the human mortality database human mortality databasefirst consider the trends of mortality rate in 19161919 in italy and the usa figure 1 shows the values of crude death rates per 1000 population by calendar year for italy you can see that mortality rose sharply in 1918 but in subsequent years it fell quite rapidly the crude death rate in pre-war 1913 is given for comparison because of significant war losses in italy in 19161918 in 1919 mortality already returned to the pre-war values a similar pattern is observed for mortality trends in 19161920 in the united states see figure 2 as in the case of italy in the united states there was a surge of mortality in 1918 and a fairly rapid drop of mortality in 1919however it is well known that the spanish flu epidemic passed in waves and the first cases of flu were recorded in the united states in march 1918 and the second deadly peak of the spanish flu was observed in the fall of 1918 to better understand the development of the spanish flu epidemic in 1918 and 1919 it makes sense to consider changes of mortality from all causes by monthmonthly mortality changes in 1918 and 1919 in italy are shown in figure 3 it follows from the figure that the acute phase of the spanish flu epidemic was observed in the fall of 1918 with a surge of mortality in october by april 1919 this elevated mortality wave totally disappeared at the same time the spring peak of the spanish flu epidemic in 1918 had practically no effect on the total mortalityfigure 4 shows monthly mortality changes in italy for 19161919 it follows from the figure that the spanish flu spring wave had little effect on total mortality which was almost the same in the first half of 1918 as in the previous two years however an increased number of deaths from influenza spanish flu was reported in italy in 1919 and even in 1920 see figure 5figure 6 shows monthly mortality changes in the united states in this figure one can see a slight increase in mortality in the spring of 1918 which looks insignificant compared to the peak of mortality observed in october as in the case of italy a decrease in mortality to normal levels occurred by april 1919 figures 4 and 6 show that the acute phase of the pandemic with very high mortality lasted from one to two months but a complete mortality decline to normal levels took about eight monthsnow consider age-specific mortality changes in 19171919 in the case of current coronavirus pandemic it is observed that older people are more likely to die from coronavirus than younger ones this observation is not surprising the analysis of mortality italy in 19692001 demonstrated that older people die more often during regular flu epidemics rizzo et al 2007 however during the 19691970 pandemic the excess mortality was observed not only at older but also at middle ages rizzo et al 2007 the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 differs from other flu epidemics by significant relative increase of mortality at middle ages figure 7 shows the age-specific mortality rates for italian women in 19171919 the figure for italian men is not given here due to significant war losses in 19171918 distorting the age-specific mortality patternfigure 7 shows a significant increase in mortality between the ages of 15 and 60 years during the spanish flu pandemic in 1918 in 1919 an increased mortality rate among middle-aged women was also observed while after the age of 65 mortality does not change at the same time we cannot say that mortality at older ages was unaffected by epidemic figure 8 shows age-specific mortality of women after age 65 in italy in 19171919 it can be seen that the spanish flu epidemic has added an additional mortality increment in 1918 to already high mortality rate at old ageeffect of the spanish flu epidemic on mortality can also be analyzed using time series of mortality data with the method of latent variables gavrilovet al 2017 gavrilova and gavrilov 2011 to this aim we conducted a factor analysis of mortality over the period of 19002014 we used so-called p-technique of factor analysis when the analysis occurs across different time points or observations values of hazard rates at different years for ages 25 through 85 we applied factor analysis procedure with promax rotation method using the stata release 13 statistical package we identified two factors capable of explaining almost 98 of the variance in the temporal changes of hazard rates thus mortality evolution in italy can be described by the following model
xt0x1xf1t2xf2t
where x is age t is time x 1x 2x are three sets of parameters depending on age only while f1t and f2t are two sets of parameters depending on time only sets of coefficients determined by factor analysis modelsby studying the variation of these factors over time we noted that the first factor  comparable to the senescent mortality gavrilov and gavrilova 1991 willmoth 1997 and chiefly concerning the old ages population  remained remarkably stable over a period of 19001950 see figure 9 the second factor  comparable to the background mortality gavrilov and gavrilova 1991 and observed in the young population  declined from the beginning of the century figure 9 shows the trends in background and age-related senescent mortality factors in italy in this figure peaks of background mortality are noticeable in 1918 the epidemic of spanish flu and in the 1940s world war ii this figure shows that in italy the effect of the spanish flu epidemic on mortality was even stronger than the effect of hostilities during the world war ii it is also seen that subsequent influenza epidemics did not have a noticeable impact on background mortalitythe data presented here clearly demonstrate that the spanish flu pandemic cannot be compared to the later flu epidemics and pandemics of influenza by its effect on mortality a distinctive feature of the 1918 pandemic was a high percentage of deaths among young and middle-aged people with a relatively low increase in mortality among the elderly studies have shown that this phenomenon was observed among the population of europe and the united states but in the more remote regions of latin america and the pacific islands the mortality of the elderly from the spanish flu was even higher than at younger ages it is believed that exposure to influenza viruses in childhood could have a protective effect in the elderly in europe and the usa during the 1918 pandemic simonsen et al 2018returning to the epidemic of coronavirus it should be noted that there is a certain similarity in the damage to respiratory system produced by the coronavirus and the spanish flu virus including acute respiratory distress syndrome cilek et al 2018 right now we can do only preliminary estimates regarding the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on total mortality the italian institute of statistics instituto nazionale di statistica regularly publishes the number of deaths from all causes for some municipalities on its website wwwistatit according to these data during the period from march 1 to march 28 2020 29565 people died in the studied municipalities of italy during the same period of 2019 14603 people died in the same municipalities thus the number of deaths in the studied municipalities of italy in march 2020 doubled for comparison the death toll in italy in october 1918 the peak of the epidemic was five times higher than in october 1917 in the united states mortality in october 1918 was 36 times higher than in october 1917 these data suggest that the coronavirus epidemic must be taken seriously yet the coronavirus epidemic has significant differences from the spanish flu epidemic the main difference is that the group with the highest risk of death from coronavirus is mainly elderly people with burden of chronic diseases although deaths of healthy middle-aged adults also occur mortality at older ages is highly seasonal mainly due to seasonal influenza epidemics rosano et al 2019 therefore the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on mortality can be better assessed by studying the entire set of data on seasonal mortality including data for 2020 which are currently insufficient one can only assume that the coronavirus epidemic is likely to lead to a parallel upward shift in mortality for ages over 20 years in semi-log coordinates similar to what happened during the spanish flu epidemic for ages over 60 years fig 8 some optimism is inspired by the fact that the acute period of the spanish flu epidemic with unusually high mortality did not last long  one to two months it should be remembered that the waves of the epidemic continued after 1918 until 1920 but their impact on the total mortality was negligible therefore we can hope that in the case of coronavirus pandemic the acute phase heralded by mortality surge will not last longviral infections are the most frequent infectious diseases and are common triggers for constituting major health and socio-economic harms meo et al 2020 in late december 2019 an earlier named novel coronavirus 2019-ncov currently

biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality outbreaks of coronavirus covid-19 infectionsin this study the information on the biological and epidemiological trends on global prevalence and mortality due to novel coronavirus covid-2019 infections was obtained from the world health organization worldometer-coronavirus the centers for disease control and prevention and reports from various countries and their allied ministries to the who hence ethical approval was not requiredthe data were recorded and analyzed and the results were expressed in numbers and percentages the regression analysis was performed and a p-value 005 was considered significantthese results are established from the available information at the time of publication originating from

 the outbreak of novel coronavirus covid-2019 started on december 29 2019 the results shows rising trends in the transmission prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus covid-2019in this study we also analyzed the daily cases and death growth factors of the coronavirus covid-2019 it was identified that during the january 22 to march 31 2020 the growth factor of the number of cases worldwide was 028 to 696 mean 120 and the growth factor of death rates was 051 to 217 mean 112 there was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate r20996 it showed a mutable change in both the daily case growth factor and mortality rate fig 3coronavirus infection is an emerging global health concern and has infected a significant portion of the worlds population in this study we investigated the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus covid-19 infection the covid-19 infection is expanding over 198 countries and territories infected 750890 people has caused 36405 484 deaths during the period december 29 2019 to march 31 2020 table 1the coronavirus covid-2019 infection is rapidly transmitted the disease is still in its spreading phase with predictions of infection expand to over one people globally we have derived the estimates of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic and found that still the mean growth factor for number of cases and mortality rate is more than 10 it is highly contagious because of its biological characteristics meo et al 2020 it is a zoonotic disease with person-to-person transmission through droplet or contact transmission wu et al 2020 infected people can transmit the disease before they present clinical symptoms rothe et al 2020 this is the main reason that the disease could swiftly spread from wuhan china to various corners of the globe more recently the epicenter of the diseases appears to have shifted from wuhan china to the european world and mainly italy and united states of america world health organization 2020a world health organization 2020b many countries including china italy saudi arabia new zealand poland ireland denmark spain france have cancelled international flights and implemented the worlds largest and most restrictive quarantines policies to minimize the further transmission and disease burden for the prevention of the spread of the disease these countries are not permitting people to enter or leave the country without strict screening of the passenger for covid-2019 infection at airportsquilty et al 2020 evaluated the usefulness of thermal passenger screening for covid-19 infection at airports exit and entry points the authors found that effectiveness of entry screening was dependent on the effectiveness of the exit screening at the destination the authors identified that 46 of the infected travelers were not detected because of the incubation period and asymptomatic or subclinical cases chan et al 2020 quilty et al 2020 also reported that airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of covid-19 infected travelers the screening is intended to be a barrier for preventing infected people from entering into the country however evidence of its effectiveness remains limited these are reasons that health officials are still unable to control the spread of this contagious disease the transmission of the disease is closely linked to the asymptomatic and infected people and those visiting the countries with covid-19 pandemicthe coronavirus covid-2019 spreads over 198 geographical regions of the globe the gender-based analysis demonstrated that the identified cases consisted mostly of men with median age range of 50-65 years li et al 2020 reported that the novel coronavirus covid-2019 infection was found in china and later spread almost entire nations of the world the virus infection mainly occurred among the elderly with the median age of 59 years december 29 2019 to march 31 2020 the number of cases was positively linked to the death rate of covid-19 infection fig 4 the disease is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trendsthe epidemiological trends show that novel coronavirus covid-19 is highly contagious and has affected 750890 people with a mortality rate of 484 the number of cases were proportional to the number of deaths there was a great fluctuation in the biological and epidemiological trends both in the growth factor of number of cases and the mortality rates global health officials have taken high priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe but still the coronavirus covid-19 is swiftly spreading with mutable biological trends the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating the dire need for enhanced public health mediations good hygienic conditions social distancing and movement limitations to control the covid-19 epidemics

preschool children have viral infection 610 times in a year and school-age children and adolescents have 35 times in a year1 in a study published by american centers for disease control and prevention in 2015 pathogens were detected in 80 of 2254 pneumonia cases in patients aged between a day and 17 years 66 of these pathogens were viruses23viruses may cause several clinical conditions that require hospitalization in a picu such as bronchiolitis pneumonia chronic lung diseases and more severe manifestations such as myocarditis encephalitis and sepsis besides the known agents recently new generation viruses including human metapneumovirus hmpv coronavirus and bocavirus have also been lead to cause these manifestations45in this study it is aimed to bring out the clinical characteristics of patients who had viral infections requiring picu admission during winter season in turkeyinitially descriptive properties of variables mean median number and percentage were found numerical variables were checked for normal distribution student t test was used for normally distributed numerical variables mann-whitney u test was used for variables with no normal distribution when two groups were compared in comparison with the numerical values of multiple groups anova was used for variables with normal distribution and kruskal vallis test was used for variables with no normal distribution comparison of categorical variables was carried out by chi-square test and fisher exact test the most effective presenting finding on mortality was revealed with regression analysis multivariate regression analysis was performed for determining mortality risk factor critical ph and pco2 value were found with the roc curve roc analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between blood ph and mortality the p-value 005 was considered as significant the results were evaluated using the statistical package for social sciences - spss 17 chicago usa programdata of 302

828 days in the patients who did not receive antiviral therapy p 005 it was found that virus species did not affect mortality between patients who received and did not receive antiviral therapy table 5bacterial infection was detected in the cultures of 16 of patients there was bacterial infection in 435 of patients who died and in 145 of patients who were discharged p  0001 secondary bacterial infection was detected in 375 of patients with coronavirus 25 of patients with adenovirus 20 of patients with influenza 179 of patients with rhinovirus 172 of patients with parainfluenza 143 of patients with rsv and 71 of patients with hmpv there was statistically no difference between the viruses in terms of development of secondary bacterial infection p  05of all 923 of patients required respiratory support treatments renal replacement therapy was performed in 66 plasma exchange in 52 and ecmo in 19 of patientsviral respiratory tract infections are the most common infections worldwide they are the most important cause of mortality in all age groups particularly in children7 this retrospective observational study was conducted in order to analyze the course of seasonal viral infections of respiratory tract in patients hospitalized in picus of 16 centers representing the whole country there are a bunch of studies in literature investigating the relationship between viruses and morbidity comparison of single-multiple viruses or relationship between diseases and viruses818 current study is multi-directional and has comprehensively analyzed all these issues in a very large population requiring picuviral respiratory tract infections constitute significant proportion of patients admitted to picus in winter and these patients require advanced intensive care support with high mortality and morbidity rates in line with this our study group shows a very high mortality rate as 76 which supports the justification of this multicenter survey although respiratory tract viruses commonly cause lower respiratory tract infections presentation with extrapulmonary clinical manifestations are also likely in children under one year of age819 similarly the most common cause of hospitalization was respiratory symptoms in our study fever neurological symptoms circulatory disorders and shock were more common indications for hospitalization in patients under one year compared to older children table 2 in patients over one year of age presenting with respiratory symptoms hypoxia as well as a need for mv were more common we attributed this situation to rsv which was more frequently observed in this age group in the literature rsv is more prevalent in infancy for picu admission though influenza and bocavirus that was more common in our patients less than one year of age1910we statistically evaluated all initial symptoms clinical laboratory and radiological and virus species through four parameters duration of stay on mechanical ventilation mv duration of stay in picu duration of hospitalization and mortality accordingly we assessed relationship among presenting symptoms virus species and severity of disease it was observed that presenting symptoms that have an effect on mortality were neurologic symptoms hypotension tachycardia and hypoxia it was also found that liver and renal function test abnormalities higher lactate values were related with death eighty-seven percent of mortalities are presented with acidosis table 1 the critical ph value related with mortality and critical pco2 was 710 and 60 mm hg respectively in regression analysis acidosis alone was found to increase mortality by 25 folds in the light of these findings it can be predicted that patients with neurological symptoms tachycardia hypotension low levels of pulse so2 acidosis and impaired liver or renal function at the time of admission will have a higher morbidity and mortalitykumar et al showed that organ failure in patients hospitalized in icu with h1n1 infection increased mortality11 also kendirli et al demonstrated the correlation between organ failures and mortality in the patients who presented with h1n1 infection12 similarly in our study mortality rates were higher and in regression analysis we demonstrated that initial presentation with mods increased mortality by 20-foldsin a study it was shown that rsv was the most common agent in patients who needed intensive care20 this is definitely compatible with our findingsspaeder and fackler reported that virus species did not affect durations of stay in picu and hospital as well as development of mods and mortality21 in our study we also investigated virus species organ failure relationship and emerging indications for picu admission we demonstrated that there was no correlation between virus species and diagnosis of admission to picu or type of organ failure developed table 4 however 63 of the patients who died in 2017 winter season had rsv parainfluenza or influenza secondary bacterial agent was observed in about half of the patients who died it is not easy to blame viral agents to be the leading causes of mortality because of the frequent accompaniment of secondary bacterial agents similar to the literature we found that secondary bacterial infections negatively affected mortality152223in the present study multiple viruses were detected in 13 of the patients although there are also contrary opinions2426 detection of multiple viruses does not affect mortality and duration of stay in picu222728 similarly we showed that multiple viruses did not affect mortalitywhen multiple virus isolated patients were excluded coronavirus revealed to be the most lethal virus as three out of eight patients with coronavirus died table 3 coronavirus is known as the primary agent of upper respiratory tract infection and common cold29 coronavirus had been defined as the causal agent of sars severe acute respiratory syndrome which more severely progresses in adults while the disease lasts shorter and shows milder progression in children30 unlike the literature coronavirus presented severe symptoms with organ failures in our group of patients table 4 lower respiratory tract infections caused by coronavirus types out of sars are rare and some studies found the incidence of pneumonia and bronchitis as 53136 therefore in our study the incidence of coronavirus was low that is consistent with the literature but unlike that coronavirus caused lower respiratory tract infections and emerged as the most lethal viral agent table 3 however 36 of the patients with coronavirus had secondary bacterial infections so coronavirus is not solely responsible for mortalityalthough secondary infections were found in only 16 of all patients we found that 94 of the patients who presented with viral infections received antibioticssixty-two percent of the patients received antiviral treatment oseltamivir because antiviral therapy was started before nasal swab results in patients with severe infection findings we found that antiviral therapy did not affect mortality table 5 including the influenza subgroup though there are studies in literature showing that oseltamivir initiated in the early period was effective3739 however weakness of our study is that the data we gathered is not capable of differentiating the initiation timing for antiviral therapy further studies are needed for this issue influenza is already known as the only agent that benefits from oseltamivir when we separately evaluated the influenza subgroup we found the median patient age as 41 months and higher prism and pelod scores compared with rest of the viral agents influenza was more common in older children and progressed more severely therefore oseltamivir can be preferred in children especially over one year of age and who presented with more severe symptoms because they are more likely to have influenzaconsistent with the literature comorbidities were common in the present study9121420 although 60 of the patients who died had an underlying disease a statistical correlation is lacking as described in the literature912in our study it was found that mechanical respiratory support was administered to the majority of the patients and renal replacement therapy was applied in the group which had organ failure and progression as expected we found that prism and pelod scores were higher in patients who diedwe found that tachycardia hypotension hypoxia acidosis impaired liver or renal tests and mods at the time of admission are the factors associated with mortality and predictors of a severely progressing disease it was found that acidosis increased mortality by 25-folds and mods by 20-folds respiratory symptoms were common and besides respiratory symptoms incidence of circulatory disorders and shock findings were also high in patients less than one year of age fever tachycardia neurologic symptoms the incidence of anemia leukocytosis thrombocytopenia impaired renal tests and electrolyte imbalance were high in patients less than one year of age consequently acidosis and mods at the time of admission or a patient less than one year of age with symptoms mentioned above should alert clinicians for a possible poor prognosis although we could not show the relationship of virus type with severity and mortality rsv parainfluenza and influenza were the commonly isolated viruses in the patients who died coronavirus was found as the most lethal virus although coronavirus is known as the primary agent of upper respiratory tract infection and common cold this result of our study can be attributed to the incidence of secondary bacterial infections being high in the patients with coronavirus detected with this context further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between coronavirus and mortalityin our study we could not demonstrate effects of oseltamivir on mortality duration of hospitalization and stay in the picu including influenza subgroup but there are studies reporting that oseltamivir initiated within first 48 hours is beneficial therefore oseltamivir can be preferred in children who present with more severe symptoms because they are more likely to have influenzasevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a novel zoonotic pathogen it is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 1 the covid-19 pandemic has imposed a heavy burden on global health and medical systems 2 a whole genome scan has shown that sars-cov-2 has a 79 similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and a 50 similarity to middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 3 currently sars-cov-2 is classified as a sars-associated coronavirus and taxonomically belongs to the subgenus of sabek virus 3 sars-cov-2 is the 7th coronavirus outbreak following hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 sars-cov and mers-cov 4 of the 7 coronaviruses the former four can cause common cold symptoms but sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov can lead to severe respiratory syndromes with about 676 96 and 355 mortality rates respectively 24several similarities in the pathogenicity clinical features and transmissibility of covid-19 sars and mers have been identified 5 the median age of covid-19 cases ranges from 49 to 57 years similar to those of sars and mers 5 the most common presenting symptom in covid-19 sars and mers is fever followed by cough sore throat and dyspnea 5 laboratory findings in patients diagnosed with covid-19 differ little from those of patients diagnosed with sars or mers lymphopenia is the most common finding other findings included low platelet count decreased albumin level and increased aminotransferases lactic dehydrogenase ldh creatine kinase and c-reactive protein crp levels 5 radiological presentation of covid-19 differs little from the other two coronavirus-associated pneumonias 5 furthermore sars-cov-2 has the same human cell receptors as sars-cov the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 6 these features suggest that covid-19 sars and mers may have common mortality risk factors there have only been a handful of case-control and cohort studies about covid-19 mortality this has resulted in poor covid-19 mortality prognosis identification therefore a systematic review of covid-19 sars and mers studies with mortality outcomes will provide perspective for understanding the clinical laboratory and imaging features of covid-19 in addition a systematic review could compare and contrast the risk factors for in-hospital death among these three lethal coronaviruses this will provide a new strategy for covid-19 prevention and treatmentthis systematic review follows the methodological approaches outlined in the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions version 60 7 it is described according to the prisma-p preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses protocols statement 8 this systematic review has been reported in the international prospective register of systematic reviews prospero database crd42020180929we chose five online bibliographic databases medline epistemonikos cochrane china national knowledge infrastructure and wanfang stata as a basis for identifying the relevant literature up through april 11 2020 the search string was sars or severe acute respiratory syndrome virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus or mers or middle acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus or 2019-ncov or novel coronavirus or sars-cov-2 or covid-19 and prognosis or prognostic factors or factor prognostic in addition we manually searched the included articles reference liststo determine eligibility four independent researchers evaluated all studies retrieved by the search using their titles and abstracts in cases of disagreement a fifth investigator was consulted a studys eligibility for inclusion in the meta-analysis was based on the following selection criteria i studies included patients infected by sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov ii patients in the studies had clinical outcomes including death iii studies reported demographic characteristics clinical manifestations laboratory indicators and imaging iv articles were written in either chinese or english conference papers review published letters editorials and studies including pregnant women or children were excluded we also excluded studies if they were the only study reporting on a specific indicator when there was overlap in studies patients ie utilizing the same period region or hospital we chose the study with the larger samplefour investigators independently extracted the following data from each included study and input them to a data extraction form study name author research publication date study design study area and hospital or institute number of patients data source demographic characteristics clinical features laboratory indicators and imaging case definitions for covid-19 sars and mers the fifth researcher checked the article list and data extraction to ensure there were no duplicate articles or duplicate patient datathe quality of the studies included was independently appraised by four authors using the newcastle-ottawa scale nos for observational case-control and cohort studies 9 observational studies were rated as high quality if they had a score of 6-9 moderate quality if they had a score of 4 or 5 and poor quality if their score was 3 or lowerresults were merged across studies with stata version 151 stata corp mp college station tx usa 1011 we applied a random-effects meta-analysis model which accounted for the included studies populations being infected by different coronaviruses as well as variation in the number of patients and their clinical stages estimating the common effect size was impossible in light of the studies heterogeneity we calculated the standardized mean difference in laboratory indicators between the survivors and non-survivors of covid-19 sars and mers respectively then to determine the strength of association for various indicators with clinical outcomes estimates were pooled with generic inverse-variance and expressed in odds ratios or with 95 confidence intervals ci per factor this follows the cochrane handbook guidelines risk factors of covid-19 sars and mers including demographic characteristics comorbidities clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators were ranked according to the absolute or values shown in table 1
 subgroup analysis was done by covid-19 sars and mers respectively between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the i

 finally there was considerable overlap in the studies in terms of regions and hospitals in order to prevent research redundancy we selected the 28 studies with the largest samples for our meta-analysis this resulted in a total of 16095 patients covid-19 11818 patients 910 death sars 3292 patients 336 death mers 985 patients 465 death including 1711 in-hospital death patients the characteristics of the included 28 studies are summarized in supplementary table 1 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 these included studies were conducted in several coronavirus outbreak areasbeijing guangdong shanxi hong kong and taiwan in china and toronto where sars broke out 12 studies saudi arabia and south korea where mers broke out 6 studies china italy south korea and the united states where covid-19 broke out 10 studies among these studies 11 were case-control studies 13 were cohort studies and 4 were case series the diagnostic criteria for covid-19 sars and mers were laboratory diagnostics clinical characteristics and epidemiological investigation as issued by the world health organization who we analyzed 31 factors in the meta-analyses table 1 the nos for observational case-control and cohort studies assessment were showed in supplementary table 1 the 28 included studies scored between 5 and 9 none of the studies was considered to be poor qualityelder patients were found to have higher mortality rates total or  786 95 ci 546-1129 covid-19 or  645 95 ci 386-1077 sars or  1197 95 ci 882-1624 mers or  702 95 ci 459-1073 fig 2

respectively this resulted in five similar laboratory indicators among these three coronavirus diseases including ldh neutrophils crp and bun and albumin table 1 however the wbc counts in the covid-19 patients the interleukin-6 il-6 levels in the sars patients and the creatine levels in the mers patients varied between covid-19 sars and mers these results were statistically significant table 1 moreover the variation in laboratory indicators among the covid-19 patients was higher than those of the sars and mers patients with the exception of hemoglobin hb supplementary figs 1-2 and table 1

sensitivity was analyzed with duval and tweedies trim-and-fill test the results showed that chronic lung disease and alanine aminotransferase alt were not robust supplementary table 2millions of covid-19 patients have been diagnosed worldwide and it is a major burden on public health and medical systems around the world 2 vaccines and specific drugs for covid-19 are not yet available and many countries have experienced collapses in their clinical medical systems this has been a factor in covid-19 becoming a pandemic 42 therefore to provide supportive treatment covid-19s clinical manifestations laboratory indicators and imaging features must be identified this systematic review has included a large sample of case-control and cohort studies of covid-19 sars and mers its results are representative we included 28 studies of covid-19 sars and mers with in-hospital death outcomes this covered 16095 patients and 1711 in-hospital deaths covid-19 11818 patients 910 deaths sars 3292 patients 336 death mers 985 patients 465 deathsadvanced age has been reported as an independent predictor of death for sars and mers 2541 this systematic review confirmed that advanced age is associated with covid-19 mortality previous studies of macaques inoculated with sars-cov have found that older macaques have stronger innate host responses to virus infection than younger adults these studies have also shown an increase in differential gene expression associated with inflammation whereas type i interferon beta expression declined 43 the age-dependent defects in t-cell and b-cell function and the excess production of type 2 cytokines could lead to a viral replication control deficiency and more prolonged pro-inflammatory responses potentially causing poor outcomes 44 during systemic viral infection aging alters the host-pathogen interaction to overproduce interleukin-17 which activates neutrophils this contributes to liver injury and death 45 moreover advanced age was positively correlated with exaggerated pulmonary responses to injury the inflammatory response is delayed but aggravated in the elderly 46 in addition the average ages of both survivors and non-survivors of covid-19 were higher than those of sars and mers supplementary table 3 this might be due to sars-cov-2s pathogenesis being milder than that of sars-cov 47the results of this meta-analysis show that non-survivors of covid-19 sars and mers have a higher proportion of co-existing chronic diseases than survivors covid-19 patients with various comorbidities including diabetes hypertension and chronic lung disease were founded to have a higher likelihood of complications and death chronic inflammation increased coagulation activity immune response impairment and potential direct pancreatic damage by sars-cov-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and covid-19 48 pro-inflammatory cytokine storms have been shown to cause rapid deterioration in covid-19 patients 49 increases in systemic il-2 il-6 and il-7 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor c-x-c motif chemokine ligand 10 chemokine ligand 2 and tumor necrosis factor- have been observed in covid-19 patients the same cytokines have been shown to be factors in the development of hypertension in experimental and clinical observations as well as interventional studies 49 research has found that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and current smokers have elevated expression of ace-2the entry receptor for the covid-19 virus 50 it has been documented that sars-cov-2s average age is higher than that of covid-19 see supplementary table 3 this might contribute to the lower likelihood of death in covid-19 patients with comorbidities of diabetes and hypertension compared with sars patients therefore diabetes hypertension and chronic lung disease are involved in the pathological mechanism of covid-19 however the progression of this disease needs further investigationthe differences in laboratory indicators between covid-19 survivors and non-survivors are substantial higher wbc counts and procalcitonin levels indicated that a large proportion of deceased covid-19 patients might have had secondary bacterial infections these secondary infections may be a factor in mortality deceased covid-19 patients had more severe lymphopenia than patients who recovered suggesting that a cellular immune deficiency state was a factor in poor prognosis additionally other laboratory abnormalities in deceased patients included coagulation disorder elevation of prothrombin time and d-dimer impaired liver and kidney function mild or moderate elevation of alt ast total bilirubin bun and creatinine elevated inflammatory markers high sensitivity crp and ferritin and cytokine storm most notably deceased patients had higher ldh levels than patients who recovered the d-dimer high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i serum ferritin ldh il-6 levels and lymphocyte counts were all elevated in covid-19 non-survivors compared with survivors throughout the clinical course and illness progression 14next we identified increased ldh crp and bun levels and neutrophil count decreased albumin was correlated with mortality in covid-19 patients neutrophils can form neutrophil extracellular traps which contribute to organ damage and mortality in covid-19 51 the changes in crp and albumin levels might be due to the coronavirus increasing inflammation in the body leading to poor outcomes the elevated ldh and bun in deceased patients might be due to heart or kidney injury caused by the coronavirus disease in addition this systematic review has suggested that il-6 level is an important mortality factor in covid-19 and sars patients the role of il-6 in predicting respiratory failure and identifying severe covid-19 cases has been reported 5253 the il-6 level has also been positively associated with crp ldh ferritin and d-dimer levels in covid-19 patients 5253 furthermore lower lymphocyte subtype counts are mortality risk factors in sars patients it has been shown that lymphocyte subsets can differentiate severe covid-19 patients from non-severe covid-19 patients 54the degree of difference among covid-19 laboratory indicators reviewed in this study was higher than that of sars and mers with the exception of hb accordingly we speculated that the older patients with lower sars-cov-2 covid-19 pathogenicity also contributed to the differences in laboratory indicators between covid-19 and sars mers patients stronger inflammatory effects higher cytokine levels and cellular immune deficiency were found and led to poor outcomes in older patients suffering from viral infections 43 44 45 46 however 81 of the confirmed chinese covid-19 cases were classified as mild ie non-pneumonia or mild pneumonia 14 as severe ie dyspnea respiratory frequency  30min blood oxygen saturation  93 to inhaled oxygen ratio  300 andor lung infiltrates  50 within 24 to 48 hrs and 5 as critically ill ie respiratory failure septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunction or failure 55 sars patients respiratory distress and oxygen desaturation progressed rapidly with 20-36 requiring intensive care and 13-26 progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards necessitating invasive ventilatory support 56 among the 144 laboratory confirmed and 17 probable mers patients from nine countries 441 developed pneumonia 516 required intensive care 57in addition the imaging features for consolidation and bilateral ground glass shadows in the lungs of covid-19 patients were similar with those of sars and mers patients 17 the number of deceased covid-19 patients who had suffered from pulmonary consolidation and had presented ground glass imaging characteristics exceeded that of those who had survived covid-19 consolidation or  326 95 ci 116-913 ground-glass opacity or  145 95 ci 047-449 1417 the percentage of

the imaging features were also correlated with initial presentation start of ribavirin first use of pulse corticosteroid peak lung opacification both before death and at discharge for sars patients imaging features were also correlated with the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils oxygenation index and ldh levels 59this systematic review and meta-analysis has several limitations first it analyzes a large sample of case-control and cohort studies of covid-19 mortality risk factors however the patients covid-19 laboratory mortality indicators included in this meta-analysis were limited to the wuhan area with the outbreak of the pandemic studies from different regions are needed to validate the correlation between laboratory indicators and covid-19 mortality secondly one of the mers mortality studies included in this systematic review covered critically ill patients thus the or values of the mers mortality indicators may have been underestimated thirdly transfer of patients between hospitals variation in the types of patients admitted to the designated hospitals and regional differences were all inevitable therefore there was severe heterogeneity among the mortality risk factors in the covid-19 studies included in this meta-analysis in the future more covid-19 patients need to be investigatedcovid-19 mortality factors are similar to those of sars and mers advanced age as well as comorbidities and laboratory indicators including ldh crp neutrophil bun and albumin are correlated with covid-19 mortality additionally age and laboratory indicators would facilitate even

interest related to this workon january 7 2020 a new pathogenic virus causing pneumonia was identified in a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in wuhan hubei province china the pathogen had typical features of the coronavirus family and therefore was classified in the subgenus sarbecovirus orthocoronavirinae subfamily 1 2 this virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and the disease it causes has been named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 it is the third epidemic coronavirus that has emerged in the human population in the twenty-first century following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars outbreak in 2002 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers outbreak in 2012 3 4coronavirus is one of the main causes of human respiratory disease owing to frequent cross-species infections the emerging virus rapidly became a challenge for global public health due to it spreading through human-to-human transmission the majority of the earliest covid-19 patients were linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market however human-to-human transmission has frequently occurred and the epidemic has been gradually growing 5 as of march 4 2020 80566 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported in china internationally more than 14396 cases had been reported in 77 countries 6 7 the number of infected individuals is far surpassing that of sars and mers sars-cov-2 can cause severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome it has been reported that sars-cov-2 is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities suggesting that age and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcomes 8 9 in china the reported death rate approached 3 of the total number of covid-19 patients during february 2020at present information regarding the prevalence and case-fatality for the clinical features and epidemiology of covid-19 remains scarce however a relatively accurate evaluation of incidence and mortality is required to help refine the risk assessment and to ensure that the public and patients are managed in an effective way therefore it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the risks for individual groups of different ages and genders in this paper we report our initial analysis of the public data from local authorities our study shows that the incidence risk of covid-19 might be as low as 01 for children while it could be over 09 for 40-year-old adults our results also suggest that the mortality risk might be above 02 for patients older than 80 years notably the mortality risk was significantly different between patients of hubei province and those from other parts of chinabasic information on covid-19 cases was released on official websites by the national health commission of china and its local branches we collected data from a total of 6673 identified cases published before february 22 based on the completeness of the data we involved 5319 cases in our study all the 5319 covid-19 cases were residents outside hubei province a total of 76 fatal cases were included in our analysis among the 76 fatal cases 45 cases were reported as residents of hubei province and 31 cases were reported as residents of other parts of china epidemiological characteristics such as age gender and location were carefully checked to remove missing values or duplicated records the composition of the age of the general public was obtained from data of 1144648 individuals from the general census of china 2018 10 the census data were collected from the whole country including 31 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government ethical approval for this study and written informed consent from the participants of the study were not required in accordance with local legislation and national guidelineswe estimated the incidence risk of covid-19 for different age groups in the general public by a maximum likelihood approach in this approach given the age composition of the general public and the incidence risk of different age groups age composition of covid-19 cases can be obtained aswhere pincidece  agei is the incidence risk of age group i and pagei is the proportion of age group i in the general public we assumed that the incidence risk for different age groups could be obtained from a logistic function of age pincidenceagei11exp-ir the likelihood of observation for age composition of 5319 covid-19 cases can be maximized by searching for optimized  and  consequently the incidence risk can be achieved in a maximum likelihood approach where the risk is given by a logistic function of age with estimated parameters  and to assess the mortality risk of covid-19 in the general public we used a maximum likelihood approach that is similar to that mentioned above we obtained the age composition of fatal cases of covid-19 aswhere pmortality  infection agei is the risk of mortality condition on an individuals age and infection state and pagei  infection mortality is the age composition of fatal cases of covid-19 in this study we assumed that infection happens in all age groups for the general public and therefore have pagei  infection  pagei we further applied the maximum likelihood approach to obtain the mortality risk of covid-19 for different age groups in the general public pmortality  infection agei in the maximum likelihood approach the mortality risk was given by the aforementioned logistic function of age but with mortality-specific  and  to eliminate the concern that the high mortality risk of older people may inflate the mortality rate of the infected population we further imputed the mortality rate of the infected people asthe public data of a total of 5319 identified covid-19 cases were included in our analysis there were 2829 532 males and 2490 468 females in the covid-19 cases the male to female ratio turned out roughly equal across all age groups the age of covid-19 patients ranged from 05 to 97 years with a mean of 452 years the age and gender composition of covid-19 patients and the public reference are presented in table 1 compared to the general public the covid-19 cases had a higher average age and there was a higher proportion of people aged 3069 yearswe collected detailed information on 76 fatal cases and plotted the age composition of the cases and the general public in figure 1 it is evident that death occurs more frequently in older people but is rare for patients under 40 years old the fatal cases were from 34 to 89 years old with an average age of 7147 and a standard deviation of 1249based on the age composition of 5319 covid-19 cases and the 1144648 individuals of the general public we estimated the incidence risk by a maximum likelihood approach our results show that the disease can occur in all age groups and there is no significant difference between males and females figure 2 the difference in incidence risk for different genders is observed only for the groups between 15 and 50 years old after the age of 15 years males have a slightly higher incidence risk than women but the increase is negligible for people over 50 years old our result does not support a previous report that sars-cov-2 generally affects more males than females in the epidemic 8 the incidence risk is low for children and teenagers but rapidly increases for adults for adults over 40 years of age the risk is higher than 09 when they have full exposure to the virusin our assessment of mortality risk there is a significantly higher mortality risk in older adults figure 3a the estimated fatal probability is 001 for individuals under 40 years but it is more than 051 for people older than 90 years the calculated risk is much higher than previous reports stated our result is consistent with most of the earlier studies supporting the hypothesis that older age is associated with an increased risk of mortality in covid-19 patients our analysis of the total of 76 fatal cases suggests a mortality rate of 238 for general infection however we noticed that the mortality rate of covid-19 in reports is significantly different between identified cases of hubei province and that of other parts of china 11to compare the mortality risk between hubei and other provinces of china we divided 76 fatal cases into two subsets 45 cases from hubei province and 31 cases from other parts of china the aforementioned statistical analysis for mortality risk was applied to the two subsets with nine different age groups in each to account for variability we further obtained a standard deviation of estimates by applying the same method to 1000 simulated data sets that were generated from the initial estimation our results show that mortality risk is no more than 013  010 for people over 80 years outside hubei province but the risk is as high as 060  015 for the corresponding age group in hubei province figure 3b mortality risk falls under 005 for people younger than 70 years in other parts of china while only people under 50 years have a risk under 005 in hubei province we also calculated the expectation of mortality rates for a general infection inside and outside hubei province as 478 and 095 respectivelyour results suggest that there is a significantly higher mortality risk for covid-19 in seniors than that given in the previous report 11 this is probably due to the published report not accounting for the increasing death rate of the identified covid-19 cases in the previous study the crude mortality rate was only 23 but the rate was 37 on march 4 2020 3015 deaths among 80566 identified covid-19 cases as of march 4 2020 there were still 5952 covid-19 patients in critical condition in china it has been reported that the survival probability of critically ill patients continuously decreased with the increase of time since admission to the intensive care unit 12 our analysis was based on the composition of the age of the different populations and therefore it is less affected by the disease progression of patients especially the increasing death rate of critically ill patients age has been reported as the independent predictor of an adverse outcome in sars and mers comorbidities and low immune function in older people might be the major cause of a higher mortality of coronaviruses 3 4 11 prompt administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and the strengthening of immune support treatment might reduce the mortality of seniors 8our data showed that the mortality rate of covid-19 is five times higher in hubei province than that in other parts of china this result is supported by an early publication that stated the estimated case fatality rate of mainland china excluding hubei was 015 far less than that of the hubei province excluding the city of wuhan 141 and wuhan city 525 13 on the one hand this difference may be partially explained by insufficient medical resources due to such a large number of patients in hubei province during the outbreak according to the 2018 annual brief report of the health service development in wuhan city there were 86 hospital beds per 1000 people however hospital bed utilization ratio of 2017 and 2018 reached 9234 and 9422 respectively 14 it was shown that even under normal circumstances there were few spare beds on the other hand detailed information on the majority of fatal cases 40 of 45 in total from hubei province was published before january 25 2019 the mortality rate of early reported cases may be overstated because case detection is highly biased toward the more severe cases however we strongly suggest that international authorities try their best to immediately prevent covid-19 patients from overloading their health care system our hypothesis that a smooth-running health care system can effectively reduce the mortality rate of covid-19 is strongly supported by the low mortality rate in other parts of chinain conclusion we investigated the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of covid-19 patients and the general public in china our data show a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for older adults therefore it is prudent to strengthen the tertiary preventive and clinical care of old-aged patients to reduce mortality furthermore our results also support the conclusion that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1 or less our study could be of value to medical authorities to implement effective medical service the lack of complete data for all covid-19 cases potentially increases the occurrence of selection and measurement biases in this study therefore further large-scale epidemiological studies are necessary to elucidate the risk factors of covid-19 for the general

 mortality is poorly assessed but it is clear that there are chronic carriers as well as asymptomatic carriers studies have shown that there are as many asymptomatic carriers as symptomatic patients 39 three epidemic episodes of emerging coronaviruses have been reported the first severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus had very little impact on global morbidity and mortality with more than 8000 recognized cases and 774 deaths 1516 the second middle east respiratory syndrome mers-coronavirus remained localized in saudi arabia with a small epidemic of mainly nosocomial infections in south korea 17 mers-coronavirus like sars-coronavirus highlighted the major danger of nosocomial transmission to healthcare personnel the health of whom is essential in these epidemics 18 finally sars-cov-2 the novel coronavirus that appeared in december 2019 has expanded and has now affected more than 90 000 people worldwide 21920 at the time of writing a significant number of cases had occurred in the far east it is incontestably contagious as a quasi-experimental study on the diamond princess cruise ship showed that confinement of infected patients with uninfected patients resulted in rapid infection of the uninfected patients leading to 700 additional cases on board 21 however coronaviruses in common circulation remain predominant because of their global distribution and their non-negligible mortality 1422 the aim of this study was to share the experience of a reference laboratory representing approximately 1 of serious and diagnosed respiratory infections particularly seasonal in france this will allow the evaluation of the relative mortality of different human coronaviruses presented in hospitals in marseille compared with that of sars-cov-2assistance publique-hpitaux de marseille ap-hm covers all public hospitals in marseille including four university hospitals la timone hospital conception hospital north hospital and south hospital this corresponds to 3400 beds and 125 000 admissions each year 23 the ihu mditerrane infection diagnostic laboratory tests all samples from ap-hm in which respiratory viruses are suspected molecular biology is used for diagnosis the results are monitored by a weekly automated surveillance system in the diagnostic laboratory coupled with a laboratory information system nexlabs 23 sars-cov-2 epidemiological data were obtained through an online platform gathering data from public agencies 24 statistical analyses were performed using biostatgv softwarein 2016 there were 594 000 deaths in france 592 of these deaths occurred in a care establishment 25 in the same year ap-hm reported 2854 deaths as such it can be estimated that approximately 08 of deaths in care establishments in france occurred in ap-hm hospitals this estimate provides an approximation of the number of people affected by a pathogen in france according to the number of people who died each year at ap-hm hospitalsfrom 1 january 2013 to 31 december 2019 21 662 samples were tested by the ihu mditerrane infection diagnostic laboratory among these 770 samples were positive for coronavirus with eight deaths mortality rate 1 among identified coronaviruses 63 were identified as hku1 one death mortality rate 16 74 were identified as nl63 two deaths mortality rate 27 92 were identified as e229 one death mortality rate 11 and 160 were identified as oc43 four deaths mortality rate 25 three hundred and eighty-one coronaviruses diagnosed before 2017 were not assigned to any of these four strains table 2
systematic testing molecular biology for sars-cov-2 was performed from 1 january 2020 to 2 march 2020 in total 7059 samples from patients presenting with infectious symptoms were tested by the ihu mditerrane infection diagnostic laboratory among them 543 samples were positive for coronaviruses with two deaths mortality rate 036 277 samples were hku1 146 samples were nl63 77 samples were oc43 and 43 samples were 229e no cases of sars-cov-2 were identified among these samples of the two deaths one patient had oc43 mortality rate 13 and one patient had hku1 mortality rate 036 there were no deaths from nl63 or e229 during this periodover the same period ihu mditerrane infection was the regional centre for detection of the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 at the time of writing 596 analyses have been performed on suspected cases since the emergence of the novel pathogen from which four cases of sars-cov-2 have been identified in addition 337 french nationals returning from hubei province have been tested twice and all were negative for sars-cov-2by 2 march 2020 a total of 90 307 patients have tested positive for sars-cov-2 worldwide with 3086 deaths mortality rate 34 among the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd countries 7476 patients have tested positive for sars-cov-2 with 96 deaths mortality rate 13 table 3
 in france 191 people have tested positive for sars-cov-2 with three deaths mortality rate 16this study compared the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 in oecd countries 13 with the mortality rate of common coronaviruses identified in ap-hm patients 08 from 1 january 2013 to 2 march 2020 chi-squared test was performed and the p-value was 011 not significantthis study found that the mortality rate of common coronavirus infections is 08 in france in comparison the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 in european or american developed countries of a comparable economic level is 13 table 3 if the extrapolation of deaths in ap-hm hospitals is correct in metropolitan france this would represent 54308  100  67 875 cases of patients hospitalized with a respiratory infection with common coronaviruses in 2 months which is almost as many cases as for sars-cov-2 worldwide in fact mortality from respiratory infections is extremely dependent on the quality of care and access to care and severe forms have a better prognosis in countries with superior medical infrastructures under these conditions there does not seem to be a significant difference between the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 in oecd countries and that of common coronaviruses 2 test p011 of course the major flaw in this study is that the percentage of deaths attributable to the virus is not determined but this is the case for all studies reporting respiratory virus infections including sars-cov-2 indeed viral infections are ecosystem infections where the outcome depends on the inoculums and the surrounding microbiota 26 thus certain bacteria seem to be associated with symptomatic manifestations such as streptococcus pneumoniae haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus which are known to cause an excess of mortality due to secondary infection finally seasonality geographic location heat and humidity are co-factors as are age gender and underlying pathologies under these conditions and all other things being equal sars-cov-2 infection cannot be described as being statistically more severe than infection with other coronaviruses in common circulationfinally in oecd countries sars-cov-2 does not seem to be deadlier than other circulating viruses in addition to coronaviruses there are 16 endemic viruses in common circulation in developed countries adenovirus bocavirus cytomegalovirus enterovirus influenza a h1n1 virus influenza a h3n2 virus influenza b virus metapneumovirus parainfluenzae virus 1 parainfluenzae virus 2 parainfluenzae virus 3 parainfluenzae virus 4 parechovirus picornavirus rhinovirus syncytial respiratory virus and 26 million deaths from respiratory infections excluding tuberculosis per year have been noted in recent years worldwide 27 there is little chance that the emergence of sars-cov-2 could change this statistic significantly fear could have a larger impact than the virus itself a case of suicide motivated by the fear of sars-cov-2 has been reported in india 28in addition coronaviruses that have rarely been tested systematically around the world may persist in the pharynx of asymptomatic people representing a potential source of population immunity 29 furthermore it should be noted that systematic studies of other coronaviruses but not yet for sars-cov-2 have found that the percentage of asymptomatic carriers is equal to or even higher than the percentage of symptomatic patients the same data for sars-cov-2 may soon be available which will further reduce the relative risk associated with this specific pathologyat the end of 2019 a number of patients with fever and clinical pneumonia of unknown origin were found in wuhan hubei china 1 through virus isolation gene detection and the analysis of protein structure in the laboratories the disease was identified as 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by a new kind of coronavirus researchers have found that this new coronavirus belongs to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 2 3 4 this novel coronavirus is currently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 on february 12 2020 the world health organization who announced that the disease caused by sars-cov-2 was officially named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 covid-19 is another serious infectious disease caused by coronavirus after severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2015 sars-cov-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans 1since january 2020 covid-19 has rapidly spread throughout china causing serious harm to human health up to april 27 2020 at least 2878196 patients have been confirmed to have covid-19 all over the world of whom 198668 have died 5 the who characterized covid-19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 after it announced that covid-19 in china was a public health emergency of international concern pheic on january 31 2020 67 due to the severe outbreak of covid-19 and its wide-ranging scope strict prevention and control strategies should be implemented in the affected countries and the treatment of infected individuals should receive more attentionas reported by the china centers for disease control and prevention approximately 128 of patients with covid-19 have hypertension and 4 of patients have cardiovascular disease cvd the mortality rate of patients with cardiovascular disease is much higher than that of patients without comorbidities 8 growing evidence suggests that combined cardiovascular disease may increase the severity of coronavirus infection and lead to a poor prognosis 9 10 11 12 13 at the same time there is also evidence suggesting that serum levels of cardiac necrosis biomarkers have increased to varying degrees in both mild and severe covid-19 patients suggesting different degrees of myocardial damage 9 10 11 12 13 14 moreover the study found that the markers of myocardial necrosis in severe and deceased covid-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild covid-19 patients suggesting that cardiac damage may be related to poor prognosis 9101213 existing evidence suggests that covid-19 is closely related to cardiovascular disease but the specific interaction between the two is unclear this paper describes the relationship between coronavirus and cardiovascular diseases through a review of the literature and datasets about sars mers and other diseases caused by the human coronavirus hoping to provide some assistance for the prevention and treatment of covid-19coronaviruses covs are the largest group of viruses belonging to the nidovirales order which includes the coronaviridae arteriviridae and roniviridae families covs are further subdivided into four groups the    and  covs 15 the newly discovered sars-cov-2 belongs to the -covs 2 all covs are enveloped nonsegmented positive-sense rna viruses 15 the most significant feature of covs is the club-shaped spike projections emanating from the surface of the virion therefore cov look like a tiny corona as depicted in studies by cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy prompting the name coronavirus 16 17 18 cov is a respiratory virus that exists widely in nature its natural hosts include humans and other mammals such as pigs dogs cats mice and bats 19at present seven human coronaviruses hcovs have been discovered in which hcov-229e 20 hcov-nl63 2122 hcov-oc43 23 24 25 hcov-hku1 26 sars-cov 27 28 29 30 and mers-cov 3132 are included in addition to sars-cov-2 recently isolated from the respiratory tracts of patients with covid-19 in wuhan 2 3 4 hcovs mainly cause respiratory infections of which four endemic hcovs hcov-nl63 hcov-229e hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 mainly cause mild respiratory infections and the other three epidemic hcovs sars-cov mers-cov sars-cov-2 can cause acute severe pneumonia 1933coronaviruses originally discovered as hcov-229e are the cause of respiratory infections in children and adults but they are not particularly dangerous patients respiratory symptoms are mild similar to those of the common cold 34 most clinically significant coronavirus infections occur in children under two years of age although adults can also be severely infected 3536 mortality is negligible 37 however sars-cov and mers-cov which have appeared since 2003 are highly contagious and cause a high incidence and mortality rate of pneumonia 3337 38 39 in addition to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 is another human coronavirus that can cause severe pneumonia 1 the researchers compared the sequence of sars-cov-2 from wuhan with that of sars-cov and mers-cov through genetic testing and found that the gene sequence of sars-cov-2 is almost identical with a homology to mers of approximately 40 and a higher degree of homology to sars of approximately 70 40 the differences between the sequences are mainly in the orf1a gene and the spike gene encoding s-protein which is the key protein for the interaction between coronavirus and host cells 40the coronavirus spike protein is a multifunctional molecular machine that mediates coronavirus entry into host cells it first binds to a receptor on the host cell surface through its s1 subunit and then fuses viral and host membranes through its s2 subunit 4142 some cellular receptors of human coronavirus have been identified including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 404344 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 45and aminopeptidase n apn 46 coronavirus enters the human body through receptors on the surface of host cells multiplies in the body and causes inflammation in the body and diseases such as pneumoniasimilar to sars-cov ace2 was found to be a receptor for sars-cov-2 434748 ace2 is also an important member of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas it catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin ii ang ii to angiotensin 1-7 activates downstream mas receptors and finally exerts anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects 49 in addition ace2 can also decompose ang ii into angiotensin 1-9 angiotensin 1-9 not only can be catalyzed by ace and further decompose into angiotensin 1-7 but also can directly activate ang  type 2 receptor at2r exerting its anti-inflammatory and anti-angiotensin  type 1 receptor at1r effects 50ace2 is primarily expressed in the heart kidneys and testes and it is widely distributed in human alveolar epithelial cells small intestinal epithelial cells arterial smooth muscle and endothelial cells and vein endothelial cells 5152 in the heart ace2 is expressed in the endothelium 51 and cardiomyocytes 53 increasing evidence suggests that ace2 enzyme activity has a protective role in cardiovascular disease the loss of ace2 can be harmful because it may lead to worsened heart function and the progression of heart and vascular disease 4954 virus-induced ace2 down regulation may attenuate its function diminish its anti-inflammatory role and heightened angiotensin ii effects in the predisposed patients 55 the tissue localization of the receptors correlates with covid-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction in the lung ace2 is expressed in type i and type ii alveolar epithelial cells in addition 83 of type ii alveolar cells express ace2 56 the combination of sars-cov-2 with ace2 results in increased expression of ace2 which can lead to alveolar cell damage in turn triggering a series of whole-body reactions and even death 48wrapp et al 18 found that the receptor-binding ability of sars-cov-2 is 10-20 times stronger than that of sars-cov providing a laboratory basis to prove that sars-cov-2 is more infectious than sars-cov 3 there is evidence showing that ace2 levels are higher in men than in women 48 however the male-to-female ratio of ncp-confirmed cases is 0991 in wuhan 1041 in hubei province and 1061 in china 8 meaning that there are few differences in prevalence between men and women however the crude case fatality rate for men 28 is slightly higher than that for women 17 8 however the relationship between ace2 expression level and sars-cov-2 infection rate and mortality remains unclearraas inhibitors including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor acei and angiotensin receptor blocker arb drugs are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension heart failure and myocardial inflammation they can control the level of ang ii in the body slow down the deterioration of inflammation and improve patient survival aceis and arbs can also exert their protective effects by activating the ace2angiotensin 1-7mas axis which may lead to increased ace2 in patients 5758 increased ace2 expression levels may lead to an increased risk of infection however there are no reports indicating that patients using aceisarbs are more likely to become infected whether acei  arb can be widely used in covid-19 patients with comorbid cardiovascular disease was unclear or even controversial 59 but recently guo et al reported that although more patients with higher troponin t tnt were using acei and arb medications owing to their baseline cvd their use was not associated with patients mortality rate 60 a research published in circulation research by zhang et al showed that among hospitalized covid-19 patients with hypertension inpatient use of acei  arb was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with acei  arb non-users 61 we can see that in-hospital use of acei  arb was not associated with an increased mortality risk there is no need for patients with hypertension to stop using acei  arb or switch to other antihypertensive medicinehcov-229e and hcov-oc43 35 were discovered in the 1960s and hcov-nl63 22 and hcov-hku1 26 were later discovered in upper respiratory tract infections asthma bronchiolitis and pneumonia there is evidence showing that infant elderly and immunocompromised patients are more likely to be infected with high mortality rates 3762 63 64 these infected patients are more likely develop severe disease states 65 66 67 68varghese et al 37 retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 261 children with hcov infection including 229e hku1 nl63 oc43 and found that approximately 165 of the children had cardiovascular disease hcov-infected children with cardiovascular disease are more likely to receive respiratory support and enter a pediatric intensive care unit picu suggesting that the underlying cardiovascular disease increased the severity of hcov infection in the children cabea et al found that children with heart disease are more likely to be infected by hcovs 69 the presence of congenital heart disease was a significant risk factor for severe coronavirus infection in children who were less than five years old 70 table 1
hypotension was found in a small number of patients with these four hcov infections 70 table 2
 there is no relevant evidence showing that hcov infection can cause heart injury however kim et al reported that hcovs were detected in children with kawasaki disease which is characterized by acute systemic vasculitis in childhood and may induce severe cardiovascular complications 71 serological tests suggest that hcov-229e may be involved in the occurrence of kawasaki disease 72 therefore we still need to pay attention to cardiovascular complications when facing these four kinds of hcov infectionthe severe acute respiratory syndrome 27 that broke out globally in 2003 is different from the human coronavirus described previously it is a severe acute respiratory infection with clinical manifestations of fever and dry cough with the lungs as the main locations of lesions some patients quickly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure with high mortality 73 74 75 76 77there is much relevant evidence showing that pre-existing comorbid conditions are one of the major determinants of fatality 7678 79 80 81 82 83 it has been reported that the presence of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart disease is associated with adverse outcomes and mortality in sars patients 84 85 86 87 wong et al reviewed the medical records of fatal cases and found that 60 of the patients who died had comorbid conditions such as hypertension and coronary artery disease 88 chen et al found that patients with combined hypertension and cerebrovascular diseases are more likely to develop ards 89 another study by hu et al showed that the incidence rates of critical conditions and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome  mods  among sars patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were 18-fold and 19-fold higher than those of patients without underlying disease suggesting that cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are major risk factors for sars patients to devolve into critical conditions and mods and eventually lead to death 90 table 1regarding the cardiovascular complications of sars patients it was found that sars patients had subclinical diastolic impairment without contraction involvement and this damage may be reversible upon clinical recovery 91 another study by yu et al found that cardiovascular complications including hypotension and tachycardia are common in sars patients but are usually self-limiting bradycardia and cardiac hypertrophy were less common and arrhythmias were rare 92 acute myocardial infarction can also be seen in a few sars patients 93 sars-cov was reported to be found in 40 718 patients of heart samples from patients who died of sars during the toronto outbreak 76 which might explain the myocardial damage discovered in sars patients 89 there are reports indicating that sars-cov also attacks small blood vessels throughout the body causing systemic vasculitis 94 table 2 in addition to clinical studies laboratory studies were performed to look for the pathophysiological mechanism associated with myocardial dysfunction caused by sars-cov infection 95 96 97 98 99 it was reported that pulmonary infection with sars-cov in mice led to a myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ace2 expression which may be responsible for the myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with sars 99mers is a severe respiratory infectious disease caused by mers-cov that was first reported in saudi arabia in september 2012 29 the symptoms are similar to those of sars and severe cases can manifest as pneumonia with ards and other severe life-threatening complications such as septic shock acute myocarditis and multiple organ failure 100 101 102 103 104 105 the mortality rate of mers is 355 which is much higher than that of sars 10 39it has been reported that people with underlying diseases such as diabetes cardiovascular disease renal failure obesity and immune deficiency are more likely to develop severe diseases after being infected with mers-cov 105106 badawi et al found that 50 of mers patients have diabetes and hypertension and that approximately 30 of patients have heart disease 107 they believed that these underlying disease conditions inhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines damage the hosts natural and humoral immune systems and lead to an increased risk of severe mers complications another study found that 462 of the patients who died had hypertension suggesting that the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease increased the mortality of mers 108 banik suggested that sufficient attention should be paid to mers patients with combined underlying diseases to reduce the occurrence of serious complications and mortality 109 table 1heart damage was also reported in mers patients 110 mers-cov was found in the kidneys of deceased patients but was not detected in the heart tissue and the heart showed no significant histological changes 111112 however an animal model study clearly stated that mers-cov rna could be seen in cardiac tissue implying direct cardiac pathology 113 the mechanism of heart injury in mers infection remains unclear and requires more researchcovid-19 which broke out at the end of 2019 is a disease caused by infection with sars-cov-2 124 similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 is a -cov 2 covid-19 is similar to sars and mers and manifests as extensively pathological viral lung inflammation 1 although similar to sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 has its own characteristics 1114 early cases suggest that covid-19 may not be as severe as sars and mers however the rapidly increasing number of cases and increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission suggest that sars-cov-2 is more contagious than sars-cov and mers-cov and has a lower fatality 39115 116 117 up to april 27 2020 the overall mortality of covid-19 was 69 globally 5 but the fatality rate is different in different regions and times ranging from 07 to 135 5118the symptoms of covid-19 infection appear after an incubation period of approximately 64 days 119 fever fatigue and dry cough are the main manifestations of covid-19 and a few patients have symptoms such as nasal congestion runny nose sore throat and diarrhea 29120121 patients with severe cases often experience dyspnea andor hypoxemia one week after onset 122 severe cases of covid-19 progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome septic shock and metabolic acidosis which is difficult to correct and coagulopathy 10current case reports show that sars-cov-2 infection may have cardiovascular symptoms in addition to the typical respiratory symptoms a small number of patients have atypical clinical manifestations and may start with cardiovascular symptoms such as chest tightness palpitations and chest pain a study by liu et al found that 73 10137 of patients had palpitations as the first symptom 123 it was also reported that 2 of patients experienced chest pain during hospitalization 11 in addition wang et al found that 167 of patients with covid-19 had arrhythmias 10according to relevant studies 9 10 11124 the proportion of covid-19 patients with comorbid cvds such as hypertension coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease was larger than that of patients with other comorbidities or without comorbidities suggesting that patients with cvd may be more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection moreover the incidence of cvd in patients with severe or fatal cases with covid-19 was higher than that in patients with nonsevere cases or in those who survived 1213124 according to the reports of the chinese center for disease control and prevention 157 of the deaths were hypertension and 9 had other cardiovascular diseases further suggesting that underlying cardiovascular diseases may be one of the important risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with covid-19 8 it can be seen not only that the number of covid-19 patients with cardiovascular disease is large but also that these patients have poor tolerance to severe pneumonia and are more likely to develop severe cases table 1cardiac complications such as electrocardiography abnormities diastolic dysfunction and acute myocardial injury were reported in patients with covid-19 124 125 126 127 cases of severe myocarditis with reduced systolic function have been reported after covid-19 128 129 130 and sars-cov-2 infection-related myocarditis is likely associated with myocardial injury 60128 according to the study by li et al the most common organ damage outside the lungs was heart injury 13 serum myocardial necrosis markers such as hypersensitive troponin i hs-tni and creatine kinase ck increased to varying degrees in patients with mild and severe cases of covid-19 9 10 11 12 13 14131 132 133 134 however the risk of heart injury was higher in patients with severe cases approximately 222 to 31 912126133134 than in patients with mild cases approximately 2 to 4 910 the percentage of heart injury in covid-19 patients who died approximately 28 to 89 1213132 was higher than that in those who survived n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide nt-probnp levels were also reported to be increased 13134135 increased hs-tni and probnp expression levels may be risk factors for severe illness and high mortality of covid-19 133 134 135 furthermore it was found that high hs-tni levels were associated with increased levels of inflammation neutrophils il-6 crp and pct and decreased levels of immunity lymphocytes monocytes and cd4 and cd8  t cells suggesting that cardiac injury may have something to do with the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response 131132 table 2two recent studies published in jama cardiology reported the cardiovascular complications of covid-19 in detail 60136 shi et al found that cardiac injury was a common condition among hospitalized patients with covid-19 in wuhan china and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality 136 guo et al reported that myocardial injury was significantly associated with fatal outcome of covid-19 myocardial injury was associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury 60 table 2covid-19 may induce new cardiovascular diseases and  or aggravate potential cardiovascular diseases the short-term and long-term cardiovascular effects of covid-19 and the effects of specific treatments are unclear and need further investigationas the epidemic spread sars-cov-2 evolved multiple subtypes in a recent study researchers proposed the subdivision of the global sars-cov-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural nsp3 nsp4 nsp6 nsp12 nsp13 and nsp14 cistrons structural spike and nucleocapsid and accessory orf8 genes 137 six virus subtypes were predominant in the population accounting for more than 97 of the samples isolated from around the world and the subtypes showed some geographical structure with two clusters a smaller one comprised of isolates mostly sampled from western hemisphere subtypes ii vi ix x and xi and a larger one whose isolates were sampled from western and eastern hemispheres subtypes i iii iv v vii viii xii xiii xiv xv and xvi 137 the researchers believed that the genetic structure determined for the sars-cov-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs 137in another earlier study population genetic analyses of 103 sars-cov-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types designated l and s that are well defined by two different single nucleotide polymorphisms snps 138 the l type 70 is more prevalent than the s type 30 but the s type was found to be the ancestral version the l type is more aggressive and spread more quickly and it was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in wuhan but the frequency of the l type decreased after early january 2020 for more severe selective pressure placed by human intervention on the l type 138 contrary to the l type the s-type which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive might have increased in relative frequency due to the weaker selective pressure 138it was also reported that among the 27 viruses isolated from wuhan 26 963 were l type and only 1 37 was s type 138 however among the other 73 viruses isolated outside wuhan 45 616 were l type and 28 384 were s type 138 this comparison suggests that the l type was significantly more prevalent in wuhan than in other places and recent studies about the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with covid-19 in wuhan 9 10 11139 or outside wuhan 134140141have showed that the mortality of covid-19 patients and the proportion of patients with cardiac injury outside wuhan was lower than that in wuhan table 3
 although there were many reasons for the different incidence of cardiac injury and outcome of covid-19 in and outside wuhan such as the shortage of medical resources in wuhan the role of different sars-cov-2 subtypes cannot be ignored the relationship between sars-cov-2 subtypes and the mortality of covid-19 or the cvd complications need for further immediate comprehensive studies that combine genomic data epidemiological data and records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019according to the references above we can see that patients with underlying cvd may be more likely to become infected with coronavirus and cvd may be one of the risk factors for poor prognosis and high mortality of cov infection few studies however have explored the mechanisms underlying these associations we believe that the possible mechanisms may be related to inflammationcardiovascular diseases such as hypertension coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are all metabolic-related diseases it has been reported that metabolic syndrome can downregulate the key mediator of the hosts innate immune response to pathogenesis affecting the function of the innate and humoral immune systems 142 chronic low-grade inflammatory disease has been widely recognized as a feature of coronary heart disease and its occurrence is closely related to inflammation 143 the occurrence of hypertension is associated with oxidative stress inflammation and the activation of the immune system 144 il-6 il-1 and tumor necrosis factor  tnf- levels are higher in patients with hypertension than in patients with normal blood pressure 145 this may explain why patients with underlying cardiovascular disease found in the clinic are more susceptible to infectionkulcsar et al showed that mers-cov infection can lead to prolonged respiratory tract inflammation immune cell dysfunction and changes in the expression profile of inflammatory mediators 146 lymphopenia and increased inflammatory mediators were found in sars-cov-2 infection 147 immune disorders caused by sars-cov infection have also been reported 148 these may lead to the exacerbation of the original cardiovascular disease which is related to the death of some patients found in the clinic due to heart failure 88103132 according to information released by the shanghai municipal health and family planning commission the first covid-19 death in shanghai was in an individual who was 88 years old with a severe history of hypertension and cardiac insufficiency an analysis of the cause of death suggested that the patient died of heart failure and systemic multiple organ dysfunction therefore sars-cov-2 infection was just an inducement for exacerbations 124overall the heart and lungs are inseparable in the normal physiological functions of the human body on the one hand comorbidities and complications of the heart increase the risk of pneumonia infection and exacerbation on the other hand pneumonia infection may aggravate existing cardiovascular diseases such as increased blood pressure increased heart failure and the recurrence of myocardial infarctionfever is a common symptom in patients with coronavirus infection 927149 fever promotes the immune functions of humans and some animals and decreases the pathogenicity of some microbes antibody production t-cell activation neutrophil function and macrophage oxidative metabolism have been reported to increase in the presence of fever 150 151 152 153 154 however to avoid excessively elevated body temperature affecting normal physiological functions the body will activate sympathetic nerves and regulate circulatory function which will increase the heart rate and cardiac output 155 an increase in heart rate over a long period of time will lead to increased myocardial oxygen consumption and decreased cardiac output which may cause ischemia or heart failure 156 many diseases with fever symptoms may be complicated by myocarditis such as spotted fever rickettsioses infection 157 severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome 158 drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms 159 dengue 160 161 162 complicated scrub typhus 163 herpes simplex virus infection 164 enteric fever 165a decrease in cardiac function may occur in febrile illnesses but whether myocardial damage is due to fever or the underlying infection is not known 166 weissinger et al found that in pigs with a bacterial infection with elevated body temperature serum ck lactate dehydrogenase ld and gamma-globulin gg levels were increased the administration of antibiotics to these pigs and lowering their body temperature reduced ck and ld levels but gg levels remained elevated suggesting that the infection did not decrease this study indicated that the levels of ck and ld were elevated due to fever caused by infection 167 k l et al discovered that a longer duration of fever was related to the occurrence of pericarditis after myocardial infarction 168 therefore heart injury in coronavirus infection may be related to feversevere pneumonia can cause significant gas exchange disturbances and lead to hypoxemia hypoxia reduces the energy production required for cell metabolism and increases the bodys anaerobic digestion acidosis and oxygen free radicals accumulated in the cell destroy the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane as hypoxia continues the intracellular calcium ion concentration increases significantly leading to a series of cell damage processes including apoptosis 169 at the same time hypoxia can also induce inflammatory reactions such as the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the release of cytokines leading to further tissue ischemia and may even cause myocardial infarction 13170171previous lessons from coronavirus and influenza have shown that viral infections can cause acute coronary syndrome 172173 arrhythmia 174 and exacerbation of heart failure 175 mainly due to a combination of significant systemic inflammation response and localized vascular inflammation at the arterial plaque along with other effects 176 177 178 evidence has shown that sars-cov induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mcp-1 transforming growth factor-beta 1 tgf-beta1 tnf il-1 and il-6 and interferon- ifn- in sars patients and experimental animal models infected with sars-cov 179180 tnf and il-1 family and il-6 family cytokines are considered proinflammatory mediators of heart failure and they have obvious negative inotropic effects which may explain heart failure complications in sars infection 181 the acute heart injury might be due to the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response to sars infection 30 there is evidence indicating that myocardial inflammation induced by sars-cov is mainly mediated by macrophages and the resultant production of chemokines 9596 the nuclear factor-b nf-b signaling pathway associated with the induction of proinflammatory cytokines is activated in sars-cov-infected mice treatment with drugs that inhibited nf-b activation led to a reduction in inflammation in both sars-cov-infected cultured cells and mice and significantly increased mouse survival after sars-cov infection indicating that the activation of the nf-b signaling pathway represents a major contribution to the inflammation induced after sars-cov infection and that nf-b inhibitors are promising antivirals in infections caused by sars-cov and potentially other pathogenic human coronaviruses 182sars-cov-2 appears to affect themyocardium and cause myocarditis 128 myocardial injury is likely associated with infection-related myocarditis andor ischemia 60 increases in inflammatory factors such as crp il-1 and il-6 were also discovered in sars-cov-2 infection 131132147 wu et al believed that sars-cov-2 may cause heart damage by the cytokine storm 131 evidence has shown that sars-cov-2 may mainly affect t lymphocytes especially cd4  t cells resulting in a significant decrease in lymphocyte numbers 183 the extent of lymphopenia and an increase in inflammatory cytokines are related to the severity of the disease 147 critically ill covid-19 patients had higher levels of il6 il10 tnf lactate dehydrogenase ldh and c-reactive protein than patients with mild covid-19 9139184 suggesting that inflammatory indicators are an important factor in the early diagnosis of severe covid-19most patients with coronavirus infection are in an inflammatory state which places the patients in a hypercoagulable state for example covid-19 leads to an increase in d-dimer levels in 40 of patients a decrease in activated partial thromboplastin time aptt in 16 of patients and a decrease in pt in 30 of patients further increasing the risk of embolism 11 hypercoagulability induced by inflammation might contribute to plaque rupture with subsequent thrombosis and myocardial injury 185 therefore clinicians should pay attention to covid-19 patients with coronary heart disease to prevent myocardial injury and myocardial infarctionseptic shock can be seen as a serious complication in sars mers and covid-19 1376103 approximately 62 of sars-cov-2 infections are complicated by shock 126 it was reported that left ventricular dysfunction occurs in approximately 20 of patients within 6 hours after the onset of septic shock and the incidence can increase to 60 by 1 to 3 days after the onset of septic shock 186 myocardial dysfunction and cardiovascular inflammation might lead to elevated creatine kinase and troponin 187 which might explain the high hs-tni in deceased patientsin addition to the abovementioned accompanying symptoms anxiety and stress can also lead to adverse reactions such as accelerated heart rhythms and elevated blood pressure especially in critically ill patients 188189 health anxiety could be found in coronavirus-infected patients 190 generally everyone experiences health anxiety to some degree and the associated vigilance to a potential health-related threat can be protective however excessive health anxiety can be detrimental 190 the literature indicates that stress can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system leading to an increase in peripheral glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels 191 high plasma catecholamine levels are associated with an increased risk of heart failure altered autonomic activity during depression can lead to arrhythmias the activated sns alters cardiac wall contractility and increases apoptotic pathways in cardiomyocytes contributing to cvd developmentalthough there is no relevant study on covid-19 patients suffering from anxiety medical workers have been reported to be anxious after direct contact with the patients 192193 a study by sun et al showed that some chinese showed acute posttraumatic stress symptoms during the covid-19 outbreak 194 therefore psychological counseling should be conducted on patients in a timely manner and anxiolytic drugs could be used when necessaryas mentioned above sars-cov was reported to lead to myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ace2 expression which may be responsible for myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with sars 99 direct sars-cov infection of cardiomyocytes may also lead to myocarditis and impaired myocardial function coronavirus-induced myocarditis and its subsequent progression to dilated cardiomyopathy have been described in rabbit models 195 sars-cov was found in heart samples from patients who died of sars 76 pathological findings showed a marked increase in macrophage infiltration in patients with sars-cov in the heart with evidence of myocardial damage mers-cov was not detected in the heart tissue and the heart showed no significant histological changes in mers patients 111112 however an animal model study clearly stated that mers-cov rna could be seen in cardiac tissue implying direct cardiac pathology 113 although myocarditis was reported in sporadic autopsy cases 128 there is still no clear pathological evidence supporting that sars-cov-2 can directly cause heart damagethe most frequently used drugs during hospitalization are glucocorticoids and antiviral drugs as well as antibiotics the secondary qt interval prolongation caused by the use of drugs during hospitalization cannot be ignored antiviral drugs lopinavir ritonavir antibiotics azithromycin moxifloxacin levofloxacin antifungal drugs glucocorticoids and some antiarrhythmic drugs there is a potential risk of prolonging the qtc interval 196197 drug-associated qt prolongation is associated with increased arrhythmic and non-arrhythmic mortality and it therefore continues to be an important metric of drug safety 198a small study in france enrolling 26 treated patients and 16 non-randomized controls showed that hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin shortened the time to resolution of viral shedding of covid-19 199 based on this study clinicians in many countries have begun using these medications in clinical practice and multiple randomized trials are being initiated but there were occasional case reports of hydroxychloroquine prolonging the qt interval and provoking torsade de pointes when used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus 200 201 202 203 the widely used antibiotic azithromycin was gradually recognized as a rare cause of prolonged qt severe arrhythmia and increased risk of sudden death 204 205 206 207 although there were no reports of arrhythmia death caused by the use of hydroxychloroquine the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin should also be noted 208active support with expected management based on early prognostic indicators may improve recovery appropriate treatment of heart failure arrhythmia acute coronary syndrome and thrombosis are still important with continued global cooperation on multiple methods specific evidence-based treatment strategies for covid-19 will emerge in order to protect the wider population antibody testing and effective vaccines will be needed to make a history of covid-19 and some treatment related issues need attentionfirstly the use of acei  arb drugs was controversial in the earlier phase of covid-19 epidemic but recently published studies suggested that there is no need for patients with hypertension to stop using acei  arb or switch to other antihypertensive medicine 6061209 some conjectures 210 based on the disease mechanism in the early stage of the outbreak that acei  arb may increase the infection of new coronavirus and the aggravation of covid-19 by increasing the expression of ace2 have been denied by more and more clinical evidence we see that the continuous treatment of covid-19 patients with hypertension with acei  arb will not only cause the deterioration of the condition but also continue to exert cardiovascular protection and even improve the prognosis 6061209secondly we should pay attention to the application of hydroxychloroquine 200 201 202 203 and azithromycin 204 205 206 207 for their side effects of prolonging the qt interval other drugs used to treat the covid-19 patients such as antiviral drugs lopinavir ritonavir antibiotics moxifloxacin levofloxacin antifungal drugs glucocorticoids and some antiarrhythmic drugs can cause the qt interval prolongation and should attract more attention reference by sapp et al would help to minimize risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmia during treatment of covid-19 211thirdly a recent study from jama reported that the mortality rate of patients with mechanical ventilation treatment was 881 212 multiple studies around the world have shown that the mortality rate of covid-19 patients using ventilator was still high 213 214 215 and it was believed that the ventilator should be used more cautiously in patients with covid-19 which can reduce the mortality of patients using the ventilator by more than 50 216 new guidelines should be established for when to use a ventilator for patients with covid-19 we advocate the application of staged breathing support methods to delay the use of ventilator simple oxygen treatment like nasal oxygen supply may be safer and more effectivefourth methylprednisolone are the classical immunosuppressive drugs which are important to stop or delay the progress of the pneumonia and have been proved to be effective for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in recent study 217 wu at al found that the administration of methylprednisolone appeared to reduce the risk of death in covid-19 patients with ards however of those who received methylprednisolone treatment 23 of 50 patients died this is a rather high mortality of 50 the indication timing dosage and duration the application of methylprednisolone needs further investigationfifth the early report showed that remdesivir was highly effective in the control of sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 218 but recent study published in lancet showed that remdesivir did not reduce the mortality of covid-19 patients 219 however another clinical trial showed that remdesivir accelerates recovery from advanced covid-19 220 another clinical trial showed that there was no significant difference in clinical outcome between the 5-day and 10-day course of remdesivir 221 these data suggested remdesivir does not reduce the mortality of covid-19 patients but have an effect on shortening the course of disease in mild patients and early medication may be better the application of remdesivir needs further researchesclinical data indicate that comorbid cardiovascular disease will aggravate the severity of coronavirus infection leading to a poor prognosis coronavirus may cause myocardial injury and the prognosis of patients with complicated myocardial injury is poor the mechanism of coronavirus causing myocardial injury and drug treatment options remain to be further studiedthis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorsthe authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this workcoronaviruses are single  stranded and positive  sense rna viruses among coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 seven coronaviruses hcov-229e hcov-nl63 hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov have been known to infect human hosts and cause respiratory diseases these seven known human coronaviruses hcovs can cause respiratory diseases from mild to severe symptoms hcovs caused mild upper respiratory symptoms until the unexpected outbreak of sars in 2003 was associated with significant infectivity and high case mortality rate1 the clinical manifestation of coronavirus infection widely ranges from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to rapidly progressing acute respiratory stress needing mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo or even acute death2 the initial symptoms of coronavirus infection are just common flu-like nonspecial symptoms like cough fever chills and gastrointestinal symptoms makes it difficult to distinguish from flu3 unfortunately coronavirus infection is much more dangerous and challenging than flu cold and usually rapidly progress into severe illness like severe pneumonia shortness of breath acute respiratory distress syndrome ards respiratory failure and other related life threating comorbidities the outbreak of sars was a turning point that human beings think of coronavirus and the novel coronavirus identified in a 60-year old man in saudi arabia in 20124 known as the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov strengthened the awareness and understanding of coronavirusboth sars-cov and mers-cov caused outbreaks affecting multiple countries severe disease and global threatening for its widespread infectivity rapid progress high variance and mortality rate and nonspecial treatment somewhat the same as sars-cov-2 in wuhan china5 as for treatments currently there is no defined primary remedy vaccination or prophylaxis nowadays treatments for such cases range from supportive treatment including fluid balance nutrition support invasive ventilation renal replacement therapy vasopressors corticosteroids immunoglobulins etc to antiviral treatment or both6 7 8 9 10 the specific antiviral treatments were interferons ifn ribavirin lopinavir and other related antiviral agents clinically the use of specific antivirals especially the utility of ifns is still under great debate for its efficacy safety and treatment-related adverse effectsinitial in vitro investigations demonstrated type i interferons ifn- ifn- to inhibit replication of sars coronavirus sars-cov11 based on previous studies morgenstern et al investigated the combination effect of ifn- and ribavirin to prevent sars-cov and yield potential benefits of the ribavirin plus ifn- for the treatment of sars12 illuminated by the possible antiviral treatment for sars several in vitro studies determined a possible efficacious effect of ifn-2b and ribavirin in the treatment of mers-cov infection13 14 subsequently the same investigators further examined the efficacy of these drugs in an animal study macaques 8 hours after they were inoculated with mers-cov with favorable outcomes15 strayer et al concluded that the most active drugs against sarsmers cov at clinically achievable serum levels were type i interferons and a tlr3 agonist interferon induceractivator16promising potential benefits of these antivirals successfully attracted attention of clinicians for the treatments of coronavirus infection though a systematic review conducted by zumla et al indicated that the application of type i ifns may not improve clinical outcomes there still exist several clinical trials determined that ifns could make contributions to increase survival rate improve oxygen saturation and associated with a more rapid resolution of pyrexia or radiographic lung opacities and respiratory improvements17 18 19 20 21 or even prophylaxis efficacy22 23a review of such anecdotal experiences is greatly needed for the more rational use of type i ifns for coronavirus therefore we conducted this updated systematic review and meta-analysis to recapitulate relevant studies to evaluate the safety efficacy tolerability and treatment-related outcomes of type i ifns for coronavirus infection in clinical practice with expectation to provide more robust evidence whether ifns should be served as first-line agents for coronavirus infection including the sars-cov-2this study was performed in accordance with prisma preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses24 the systematic literature search of databases was conducted by two independent reviewers on february 2020 these articles that contained relevant information on ifn and coronavirus were initially searched on pubmed cochrane library web of science database science direct wanfang data and china national knowledge infrastructure cnki without time period language and region restriction a mesh terms search and keywords search were combined the references of the included studies and reviews were also manually searched we used the following search terms using the boolean operators1 interferon or ifn or antivir or drug effect or drug ther or combination drug therand2 coronavirus or middle east respiratory syndrome or mers-cov or mers virus or sars or severe

dichotomous variables were analyzed using review manager version 53 cochrane collaboration oxford united kingdom and the mantel-haenszel method the crude ors and their 95 confidence intervals cis were calculated for continuous variables mean difference md with 95 ci was applied the single-rate meta-analysis was performed using stata 150 software stata corporation college station texas usa which assigned a weight to each study based on both within-study variance and between-study heterogeneityheterogeneity of these manuscripts was tested using both the chi-square test with a low p-value indicating high heterogeneity and p-value 01 indicating low heterogeneity and i2 index statistics 0 indicating no inter-study heterogeneity25 when i2 was  50 the fixed effects model was applied otherwise the random effects model was applied26 in all analysis p-value less than 005 was considered significantthe initial database search yielded 1073articles figure 1
 in addition six articles were added by manual searching from retrieved study lists and relevant reviews and two papers added by expert suggestion after eliminating 161 duplicate articles 920 titles and abstracts were screened after comprehensively screening 38 full texts only 15 studies complied with the eligibility criteria and were included at last among these three were rcts18 22 one of which has not published yet27 four were retrospective cohort studies6 20 28 29 four were case series6 19 21 23 one prospective cohort study30 one open-label preliminary study17 one open-label prospective randomized study31 and one retrospective observational study32turner et al firstly explored whether the prophylactic recombinant ifns could decrease cov-229e catch rate or reduce the severity of coronavirus cold symptoms in 1986 in a well-design randomized placebo-control study22 they recruited absolutely healthy volunteers for participants in their study they found that the cold-catch rate the mean nasal symptom score the mean total symptom score and the mean number of days with total symptom score 4 were much lower in ifns prophylaxis group than placebo group all reached significant difference table 2 as a consequence they concluded that prophylactic intranasal recombinant ifns effectively shortened the duration and reduced the severity of coronavirus cold symptoms this trial seemed to be the first research to establish the role of ifns in antiviral agentsduring the sars period zhao et al conducted a rct to compare four groups receiving different remedies in 200318 in their study ifns ribavirin antibiotics methylprednisolone were assigned into each group to make a comparison regarding the complexity of comprehensive treatment and defect of original design the results were inconclusive we could still realize some trends in treatment outcomes resolution of pyrexia and respiratory improvements were better in ifn-used group in addition combination of ifn- and high-dose methylprednisolone played the most vital role in resolution of pyrexia and respiratory improvementin 2003 an open-label preliminary study was conducted in the usa in which the authors compared the treatment effects of combination of ifn-1 and corticosteroids and corticosteroids only for sars-cov17 corticosteroids was vital in sars according to the study the combination of ifn-1 and corticosteroids treatments associated with improved oxygen saturation p002 and more rapid resolution of radiographic lung opacities p0001 less need for supplemental oxygen p002 less of an increase in creatine kinase levels p003 than systemic corticosteroid alone table 2a relatively large retrospective cohort study included 44 adult patients was designed by omrani et al in 2014 after the outbreak of mers-cov6 of those patients 20 patients received subcutaneous pegylated interferon-2a peg-ifn-2a and oral ribavirin and 24 patients control group received supportive treatment only the 14-day survival rate from the date of diagnosis was statistically higher in the treatment group compared with the control group 70 versus 29 p0004 and 28-day survival rate was still higher in antiviral group 30 versus 17 p0054 though didnt reach significant difference adverse effects were similar between groups decreased hemoglobin level was more obvious in combination of peg-ifn- 2a and ribavirin group but there were no life-threating adverse effects were detected and no premature discontinuation secondary to adverse effects happenedin 2015 another retrospective cohort study was conducted on 24 mers cases confirmed by rt-pcr in saudi arabia28 the authors compared the treatment difference between ifn-2a and ifn-1a of these included patients 13 received combination of ribavirin and ifn-2a subcutaneous once weekly and 11 received combination of ribavirin and ifn-1a subcutaneous three times weekly the fatality rate was 85 in ifn-2a vs 64 in ifn-1a p024 all patients tolerated well and no obvious severe adverse effects were detectedsimilarly al-quseer et al and mohammad et al also concluded that ifn plus ribavirin presenting possible efficacious for mers-cov according to their case series experience regardless of critically ill or mild ill coronavirus-infected patients19 21 there was still no life threating adverse effects detected in a retrospective observational study of five critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation though all patients died of multi-organ failure eventually ifns still played a vital role during supportive treatments moreover several side effects were detected among these five severely ill patients including drop in platelet drop in hemoglobin rise in lipase and emergence of pancreatitis but this should not only roughly ascribe to the effect of ifn32on account of insufficient data inconsistent initial study design and complexity of human bodies and case variance statistical synthesizing was impossible regarding abovementioned parameters table 1 as for total mortality rate we investigated the variance between critically and mild ill patients on the basis of our analysis the mortality rate was 690 95 confidence interval 612-768 i2711 and 112 95 confidence interval 19-205 i2985 in critically and mild ill coronavirus-infected patients both presented high heterogeneity and the random effect model was used figure 2
our study systematically investigated the application of type i interferons for hcovs infection in clinical practice according to our review ifns mainly acted a vital role in rapid resolution of lung abnormalities respiratory improvements better oxygen saturation reduced needs for supplemental oxygen support and less of an increase in creatine kinase level which are indispensable for advanced life support and further increase survival in the meantime several adverse effects were detected including drop in platelet drop in hemoglobin rise in lipase or bilirubin and emergency of pancreatitis only one critically ill case at terminal phage of disease but these treatment-related outcomes couldnt rule out the effects of other agents like ribavirin and still need further investigation33 these side effects were not life threating and much easier to solve compared with respiratory distress intractable hyoxemia or rapid progress of renal or hepatic failure the tolerability of type i ifns was acceptable and no premature discontinuation of ifn secondary to adverse effects was found in all case apart from remedy effect of ifn in coronavirus infection described above we also found the prophylaxis efficacy of ifn in coronavirus infection22 23 which increased and enhanced the utility of ifn in clinical practiceal-tawfiq et al reported their experience of five critically ill patients that were all died of multi-organ failure after treatment of ifn plus ribavirin and concluded that combination antivirals may not contribute to mers-cov-infected patients32 as preclinical data suggested in addition vast majority of adverse effects were reported by them we think this conclusion may be not objective they included only critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities all under mechanical ventilation and most importantly diagnosed late in admission the mortality rate was significantly related with comorbidities like chronic renal failure diabetes mellitus coronary artery disease hypotension elevated creatinine anemia etc and age more than 50-year20 28 whats more severity of illness was the greatest predictor of reduced survival in the multivariate analysis20 as for adverse effects this couldnt absolutely ascribe to ifn alone critically ill patients may suffer from respiratory abnormality internal environment disturbance and other disease-related complications beyond this some side effects at least drop in hemoglobin level was found related with ribavirin for its temporal toxicity21 33cheng et al concluded from their research that even with steroid therapy alone the mortality rate appeared to be low when compared with conservative treatment for pneumonia caused by sars-cov and the combination of an effective antiviral and steroid was associated with a better outcome34 the same results from omrani et al a retrospective cohort study ifn plus ribavirin have a decreased mortality rate than supportive treatment only and didnt significantly increase adverse effectsapart from antiviral therapy management should primarily focus on strict lung-protective ventilation35 our analysis indicated that the overall mortality rate of coronavirus-infected critically ill patients was about 690 and 112 in mild ill patients in accordance with imran khalids conclusion that delay in remedy would increase mortality35 but this caculated mortality rate may be higher that its actual level for publication bias as a consequence early dignosis and intervention would greatly improve outcomes19 this also suggested us paying attention to early screen of close contacts and suspected patients of such disease was equally crucialzumla et al summerized the therapeutic options for coronavirus in 201536 in the absence of a targeted vaccine with proved effects or a pathogen-specific antiviral broad-spectrum antivirals would still function to limit virus spread type i interferons could inhibite the replication of both rna and dna viruses at different stages of their replicative cycles and activate immune cell population to clear virus infection37 combined with clinical and molecular mechanism researches type i interferon presented as an ideal candidate broad-spectrum antiviralsthere is no doubt exist plenty of limitations in this descriptive analysis vast majority of studies are retrospective designs or case series the baseline characteristics of patients in different studies comorbidities intervetion strategies between-study heterogeneities are all impossilble to ignore and most importantly many of these studies reported the effect of combination treatment and not ifn alone thus this conclusion should be interpreted with great caution given insufficient data inconsistent study design and case variances statistical synthesizing is impossible to conduct currently data on ifns in hcovs are limited heterogenous and mainly observational current data do not allow making regarding robust commendations for the use of ifns in hcovs in general or in specific subtype but we still recommend the clinical use of ifns in hcovs within local protocolsclinically combination of ifn and ribavirin are reletively widely adopted to coronavirus onfection though lack of robust evidence3 one well-designed randomized placebo-control trial regarding effects of recombinant ifn-1b plus opinavirritonavir was registed in 2018 and still pending completion27 in this rct primary and secondary outcomes are mortality in the icu mortality in the hospital and 28-day mortality 90-day mortality sequential organ failure assessment scores at baseline and on study days 1 3 7 14 21 and 28 this seems to be the best conceived trial to determine the efficacy of antivirals in coronavirus infection we are looking forward to the successful administration of this clinical trial and calling for large-scale prospective randomized studies to assess the role of antivirals for the treatments of coronavirus to better guide clinical practicein conclusion type i interferons seem to improve respiratory distress relieve lung abnormalities present better saturation reduce needs for supplemental oxygen support type i interferons seem to be well tolerated and dont increase life threating adverse effects we still recommend type i interferons serving as first-line antivirals in coronavirus infections within local protocols with timely administration and monitoring of adverse events and interferons may be used to treat sars-cov-2 infected patients well-designed large-scale prospective randomized control trials are greatly needed to provide more robust evidence on this topicdeclaration of interestno financial or nonfinancial benefits have been received or will be received from any party related directly or indirectly to the subject of this articlecoronaviruses covs are enveloped viruses with a positive single-stranded rna virus which are widely distributed in humans and animals to cause respiratory infections in humans 1 nowadays the ongoing pandemic of covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus syndrome-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is an emerging rapidly evolving situation 2 as of april 14 2020 1924626 cases and 119625 deaths in total have been confirmed around the world suggesting that the overall death rate of covid-19 was 62 although sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share similarities in phylogeny and clinical trials the new type of coronavirus seems to have a higher spread and lower mortality 3 a study reported that sars-cov-2 invades into the cells through its predicated receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 4 blocking the renin-angiotensin system can prevent new-onset diabetes and reduce the risk of diabetes complications 5 du et al 6 found that the elderly who are over 65 years old showed higher risk of suffering from the disease especially those with severe complications and patients who had experience of entering the intensive care unit icu than those who did not this finding indicated that complications may be a risk factor for adverse consequences a recent meta-analysis reported that hypertension diabetes copd cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease are major risk factors for patients with covid-19 but the impact of these risk factors on covid-19 mortality has not been explored 7 therefore this meta-analysis first aims to explore the possible clinical mortality between diabetes and covid-19 analyze if diabetes patients infected with sars-cov-2 are exposed to the worst clinical prognostic risk and to evaluate the reliability of the evidence this result may help the government formulate prevention policies and respond to the outbreak of covid-19 ultimately contributing to the better clinical management of patients with covid-19 and diabetesthe preferred reporting items for meta-analyses prisma guidelines were used we determined to include studies involving in covid-19 sars-cov-2 or diabetes to find relevant primitive articles we performed a comprehensive retrieval in databases involving medline via pubmed embase and web of science with the following words covid-19 sars-cov-2 wuhan virus chinese virus novel coronavirus novel coronavirus 2019 2019 ncov wuhan coronavirus wuhan pneumonia the 2019 coronavirus died non-survivors death survival survivors and alive papers were searched in the databases until april 14 2020 with no restrictions of language we also reviewed reference lists based on the recognized literature to find additional eligible studies we first screened both titles and abstracts of the articles and publications which may involve in data concerning covid-19 sars-cov-2 or diabetesprimitive studies were carefully examined and there were no nation restrictions in our study the inclusion criteria were as follows 1 all studies reporting data on covid-19 non-survivors survivors and laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients 2 studies limited to mankind contained original data published in english and appeared in the form of either abstract or full-text the exclusion criteria were as follows 1 duplicate studies letters case reports abstracts or reviews 2 research focusing on morbidity rather than mortality we collected the following information from each study publication year first authors name sample size age for both dead group and alive groupwe assessed the quality of each involved research by the newcastleottawa scale 8 meta-analysis was conducted via review manager 53 by calculating the i2 index to evaluate the heterogeneity the i2 values of  25 2550 5075 and 75100 were considered as homogeneous low moderate and high heterogeneous levels respectively if the i2 value was  50 the random effects model rem would be applied if the i2 value was  50 the fixed effects model fem would be applied the pooled odds ratios ors of different studies and corresponding 95 confidence intervals cis were used to estimate the relationship between diabetes and the mortality of patients with covid-19 then the sensitivity analysis was repeated with the impact of each study evaluated by deleting different individual studies each timea total of 597 potentially relevant articles were identified using our search strategy from databases and 1 from reference lists four hundred and sixty studies remained after ruling out duplicates after screening the titles and abstracts 347 research articles that did not satisfy the inclusion criteria were ruled out after scanning the main body of the reserving 13 records another seven articles were excluded finally nine qualified articles met the eligibility criteria 917 the steps of document retrieval are shown in fig 1 meanwhile the common characteristic of included studies is listed in table 1 the meta-analysis involved 926 cases 260 dead and 666 alive overall that were all published in 2020 one study 9 reported the settings in icu and isolation wards all articles are of high quality because nos score was no less than 6the outcome of the forest plot for the connection between diabetes and the mortality of patients with covid-19 is shown in fig 2 our results showed a close relationship between diabetes and mortality of covid-19 with a pooled or of 175 95 ci 131236 p  00002 the pooled data were calculated with the fem as no heterogeneity appeared in the studieswe chose age as the subgroup and there was no significant difference between age  70 subgroup and age  70 subgroup and the or was 133 95 ci 078228 p  030 and 205 95 ci 144294 p  0001 respectively in fig 3 as a result of insufficient data the impact of age stratification on mortality of covid-19 should be further carried out meanwhile our study demonstrated no heterogeneity i2  5 and upon eliminating the impact of yuans study and wangs study the results significantly affected the pooled outcomes i2 dropped from 5 to 0 therefore we assumed that the studies of yuan et al and wang et al may be the sources of heterogeneity in this meta-analysis the sensitivity analysis results showed that the ors ranged from 150 95 ci 101223 to 203 95 ci 129320 the risk of publication bias was analyzed by beggs test p  009 and eggers regression test p  036 indicating no significant publication bias in our meta-analysisour meta-analysis suggested that the mortality of patients with covid-19 was significantly related to diabetes with or of 175 95 ci 131236 p  00002 meanwhile the value of i2  5 i2  50 p  001 indicated that no heterogeneity exists in the studies in addition sensitivity analysis revealed that when excluding any single study or rem was converted to fem the total outcomes still held so we are confident in the validity of the data obtained in our study showing a powerful correlation between diabetes and the mortality of patients with covid-19despite the unclear pathophysiology it has been observed that the most severe and fatal cases of covid-19 occur in the elderly or patients with potential complications especially those with diabetes 18 according to the reports diabetes and high blood glucose levels are important predictors of the severity and death of patients infected with different viruses involving sars-cov and mers-cov 19 20 a study found elderly patients with chronic diseases including diabetes were at higher risk of severe covid-19 infection and death 21 insulin resistance promotes synthesis of end-glycosylation products and stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines oxidative stress and adhesion molecules resulting in a higher likelihood of infection and worse prognosis 22infection leads to destruction of pancreatic beta cells decreased pancreatic insulin content and changes in the hosts ability to respond normally to glucose tolerance tests 23 a previous study suggested that sars coronavirus uses ace2 as a receptor to enter and damage islet cells that cause acute diabetes 24 until now there was no relevant study exploring the role of ace2 in covid-19 diabetic patients a recent meta-analysis retrieved the data of 2108 chinese patients diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection and found the prevalence of diabetes is 103 25 but until now no meta-analysis has explored the possible mortality between diabetes and covid-19 therefore our meta-analysis results found a significant relationship between diabetes and mortality covid-19 with a pooled or of 170 95 ci 116248 p  0006 which may contribute to better clinical management of patients with covid-19 and diabetescompared with younger patients patients aged 65 and over showed higher risk of initial complications more severe symptoms and were more prone to multiple organ involvement and death 12 similarly feng et al 26 recruited 476 covid-19 patients from three different cities in china and the survival rate of patients over 75 years old was significantly lower than that of young patients factors leading to poor health include physiological changes in aging and multiple age-related complications a study held the opinion that older peoples suspicion and detection threshold for sars-2 should be lower such as temperature the decline in pulmonary function and shortness of breath 27 management began with the diagnosis and classification of the elderly in order to achieve an appropriate level of care simultaneously our age subgroup analysis results indicated that there was no significant difference between age  70 subgroup and age  70 subgroup however if we chose the threshold for age stratification as 65 years old in the age  65 subgroup the or would be 173 95 ci 128234 p  00003 so more research on the impact of age stratification on mortality of covid-19 diabetic patients should be carried outthis is the first attempt to use meta-analysis to prove whether the mortality of patients with covid-19 is related to diabetes at the same time our study has some limitations first due to the inadequate data we do not have access to information such as diabetes duration time of diagnoses diabetes type diabetes medications and complications and thus we cannot conduct risk stratification in the subgroup analysis within the diabetic population second we only obtained the information regarding the age and gender of covid-19 patients but other factors might influence the accuracy of results such as bmi 28 measurements and instruments for the detection of sars-cov-2 meanwhile the populations included in our study were mainly in asian populations and so these conclusions even if important cannot be extended automatically to caucasian or other populations finally the patients who are diagnosed with covid-19 may have multiple chronic diseases simultaneously such as hypertension cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease and copd which may affect the accuracy of the results meanwhile the samples are not quite enough and more large-scale studies are neededour meta-analysis showed that diabetes increases the mortality of patients with covid-19 these results indicated the disturbance of blood glucose in the covid-19 patients more importantly this meta-analysis grades the reliability of evidence for further basic and clinical research into the diabetes dysfunction in covid-19 patientsin december 2019 the pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus spread in wuhan china unbiased sequencing of samples from patients with pneumonia reveals a previously unknown type of beta-coronavirus which is similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov1 the causative agent was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 by coronavirus study group and the disease it caused was named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who2

sars-cov-2 is a new type of highly diverse enveloped positive single stranded rna virus which can cause a range of symptoms including self-reported fever fatigue dry cough myalgia and difficulty breathing 4 there is evidence that the transmission pattern of sars-cov-2 is human-to-human which is spread by respiratory droplets caused by coughing or sneezing5

6 as of march 19 there are now more than 200000 covid-19 cases and more than 8000 deaths in the world7 nevertheless there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human coronavirus therefore it is crucial to determine the drug treatment plan as soon as possible to deal with the outbreak of covid-198
corticosteroids have a good inhibitory effect on inflammatory factors and are often used as an auxiliary treatment for viral pneumonia the main anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids is to inhibit a large number of pro-inflammatory genes that encode cytokines chemokines cell adhesion molecules inflammatory enzymes and receptors to address the inflammatory process and restore homeostasis9 however the results of clinical studies on the role of corticosteroids remain controversial a retrospective study showed that the vast majority of sars patients received satisfactory results from the use of corticosteroids10 but in a retrospective observational study of mers patients the result showed that patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to require mechanical ventilation vasopressors and renal replacement therapy11 therefore we performed this meta-analysis to identify the roles of corticosteroids in patients with coronavirusliterature published in pubmed embase cochrane library and china national knowledge infrastructure cnki from january 1 2002 to march 15 2020 was searched by combining the following keywords sars or coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome or middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus or mers viruses or mers-cov or novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov or covid-19 or sars cov-2 and steroid or corticosteroid or prednisolone or prednisone or dexamethasone or cortisol or hydrocortisone or glucocorticoid or methylprednisolone without limitations on either the publication type or language in addition the references listed in each identified article were also screened and manually searched to make the results more comprehensive the work was done independently by two authors zhenwei yang and jialong liu disagreements were resolved by a third investigator yunjiao zhouthe inclusion criteria in this meta-analysis were as follows 1 subjects in each study were patients with coronavirus infection 2 the patients were divided into the experimental group using corticosteroids and the control group not using corticosteroids 3 the outcomes included the use of corticosteroids in critical and non-critical patients mortality length of stay los and adverse reactions to corticosteroids exclusion criteria 1 the same patients were enrolled in different articles 2 commentaries editorials case reports letters and family-based studies and 3 patients in studies were under 18 years oldthe two researchers zhenwei yang and jialong liu who performed the inclusion and exclusion of the literature also independently extracted data from the included studies differences were resolved with a third investigator xixian zhao or by consensus we extracted the following variables the authors the publication year the study design viral type population treatment details including corticosteroid use types and doses of corticosteroids and other treatments and outcome measures such as the use of corticosteroids in critical and non-critical patients mortality los and adverse reactions to corticosteroids including bacterial infection hyperglycemia hypocalcemia and hypokalemiawe used the newcastle-ottawa scale nos12 which includes patient selection study comparability and outcome assessment three components to evaluate the quality of the original study the work was done by two authors zhenwei yang and jialong liu and agreed upon through discussionall statistical analyses in this study were performed on stata140 stata college station tx usa for dichotomized data we calculated the risk ratio rr and the 95 confidence interval ci while for continuous data we calculated the weighted mean difference wmd and the 95 ci heterogeneity among the studies was assessed by the chi squared and i2 tests a random-effects model was used when either p010 or i

2804 p  0024we examined the publication bias of the included literature on the use of corticosteroids in critical and non-critical patients and mortality funnel plots showed that there was no publication bias on the use of corticosteroids in critical and non-critical patients fig 5
a while there might be publication bias on mortality fig 5bas sars-cov-2 is an emerging virus there is no effective antiviral treatment at present covid-19 patients were mainly treated with symptomatic therapy in clinic corticosteroids are widely used in symptomatic treatment of severe pneumonia however there has been considerable controversy as to whether covid-19 patients should be treated with corticosteroids russell and colleagues recommend that corticosteroids should not be used in sars-cov-2-induced lung injury or shock outside of a clinical trial25 but a team of front-line physicians from china had a different perspective they recommended short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate dose used prudently for critical patients with covid-19 pneumonia26 so it is very important to provide evidence for corticosteroid treatment of in patients with coronavirusin this systematic review and meta-analysis the result indicated that patients with severe conditions were more likely to require corticosteroids therapy the similar results were also observed in the subgroup of patients with sars-cov-2 infection and patients with sars-cov infection a study showed that the concentrations of cytokines such as interleukin 7 il7 il8 il9 il10 and so on in serum in the covid-19 patients were higher than in healthy adults in addition cytokines such as il2 il7 il10 and so on concentrations in intensive care unit icu patients were higher than non-icu patients these revealed that patients with covid-19 were usually accompanied by increased immune factors and inflammatory responses and the concentrations of immune factors were associated with the severity of the disease5 further autopsy revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar injury with fibrous mucinous exudate and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltration dominated by lymphocytes which were very similar to sars-cov and mers-cov infections27 as we all known corticosteroids do not directly inhibit virus replication their main role is anti-inflammatory and suppress immune response28 in the early stage of inflammation glucocorticoids reduce capillary dilation inflammatory cell exudation leukocyte infiltration and phagocytosis in the late stage glucocorticoids can inhibit the excessive proliferation of capillaries and fibroblasts furthermore by binding to their receptors glucocorticoids inhibit nuclear transcription factor-b nf-b signaling and further inhibit the transcription and translation of inflammatory factors9 these explained why corticosteroids therapy was more needed in severely ill patients with coronavirus infectionour analysis demonstrated that patients treated with corticosteroids had a higher mortality rate and longer los there might be multiple mechanisms that contributed to these outcomes there is a study shows that glucocorticoids inhibit the production of il-2 and interferon- ifn- in t lymphocytes shift t cell responses from the th1 to the th2 type induce programmed cell death in a variety of different immunologically relevant cells including immature t and b cell precursors and mature t cells29 another study find that preexisting cd4 t cells are associated with lower viral shedding and less severe disease30 there is evidence that the use of corticosteroids may lead to prolonged removal of viral rna from the airways11 blood31 and feces of patients32 resulting in longer hospital stays and ultimately increasing the risk of mortality in addition our analysis found that patients receiving corticosteroid therapy were more likely to develop bacterial infection due to immunosuppression this could make the disease worse and lead to death we also performed subgroup analysis the result indicated that the mortality of neither sars-cov nor mers-cov was associated with corticosteroids therapy sensitivity analysis showed that the use of corticosteroids was not associated with mortality when we excluded a study14 therefore we need to treat this result with cautionour analysis found that patients receiving corticosteroids therapy might cause some serious adverse reactions such as bacterial infection and hypokalemia however only two studies in our analysis reported data on adverse reactions to corticosteroids bias might have occurred due to the limited number of patientsthere were several meta-analyses explored the role of corticosteroids in viral pneumonia most of which shown adverse consequences in a meta-analysis of corticosteroid use in patients with sars a total of 29 studies on corticosteroids were included of which 25 were inconclusive and only 4 provided conclusive data on the harms of corticosteroids 33 in a meta-analysis of corticosteroid use in patients with influenza pneumonia the results showed that compared with placebo corticosteroids were associated with higher mortality longer icu los and a higher rate of secondary infection but not mechanical ventilation days34 in addition a meta-analysis included ten studies with 1137 recovered sars patients showed that patients who received higher cumulative doses and longer treatment durations of steroids were more likely to develop osteonecrosis35 these meta-analyses indicated that patients with coronavirus pneumonia could not benefit from corticosteroid treatmenthowever there are some limitations in this meta-analysis first most of the included studies are retrospective cohort studies historical control studies etc with a low level of evidence and a lack of randomized controlled trials with optimized design second there is no uniform standard for the time and dosage of hormones used in various studies third the effects of corticosteroids may be influenced by other therapeutic options such as antiviral drugs finally due to the rapid evolution of the sars-cov-2 situation some studies have not been published while other developments are not intended to be reported for reasons of confidentiality which will lead to publication biaspatients with severe conditions were more likely to require corticosteroids corticosteroids could lead to higher mortality longer los a higher rate of bacterial infection and hypokalemia therefore corticosteroid should be used with caution in the treatment of covid-19 patients corticosteroids are not recommended for patients with mild conditions and moderate corticosteroids can be used in patients with severe conditions to suppress the immune response and reduce symptoms nevertheless more multicenter clinical trials are needed to further verify this conclusionall the authors designed

authors analysed the data zhenwei yang wrote the first draft of article all the authors revised the article and approved the final versionno authors have competing interests in this researchthe world health organization who reported the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 known as covid-19 in late december 2019 in china as of april 5 2020 based on the who report ie httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports the numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and mortalities were 1133758 and 62784 respectively moreover the sequence similarity scores of covid-19 with bat sars-like sars-cov and mers-cov were about 99 96 and 50 respectively 1epidemiologically the covid-19 outbreak has spread to more than 200 countries resulting in who risk assessment status as very high for this purpose several authors have recently carried out their researches on covid-19 which were mostly based on clinical and epidemiological views and included the potential symptoms the ways of covid-19 transmission and epidemic issues 2 among them hellewell et al proposed a stochastic transmission model that resulted in the case and contact isolations to control the covid-19 outbreak 3 moreover peeri et al compared the epidemics of three types of coronaviruses namely sars mers and covid-19 they concluded that there were no frequent outbreaks found from two previous ones and the challenges for the covid-19 should be covered by the applications of the internet of things iot which will be beneficial for control the incidence among people 4 two systematic reviews and meta-analysis studies were available in the literature they proposed five useful factors ie clinical laboratory imaging features procalcitonin measurements outcomes of confirmed cases in predicting the severity of the covid-19 disease 5 6 7in the current study the comparisons between incidence and mortality as well as recovery and death rates among the countries for covid-19 and sars-cov with the higher incidence rates were performed using the meta-analysis approach developed in the meta-mums tool the statistical analyses used both subgroup forest plots using event rate and risk ratio statisticsdata for meta-analysis could be extracted from open datasets 8 the original and well-known data resources for covid-19 were world health organization who ie httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reports and worldometers ie httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus the retrieved parameters for the countries to be meta-analyzed were total sample size cumulative confirmed cases cumulative mortalities and total recovered cases and the data for high-risk countries in terms of incidence related to covid-19 was extracted up to april 5 2020 moreover the summary table of sars-cov was available from httpswwwwhointcsrsarscountrycountry20030815pdfuaequals1 for the period november 16 2002august 7 2003the analysis environment was the meta-mums tool as a comprehensive meta-analysis tool without any limitations in number size and data entry 910 analysis of dichotomous data was done with a 95 confidence interval to set lower and upper limits based on risk ratio rr as well as event rate er when no interventions are involved 11 in all calculations and analyses the p-values less than 005 were statistically significantthe evaluation of heterogeneity between the analyzed countries was by calculating the i2 test and cochranes q test and whenever a significant heterogeneity was present a random-effects model was used otherwise we utilize a fixed-effects model additionally subgroup analysis was carried out among the target countries to compare the effect sizes of incidence vs mortality and recovery vs mortality using risk ratio and subgroup analysis was performed for comparing effect sizes of incidence mortality and recovery rates using event ratein the current meta-analysis n  1124243 patients of covid-19 infection and n  8346 of sars-cov were available and retrieved from the initial research of who and worldometer freely accessible databases the incidence vs mortality and recovery vs mortality ratios are also determined indeed subgroup analyses were also performed for evaluation of learning significant differences of er and rrevent rates of incidence recovery and mortality of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as the followingthe incidence event rates of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below and the forest plots are illustrated in figure 1

logit er  12303 ll  13910 ul  10695 p 0001
so the incidence rate of covid-19 is more than sars-cov p 0001 and the same outcomes apply to the cumulative incidence rates with p 0001the mortality event rates of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as follows where the forest plots figure 1b shows the relationships between two viral diseaseslogit er  3113 ll  3439 ul  2786 p 0001
logit er  1914 ll  2515 ul  1312 p 0001
the mortality rate of sars-cov infection is more than covid-19 infection p 0001 by also considering their cumulative mortality rate with p 0001recovery event rate of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below and the forest plots are illustrated in figure 2

logit er  1706 ll  1137 ul  2276 p 0001
so the recovery rate of sars-cov infection is more than covid-19 infection p 0001 with the same results using the cumulative recovery rate with p 0001incidence vs mortality results of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below the forest plots illustrated in figure 2b show the relations between the two diseaseslog rr  4089 ll  4512 ul  3666 p 0001
log rr  9845 ll  11074 ul  8615 p 0001
and the mortality rate is higher than the incidence rate in both infection groups and subgroup analysis showed that in sars infection the mortality rate is more than incidence rate in comparison to covid-19 disease p 0001 cumulative incidence vs mortality rateof covid-19 and sars-cov infections reflected the above results with p 0001recovery vs mortality results of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below the forest plots are illustrated in figure 3

log rr  1895 ll  1300 ul  2489 p 0001
which resulted the recovery rate is more than the mortality rate in both infectious groups and subgroup analysis has shown that in sars infection the recovery rate vs mortality rate is higher than that of covid-19 p 0008 and cumulative recovery rate vs mortality rate of covid-19 and sars-cov infections reflected the above results with p 0001some recent news reported that the covid-19 has more mortality rate than the combination of sars and mers 12 however one should note that while this comes to statistical analysis the whole population of the world and countries are essential factorsthe rapid virus spread known as also super spreading people played a vital role in previous sars-cov case fatality rate of 96 and mers case fatality rate of about 38 outbreaks and also needs special attention in covid-19 as well 13in summary we demonstrated the statistical analyses of incidence mortality and recovery rates between covid-19 and sars-cov along with their subgroups analysis and hopefully this would shed more evidence in controlling the new infectious diseasethe limitations of the current meta-analysis are as belowthe use of open datasetsall data were observational numbers reported for incidence mortality and recovery valuesonly the countries with higher incidence values those which are high-risk countries based on who criteria assessment are involved in the current meta-analysis which might be influenced by selection bias in the futuredue to the nature of the meta-analysis the evaluation of publication bias was not possible
the current meta-analysis provided more information on incidence mortality and recovery rates between covid-19 and sars-cov infectious diseases based on event rate evaluation the incidence rate of covid-19 was higher than sars-covs where mortality and recovery rates for sars-cov were higher in comparison with covid-19 on the other hand the risk ratio and subgroup analysis of incidence vs mortality and recovery vs mortality for both covid-19 and sars-cov revealed new findings those were the higher mortality and recovery rates of both sars-cov and covid-19 in comparison to incidence and mortality rates respectivelythe authors declare that they have no conflict of interestwho declared the covid-19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 a pandemic on march 11 20201 initially superspreading events a cruise ship in japan mass gathering of a religious group in south korea skiing resorts in italy and austria and a popular pilgrimage city iran contributed to the rapid dissemination globally since then the rate of global spread has accelerated and widespread epidemics have occurred in numerous countriesthe sars-cov-2 virus is genetically closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov the first pandemic threat of a novel and deadly coronavirus that emerged in late 2002 and caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars sars-cov was highly lethal but faded out after intense public health mitigation measures2 by contrast the novel sars-cov-2 that emerged in december 2019 rapidly caused a global pandemic the sars 2003 outbreak ceased in june 2003 with a global total of 8098 reported cases and 774 deaths and a case fatality rate of 97 with most cases being acquired nosocomially2 in comparison the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-covanother deadly coronavirus but which is currently not presenting a pandemic threatemerged in 2012 and has caused 2494 reported cases and 858 deaths in 27 countries and has a very high case fatality rate of 343 because mers-cov is widespread in dromedary camels zoonotic cases continue to occur unlike sars-cov which emerged from wildlife and was eliminated from the intermediate host reservoirthe new coronavirus sars-cov-2 is less deadly but far more transmissible than mers-cov or sars-cov the virus emerged in december 2019 and as of june 29 2020 6 months into the first pandemic wave the global count is rapidly approaching 10 million known cases and has passed 500 000 deaths4 because of its broad clinical spectrum and high transmissibility eradicating sars-cov-2 as was done with sars-cov in 2003 does not seem a realistic goal in the short termin this personal view we summarise key epidemiological characteristics of sars-cov-2 in comparison with other epidemic coronaviruses and pandemic influenza we explore what makes sars-cov-2 different from pandemic influenza virus and the other epidemic severe coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov we study the various characteristics of each virus including the transmission and severity characteristics case fatality rates mortality in individuals with the disease and the population-level mortality of the sars-cov-2 pandemic table 1

key messages
the basic reproductive rate r0 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is similar to or higher than the r0 of sars-cov and pandemic influenzamortality due to sars-cov-2 and sars-cov is strongly skewed towards people older than 70 years dissimilar to the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemicsthe proportion of symptomatic people requiring hospital admission is higher for sars-cov-2 infections than for the 2009 influenza pandemicthe population risk of admission to the intensive care unit is five to six times higher in patients infected with sars-cov-2 than in those with the fairly mild 2009 influenza pandemicthe case fatality rate is probably around 1 after adjusting for asymptomatic and mild illness serological studies will aid in refining this estimate

estimating the ability of a new pathogen to spread is a key measure in an emerging disease outbreak a metric used to describe this spread is the basic reproductive rate r
0 r
0 is defined as the average number of secondary transmissions from one infected person when r
0 is greater than 1 the epidemic is growing the r
0 estimates for sars-cov sars-cov-2 mers-cov and the influenza pandemics are summarised in the appendix p 1the r
0 for the sars outbreak in 2003 was estimated to be between 20 and 30 in the early months until the end of april before public health control measures were introduced2 5 6 various control measures soon reduced the transmissibility to 11 with a wide iqr of 04246 7 for mers-cov the r
0 unmitigated was estimated to be 069 95 ci 050092 consistent with mers-cov never having caused sustained epidemics8 37 for sars-cov-2 a recent china joint mission by who concluded that transmission of sars-cov-2 is mostly driven by clusters in close contacts particularly family clusters and less so by community transmission9 since the statement was released this conclusion has been challenged although superspreading events continue to occur in the pandemic studies have estimated the r
0 at 22 95 ci 143910 and 27 252911 therefore an average r
0 of 25 seems a reasonable estimate appendix p 1 by comparison the initial r
0 estimate for the 2009 influenza a h1n1 pandemic was 1712 later estimated between 017 and 13 after mitigation was initiated13 14 15
r
0 for the 1918 influenza pandemic was estimated at around 20 in the first wave in july 191816
the r
0 values have important implications for disease control r
0 magnitude indicates the level of mitigation efforts needed to bring an epidemic under control6 mitigation reduces the effective transmission coefficient now called r
e r
e needs to be reduced to less than 1 to ensure cessation of an epidemic which can be done by rapid case identification quarantine measures and physical distancing to prevent secondary transmissions for childhood diseases such as measles the cessation of epidemic spread was achieved with an effective vaccine however a vaccine has never been a major tool for control of pandemics because they either occurred before the era of modern vaccines or as in 2009 the vaccine became available only after the first waves had already occurredfor sars-cov-2 with an r
0 value of approximately 25 transmission would need to be reduced by more than 60 to reach r
e of less than 1 11r
0 the transmissibility coefficient declines over time as control measures start having an effect which was seen during the successful eradication of sars-cov in 20038 by contrast with sars-cov and sars-cov-2 mers-cov has limited transmissibility even in the absence of mitigation although the virus has caused several nosocomial outbreaks since 2012 mainly in hospitals in saudi arabia jordan and south korea17
all three coronaviruses have a longer incubation period time from infection to symptom onset than influenza viruses one study estimated the mean incubation period of sars-cov-2 to be 58 days ranging from 13 to 113 days18 another study estimated the median incubation period to be 51 days and found that 975 of people showed symptoms within 115 days of infection19 a study from china estimated an incubation period of 52 days9
a notable difference between sars-cov sars-cov-2 and mers-cov are the kinetics of virus shedding whereas sars-cov and mers-cov have tropism for lower airways with less virus present in the upper respiratory tract this tropism is different in sars-cov-2 for sars-cov-2 the average viral load in a family cluster was 68  105 copies per upper respiratory tract swab during the first 5 days and live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness20 in a study from hong kong38 high viral loads were found in the first samples obtained after admission to hospital this finding was confirmed in a study from china39 which found a high viral load at the onset of symptoms that declined in the following 56 days this quick decline in the viral load makes isolation and quarantine of patients with sars-cov-2 and their contacts much more challenging and less effective as it has to be done as soon as possible after illness onset in order to reduce transmission by contrast for sars-cov viral loads peaked at 611 days after symptom onset21 22 allowing a full extra week to identify and isolate cases before transmission occurred this difference would in part explain why sars could be eradicated in 2003 compared with the trajectory seen in the sars-cov-2 pandemicthere is increasing evidence of transmission from asymptomatic people although what proportion of these individuals are presymptomatic remains unknown it is clear that covid-19 has a broad clinical picture which includes asymptomatic and mild illness23 40 a study from iceland24 found that 43 of pcr-positive cases had no symptoms although some individuals showed symptoms later on number of days remains unknown unofficial data from china suggest that 78 of cases were asymptomatic25
viral shedding might be occurring for prolonged periods a study of viral load26 in respiratory tract samples faeces and blood from 96 patients with covid-19 found a viral load of 105106 copies per ml up to 3 weeks after symptom onset viral shedding tended to be longer in stool samples however as of june 9 2020 there is no documented evidence of faecaloral transmission viral load is higher and persists for longer in the lower respiratory tract of patients who are severely ill with covid-1926 for sars lower respiratory tract infection occurred without upper respiratory tract infection as a consequence transmission of sars-cov was infrequent during the first 5 days of illness2 and unlike transmission of influenza transmission in household settings was rare41
a key difference between sars-cov-2 and pandemic influenza is the age distribution of patients who are severely ill the mortality rate in people infected with sars-cov-2 increases steeply with age and fatal outcomes are almost exclusively seen in people older than 50 years table 2
 this age-related increase in severe morbidity and mortality was also observed for sars-cov although with a far greater case fatality in hong kong the case fatality due to sars-cov was 0 for age group 024 years 6 for those aged 2544 years 15 for those aged 4564 years and 52 for people who were 65 years and older2 27 for both sars and covid-19 children rarely had severe illness table 2 recently a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome has been reported in children with covid-1945 in one study looking at close household contacts of people with covid-1928 children and adults both had a secondary attack rate of 15 but whether children transmit the virus as effectively as adults is still unknownclinical case fatality for which the case definition was fever and respiratory symptoms including pneumonia was around 5 in hubei province and only around 1 in the rest of china and south korea43 in the usa case fatality rates among patients with covid-19 were less than 1 for people aged 2054 years 15 in those aged 5564 years 311 in those aged 6584 years and 1027 in people aged 85 years and older early in the outbreak there have been few deaths in children and young adults younger than 20 years46 although most patients 90 with covid-19 have mild clinical illness there is considerable demand for intensive care because of the subset of patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome this requirement for respiratory support is higher for sars-cov-2 cases than for the influenza pandemic in 2009 table 1 in a study29 of patients who were admitted to hospital in new york ny usa 14 required intensive care median age 68 yearsa danish study of the 2009 influenza a h1n1 pandemic47 found that the proportion of patients with pandemic influenza never exceeded 45 of the total national intensive care unit icu bed capacity and the icu admission rate was estimated to be approximately one patient per 5500 patients infected with influenza a h1n148 such figures are lacking for the covid-19 pandemic but it is evident that icu capacity in this pandemic is a crucial element in lombardy italy an estimated 23 of covid-19 cases needed an icu bed44 comparing these rates is difficult because most people in the 2009 pandemic were younger than 60 years whereas sars-cov-2 affects mainly older individuals we compared key variables and features of the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics with sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov in table 3
the mortality impact of seasonal and pandemic influenza has long been estimated as the excess mortality above baseline excess mortality is ideally estimated from a mortality time series updated once per week during or at the end of a pandemic30 31 a study on excess mortality in the 2009 influenza pandemic used data from 33 countries31 and found that the global burden was approximately 300 000 deaths the mean excess mortality for seasonal influenza was 0164 per 100 000 people younger than 65 years 29440 per 100 000 people aged 6574 years and 1792235 per 100 000 people aged 75 years and older31 it is too early to study excess mortality for covid-19 in south korea and italy but such studies from china would be helpful as of june 8 2020 in lombardy italy the mortality rate for covid-19 has reached 159 per 100 000 population32 notably these data are not from the end of the outbreak and numbers are expected to increase further as some patients spent 4 weeks in intensive care and thus have not yet resolved the infectionthe timely european morbidity and mortality euromomo surveillance system updated once per week is a great resource for accessing excess mortality studies relating to the covid-19 pandemic in european countries49 the website shows z score elevations in a time series of deaths due to any cause allowing comparison with elevations caused by seasonal influenza the euromomo data show high covid-19 associated excess mortality in a number of countries including italy spain the uk and sweden whereas other countries such as germany norway and greece have found no or low excess mortality appendix p 2 case fatality rates are shown in table 4
49 in the usa the centers for disease control and prevention also reports substantial elevation in national respiratory deaths50 for comparison the influenza pandemic excess mortality has ranged from extreme 1918 to mild 2009 over the past 100 years table 3 a study modelling global excess mortality for the moderate 1957 influenza a h2n2 pandemic30 found a respiratory excess mortality rate of 002 for the deadly 1918 influenza pandemic estimates show that about 12 of the global population died51 however excess mortality for the 2009 pandemic was not much greater than that of a severe seasonal influenza at about 004 deaths in the global population30 31
because the mean age at death varied greatly in past pandemics one excess mortality study also looked at excess years of life lost30 using years of life lost as a metric this study found that the three influenza pandemics in 1957 1968 and 2009 had a similar size effect although it is too early to draw conclusions the effect of covid-19 might be higher in terms of excess mortality possibly with numbers somewhere in between the 1957 and 1918 influenza pandemics however in terms of excess years of life lost because of the mean age 80 years of covid-19 fatalities the covid-19 pandemic would score lower perhaps similarly to the 1957 and 1968 influenza pandemics more time and data are needed before the covid-19 pandemic can be accurately compared with past pandemicsbecause of the broad clinical spectrum it has become evident that to find out the true attack rate of sars-cov-2 serological studies are needed meanwhile we can look at reported cases deaths and the number of tests per 100 000 population understanding that more testing and a broader clinical case definition mean a higher rate of cases currently each country is in a different phase of the pandemic which will lead to a bias in early country comparisonsofficial figures are available for the usa south korea the uk spain germany and south africa table 4 appendix pp 34 as of feb 16 2020 hubei the earliest affected province in china had 67 466 confirmed cases of covid-19 and 2902 deaths reported9 these figures correspond to 011 of the population being affected and a mortality rate of 48 per 100 000 population which is low compared with certain countries in europe52 possibly because people with mild symptoms were not tested23 24 25 serological surveys will shed light on these discrepancies for comparison seasonal influenza attack rates are in the range of 1020 every winter53
a recent study54 modelled possible scenarios for covid-19 up to 2024 on the basis of epidemiology of the seasonal coronaviruses oc43 and hku1 the study assumed a winter-time r
0 of 22 and a summertime r
0 of 13 and predicted winter cycles of covid-19 after the pandemic phase by comparison the a h1n1 influenza pandemic started in mexico in february 2009 and by june a total of 73 countries had reported more than 26 000 laboratory-confirmed cases55 in july 1918 there was a peak of h1n1 influenza infections seen in copenhagen before the second wave hit in november16 56 these previous pandemics have shown that influenza transmission does occur over the summer and seasonality is difficult to predicttemperature and humidity makes a difference for viral survival in the environment a study using enveloped virus phi6 as a surrogate virus57 found that infectivity was sensitive to temperature and decreased by two orders of magnitude between 19c and 25c some data on the effect of temperature are available for sars-cov only a study of sars-cov found a two-log reduction in virus titre after 7 h at 38c and 95 humidity58 at 4c sars-cov persisted for up to 28 days and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at 20 relative humidity inactivation was faster at 20c than at 4c at all humidity levels these experimental data suggest that sars-cov-2 might be less able to survive in the summera mortality study59 in 17 cities in the usa during the 1918 influenza pandemic found that the cities which implemented mitigation strategies early on had a delayed flatter epidemic curve with a 50 lower peak mortality and a 20 lower overall mortality thus mitigating policies are of paramount importance to ensure that the burden on the health-care system remains manageable the examples of china and south korea and early signs of bending the curve seen in europe show that influencing the spread of sars-cov-2 is possible however the socioeconomical costs are enormous and will be long lastingradical containment measures have been used to curb the pandemic in some affected countries the approach taken in south korea was especially effective done by rapidly applying extensive testing quarantine and contact tracing of individuals from a large church group in the early stages of the outbreak also schools were closed and all international arrivals were quarantined for 2 weeks43 china south korea and singapore show that mitigation using a combination of contact tracing and rigorous social distancing measures is possible60 however new outbreaks have started to occur in each of these countries and renewed control measures have been implementedcountries such as denmark italy spain and germany have relied mostly on social distancing and hygiene measures in population lockdowns of various magnitudes of intensity such draconic measures were used when the epidemics were progressing too fast and capacity for effective case identification contact tracing and containment became impossible the consensus is that rigorous mitigation measures are needed early to slow down sars-cov-2 transmission61 drastic measures of quarantine and mobility restrictions put in place by china europe and the usa are no different than those used for plague in the 14th century the covid-19 pandemic so far has shown that such measures could possibly halt the pandemic if individuals follow the specific country guidelinesthe first who disease x scenario has become a reality33 the sars-cov-2 pandemic has already caused severe morbidity and mortality in older adults much higher than in the pandemic influenza although children are clearly less affected their role in the transmission of the virus still needs to be studiedat this early stage in the pandemic there are no effective treatments such as antivirals or passive immunisation schemes development of a safe and effective vaccine will take time thus only supportive treatment in hospitals is currently available and efforts to slow and limit the spread of the virus continue the goal is to reduce the impact of the virus prevent overwhelming the health-care system and protect the people at highest risk of severe outcomes while waiting for an effective vaccine and treatmentshistorical evidence from influenza pandemics which occurred in the past century shows us that pandemics tend to come in waves over the first 25 years as the population immunity builds-up naturally or through vaccination and then the number of infected cases tends to decrease this observation is the most likely trajectory for the sars-cov-2 virus however the near future will require a transition to a new normal in which a combination of physical distancing enhanced testing quarantine and contact tracing will be needed for a long time while clinical research and testing of antivirals and vaccine candidates is ongoing scientists will learn from regions and countries that were first affected also epidemiological and phylogenetic studies can yield much information about risk factors other than age such as disease transmission the role of children in transmission and a better estimate of case fatalityit is highly likely that after sars-cov-2 there will be another pandemic it might be another coronavirus an influenza virus a paramyxovirus or a completely new disease we believe that learning from this experience is crucial so that we can meet a future pandemic threat with far better preparation in terms of testing adequate stocks of personal protective equipment and critical care capability international pandemic planning is needed to ensure collaboration between countries including better surveillance of emerging infections especially zoonoses controlling an outbreak has everything to do with mitigating

the detection of respiratory viruses in aecopd has markedly improved mohan et al 2010on the other hand the role of respiratory viruses in cpcopd has not been well investigated until recently there have been only a few reports on the role of respiratory viruses in cpcopd patients mallia and johnston 2007 ko et al 2008 molinos et al 2009 vanspauwen et al 2012 moreover these previous studies have several limitations some were focused on a specific virus such as influenza virus mallia and johnston 2007 or an rtpcr test was performed in only small portion of the studies patients ko et al 2008 molinos et al 2009 furthermore to the best our knowledge none of the prior studies compared the viral etiologies and their clinical outcomes between aecopd and cpcopd we aimed to investigate the distributions and clinical impact of respiratory viruses in aecopd and cpcopd patientsthis retrospective cohort study was performed at asan medical center a 2700bed tertiary referral hospital in seoul republic of korea the current study focused on copd patients admitted from january 2010 to december 2012 all patients admitted to hospital due to copd during study period were screened and all those diagnosed with aecopd or cpcopd were included in the study see below for definitions data regarding clinical outcomes and microbiologic results were collected according to a standardized protocol if a patient was admitted to the hospital more than once during study period only the first admission was included in the aecopd or cpcopd groups also all clinical samples obtained from patients within

respiratory viral infections in aecopd versus cpcopd while respiratory viruses were frequently identified in both aecopd 419 and cpcopd 335 the distribution of identified viruses between two groups showed different patterns influenza virus was the most common pathogen in aecopd versus human coronavirus in cpcopd rhinovirus has been reported as the most common cause of aecopd in the majority of prior investigations seemungal et al 2001 rohde et al 2003 hutchinson et al 2007 mcmanus et al 2008 hershenson 2013 although human metapneumovirus martinello et al 2006 or respiratory syncytial virus dimopoulos et al 2012 occasionally have been reported as the most common cause here we found that influenza virus 141 was the most commonly identified virus in the aecopd group followed by rhinovirus 104 the hong kong group also showed that influenza virus was most commonly identified in aecopd patients ko et al 2008 however these findings should be interpreted with caution as both studies included aecopd patients who were admitted to general hospitals therefore a bias might have been introduced if less severely affected patients did not come to our tertiary care hospitalunexpectedly human coronavirus was the most commonly identified virus in our cpcopd group which has not been reported before excluding outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome sarscoronavirus peiris et al 2003 or middle east respiratory syndrome merscoronavirus assiri et al 2013 human coronavirus have never been regarded as a common cause of pneumonia the presence of viruses in pneumonia patients does not necessarily mean that these viruses are the true pathogen of pneumonia in our current study of the 19 cpcopd patients with human coronavirus infection 12 632 had bacterial coinfection including six with s aureus and two with s pneumoniae a prior report showed that there was an increase in s aureus acquisition during the sars period yap et al 2004 recently a polish group reported that human coronavirus nl63 increases the streptococcal adherence to respiratory epithelial cells golda et al 2011 and that human coronavirus nl63 infection is associated with an increase in plateletactivating factor receptor pafr expression which promotes adherence of s pneumoniae our study supports the work by golda et al who saw the same events but in an in vitro assay these finding suggests that human coronavirus infection might be associated with a risk of pneumonia development through bacterial coinfection in copd patients further studies will be needed to confirm this resultregarding the bacterial pathogens identified in our present investigation s aureus and a baumannii were significantly more commonly identified in the cpcopd group than the aecopd group these bacteria are a well known cause of healthcare associated pneumonia hcap or hospital acquired pneumonia hap yoo et al 2013 however a baumannii has not been listed as the cause of aecopd and s aureus is an uncommon cause of aecopd approximately 06 domenech et al 2013 reissig et al 2013 exposure to recent antibiotics during hospital stay might have influenced the type of pathogen and more than 20 of cpcopd events were hospitalacquired infections or health care associated pneumonia the patients in the cpcopd with s aureus group received antibiotics more frequently than those in the other pathogen group 625 1524 vs 110 982 p  001 in addition previous studies performed in korea showed that s aureus and a baumannii are important pathogens particularly in hcap and hap patients with ranges of 61198 and 20160 respectively choi et al 2012 hong et al 2014although aecopd patients have a greater severity of disease than cpcopd patients in baseline pulmonary function test cpcopd patients were associated with poorer clinical outcomes than aecopd patients in terms of length of hospital stay and in hospital mortality we found that few investigators to date have compared the outcomes between aecopd and cpcopd recently a spanish group compared the clinical outcomes between 133 aecopd patients and 116 cpcopd patients huerta et al 2013 similar to the results of our study aecopd patients had a greater severity of disease than cpcopd patients however in their results inhospital mortalities of aecopd group and cpcopd group were 30 and 34 respectively which are quite different from those of our patients especially in the cpcopd group 12 in the aecopd group and 123 in the cpcopd group we thought that these differences might reflect a different severities of illness in the two patient populations the icu admission rate of patients between two groups were different in the spanish study 38 in the aecopd group 26 in the cpcopd group versus 108 and 157 of the our studied patients in each this difference might explain the outcome difference between the two groupsamong patients with a viral infection with regard to bacterial coinfection 416 of our aecopd patients and 506 of our cpcopd patients had a bacterial coinfection respectively notably among our cpcopd patients only viral infection group had significantly better outcomes than the only bacterial infection group or the viral bacterial coinfection group this finding suggests that when bacterial coinfection complicates viral infection it can lead to poorer outcomes however according to a separate 2 test the mortality rates of patients with bacterial infection alone and virusbacteria coinfection were not significantly different thus it seems that the impact of viral infection on the mortality of cpcopd patients with bacterial infection may not be additive our study has several limitations to note first because the study was of retrospective design respiratory virus pcr was not performed for some patients this may have introduced selection bias to the study sample however most of admitted patients 858 of aecopd patients and 831 of cpcopd patients respectively were evaluated by rtpcr in our hospital second our study was performed at a single center in korea and our results may not be fully applicable to other settings because nearly all patients were tertiary referrals from other hospitals the study population might not be representative of the general population third the viruses identified by a sensitive rtpcr could be bystanders rather than causative pathogens if other admitted patients who had neither aecopd nor cpcopd were included as controls we might indirectly be able to estimate the proportion of nonsignificant colonizers however this is not possible due to the retrospective design of the study it was also difficult to establish a causeeffect relationship and it is not clear whether people developed aecopd or cpcopd following infection fourth our study did not include control patients with viral infection alone without aecopd or cpcopd and it was thus difficult to determine the precise role of the virus in mortality due to aecopd or cpcopd also due to the retrospective nature of the study some data were missing for example it was very difficult to obtain an accurate time of transfer from other hospitals and data of prior antibiotics use since we often did not know how long a patient was resident in the transferring hospital we could not take this into account finally since the number of each virus was relatively small the characteristics of each viral infection could not be compared between the groupsin conclusion respiratory viral infection is common to both aecopd and cpcopd however the distribution of respiratory viruses involved was different between these two groups of patients the clinical outcomes of cpcopd patients with only viral infection were better than those with only bacterial infection or viralbacterial coinfection the factors associated with the clinical outcomes of cpcopd patients included age and presence of bacterial infection these findings warrant future studies of larger scale with appropriate control patientsyk

now spread to more than two hundred countries around the world affecting more than 2818000 people and has caused more than 196000 deaths as of april 25 2020 1 on march 11 2020 the world health organization who had declared covid-19 a pandemic because of alarming levels of its spread severity and inaction 2 covid-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which is sufficiently genetically divergent from the closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus 3 it mainly affects the respiratory tract and the illness ranges in severity from asymptomatic or mild to severe or critical disease although the current estimate of the case fatality rate of covid-19 is  5 up to 1518 of patients may become severe or critically ill some of them requiring icu care and mechanical ventilation 4since covid-19 is a new disease knowledge about this disease is still incomplete and evolving many case-control studies have shown that patients of covid-19 who have underlying diabetes mellitus develop a severe clinical course and also have increased mortality however most of these studies have small sample size and the data in them are heterogenous and conflicting in addition the data on prevalence of diabetes in patients with covid-19 is also not clearhence this meta-analysis was conducted with the primary objective of exploring the relationship between underlying diabetes and severity and mortality of covid-19 disease and with the secondary objective of determining the prevalence of diabetes in patients with covid-19three authors ak saa and sk independently searched screened and selected the studies according to the search inclusion and exclusion criteria pubmed database was searched for papers in english language using the following keywords 2019-ncov ncov-2019 novel coronavirus 2019 sars-cov-2 covid-19 coronavirus coronavirus covid-19 and corona virus since the first report of covid-19 disease was published on december 31 2019 8 we limited our search to articles published since january 01 2020 and the last search was performed on april 22 2020 since there is a high likelihood of duplicate publications on covid-19 9 especially same set of patients being reported in english as well as chinese or other languages hence we restricted our search to papers published in english language only for the same reason we restricted our search to pubmed database only and did not search other databases in addition each included study was carefully evaluated for study setting and author list to exclude any duplicate publicationthe inclusion and exclusion criteria of studies were as follows1the studies should be in english language in the pubmed database2the study design should be case-control and should have categorized the patients into two or more groups depending on the severity clinical course or mortality of the patients with covid-19 ie composite endpoint studies without this categorization were not included the study should have data of diabetes mellitus in each group3the study should be observational retrospective or prospective interventional studies such as controlled or uncontrolled drug trials were excluded4the study should have included at least 100 patients of covid-195the participants should be adult patients with covid-19 studies describing exclusively pediatric population were excluded however studies which had both adult and pediatric patients were included studies describing exclusively pregnant women were also excluded
the following data were extracted from each study date of online publication pmid number study setting total number of patients their demographic data number of patients with composite endpoint and number of patients with diabetes mellitus among patients with or without the composite endpoint for studies with missing data the corresponding authors of those studies were contacted with a request to provide the missing datathe primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of composite endpoint which for the purpose of our study was labelled as severe clinical course and defined as occurrence of one of the two endpoints depending on each studys individual endpoint1for studies comparing survival and mortality  mortality of covid-19 patients was taken as the composite endpoint2for studies not having mortality as the endpoint one of the following were chosen as the composite endpoint of severe disease depending on studys individual endpointapatients requiring invasive ventilation orbpatients requiring icu care orcpatients having progressive disease ordpatients having refractory disease orepatients categorized as severecritical according to one of the standard predefined criteriaiwho criteria 10 oriinational health commission of the peoples republic of china version 35 criteria 1112 oriiiamerican thoracic society guidelines 13


patients not having any of the above features of severe clinical course were categorized into good clinical coursethe secondary outcome of interest was to study the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with covid-19for the assessment of quality of studies including the risk of bias the national institute of health nih tool for case-control studies was used this tool has been developed jointly by the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi and the research triangle institute international 14 it uses a composite score of twelve domains with each domain scored as 1 or 0 depending on the response yes or no respectively the studies were categorized as good quality if they scored 8 points fair quality if they scored 67 points and poor quality if they scored 6 pointsthe categorical data was displayed as n and  and continuous data as mean and sd if the study had reported the data as median with iqr or range the method described by wan et al was used to calculate the mean and sd 15to study the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with covid-19 pooled proportion and 95 confidence interval ci was taken as the effect size first the raw proportion from each study was extracted and transformed with the freeman-tukey double arcine method to stabilize the variance 16 then the pooled proportion was obtained using the dersimonian-laird random effects model 17to study the association of diabetes mellitus with the composite endpoint severe clinical course pooled odds ratio with 95 ci was taken as the effect size we performed the meta-analysis using the generic inverse variance approach and dersimonian-laird random effects model 17 a p value of 005 was used to show statistically significant association the meta-analysis was sub-grouped according to the composite endpoint of severe disease and mortalityto assess the heterogeneity among studies i2 statistic was calculated an i2 value  50 indicated substantial heterogeneity to take care of heterogeneity among the studies and to calculate a more conservative result the odds ratios were pooled using only the random effects model to explore the source of heterogeneity meta-regression analysis was done using age type of composite endpoint severity versus mortality country of study china versus others number of patients quality score and quality type good versus fair as co-variates in addition if the heterogeneity among the studies was 50 a sensitivity analysis was also performed after identifying and removing the outlier studieswe evaluated the publication bias through visual inspection of funnel plot and begg 18 and egger 19 tests when the funnel plot was symmetrical and the p value of begg and egger tests were 005 no significant publication bias was considered to exist in the meta-analysis however if publication bias was found a trim and fill analysis of duval and tweedie 20 was used to evaluate the number of missing studies and recalculation of the pooled odds ratio was done after addition of those missing hypothetical studiesreview manager software version 535 the nordic cochrane centre copenhagen denmark openmetaanalyst software version 1012 21 jasp software version 0121 university of amsterdam the netherlands and microsoft excel version 1635 were employed for the meta-analysis and statistical analysesusing the keywords 2019-ncov ncov-2019 novel coronavirus 2019 sars-cov-2 covid-19 coronavirus coronavirus covid-19 and corona virus and limiting the entrez date from 01-jan-2020 through 22-apr-2020 initially 5834 publications in english language were retrieved from the pubmed database which were screened for relevance fig 1
 after carefully going through the abstracts and full texts if needed of these publications only 207 potentially relevant studies were selected and evaluated in detail for potential inclusion of these 174 studies were excluded because of the following reasons 1 144 studies did not have comparative data on covid-19 patients with and without composite endpoint 2 22 studies were small with less than 100 participants 3 7 studies did not have diabetes as one of the comparative factors and 4 1 study was a duplicate publication hence remaining 33 studies were included in the qualitative as well as quantitative synthesis meta-analysis fig 1the study characteristics of the 33 included studies are given in table 1
 the online publication date of the studies in the pubmed database was from february 7 2020 through april 17 2020 twenty out of 33 61 studies were from single centres while remaining 13 39 were multi-centre studies most studies 3033 91 were from mainland china and of the remaining 3 studies two 6 were from usa and one 3 from france the total included patients were 16003 and of them 8849 55 were reported from mainland china 7030 44 from usa and 124 1 from france the median number of patients included in the studies was 214 iqr 139368the quality of study was assessed using the nih tool for case-control studies 14 and the results are shown in table 1 the scores were as follows 912 score 27 studies 82 812 score 5 studies 15 and 712 score 1 study 3 out of the twelve domains assessed by this tool the three domains in which all the studies were given 0 score were sample size justification blinding of assessors and adjusting for confounding variables thus 32 studies 97 were judged as good quality scores of 8 and remaining 1 study 3 was judged as fair quality scores 67 none of the included study was judged poor the single study with fair quality was the paper published by the cdc usa on the covid-19 cases reported to it from all over the us 22 thus it was a registry data rather than a hospital-based study
table 2
shows the characteristics of the included patients the total number of patients was 16003 with proportion of males being 54 50689366 thus the male female ratio was approximately 12  1 the pooled mean age was 526  174 yearsof the 16003 patients 2827 18 patients had the composite endpoint labelled severe clinical course the reasons for composite endpoint were mortality in 9 studies 6132827 22 patients and severity in 24 studies 22142827 78 patients of the 24 studies having severity as the composite endpoint the reasons were as follows pre-defined criteria 16 studies icu requirement versus no requirement 2 studies invasive ventilation requirement versus no requirement 2 studies progressive disease versus stable disease 2 studies refractory disease versus responsive disease 1 study and ards versus no ards 1 studydiabetes was present in 1724 patients out of total 16003 patients of covid-19 the pooled prevalence of diabetes was calculated to be 112 95 ci 95130 by using the freeman-tukey double arcine transformation and dersimonian-laird random effects model fig 2
 however the heterogeneity among the studies was substantial with an i2 value of 92 to explore the source of heterogeneity meta-regression analyses were done using age type of composite endpoint severity versus mortality country of study china versus others number of patients quality score and quality type good versus fair as co-variates supplementary table 1 and supplementary fig 1 the results of meta-regression showed that proportion of diabetes in patients with covid-19 was influenced by age with studies with higher patient age having higher proportion of diabetes p  0001 type of composite endpoint with studies reporting mortality endpoint having higher proportion of diabetes p  0004 and country of study with studies outside of china having higher proportion of diabetes p  0006 there was no influence of number of patients in studies or quality score of studies a sub-group analysis revealed that proportion of diabetes mellitus in china was 105 95 ci 87123 while in countries other than china mainly usa it was 193 95 ci 84303 but with high heterogeneity data not shown a sensitivity analysis was also done by excluding 13 outlier studies which revealed a pooled prevalence of diabetes to be 98 95 ci 87109 in patients with covid-19 with an acceptable i2 value of 46 supplementary fig 2of the 33 included studies in this meta-analysis 24 had used severity as the composite endpoint and 9 had used mortality as the composite endpoint presence of diabetes was found to be significantly associated with severe covid-19 pooled odds ratio 275 95 ci 209362 p  001 as well as mortality due to covid-19 pooled odds ratio 190 95 ci 137264 p  001 the combine pooled odds ratio for both the composite endpoints labelled as severe clinical course was 249 95 ci 198314 p  001 fig 3
for the mortality endpoint the heterogeneity among the studies was low i2  32 while for the severity endpoint the heterogeneity among the studies was substantial i2  63 thus the combined heterogeneity was also substantial i2  63 to explore the source of heterogeneity meta-regression analyses were done using age type of composite endpoint severity versus mortality country of study china versus others number of patients quality score and quality type good versus fair as co-variates supplementary table 2 and supplementary fig 3 the results of meta-regression showed that odds ratio was influenced by age with studies with higher patients age having lower odds ratio p  0001 in addition it was found that the cdc study from usa 22 which was of not good quality being a registry data significantly influenced the outcome of this meta-analysis and was mainly responsible for the significant heterogeneity hence a sensitivity analysis was performed after excluding this study which again revealed a significant combined pooled odds ratio of 233 95 ci 190285 p  001 and an i2 value of 41 acceptable heterogeneity supplementary fig 4for the main outcome of this meta-analysis ie association of diabetes mellitus with severe clinical course of covid-19 publication bias was evaluated through the visual inspection of funnel plot and begg and egger tests 1819 the funnel plot fig 4
 was found to be mildly asymmetric and the beggs rank correlation test for funnel plot asymmetry kendalls   0439 as well as eggers regression test for funnel plot asymmetry z  2561 were statistically significant p  005 hence a trim and fill analysis of duval and tweedie 20 was used to evaluate the number of missing studies and we recalculated the pooled odds ratio with the addition of those missing hypothetical studies the recalculated pooled odds ratio of association of diabetes mellitus with severe clinical course of covid-19 was 226 95 ci 178287 p  001 supplementary fig 5 the redrawn funnel plot after addition of four missing hypothetical studies was now symmetrical supplementary fig 6after adjusting for both heterogeneity as well as publication bias the corrected pooled odds ratio for diabetes mellitus being associated with severe clinical course of covid-19 ieboth mortality and severity was still significant 216 95 ci 174268 p  001 supplementary fig 7our meta-analysis has two limitations we have shown that diabetes is associated with covid-19 severity and mortality however it cannot be said whether diabetes is acting as an independent factor responsible for this severity and mortality or it is just a confounding factor many conditions such as elderly age hypertension cardiovascular disease and obesity often co-exist with diabetes and each of these comorbidities have been shown to be associated with severe covid-19 and its mortality in spite of this limitation the implication our meta-analysis will remain unchanged that diabetic need to be protected from covid-19 and they will need extra care if infected the second limitation of this meta-analysis is that we have not been able to document the role of glycemic control on the severity or mortality of covid-19 it has been shown previously that poor glycemic control in terms of high hba1c was significantly associated with increased risk of various infections 5354 however none of the included studies on covid-19 in our meta-analysis had evaluated glycemic control as one of the factors associated with severity andor mortality and this needs to be explored in further trialsin conclusion we have shown in this meta-analysis that presence of underlying diabetes in patients with covid-19 is associated with two-fold increased risk of mortality as well as two-fold increased risk of severity of covid-19 this necessitates enhanced prevention of covid-19 in diabetics increased vigilance in patients of diabetes for covid-19 and a lower threshold for monitoring hospitalization and icu care if diabetics develop this infection results of our meta-analysis emphasizes the need for further investigation on the pathogenic mechanism of relationship between diabetes and covid-19 and to explore its therapeutic implicationsthis research did not receive any fundingak designed the study ak saa and sk searched screened and selected the articles ak ps nb and as extracted the data from the

place in china in 2019 and subsequently spread across the globe rapidly as of 14 april 2020 a total of 1844863 confirmed infections have been reported with 117021 deaths 3 upon the emerging covid-19 there is no known approved specific effective antiviral treatment to treat this fatal disease 4 therefore it is of utmost urgency to identify potential therapies for sars-cov-2 infected patients 5as the covid-19 resemble severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers phylogenetically and symptomatically a variety of agents have been tried according to the clinical experience from sars and mers 67 the broad-spectrum antiviral agent ribavirin 8 protease inhibitor lopinavir and ritonavir 910 and immune up-regulator interferon 1112 were most commonly used in addition in vitro or in vivo studies have suggested that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine 1314 remdesivir 15 and arbidol 16 are effective in inhibiting viral replication in sars-associated coronavirus cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infections 17 however the efficacy and safety of these treatments for covid-19 remains unclear 4few systematic reviews have previously summarized clinical trials of potential therapeutic agents for sars mers or covid-19 resulting inconclusive outcomes 418 19 20 21 herein we conduct this review to identify the efficacy and safety of current option of

 the quality of findings relevant to mortality virological clearance radiographical improvement prevalence of ards intubation and mechanical ventilation were very low in addition the total aes leukopenia anemia thrombocytopenia diarrhea transaminitis increased total bilirubin had very low quality of evidence as well however the outcome quality of clinical improvement and increased creatinine were low while the bradycardia had a moderate quality of evidencehydroxychloroquine had earned a reputation for potential promising role in covid-19 42 increasing number of studies had been conducted and published 28323740 recently chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were demonstrated to inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro ec50  547m ec50  072m respectively 3243 the underlying mechanisms were inferred as follows 1 as weakly alkaline chloroquine could increase endosomal ph therefore block virus infection 4244 2 as spike s protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 blocker chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine interfered with the glycosylation of cellular sars-cov receptor thus inhibit virus attacking 4 3 as immunomodulant chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could counteract pro-inflammatory cytokine storm in critically ill patients with covid-19 2845 unfortunately the outcomes of hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 patients were inconsistent in sars-cov-2 viral eradication gautret et al reported that hydroxychloroquine alone or combined with azithromycin observed better ability of sars-cov-2 eradication at day six post-treatment 100 of patients treated with combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin had been virologically cured compared to 571 in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone and 125 in control group 32 on the contrary chen et al and tang et al documented that the sars-cov-2 eradication rate were equal between hydroxychloroquine and standard care group 3740 therefore the meta-analysis generated no significant favored outcomes of hydroxychloroquine in virological eradication the authors speculated the reasons underlying these inconsistent results included 1 unsuitable population selection mild illness or later stage of covid-19 might not be target population to assess the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine 2 inappropriate endpoints viral load shedding rather than icu admission and negative rate of nucleic acid might be more sensitive endpoints 3 confounding effects antiviral agents used in standard care group might be confounders to weaken effect of hydroxychloroquine 4 small sample size of these studies 5 no valid in vivo evidences despite adequate encouraging in vitro proofs 3740 additionally the hydroxychloroquine therapy improved more radiographical benefit 28 despite accompanied with more aes especially diarrhea 40 up to date we could not recommend hydroxychloroquine superior to the standard care of sars-cov-2 infection and we need to wait for larger randomized trials with target population and sensitive endpoints to valid the value of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19as an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus hiv protease lopinavirritonavir was a major focus as it was recommended for patients with mers 27 or covid-19 46 it was reported lopinavir could inhibit sars-cov and mers-cov replication in vitro with ec50 at 171 m and 8 m respectively 47 lopinavir was also found to demonstrated antiviral effect against sars-cov-2 in vero e6 cells with ec50 at 261 m 48 ritonavir had no effect against coronavirus but prolonged bioavailability of lopinavir by inhibiting hosts cytochrome p450 3a4 enzyme 49 five studies had reported the effectiveness and safety of lopinavirritonavir alone or combination therapy lopinavirritonavir alone or in combination with ribavirin and corticosteroids did not show any mortality benefit however lopinavirritonavir-based treatments had observed inconsistent results of virological clearance with rr of between 097-293 lopinavirritonavir alone was revealed ineffective in lowering virus load of sars-cov-2 3638 while the lopinavirritonavir accompanying with arbidol or ribavirin augmented the eradication of sars-cov-2 273547 48 49 it was speculated that lopinavirritonavir 400 mg100 mg twice daily may reach the minimal lopinavir serum concentration at 94 m 72121 m which was inadequate for inhibition of sars-cov-2 50 nevertheless lopinavirritonavir accompanied with the other agents showing effects against sars-cov-2 might decrease the inhibitory concentration of lopinavir and produce synergy 48 furthermore lopinavirritonavir-based therapies documented notably better clinical and radiographical improvement and reduced incidence of ards or intubation take adverse reactions into consideration most of the aes rate were comparable between groups conversely lopinavirritonavir alone showed tendency of more diarrhea events while the combination of lopinavirritonavir ribavirin and corticosteroids reduced incidence of diarrhea significantly it was suspected that lopinavirritonavir alone did not show demonstrably beneficial effects for covid-19 but the lopinavirritonavir combinations might play roles in the eradication of sars-cov-2 21the most extensively used therapies were ribavirin and ribavirin-based combinations ribavirin was reported to tightly bind to sars-cov-2 rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp with binding energy of -78 kcalmol and thus may be used to against covid-19 51 there were 9 studies reporting sars and mers patients treated with ribavirin or combinations with ribavirin the meta-analysis yielded inconsistent results for mortality with rr of between 038 and 082 while the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids showed remarkable lower mortality compared with control group in addition patients treated with ribavirin-based therapies showed comparable rates of intubation and mechanical ventilation with control group of note the major problem of ribavirin was significantly higher incidence of adverse events especially bradycardia anemia and transaminitis compared with control group intriguingly the combination of ribavirin and interferon did not observe these problems summarily as the inconsistent benefit considerable safety concerns and very low quality of evidence it was hard to make a clear recommendation for the use of ribavirin and ribavirin-based combinations for covid-19it was revealed that arbidol had in vitro antiviral activity in early replication stage of sars-cov 52 however the arbidol alone generated equivalent outcome in patients with covid-19 compared with control group while the addition of lopinavirritonavir showed better efficacy 27 furthermore interferon had been widely used through sars and mers epidemic 18 and there were 5 studies reported combinations with interferon unfortunately no difference was noted between treatment and control group in terms of mortality intubation rate and adverse reactions the recommendation of these treatments was uncertain because of the small sample size of study and other risk of low quality 122736firstly to best of our knowledge this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis comprehensively summarized all available evidences from rcts and cohort studies for sars mers and covid-19 secondly it objectively and rigorously assessed the efficacy outcomes mortality virological eradication clinical improvements etc and safety outcomes aes leukopenia anemia diarrhea bradycardia etc of current anti-coronavirus therapies for sars-cov mers-cov sars-cov-2 infected patients with similar definitions of outcomes across studies moreover we evaluated the quality of the evidence in the meta-analyses by implementing the gradepro in attempt to verify the strength of the recommendationon the other hand there were some limitations among included literatures first of all some outcomes included a small sample size of patients such as clinical improvement radiographical improvement and leukopenia causing imprecision of outcomes thus downgraded the quality of evidence secondly the open-label design of most rcts included in this meta-analysis also restricted the quality grade of effects thirdly the variations in timing of treatment dosage administration route and co-treatments might influence our results for an instance one study administrated hydroxychloroquine approximately 16 days after symptoms onset while the time between onset of symptoms and inclusion hydroxychloroquine initiation were 0 to 10 days in another study the virological eradication results were quite difference between these two studies however we could not perform further subgroup analysis considering these influenced factors because of the limited number of studies finally the diversity of indications might add heterogeneity to results although sars-cov and mers-cov were closely related with sars-cov the results might not be directly extrapolated to sars-cov-2 infected patients thus further research would be required to confirm our findingsgiven the latter strengths and limitations although we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for covid-19 considering the very low quality of evidence and wide heterogeneity of interventions and indications our results may help clinicians to comprehensively understand the advantages and drawbacks of each anti-coronavirus agents on efficacy and safety profiles lopinavirritonavir combinations might observe better virological eradication capability than other anti-coronavirus agents conversely ribavirin might cause more safety concern especially bradycardiacurrently growing trials related to anti-coronavirus agents were ongoing including 18 for hydroxychloroquine 13 for chloroquine 7 for remdesivir 6 for lopinavirritonavir 5 for interferon 3 for favipiravir 2 for arbidol and 13 for combinations the detailed information of registered trials is shown in supplementary table 4 these ongoing studies would facilitate our understanding of the optimal anti-coronavirus approach for covid-19 patients based on previous observations we provided some proposal and suggestions for further clinical trials as follows 1 larger-scaled rcts were utmost needed 2 severe covid-19 patients rather than mild or moderate patients should be favored investigated population 3 confounders such as anti-viral agents used in control group should be adjusted or balanced 4 the dosage and initial time of regimens should be standardized for instance the anti-coronavirus agents should be used at early stage of illness 5 specic endpoints such as mortality virological eradication or viral loading shedding and clinical outcomes including symptoms improvement radiographical results improvement intubation rate and icu admission should be estimatedthere was evidence of lower mortality better clinical and radiographical improvement in intervention group compared with control group in subgroup analysis ribavirin combined with corticosteroids lopinavirritonavir-based therapies and hydroxychloroquine showed some benefit in different outcomes however considering the very low quality of evidence the heterogeneity of interventions and indications we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for covid-19 our results may allow clinicians to comprehensively understand the property of each anti-coronavirus agent on efficacy and safety outcomes and thus may constitute a basis of drug treatment for covid-19 certainly it was of utmost necessity to conduct large-scale clinical trials to objectively assess the efficacy of antiviral treatment on the mortality virological and clinical outcomes of

approved by the western university human research ethics board we enrolled consecutive patients who were admitted to our level-3 academic icu at london health sciences centre-victoria campus london ontario and were suspected of having covid-19 based on standard hospital screening procedures 13 we collected daily blood samples starting at admission and up to 3 days in covid-19 patients or up to 7 days in covid-19 patients covid-19 status was confirmed as part of standard hospital testing by detection of two sars-cov-2 viral genes using polymerase chain reaction 14 patient baseline characteristics were recorded at admission and included age sex comorbidities laboratory values arterial partial pressure to inspired oxygen pf ratio and chest radiograph findings although icu severity of illness scores have not been validated in covid-19 patients we calculated multiple organ dysfunction score mods and sequential organ failure assessment sofa score for both covid-19 and covid-19 patient groups to enable objective comparison of their illness severity we also categorized both patient groups as having confirmed or suspected sepsis diagnosis using sepsis 30 criteria clinical interventions received during the observation period were included and consisted of antibiotics antiviral agents systemic corticosteroids vasoactive medications renal replacement therapy high-flow oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation invasive and noninvasive final participant groups were constructed by age- and sex-matching covid-19 icu patients with covid-19 icu patients as well as healthy controls that had blood samples previously banked in the translational research centre london on canada directed by dr d d fraser httpstranslationalresearchcentrecom 15 16standard operating procedures were used to ensure all samples were treated rapidly and equally blood was obtained via indwelling catheters daily in the morning and placed immediately on ice once transferred to a negative pressure hood blood was centrifuged and plasma isolated aliquoted at 250 l and frozen at 80c all samples remained frozen until use and freezethaw cycles were avoidedlevels of 57 inflammatory analytes were determined using multiplexed biomarker immunoassay kits according to manufacturers instructions milliporesigma 400 summit drive burlington ma or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa for the former plasma inflammatory analytes were measured using a bio-plextm 200 suspension array system bio-rad laboratories hercules ca which used luminex xmaptm fluorescent bead-based technology

and frequency  were used to report icu patient baseline characteristics for continuous and categorical variables respectively continuous variables were compared using mann-whitney u tests or kruskal-wallis tests as appropriate and categorical variables were compared using fisher exact chi-square with p  005 considered statistically significant daily analyte concentrations were also reported as medians iqrs and comparisons between groups were examined using mann-whitney u tests given the number of analytes analyzed and the risk of false positives a p value of  001 was used as our standard for statistical significance receiver operating characteristic roc curves were conducted to determine sensitivity and specificity of all continuous variables for predicting mortality the area-under-the-curve auc was calculated for each variable and the coordinates of the curves were then analyzed to identify the cutoff values based on the highest sensitivity and specificity for predicting mortality all analyses were conducted using spss version 26 ibm corp armonk nycovid-19 analyte data were visualized with a nonlinear dimensionality reduction on the full data matrix using the t-distributed stochastic nearest neighbor embedding t-sne algorithm 17 t-sne assumes that the optimal representation of the data lies on a manifold with complex geometry but low dimension embedded in the full dimensional space of the raw data for feature selection we pooled analyte data across 13 icu days for each of the covid-19 and covid-19 cohorts and normalized observations within analyte a random forest classifier was trained on the variables to predict covid-19 status a random forest is a set of decision trees and consequently we were able to interrogate this collection of trees to identify the features that have the highest predictive value viz those features that frequently appear near the top of the decision tree we limited the decision trees to a maximum depth of five levels and constrained the forest to 50 trees to avoid overfitting the small dataset we further explored the ability to perform automated classification of covid-19 versus covid-19 patients from their analyte spectra conservatively employing only a single decision tree and limiting the maximum tree depth to three levels we trained and tested the classifier using a five-fold cross-validation approachwe investigated 10 covid-19 icu patients median years of age  610 iqr  548670 10 age- and sex-matched covid-19 icu patients median years of age  580 iqr  525630 and 10 age- and sex-matched

patients had significantly higher unilateral pneumonia whereas covid-19 icu patients were more likely to have bilateral pneumonia sepsis was confirmed by infectious pathogen identification in only 20 of covid-19- icu patients while sepsis was suspected in the remaining 80 all other reported baseline measures were nonsignificant between patients although a mortality rate of 40 was determined for covid-19 icu patientswe measured 57 inflammatory analytes in plasma using either fluorescent bead-based multiplex technology or elisa table 2 shows that 20 inflammatory analytes were significantly different between covid-19 icu patients and healthy controls the remaining 37 nonsignificant analytes are shown in supplemental table 1 supplemental digital content 1 httplinkslwwcomccxa209 all significantly different analytes were elevated in covid-19 icu patients relative to healthy controls except mmp2 that was decreasedcovid-19 and covid-19 cohorts were then plotted in two dimensions following dimensionality reduction by stochastic neighbor embedding fig 1a the dimensionality reduction shows that the daily analyte measurements icu days 13 between the two cohorts were distinct and easily separable to determine which analytes were most informative for covid-19 status classification we performed feature selection with a random forest classifier the top six features were identified for the binary outcome of covid-19 versus covid-19 in the following order tumor necrosis factor tnf granzyme b heat shock protein 70 hsp70 interleukin-18 il-18 interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 ip-10 and elastase 2 fig 1b we then trained and tested a simple decision-tree classifier that yielded a classifier accuracy or the ability of the analytes to predict covid-19 status of 98 p

significant analytes were elevated in covid-19 icu patients relative to covid-19 icu patients while many analytes were significantly different between covid-19 and covid-19 patients over time the top

covid-19 patients but starting on icu day 2 a time course for these six markers is shown in figure 2 over icu days 13 for covid-19 patients and over icu days 17 for covid-19 patients the mean values for these six analytes remained elevated in covid-19 patients across all seven icu days the remainder of the analytes measured over time are shown in supplemental figure 1 supplemental digital content

for day 1 covid-19 icu patients was classified for mortality using a random forest classifier 1000 trees and three-fold cross-validation as hsp70 was the leading analyte associated with covid-19 death a roc curve was then conducted to determine the sensitivity and specificity of hsp70 for predicting mortality the auc for hsp70 was 100 indicating perfect sensitivity and specificity for our 10 covid-19 icu patients using youdens index the hsp70 cutoff value for predicting mortality was 264380 pgml of note with the addition of the 10 covid-19 cases to the analysis the auc and the cutoff for hsp70 remained the samein this study we measured 57 inflammatory analytes in plasma obtained from icu patients both covid-19 and covid-19 as well as age- and sex-matched healthy controls given the number of analytes measured we used two complimentary methods to analyze the data conventional population statistics and machine learning our data indicate the presence of a unique inflammatory profile characterized by early and sustained elevations in circulating tnf granzyme b hsp70 and il-18 circulating levels of ip-10 increased transiently on icu days 23 and elastase 2 was consistently elevated on icu days 27 finally the plasma levels of hsp70 in covid-19 icu patients were associated with mortality despite the exploratory nature of our study the data generated suggest that these six inflammatory analytes could be considered for further investigation as potential biomarkers andor therapeutic targets while changes in some potentially useful inflammatory analytes were not identified in our study larger cohorts will be necessary to elucidate their role in the host response ie il-6 required 47 patients per cohort to reach statistical significance based on 80 power and an alpha  001our covid-19 icu patients were similar to those reported in earlier cohorts from china 4 5 seattle 3 and italy 6 with respect to age comorbidities and clinical presentation in contrast to covid-19 icu patients and in keeping with findings from the seattle cohort our covid-19 icu patients had a higher prevalence of bilateral pneumonia covid-19 icu patients had higher illness severity scores than covid-19 icu patients although these differences were not statistically significant due to our small sample size given that ventilated covid-19 icu patients are reported to have higher mortality 18 than comparable ards cohorts 19 and that mods and sofa scores have not been validated in covid-19 icu patients the lower median mods and sofa scores in these patients may not accurately represent their illness severity relative to the covid-19 icu patients indeed mortality was 40 in our covid-19 icu patients whereas all covid-19 icu patients survived to dischargecompared with healthy controls covid-19 icu patients exhibit clinical and laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation increased circulating cytokine levels eg tnf il-6 il-8 and il-10 together with lymphopenia in cd4 and cd8 t cells characterize the purported cytokine storm associated with severe covid-19 the mediator release pattern has been compared with that seen in secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis a hyperinflammatory syndrome commonly triggered by viral infections and in a small percentage of severe sepsis patients characterized by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinaemia with multiple organ failure however when compared with covid-19 icu patients the covid-19 icu patients exhibited a pattern of cytokine elevation that was unique from previous reports in that elevations were sustained and dominated by tnf and the serine proteases granzyme b and elastase 2 these latter findings may be of particular clinical relevance as preclinical models suggest sars-cov-2 entry into cells may be blocked by protease inhibitors 20in contrast to other studies of sepsis and ards we found persistently elevated levels of circulating tnf in our covid-19 icu patients a potent acute master regulator of the proinflammatory response tnf is typically upregulated quickly and early following exposure to an invading pathogen or to tissue damage after which secondary mediators propagate inflammation while circulating levels of tnf quickly normalize 21 22 the persistently elevated levels of tnf in covid-19 icu patients could be a potential target for anti-tnf therapy with either neutralizing antibodies or small molecule inhibitors 10granzyme b is expressed specifically in the cytolytic granules of natural killer cells and cytotoxic t lymphocytes and functions as a targeted cell death mediator traditionally considered to cause apoptosis of tumor and virally infected cells 23 extracellular soluble granzyme b levels are elevated in autoimmune diseases and infections including the human endotoxemia model and in those with severe sepsis 24 furthermore granzyme b retains much of its proteolytic activity when exposed to plasma granzyme b can degrade several extracellular membrane components and is involved in the production release andor processing of proinflammatory cytokines 25 26 granzyme b activates il-18 through cleavage of pro-il-18 27 28 which in turn promotes cellular apoptosis via induction of granzyme b activation of il-18 also induces synthesis and release of the antiviral response mediators interferon-gamma ifn moreover il-18 is known to increase adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells both icam1 and vcam1 thereby increasing microvascular leukocyte adhesion 29hsp70 was elevated in our covid-19 icu patients and associated with mortality as a chaperone protein that is induced in response to environmental physical and chemical stresses hsp70 is usually cytoprotective by limiting the consequences of damage and by facilitating cellular recovery via caspase inhibition conversely hsp70 can also exacerbate the stress response signaling tissue destruction and aid in immunosurveillance by transporting intracellular peptides to distant immune cells 30 extracellular hsp70 also promotes inflammation by activating toll-like receptors and promoting entry of granzyme b into the cells initiating cellular apoptosis 23 31 interestingly hsp70 is part of the receptor complex that interacts with the binding domain of the spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus a member of the family coronaviridae enabling viral entry into lung and kidney cells 32ip-10 is an inflammatory chemokine released by monocytes and endothelial cells which aids recruitment of activated t cells into sites of tissue inflammation either protecting or promoting infection the actions of ip-10 depend on host immune status and genetic background 33 previous studies suggest that ip-10 is protective in coronavirus-induced severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 34 35 whereas others have shown improved infectious disease outcomes after blocking ip-10 with neutralizing antibodies 33elastase 2 is also a serine protease that slowly increases in covid-19 icu patients over 7 icu days neutrophil azurophilic granules as well as monocytesmacrophages and mast cells contain elastase 2 36 upon degranulation elastase 2 is either released into circulation or mobilized to the leukocyte plasma membranes and subsequently deposited to vascular endothelium or subendothelial spaces 37 38 in covid-19 icu patients elevated elastase 2 levels may contribute to increased pulmonary vascular permeability and injury elevated elastase 2 has been demonstrated under various severe inflammatory conditions and can contribute to the development of ards 39our exploratory study has identified a unique pattern of inflammation in covid-19 icu patients that could be considered for further study as biomarkers andor therapeutic targeting hypothesis-generating data however our study also has several limitations first we only studied critically ill patients and we cannot determine the inflammatory changes contributing to icu admissions second given the limited number of patients available for study we used two complimentary methods to independently analyze our data and both methods arrived at similar conclusions third our covid-19 study population was relatively small however we still generated strongly significant data eg true positives and fulfilled an urgent need for exploratory data to focus future hypothesis-driven studies on larger cohorts finally we report only mortality as a clinical outcome future studies with larger sample sizes can explore whether reported changes in inflammatory analytes correlate with additional clinical outcomes such as functional status in survivorsin summary we report sustained elevations in a unique combination of inflammatory analytes in covid-19 icu patients our exploratory data are consistent with the slow or absent improvement in covid-19 patients despite state-of-the-art icu care and could aid future hypothesis-driven research using larger icu cohortswe thank ms shannon seney

new cases and deaths continue to rise at an alarming rate 1 although most cases of covid-19 are asymptomatic or mild in severity a minority of patients experience more severe symptoms of covid-19 along with its complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards coagulopathy multiple organ failure mof and death a number of comorbidities have been associated with an increased risk of severity and mortality in covid-19 patients including hypertension diabetes cerebrovascular disease chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 2 3 4 5 6 individuals with preexisting cardiovascular diseases have been shown to have poor outcomes with covid 19 78 study from chinese center of disease control on 72314 cases reported a case fatality rate of 105 for patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease but no specific data on mortality on heart failure 9 due to looming possibility of poor drug compliance and other complications related to disruption in medical services the number of patients with new or decompensated heart failure may increase 10currently the plausible mechanisms for sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 to infect human cells include binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor and inducing hyperinflammation or cytokine storm a high expression of ace2 receptor is commonly found in patients with heart failure 78 in this systematic review and meta-analysis we wanted to investigate the association between heart failure with poor outcome in patients with covid-19we performed a systematic search of the literature on pubmed europepmc scopus cochrane central database and medrxiv for preprint studies with the search terms heart failure and covid-19 after the removal of duplicates the abstracts were screened by two independent authors ey and rp irrelevant articles were excluded the inclusion criteria for this study were studies that studied patients with preexisting hf comorbidity with covid-19

the results were less reliable analysis using funnel plot generated asymmetrical result for heart failure and poor outcome fig 8a and comparison of mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 accompanied with preexisting heart failure and without heart failure fig 8b with fig 8a showing somewhat less asymmetry compared to fig 8b based on cochrane collaboration recommendation we only performed funnel plot analysis in meta-analysis involving more than 10 studiesin this meta-analysis we observed an association between hf and poor outcome in patients with covid-19 a higher risk of death and hospitalization in those with preexisting hf and higher mortality in those with preexisting hf compared to patients without hfas with other types of pneumonia preexisting cardiovascular diseases including hf are risk factors for poor prognosis during and after the course of pneumonia 11 the effect of an infective organism on the myocardium can cause non-ischemic cardiac injury the systemic inflammatory response which is particularly excessively elevated in covid-19 can also result in kidney injury and impair sodium and water metabolism which may precipitate the worsening of hf 12recent studies on the role of ace2 in covid-19 infection have reported that ace2 levels are 50 higher in male patients with hf 13 14 15 this finding explains the higher risk of poor prognosis hospitalization and death in this population in the event of occurrence of covid-19 in this meta-analysis the majority of the studies had higher number of male patients than female patientsin patients with coexisting hf and diabetes who are in a pro-inflammatory state the membrane-bound ace2 protein can be cleaved by adam17 resulting in the release of ace2 into the interstitium and blood circulation 16 this inflammatory response which occurs in covid-19 as an elevated immune response 1718 might also explain the increase in mortality in patients with covid-19 accompanied with hf the excessive inflammatory response and oxidative stress in these patients predispose them to a more severe clinical course of covid-19 19 this phenomenon is particularly significant in patients with preexisting hf since these patients suffer from decreased circulatory and physiological reserves older patients with hf commonly suffer from multiple comorbidities deterioration in function of multiple organ systems and functional decline 2021ace2 is an enzyme involved in the raas pathway however it differs from ace in not being capable of converting angiotensin i into angiotensin ii furthermore as opposed to the vasoconstrictor property of angiotensin type 1 receptors ace2 via the ace-2 receptors cleaves angiotensin ii into angiotensin 17 which has vasodilatory properties 22based on these explanations it is easy for us to conclude regarding the dangers of upregulation of ace2 as in patients being treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers rasb one study has even proposed ceasing administration of rasb in patients with covid-19 on these drugs 23 however this does not seem to be the case and several other authors have questioned this hypothesis 24 25 26 27 the rationale for this rebuttal is based upon several in vitro studies which revealed that upon entry into alveolar cells using membrane-bound ace-2 receptors sars-cov-2 downregulates the expression and causes internalization of ace2 receptors the result of this process is a decrease in angiotensin-ii to angiotensin 17 conversion and an increase in the availability of angiotensin ii to bind to the at1 receptor this induces cellular inflammation oxidative stress vasoconstriction fibrosis and aldosterone activation which may eventually lead to lung injury 28 29 30 31 32 the use of rasb may serve as a protective measure against lung injury by the inhibition of angiotensin ii synthesis using aceis and blockade of at1r by arbs this would result in a skew of the raas towards angiotensin 17 and its subsequent interaction with mas-receptors which may minimize the risk of lung injury 2933the result of this meta-analysis is similar to that of previous studies in which patients with preexisting heart hf demonstrated an elevated risk of poor outcome hospitalization and death 3149 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 5152compared to other diseases based on our pooled results patients with hf suffering from sars-cov-2 infection have a threefold increased risk of in-hospital mortality compared to patients with hf who develop influenza or 346 252 475 p  0001 vs or 115 103 130 p  002 and or 166 144191 p  0001 5354 however when compared to patients infected with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov patients with preexisting hf who developed covid-19 had a lower risk of mortality or 346 252 475 p  0001 vs or 12981 1324 127313 p  0025 55studies have shown a poorer prognosis in patients with hf who develop influenza 5354 as a result of the decreased physiological reserve influenza virus infection in patients with hf is associated with a severe course and significant hemodynamic compromise which often requires cardiac support 56 influenza vaccination in these patients is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death furthermore receiving 1 influenza vaccine is associated with 18 reduction in both all-cause and cardiovascular death all-cause death 082 95 ci081084 p  0001 cardiovascular death 082 95 ci 081084 p  0001 in the event of influenza infection patients with heart failure may fail to cope with the increased metabolic demand which is caused by the infection itself as a result decompensation or exacerbation in heart failure symptoms may occur 57 patients with hf are currently classified as a high-priority group to be vaccinated with the influenza vaccine 58 based on these findings once an effective vaccine for sars-cov-2 infection becomes available patients with hf should be prioritized to be vaccinated even in case of covid-19we observed some limitations of this meta-analysis such as the use of preprint studies included in this meta-analysis additionally several studies have been conducted in the same citiesregions posing a risk of subject overlap data regarding the difference between new-onset and worsening of hf in patients in the studies was rarely available data regarding staging of hf was also rarely found additionally in patients with hf suffering from a severe course of covid-19 infection data regarding the use of vasopressors and inotropic agents as well as the incidence of cardiogenic shock was lackingin conclusion patients with hf are at increased risk for poor outcomes such as hospitalization and death from covid-19 a significant difference in mortality between patients with and without hf was observed those with hf showing higher mortality rates these findings probably stem from the reduced physiological reserves in patients with hf mortality of patients with hf accompanied with sars-cov-2 infection is higher than that of patients with influenza but lower than that of patients with mers-cov thus if sars-cov-2 vaccine becomes available patients with hf should be prioritized to be vaccinated

this single-center retrospective study was done at tongji hospital tongji hospital located in wuhan hubei province the endemic areas of covid-19 is one of the major tertiary teaching hospitals and is responsible for the treatments for patients with severe covid-19 assigned by the government we recruited inpatients cared in the icu from january 10 2020 to february 10 2020 who have been diagnosed as covid-19 according to world health organization interim guidance 10 laboratory confirmation of covid-19 was performed by the local health authority as previously described 11 data of the patients were achieved by reviewing the admission logs and histories from all available electronic medical records and patient care resources the patients were followed up to february 25 2020 this study was approved by the ethics commission of tongji hospital tj-irb20200225data extraction was performed by physicians using a standardized form to collect data about demographic characteristics exposure

and outcomes the date of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptom was noticed for all patients the glasgow coma score gcs sofa score curb65 score and apache ii score were assessed within 24 hours of admission the length of hospitalization and outcome state of each patient were recordedards was defined according to the berlin definition 12 acute kidney injury was identified according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes definition the cardiac injury was defined if the serum levels of cardiac biomarkers eg troponin i were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography 11based on the clinical implications of laboratory indices we identified the cut-off value of these indicators to be the upper or lower limits of their normal range values are presented as mean  sd or as number and percentage for continuous variables and categorical variables respectively the difference of categorical variables between the survivors and deaths groups was compared by chi-square test or fisher exact test when appropriate whereas continuous variables were compared using student t test spearman correlation analysis was performed among significant variables in the univariate analysis univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis was used to explore the effect of apache ii score sofa score and curb65 score on the occurrence of death taking account of the potential bias only variables with the absolute value of a correlation coefficient less than 04 were included in the initial model of multivariate cox regression analysis receiver operating characteristics roc analyses were conducted to evaluate and compare the predictive value of these three scoring systems the scoring system with largest area under the curve auc of roc curve was selected for further analysis the cut-off value of the selected scoring system was determined based on the maximum youden index then the patients with covid-19 were classified into two groups low risk less than cut-off point value and high risk greater than or equal to cut-off point value kaplan-meier method was used to compare the

1016 d fig 2this is a retrospective study on the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the patients with covid-19 about half of the patients had organ dysfunctions apache ii score was demonstrated to be independently associated with hospital mortality in patients with covid-19 furthermore apache ii score performed better to predict hospital mortality in patients with covid-19 compared with sofa and curb65 scores apache ii score greater than or equal to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death which may help provide guidance to make further clinical decisionssars-cov-2 is a coronavirus that can be transmitted to humans like sars-cov and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers-cov and these viruses are all related to high mortality in patients with critical illness in a cohort of 38 critical patients with sars in canada 43 of patients had died at 28 days 13 fifty-eight percentage of patients had died at 90 days in a saudi arabia cohort with 12 patients with mers 14 yang et al 6 reported 615 of critically ill patients with covid-19 had died at 28 days in our cohort two thirds of critically ill patients died the mortality of patients with covid-2019 was higher than that previously seen in critically ill patients with sars and mers several of the reasons are as follows first a large number of covid-19 cases occurred in a short period of time led to difficulty in hospitalization treatment in our cohort the duration from onset to hospitalization was longer in deaths than that in survivors second as an emerging infectious disease the clinical characteristics and pathophysiologic features of the patients with covid-19 have been known little at the start of the epidemic although the shortage of medical staff has been improved with assistance from other provinces from all over the country the number of doctors and nurses of critical care medicine remains inadequate because of the considerable mortality of patients with covid-19 a clinically predictive system for early warning of mortality risk is urgently neededthe cut-off value of apache ii score in covid-19 is much lower to predict mortality several reasons may explain it first gcs is an important component of apache ii score direct damage to the nervous system by sars-cov-2 was rarely reported only a few patients had a disturbance of consciousness in the study most of them suffered from hypoxemia-induced ischemic hypoxic encephalopathy and one was attributed to underlying cerebral hemorrhage second apache ii score was assessed according to the characteristics of the patients on the first day of icu admission abnormal levels of serum sodium and potassium were observed in some patients but only a few patients got scores for the corresponding part in apache ii score finally according to our observation several patients deteriorated during their stay in the hospital in a few days and quickly died although timely given powerful empirical treatments including glucocorticoid immunoglobulin mechanical ventilation etc the patients were still hard to recover from covid-19 a recent study showed the median apache ii score of survivors and deaths in critically ill patients with covid-19 were 14 and 18 respectively 6 this indicated that covid-19 might be more variable and mortal compared with pneumonia caused by other pathogens further studies are needed to confirm our findingsapache ii score sofa score and curb65 score are commonly used to describe multiple organ function for assessing disease severity and estimate hospital mortality 7 9 15 according to recent reports any underlying disorder was significantly more common in severe cases when compared with nonsevere cases the medical history of coronary heart disease was an independent determinant of critical illness of the patients with covid-19 16 and it was also associated with a higher risk of mortality in patients with covid-19 17 in this cohort about half of patients had one or more underlying comorbidities and coronary heart disease was more common in deaths than in survivors it suggested that comorbidities played an important role in the death of the patients with covid-19 age has also been identified to be associated with the severity and death in patients with covid-19 based on the present and previous studies 1820 of the three score systems only apache ii score includes comorbidities and age whereas curb65 score takes into account only age and sofa score takes into account neither of them these may explain why apache ii score performed better than the other two for predicting mortality in patients with covid-19notably sars-cov-2 mainly caused lung lesions but other organs injury cannot be neglected in the present study we found that the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was higher in deaths than that in survivors qu et al 21 also demonstrated that high platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was associated with severe illness in patients with covid-19 platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio mainly reflects the level of systemic inflammation and high value may lead to adverse outcome recent studies have shown that the proportion of developing liver injury in patients with severe covid-19 was significantly higher than that in mild patients 2224 our study also found that the proportion of liver dysfunction was higher in the deaths group than that in the survivors group consistent with the other study 25 currently studies on the mechanisms of sars-cov-2related liver injury are limited it has been shown that sars-cov-2 also uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as its entry receptor as sars-cov does 26 whether it results in liver damage in patients remains to be investigated troponin i was significantly increased in patients with severe covid-19 compared with those with milder illness 16 the mechanisms may be similar to that of myocardial injury in other severe respiratory illnesses in which myocardial oxygen demand is heightened and inflammation is rampant 27 further studies are need to confirm the mechanisms underlying these findingsthere were still some limitations in our study first the present study was a retrospective single-center study with a relatively small sample size second all patients were enrolled from the icu in tongji hospital most patients were transferred from other hospitals or isolation units these patients were more likely to progress to adverse outcomes therefore the mortality of patients with covid-19 in this study may be much higher than general population 28 and may be not generalized third the treatments may influence the outcomes of patients with covid-19 but in this study we aimed to apply the characteristics of the patients at the first day admitted to icu to predict the outcome of the patients with covid-19 additional research is needed to understand the role of apache ii score in the risk stratification of patients with covid-19apache ii score was identified to be an effectively clinical tool to predict mortality in patients with covid-19 compared with sofa score and curb65 score future researches are needed to explore whether the application of apache ii score in patients with covid-19 could reduce mortality and improve patient outcomespoor dietary habits are considered to be the second-leading risk factors for mortality and disability-adjusted life-years dalys in the world the poor dietary habits are responsible for 103 million deaths and 2291 million dalys in 2016 1 for example the following dietary habits are among the leading risk factors for early death and disability in european countries the habits are low intakes of whole grains fruit and vegetables and nuts and seeds and high intakes of alcohol and sodium the western dietary habits are consuming diet processed high in red and processed meat diets with high in sugar-sweetened beverages and low in milk these kinds of dietary habits are regarded to be a rising health concerndietary patterns are different based on cultural environmental technological and economic factors however the dietary patterns are becoming similar due to increasing living standards and growing globalization of the food sector 2 3mertens et al 4 explored the dietary intakes in four different european counters using individual-level dietary intake in adults in nationally- representative surveys of denmark france czech republic and italy they reported a higher intake of fruits and vegetables and lower intakes of sweetened beverages and alcohol in italy while individuals in denmark and the czech republic had a higher intake of vegetables a comparison of population subgroups within countries shows that there is a difference in the dietary preferences beliefs and practices for particular consumer groups for example highly-educated persons and women have a higher intake of fish nuts and seeds along with lower intake of red and processed meats 5the individual-level reported dietary data of the countries could be used as a useful tool to make a connection between health and environment with foods as their common denominator 1 a recent review study reported that the detailed assessment of patients for the dietary and nutritional risks along with medical lifestyle and environmental factors with suitable risk management strategies make the sensible way to deal with the covid-19 6 the diet and nutrition have a variance impact on the immune system competence in addition they determine the risk and severity of the infections the relation between diet nutrition infection and immunity is bidirectional 7 the macro- micronutrients and phytonutrients in diet such as fruits and colorful vegetables improve healthy immune responses the micro- and phytonutrients provide the antioxidants and the antiinflammatory nutrients like beta-carotene vitamin c vitamin e and polyphenolic compounds resulting in modulating the immune functions 8 9nutritional deficiencies of energy protein and specific micronutrients have been shown to contribute to depressed immune function and increased susceptibility to infections the sufficient intake of iron zinc and vitamins a e b6 and b12 is vital for the overall maintenance of immune function 10the new epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has become a pandemic to the world currently we make a hypothesis that geographical variation in dietary factors could have a role in infection and mortality rates of co vid-19 in the world therefore we aimed to explore the relation of dietary factors with global infection and mortality rates of covis-19 in this studyin the current ecological study the countries that had national dietary data from the global dietary databases of the united nations 11 and coronavirus disease statistics from the world health organization who were included 12 the countries that had coronavirus disease statistics from the who were consecutively checked for the recent data of the dietary factorsthe countriesstates met eligibility criteria for this investigation if they had the statistics from the who coronavirus disease covid-19 situation dashboard from the website of the world health

countries were presented in median interquartile range iqr mean std deviation and number percentage the confirmed and dead cases were presented in median and interquartile range due to the non-normal distribution of the data the normality of the outcomes was examined in drawing a histogram and box plot the number of confirmed cases was divided by the total population of a country multiplied by 1000000 to obtain the infection rate of covid-19 per one million persons the number of dead cases was divided by the total number of confirmed cases and divided by total population multiplied by 1000000 to obtain the mortality rate1000000 persons the infection and mortality rates were determined in a median and interquartile range following dealing with the potential outliers the upper limit values were considered for the extremely higher limit values in the infection and mortality rates the crude infection rate was categorized into the following groups 0500 5001000 10001500 15002000 20002500 and  2500 per one million personthe infection and mortality rates were transformed through the ln technique to obtain a normally distributed histogram following that the correlation of transformed infection and mortality rates of the covid-19 with dietary factors in the world was performed in pearson correlation the matrix scatter plots were uses to make the scatter plots for the correlation of infection and mortality rates with dietary factors the role of dietary factors in the infection and mortality rates of covid-19 in the world was examined in linear regression analysis the comparison of dietary factors in countries with different infection rates was presented in box plots and examined in anova-one way the significant level of difference was determined in a p-value of less than 005 the statistical analyses were performed by statistical package for social sciences version 25 ibm spss statistics for windows version 250 armonk ny ibm corpno ethical aspect was applicable to this studythe median crude infection rate by covid-19 was 8778 iqr 46803 ranged between 000 and 2403451 per 1000000 persons the median mortality rate by covid-19 was 00015 iqr 00059 ranged between 000 and 13728 per 1000000 persons the two highest percentage of the crude infection rate were between 0 and 500 759 and 5001000 89 per one million persons table 1
the study showed the crude infection rate was raised with increasing consuming fruits r0416 p0001 unprocessed red meats r0457 p0001 fruit juices r0390 p0001 total protein r0275 p0001 calcium r0550 p0001 potassium r0371 p0001 and total milk r0450 p0001 regarding crude mortality rate per 1000000 persons the study showed that crude mortality rate was raised with increasing consuming unprocessed red meats r0234 p0007 sugar sweetened beverages r0224 p0010 fruit juices r0272 p0002 calcium r0288 p0001 and total milk r0230 p0008 however the mortality rate was decreased following increasing consuming non-starchy vegetables r0196 p0023 see table 2
the regression analysis showed that the crude infection rate has been increased by raising consuming fruits beta 0237 p0006 and calcium beta 0286 p0007 however the infection rate was decreased with rising consuming beans and legumes beta 0145 p0038 table 3
the effect of dietary factors on the crude mortality rate by covid-19 was examined in the regression analysis the analysis showed that the crude mortality rate was increased by raising consuming sugar-sweetened beverages beta 0340 p0001 whereas the crude mortality rate by covid-19 has been decreased by increasing fruits consuming beta 0226 p0047 and beans and legumes beta 0176 p0046 as presented in table 4
the comparison of dietary factors in countries with different infection rates was examined in table 5 and fig 2 the study showed that the countries with higher infection rates between 1500 and above had a higher intake of fruits p0002 fruit juices p0001 calcium p0001 potassium p0001 and total milk p0001 however these countries had a lower intake of unprocessed red meats p0001 and total protein p0013
the daily recommended allowanceintake of the dietary factors are different across the countries it is required to mention that food intake varies markedly based on the socio-demographic factors like age gender and educational level we did not make stratification the results of the study based on the socio-demographic aspects since the who has not published the covid-19 confirmed cases according to age gender and educational level besides the cross-country caparison of individual-level dietary data is challenged by the dietary surveys performed with various survey characteristics and data collection methods with a possible influence in the comparison of the results however we used the fao dietary data that represent the nationally representative sample of all age-sex and educational level categoriesthe present study showed the higher intake of fruits and sugar-sweetened beverages had a positive effect on infection and mortally rates by covid-19 respectively in contrast the higher intake of beans and legumes had a negative effect on both increasing infection and mortality rates the possible reason for the role of fruits and sugar-sweetened beverages on infection and mortally rates back to the indirect effect of weight gain and obesity and the role of agein december 2019 a series of pneumonia cases linked to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market emerged in wuhan hubei china 1 deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus which was named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov 2 by 4 feb 2020 a total 24324 cases have been confirmed infection nationwide with 3219 severe cases 490 death cases and another 23260 suspected cases 3 reports have also been released of exported cases in many other countries who had determined this situation should be deemed a public health emergency of international concern on 30 jan 2020 4 symptoms of 2019-ncov infected pneumonia ncip include fever andor respiratory illness lymphopenia and radiologic abnormality 57 among these clinical features radiologic characteristics of ncip are especially important for diagnosing and predicting prognosis we herein summarize the clinical and radiologic characteristics of 27 confirmed cases and analyze the association of radiologic findings with mortality casesthis retrospective study was approved by the institutional review boards of hubei public health clinical center the central hospital of wuhan and written informed consent was waived between 1 january 2020 and 25 january 2010 27 consecutive patients who fulfilled the clinical criteria for 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov infected pneumonia ncip established by the who interim guidance 8 and discharged with recovered symptoms or died in hospital were included diagnosis of

protocol at hubei provincial center for disease control and prevention cdc clinical characteristics together with chest imaging manifestations of each confirmed cases were recorded if availableall patients were treated with intravenous ribavirin 05g twice daily andor oral oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily antibiotics including levofloxacin moxifloxacin sulbactam and cefoperazone piperacillin and meropenem were used some patients also received glucocorticoid andor intravenous immunoglobulin administrationthe technical parameters included 64-section scanner with 1 mm collimation at 5 mm intervals all ct examinations were performed with the patient in the supine position and with breath-holding following inspiration without administration of contrast material images were obtained with both mediastinal width 350 hu level 40 hu and parenchymal width 1500 hu level -600 hu window settingstwo experienced pulmonologists yml yw reviewed the images independently with a final finding reached by consensus when there was a discrepancy ct findings included ground glass opacity consolidation air bronchogram and nodular opacities ground glass opacity ggo was defined as hazy areas of increased opacity or attenuation without concealing the underlying vessels consolidation was defined as homogeneous opacification of the parenchyma obscuring the underlying vessels air bronchogram was defined as a pattern of air-filled low-attenuation bronchi on a background of opaque high-attenuation airless lung nodular opacities were defined as focal round opacities either solid nodules or ggos diameter  3 cm the presence of lymphadenopathy was defined as a lymph node  1 cm in short-axis diameterthe ct scans were scored on the axial images referring to the method described previously 9 the extent of involvement of each abnormality was assessed independently for each of 3 zones upper above the carina middle below the carina and above the inferior pulmonary vein and lower below the inferior pulmonary vein the location of the lesion was defined as peripheral if it was in the outer one-third of the lung or as central otherwise the ct findings were graded on a 3-point scale 1 as normal attenuation 2 as ground-glass attenuation and 3 as consolidation each lung zone with a total of six lung zones in each patient was assigned a following scale according to distribution of the affected lung parenchyma 0 as normal 1 as  25 abnormality 2 as 2550 abnormality 3 as 5075 abnormality and 4 as  75 abnormality the four-point scale of the lung parenchyma distribution was then multiplied by the radiologic scale described above points from all zones were added for a final total cumulative score with value ranging from 0 to72 fig 1continuous variables were expressed as median

cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov emerged in 2012 and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov emerged in 2002 a novel coronavirus ncov is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans 10 the 2019-ncov causes symptoms similar to sars based on recent clinical data 5 6 and is capable of spreading from human to human and between cities with very contagious characteristic 11 the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 22 12 the mortality of the 27 included patients infected by 2019-ncov was 37 which is much higher than that reported 2 on 4 feb 2020 3 giving the priority of 2019-ncov detection to severe cases because of shortness of test kits in our hospital initially and potential false negative results of 2019-ncov viral rna detection in mild cases might account for this discrepancy consistent with recent reports our results suggest that 2019-ncov is more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities as a result of the weaker immune functions of these patients 5 6 and 2019-ncov-associated death is also related to elder age and underlying illnesses especially hypertension diabetes and cardiac diseaseconsistently with several recent reports regarding to ct findings of 2019-ncov infected pneumonia ncip 1315 our results showed that ct manifestations of ncip were featured by predominant ground glass opacities ggo 67 mixed with consolidations 30 mainly peripheral 26 or combined peripheral and central distributions 74 bilateral 86 and lower lung zones 96 being mostly involved merely consolidation central distribution only pleural effusions or lymphadenopathy were relatively rarely seen initially the ct images might be ggo nodules or patchy ggo mostly peripherally distributed then consolidations and extensive distributions were seen when pneumonia progressed consolidation air bronchogram extensive distribution as well as multiple involved lung zones were more common in mortality group suggesting a more severe clinical course for these abnormalities can be pathologically correlated with diffuse alveolar damage and similar conclusions can be drawn in h1n1 pneumonia h5n1 pneumonia h7n9 pneumonia and sars 9 1618 as members of the same virus family ncip shared much common ground with mers and sars in ct features subpleural and basilar airspace lesions with ggos and consolidations were conspicuous ct characteristics of all three kinds of virus pneumonia but pleural effusions are more common in patients who died of mers 1922comprehensively evaluated the ct features of ncip we calculated the ct score of each patient the ct scores were much higher in mortality group compared to survival group 30 iqr 713 vs 12 iqr 1143 0021 p  0021 on admission in mortality group the scores markedly increased in a short time 12 iqr 5245 vs 20 iqr 1546 p  0042 suggesting a progressive course of ncip although the ct scores were not diminished they maintained a relatively stable level for a period of time in survival group 12 iqr 612 vs 12 iqr 615 p  0237 suggesting that it might take a long time to recover in chest imaging when ncip was under controlled we found an optimal cutoff value of a ct score of 245 sensitivity of 856 and specificity of 845 to predict mortality we hope the simple scoring method according to ct scans may help triage patients and screening patients who need more aggressive treatment and closely monitoring however the efficacy of such approach to decrease mortality remains to be validated in future studiesalthough a definite diagnosis of ncip cannot be achieved by using imaging features alone for most viral pneumonia imaging patterns share similarity the ct features summarized above might be helpful in differentiation various pathogens of pneumonia and in triage patientsthere were limitations in our study first it was a retrospective study including only 27 inpatients while outpatients and suspected but undiagnosed cases for deficiency of detection kits of 2019-ncov and potential false negative results were ruled out second not all information was collected because a significant part of patients had not rechecked ct scans then it was pulmonologists although they are experienced who evaluated ct images finally there was a lack of information regarding interobserver agreement because the study emphasis on the final consensus interpretation rather than independent readingacross millennia disease outbreaks have impacted societies and reinforced the human perception of frailty and mortality 2 dramatic demographic shifts in the past century have escalated the difficulty in containing a pandemic and the rise of globalization and urbanization have facilitated the rapid spread of pathogens from one continent to another in a flight of just a few hours yet when a comparison is drawn between the 2019 coronavirus pandemic and the 1918 influenza pandemic the most widely available tools to respond to these disease outbreaks have remained nearly the same public health interventions have been and are still the first line of defense against a pandemic in the absence of a vaccine 3 understanding that the environment plays a significant role in disease dynamics and in determining the health of individuals has always been an essential aspect to controlling and managing infectious diseases for example the history of urban planning in the past century has highlighted how built environments can have an effect on preventing both chronic and infectious diseases 4 however the function of human behaviors and social ideologies stemmed from the darker side of humanity must also be acknowledged as an important component to determining who lives and who survives during the deadliest periods of disease pandemicsin the midst of world war i the influenza pandemic spread worldwide during 1918-1919 and was outstanding in its lethality 5 while there is not a universal consensus on the pandemics origin it is understood to have been was caused by a h1n1 subtype of an influenza a virus with avian and swine genetic origins 678 over the course of the pandemic an estimated one third of the worlds population approximately 500 million persons became infected and the total deaths were estimated at 50 million or arguably as high as 100 million 7 historically the curve of influenza deaths in humans has been u-shaped with peaks among infants and the elderly nevertheless this 1918 influenza pandemic exhibited a w-shape age-related fatality with the addition of a third peak among young adults 79 as such death rates for individuals 15 to 34 years of age were 20 times higher than in previous years 710the influenza pandemic occurred in three distinctive waves over a 12-month period in europe asia and north america the first wave of the pandemic which began in spring 1918 and lasted approximately six months was not particularly virulent and mimicked typical seasonal flu symptomology and mortality 7811 however due to a possible viral mutation over the course of the summer and wartime troop movements this first wave was then followed by a rapid succession of more fatal second and third waves in the autumn of 1918 septembernovember and the winter and spring of 1919 january-may respectively 712131415 in the united states the first outbreak of flu-like illnesses was detected in march 1918 with more than 100 cases at camp funston in fort riley kansas 1617 within a week the number of influenza cases quintupled throughout the army installation 16 by the end of the month approximately 1100 soldiers were hospitalized and 38 had died after developing pneumonia 18 nevertheless thousands of soldiers were continually deployed for world war i and traveled across the atlantic ocean in europe the disease first appeared in april 1918 among american soldiers in a military camp near bordeaux france 517 the influenza presentation was in the form of a benign fever accompanied by cold-like symptoms and the attending american doctors believed the underlying cause was haemophilus influenzae a pathogenic bacterium formally called pfeiffers bacillus 19 the spring 1918 wave of influenza affected nearly 15000 soldiers from april to july but only five american soldiers died 19 although the mortality of this first pandemic wave was minor in comparison to the waves to come spain was the first european country in which the disease spread to wide sectors of the population thus causing a significant level of mortality in may and june 1918 there were 276 influenza deaths in madrid which represented a mortality rate of 042 deaths per 1000 people 19 during this same period another 852 unconfirmed influenza deaths were attributed to different respiratory system pathologies if these unconfirmed deaths were combined with the confirmed influenza deaths the mortality rate would have been 131 per 1000 people the highest mortality figure traceable to this pandemic 19 up until this point very little was written or documented about the strain of the outbreak or its epidemiologic indications due to wartime censorship however this mortality rate from one single etiological agent could not be overlooked in may 1918 the spanish newspaper el sol first published a report about a sickness which had not yet been diagnosed by doctors and headlines around the world labeled this as one of the worst pandemics in human history 1920 thus the derivation of spanish influenza was conceived 5in september 1918 the second and most deadly wave of the pandemic emerged within the united states 21 soldiers at camp devens an army training camp just outside of boston massachusetts and sailors aboard the receiving ship at commonwealth pier in boston began reporting flu-like symptoms 1622 by months end more than 14000 cases were reported at camp devens approximately one-quarter of the total camp and 757 soldiers succumbed to influenza 16 the massachusetts department of health informed local newspapers of the epidemic and stated that unless precautions are taken the disease in all probability will spread to the civilian population of the city 22 at the nearby navy radio school within harvard university in cambridge massachusetts cases of influenza were reported among the group of 5000 young men studying radio communications as 1918 concluded cambridge experienced 3014 cases of influenza among its meager population of 109000 residents ultimately leading to a mortality rate of 541 per 100000 23 during this time in new york state the board of health in new york city added influenza to the list of reportable diseases and required all cases to be isolated at home or in a city hospital 16 moreover in a document entitled fighting influenza with transit systems the board of health adopted a plan to set operation schedules for many business which would then elongate the time window for transit service and reduce congestion 2425 in lieu of subway suspension royal copeland the city health commissioner staggered workdays by industry so that instead of everyone arriving at work at 900 am some were to come in later or earlier 26 other cities such as seattle washington followed suit in controlling the transmission of influenza within public transit environments by requiring passengers to wear face masks before boarding streetcars figure 1 27interestingly commissioner copeland did not issue an order to close schools or the prohibition of public gatherings at theaters in new york city he stated that his rational to not issue general closing orders and making a public flurry over the situation was to keep down the danger of panic and that he wanted people to go about their business without constant fear and hysterical sense of calamity 29 unlike new york city public gatherings were prohibited and social distancing was encouraged with the closure of theaters movie houses and night schools in other cities namely chicago illinois reno nevada and madison wisconsin 3031 there was also a call for volunteers to help nurse the infirmed in chicago and other cities throughout the united states due to the severe deficit of professional nurses a shortage resulting from the deployment of nurses to military camps and the failure to use trained african american nurses 16 despite the social distancing efforts employed in new york city and chicago philadelphia pennsylvania choose to ignore these initiatives on september 28 1918 the city held its fourth liberty loan drive a parade that gathered over 200000 philadelphians within days after the parade over 1000 people were dead another 200000 cases of influenza were reported every bed in the citys 31 hospitals was filled and the city was forced to close churches schools theaters and all other places of public amusement 223233 a week after the parade 2600 philadelphians had died 34 with the pile up of corpses in philadelphia cold-storage plants were used as temporary morgues and a trolley car manufacturer donated 200 packing crates to be used as coffins 16 by early october single day influenza deaths reached record numbers in philadelphia 289 deathsoctober 6 1918 and new york city 851 deathsoctober 15 1918 22 the virus continued to journey westward to louisiana texas new mexico utah california and washington the wearing of six-ply gauze masks became mandatory in washington and parts of california 1622 for example in san francisco california individuals were fined 5 us dollars usd an equivalent of approximately 85 usd today if they were seized in public without face masks 33 in salt lake city utah officials placed quarantine signs on the doors of 2000 homes where occupants had been infected with influenza 16 the end of the second wave which left its mark as being the deadliest of all three waves coincided with the end of world war i on november 11 1918 1121 as people celebrated armistice day with parades and large gatherings a public health calamity was lurking with an influenza resurgence in some cities 1622 by december 1918 the second wave of the pandemic had passed but the health threat was far from overin australia a third wave erupted in january 1919 and eventually drifted back to europe and the united states 18 there were 1800 cases and 101 deaths reported in the first five days of january in san francisco and on the other side of the country in new york city 706 cases and 67 deaths were reported 16 even though eradication of influenza appeared in louisiana and washington many residents in san antonia texas began complaining that a new surge of influenza cases were not being reported 1622 as a precautionary measure states like massachusetts and illinois began to request special appropriations for the study of influenza treatment and to train women as practical nurses in response to the nursing shortage 16 the nursing shortage was so dire in some areas of the country that the american red cross asked local businesses to grant workers a day off if they volunteered in the hospitals at night 35 the mortality rate of the third wave was just as high as the second wave but the end of the war eliminated the conditions that enabled the rapid and widespread transmission of the virus deaths from the third wave paled in comparison to the annihilation during the second wave 18 with one-quarter of the american population infected with influenza the pandemic was affecting everyone it was believed that president woodrow wilson contracted the virus in april 1919 while negotiating the treaty of versailles to end world war i 18 the pandemic finally came to an end during the summer of 1919 although a very minor fourth wave appeared in spring 1920 throughout isolated areas of new york city the pandemic ended simply because individuals who were infected either died or developed immunity with an estimated death toll of 675000 people in the united states the pandemic lowered the average life expectancy by more than 12 years 10during world war i the worst cases of the influenza pandemic came from overcrowded military barracks and ships with poor ventilation 36 it was quickly found that one way to heal infected wounds was to expose patients to sunlight and open-air in june 1915 sir arthur everett shipley an eminent scientist of the time determined that open-air treatment of infirmed and wounded soldiers at the first eastern general hospital was a success particularly for those with influenza related pneumonia 3738 when the pandemic clinched the united states health officials converted schools halls and large private houses to emergency and open-air hospitals 37 as such open-air hospitals became a common practice by the time of the 1918 pandemic 3940 a combination of outdoor air and sunlight reduced the number of infections and deaths reported at open-air hospitals specifically medics found that regular meals warmth and plenty of fresh air and sunlight helped severely ill patients recover better than indoor nursed patients 41 researchers also revealed that healthcare facilities designed with high ceilings and large windows had the same effect as open-air hospitals 42 accordingly natural ventilation and fresh air was the best way to prevent the transmission of influenza as well as other infectious diseases 43 open-air therapy was one of the popular techniques in dealing with common and often deadly respiratory infections of the time until antibiotics replaced it in the 1950s 44in the absence of a vaccine for novel pathogens and antibiotics to protect against influenza secondary bacterial infections many authorities suggested non-pharmaceutical interventions for the control of a pandemic 4546 social distancing had become the most well-established non-pharmaceutical public health measure to slow the spread of communicable diseases social distancing measures were implemented through the closing of schools restaurants and theaters as well as the banning and restriction of public gatherings and transportation among cities in the united states during the 1918 pandemic 3 the point of initiation duration and decision to relax social distancing measures profoundly impacted mortality rates during this period 47 for example cities such as philadelphia 748 deaths per 100000 at 24 weeks that initiated social distancing measures later and for shorter periods tended to have spikes in deaths and overall higher death rates figure 2 348 in philadelphia the first cases of the influenza appeared on september 17 1918 47 however the philadelphia public health director dr wilmer krusen understated the risk of disease transmission dr krusen assured people that sick soldiers were suffering from casual seasonal influenza which could be avoided by staying warm he allowed large public gatherings notably the fourth liberty loan drive parade on september 28 1918 as mentioned previously as a result philadelphia experienced a mortality acceleration that was 360 higher than the average american city 49 in comparison cities such as minneapolis minnesota 267 deaths per 100000 at 24 weeks that ordered social distancing measures sooner and for longer periods slowed the transmission rate and lowered overall death rates 348 furthermore cities that relaxed social distancing measures prematurely experienced multiple spikes in deaths this was observed in st louis missouri due to its low death rate the city lifted restrictions on public gatherings less than two months after the influenza outbreak began however a sharp and higher spike of new cases soon followed 348 research comparing 17 american cities has suggested that the implementation of early interventions to control the spread of influenza may have significantly decreased the rate of transmission and mortality observed 47 cities across the united states including milwaukee wisconsin and indianapolis indiana had the most effective interventions and reduced transmission rates by up to 3050 50 the lower level of mortality was due to the quick public health response in the first days of the epidemic and the introduction of broad measures designed to promote social distancing 4750initially the american medical community minimized the scale and scope of the influenza pandemic to create a false sense of security in the countrys largest cities including philadelphia 11 yet this was an issue beyond the medical community this was a public health crisis that brought to light urban environment deficiencies namely the proliferation of municipal waste and unsanitary living conditions 51 while not always well understood the presence and threat of infectious diseases has shaped urban planning in the united states during this early 20th century pandemic urban environments in new york city chicago and other american cities were densely populated and characterized by crowded tenement housing in proximity to factories animal yards and slaughterhouses with little airflow or light 452 even before the 1918 influenza outbreak cities were plagued with cholera tuberculosis and typhoid epidemics 4 medical models specifically the miasma theory an idea that diseases were caused by a noxious form of bad air prevailed but there was also a sense that the congestion pollution lack of sunshine and poor airflow contributed to illness 452 in response urban planning efforts introduced zoning to spatially segregate residential commercial and industrial uses and housing regulations to require light and airflow in order to improve overcrowding and unsanitary urban living conditions 452 during the 1918 pandemic urban reformers and engineers again tried to prevent infection by improving waste removal and housing quality and creating technological enhancements to control environmental nuisances and hazards but trivial cooperation from municipal government leadership and interference of the private interest sector often blocked immediate and effective action 51 as a result the schism in the public health community ultimately impacted the lives of millions 53epidemic diseases have not been random events that afflicted societies capriciously and without warning they typically unfold across a wide spectrum of communities that are diverse by race age gender and socioeconomic status 5455 the 1918 pandemic affected the youngest and wealthiest people without any boundaries racially the composition of the country during this time was predominately black and white and up until this point medical and public health reports had documented that african americans suffered higher morbidity and mortality rates for several diseases in comparison to white americans 56 specifically web du bois a prominent sociologist and civil rights activist found through an analysis of the 1900 us census that the african american mortality rates were two to three times higher for several diseases including tuberculosis pneumonia and diarrheal disease in comparison to the white american mortality rates 57 dubois argued that these disparities reflected social conditions and not racial susceptibilities 57 in poor and working-class urban neighborhoods social conditions like overcrowded housing poor sanitation service and unsafe drinking increased the vulnerability of influenza 51 in 1910 the us census set 2500 as the minimum population threshold for the urban category and by the 1920 us census over 50 of the american population was defined as urban 58 before the onset of the pandemic urban environments within american cities were composed of a predominantly 9345 white population 59 during this period more than 90 of the african american population lived in southern parts of the united states but millions began migrating to the north in search of better job opportunities and living conditions 60 with this first great migration from the rural south to northern cities starting in 1910 a larger share of african americans lived in urban areas during the 1918 pandemic 61 still on average and in comparison to white americans fewer african americans less than 5 lived in high population density urban areas which were the epicenters of the outbreak 62 hence the norms of disease morbidity and mortality for african americans changed during the pandemic during the second wave in fall 1918 african americans had lower influenza morbidity and mortality rates but a higher case fatality rate in comparison to the white population 63 this was an unexpected phenomenon as african americans were expected to have higher influenza morbidity and mortality explanations for this 1918 pandemic norm crossover have included 1 an unequal exposure based on where african americans lived eg urban vs rural environments 2 a higher exposure to the less virulent spring wave which provided some african americans with immunity 3 a military segregation which allowed for less crowding among african american soldiers and 4 an underreporting of influenza cases and deaths for african americans 63 while there has been no evidence that the first spring wave was especially rampant in the south to induce a higher influenza exposure among the majority of african americans living in rural southern areas there has been a clear understanding that the first great migration left a large portion of african americans in cramped dilapidated impoverished and segregated conditions with less access to sanitation and urban social programs in northern cities the segregated african american neighborhoods may have functioned as a makeshift quarantine yet in cities such as baltimore maryland and detroit michigan the segregation created crowded urban ghettoes where tuberculosis became one of the top three causes of death among urban african americans 64 individuals with tuberculosis lung damage were more susceptible to influenza which would explain why a higher proportion of african american influenza cases developed pneumonia and also had higher case fatality rates during the second wave 63 the entrenched racial and economic discrimination within the united states seemed to have both protected and endangered african americans to the 1918 pandemicthroughout world war i many doctors had been called into military service and the shortage of the doctors nurses and medical staff caused hospitals to reject patients particularly african americans 56 the american red cross served as the recruiter of nurses for the army with the racial discriminatory practices of the american red cross african american women who tried to gain entry as nurses were rebuffed while the devastation of the pandemic forced the army to drop its ban on african american nurses the racial discrimination still surpassed the need for healthcare in some areas the november 2 1918 edition of the chicago defender reported that the dean of ohios hiram college refused to allow an african american nurse named olive walker to care for influenza patients at the college 5665 african american doctors also found the color line to be rigid in trying to care for white americans during this time 66 racism and legalized segregation restricted african americans and other non-white americans access to healthcare professionals and facilities in cities across the nation african americans received substandard care in segregated hospitals or in confined hospitals that served only african americans many infected people died without seeing a doctor due to the sheer number of bodies that overwhelmed the capacity of hospitals and the heavy burden of the medical staff 67 african american influenza patients exceeded the limit of the frederick douglass memorial hospital one of philadelphias two african american hospitals and pushed the medical director to establish an emergency annex in an african american parochial school 56 in richmond virginia african american patients received care in a hospital basement until the city opened a separate hospital staffed by african americans at an elementary school 5668 the baltimore afro-american newspaper criticized provident hospital the only african american facility in the city for turning patients away 5669 a prohibition on public gatherings that included funerals and wakes prevented families from properly grieving many victims were buried without coffins or were thrown into unmarked burial grounds native americans who practiced different burial practices became exposed to the virus at alarming rates in september 1918 more than 2000 navajos died of influenza in apache county new mexico 22 across the country mass graves were dug to accommodate the pile of corpses 36 african american bodies in particular were neglected by the general public infrastructure in baltimore sanitation department employees refused to dig graves for african american influenza victims after the citys only african american cemetery could not accommodate any more graves 65the 1918 pandemic took a heavy human toll on entire families and communities with the devastation and bereavement violence erupted in some areas people were shot for not wearing masks and rates of homicides and suicides skyrocketed 22 white supremacist ideologies and racist scientific theories advanced bigoted and false notions of the biological physiological and moral inferiority of african americans when they were blamed for the pandemic 56 throughout the first great migration period african americans were highly visible and thought of as diseases the 1918 pandemic heightened these existing prejudices which were further reinforced by contemporary newspaper headlines such as rush of negroes to city starts health inquiry negros arrive by thousandsperil to health or negro influx brings disease 70 the memory of the 1918 pandemic left a lasting blemish on public health planning and practice and reflected the moral relationships and deterioration of humanity during that period the magnitude of events and death with the influenza pandemic have served as a reference point and hopefully as a severe if not worst-case scenarioin december 2019 the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was detected in the wuhan hubei province of the peoples republic of china 71 in the following weeks infections spread across china and other countries around the world 7273 covid-19 was first confirmed to have spread to the united states in january 2020 when a 35-year-old man returned to washington state on january 15 2020 after traveling to visit family in wuhan china was diagnosed 74 on january 30 2020 the first case of person-to-person covid-19 transmission was confirmed in the united states between a married couple after a 60-year-old wife returned from china 75 she subsequently became symptomatic and transmitted the infection to her husband by march 11 2020 there were over 125000 cases and 4500 deaths worldwide 76 as such the world health organization classified the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic as of june 21 2020 there were over two million confirmed cases and 119810 deaths in the united states 77 these numbers however to do include the thousands of americans such as an estimated 5200 people in new york city who died without being tested for covid-19the coronavirus pandemic in the united states which has the highest number of known cases in the world exploded over the course of march and april 2020 at the start of march most of the cases were tied to overseas travel and there was extremely limited testing available in many parts of the country such as in new york maryland indiana north carolina and louisiana there was a period when the number of cases was doubling every 7 to 14 days 77 one precipitating source of community transmission unique to covid-19 has been cruise ships cruise ships have previously been settings for infectious diseases outbreaks because of their compact closed environments contact with travelers from many countries and crew transfers between ships more than 800 confirmed covid-19 cases occurred on the diamond princess and grand princess cruise ship voyages the latter of which sailed roundtrip departing san francisco from february 11 to 7 march 2020 78 four stops were made in mexico voyage a and most of the 1111 crew and 68 passengers from voyage a remained on board for a second voyage that departed san francisco on 21 february 2020 voyage b with a planned return on 7 march 2020 78 a healthcare provider in california reported two patients who had traveled on voyage a with covid-19 symptoms and one of whom with a confirmed positive covid-19 test subsequently more than 20 additional covid-19 cases among voyage a passengers were confirmed in california on 5 march 2020 a centers for disease control and prevention cdc response team was transported by helicopter to the grand princess cruise ship to collect specimens from 45 passengers and crew with covid-19 respiratory symptoms among these 45 individuals 21 467 had positive covid-19 test results which included two passengers and 19 crew members this high attack rate among passengers and crew has been partially attributed to a high proportion of asymptomatic infections until disembarkation passengers and symptomatic crew members were asked to self-quarantine in their cabins and room service replaced public dining when the grand princess cruise ship docked in oakland california on 8 march 2020 everyone was transferred to land-based sites for a 14-day quarantine period as of 21 march 2020 78 166 of 469 persons with available test had positive covid-19 test results additional covid-19 cases linked to several additional cruises were also reported across the united states 78 by 17 march 2020 the cruise lines international association announced a 30-day voluntary suspension of cruise operations in the united states and the cdc issued a level 3 travel warning for all cruise travel to be deferred worldwidethe first preliminary description of outcomes among covid-19 patients in the united states was reported in march 2020 by the cdc this report indicated that fatality was highest in persons aged 85 ranging from 10 to 27 this was then followed by persons aged 6584 years 3 to 11 aged 55-64 years 1 to 3 aged 2054 years 1 and aged 19 years 0 79 pediatric 18 years covid-19 cases less than 2 of the total cases in the united states have demonstrated much milder symptoms and may not even have a cough or fever 80 although severe covid-19 illness leading to hospitalization including intensive care unit icu admission and death can occur in adults of any age 31 of cases 45 of hospitalizations 53 of icu admissions and 80 of deaths have occurred among adults aged 65 years 79 likewise long-term residential care facilities were particularly at risk for covid-19 in washington a female resident of a long-term care skilled nursing facility contracted covid-19 an epidemiologic investigation determined that 129 cases of covid-19 were associated with this facility including 81 residents 34 staff members and 14 visitors the majority of covid-19 cases were women 651 and the median age was 81 years range  54100 years among facility residents 425 years range  2279 years among staff members and 625 years range  5288 years among visitors out of the total 129 covid-19 cases associated with this nursing facility 568 of residents 357 of visitors and 59 of staff members were hospitalized ultimately 23 persons 22 residents and 1 visitor died as a result of covid-19 81 while it is believed that limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to the spread within and between facilities the existence of underlying medical conditions has been found to be a very important risk factor among these facility residents the most common chronic underlying conditions were hypertension 691 cardiac disease 568 renal disease 432 diabetes mellitus 370 obesity 333 and pulmonary disease 321 81by mid-march 2020 the entire united states including four territories had reported cases of covid-19 on 7 april 2020 nationwide case doubling time was approximately 65 days yet for areas such as louisiana the doubling time was 55 days 82 moreover during this time louisiana ranked 5th in the nation with approximately 16200 confirmed cases and nearly 700 deaths of which 70 were african american 7783 the explosion of cases in new orleans has been anecdotally linked to the influx of travelers for mardi gras yet this theory does not explain the situation of shreveport another louisiana hotspot for covid-19 cases 84 initially race and ethnicity data were not reported for covid-19 cases but then the covid-19associated hospitalization surveillance network covid-net was created using the existing infrastructure of the influenza hospitalization surveillance network flusurv-net and the respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization surveillance network rsv-net in order to conduct population-based surveillance 85 during the first month 130 march 2020 of surveillance in the united states 1482 patients hospitalized with covid-19 were surveilled among the covid-19 patients with underlying conditions data 893 had one or more underlying medical conditions the most common conditions were hypertension 497 obesity 483 chronic lung disease 346 diabetes mellitus 283 and cardiovascular disease 278 85 hence the majority of persons hospitalized with covid-19 had underlying medical conditions among patients with race and ethnicity data 450 were white 331 were african american 81 were hispanic 55 were asian and 79 were of other or unknown race 85 again considering that african americans only comprise 13 of the united states population the overrepresentation of african american covid-19 cases sheds light on issues that have often been overlookeddr frank m snowden a professor emeritus of history at yale university stated in an interview with the new yorker that epidemics reflect our relationships with the environmentthe built environment that we create and the natural environment that responds 86 communicable diseases have existed in humankind since the days of hunting and gathering but when the shift to a more agrarian life occurred thousands of years ago the formation of communities by way of built environments created ideal conditions for epidemics built environments the man-made settings constructed and operated for the purpose of human activity include the physical sites where humans live and work and range in scale from homes in neighborhoods to buildings in cities some evidence has shown that high occupant density built environments can encourage the transmission of airborne pathogens that can cause the common cold influenza chicken pox whooping cough tuberculosis and even covid-19 because of increased social interactions and direct contact between individuals 87 open interior spaces where there is a high degree of spatial connectivity and more opportunity for social encounters can facilitate the spread of these pathogens as well as others 88 therefore the coronavirus pandemic has put a spotlight on the relationship between built environments pathogenic infections and public healthon march 15 2020 the cdc recommended social distancing also called physical distancing in modern society 798990 most states followed suit and issued stay-at-home orders with detailed directives such as every person is ordered to stay at his or her place of residence except as necessary to perform essential activities and essential activities included grocery shopping obtaining medical prescriptions or service providing care for others or outdoor physical activity 91 many states including maryland and massachusetts prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people and mandated that individuals stay at least six feet apart 91 states throughout the country had ordered most businesses to close banned all non-essential gatherings of any size and implemented telework policies when possible for instance in new york only pharmacies some retailers hospitals manufacturing plants and financial institutions were allowed to open 92 the closure of the schools businesses restaurants without a carry-out or delivery options and leisure activities including theaters and fitness facilities have in essence created an abandonment of many built environment structures many restaurants even with carry-out or delivery options have still needed to cut hours switch to mobile payment systems and create new protocols of operation to face the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic 93 some retailers namely grocery stores have implemented a daily senior shopping hour for this at-risk population and added six feet apart points at checkout lines to help customers maintain a physical distance 9495 amid the coronavirus pandemic companies have enabled work-from-home structures to keep businesses running and assist employees with social distancing compliance nonetheless working remotely has been a growing trend for a while and this pandemic essentially created millions of teleworkers overnight 96 the public transportation infrastructure another essential feature of built environments has also been impacted by the severity of the coronavirus pandemic in compliance with social distancing directives many cities significantly reduced public transit service eg subways buses thereby negatively affecting many individuals needing transit access new yorks metropolitan transit authority closed non-essential lines concentrating resources to transit routes that supported essential personnel and those with urgent personal business 97 new orleans regional transit authority has defined a set of essential destinations and eliminated routes that do not serve these locations 98 the list of essential destinations included only healthcare facilities pharmacies and grocery stores many agencies like the chicago transit authority have also imposed ad-hoc sanitation regimes to minimize the spread of the virus as well as the requirement of face masks for all riders 99 the necessity of these preventative measures were underscored when a detroit city bus driver vented on social media his anger over a coughing bus rider and then subsequently died 11 days later from covid-19 100 in addition to a reduction of public transit in various municipalities throughout the united states the service of commuter trains with amtrak was also disrupted throughout the coronavirus pandemic due to social distancing and shelter-in-place orders on 16 march 2020 amtrak announced a 40 reduction suspension or complete cancellation of various train lines throughout the northeast corridor of the country including the amtrak hartford and winter park express lines 101 amtrak has also required passengers to wear face masks 102 furthermore the department of homeland security dhs issued a notice of arrival restrictions in early march 2020 whereby all airline passengers arriving from china iran and certain european countries were required to travel through one of 13 airports where dhs had established enhanced entry screening capabilities 103 by march 31 2020 the department of state disseminated a global level 4 health advisorydo not travel and advised american citizens to avoid all international travel due to covid-19 104airborne pathogens can be easily transmitted through indoor air and unfortunately indoor environments have not been designed to prevent the rapid dissemination of new diseases 105 ventilation and the pattern of airflow controls the direction of droplet distribution generated from the respiratory activities of building occupants thus it is essential that environments with high occupant density and mobility such as hospitals schools and offices are designed to minimize the spread of airborne infections 105 administrators and building operators have been searching for ways to promote good design and amenity of built environments even before the coronavirus pandemic new design and planning policies were trying to provide achievable guidance to environmental decision-makers building operators and all indoor occupants in an attempt to minimize infectious disease transmission particularly in dense urban environments 106 consequently the new sars-cov-2 virus has made a profound impact on planning environmental laws and urban infrastructures according to the university of oregons biology and the built environment center stringent social distancing measures and building cleaning efforts needed to be put in place to reduce exposure to sars-cov-2 88 moreover a more involved series of strategies including changes to ventilation systems eg increased outside air fractions to improve indoor air and window operations eg open windows to dilute indoor contaminants have also emerged from the research center 88 these modifications as well as architectural techniques combined with public health interventions can be used to efficiently disable diseases virulence and protect occupants in buildings from airborne pathogens 107108classifications and guidelines have shown that filtration as part of the ventilation system is a proven way to block the penetration of the outside pathogens into buildings 109110 filtration can improve the indoor air quality and effectively reduce the pathogen loads released in the air 111112 natural light and ultraviolet lights following proper protocols may also have the ability to inactivate sars-cov-2 88 studies have shown that some viruses are susceptible to ultraviolet germicidal irradiation uvgi factors including humidity airflow patterns uvgi energy intensity and duration have been able to impact uvgi effectiveness in inactivating pathogens 113114115116 indoor humidity levels have also been discovered to be vital in the survivability of covid-19 a research team found that indoor humidity levels of 4060 may help minimize the spread and survival of sars-cov-2 and with little risk of indoor mold growth 88 while most designs of air-conditioning systems have not supported central humidification a targeted in-room humidification may be necessary during episodes of pathogen transmission risk 88the coronavirus pandemic has exposed weaknesses in the american healthcare system specifically the consortium of hospitals there are more than 6000 hospitals with approximately 920000 beds in the united states but even before the pandemic there were fewer doctors and fewer beds per capita than most other developed countries 117118 according to data from the organization for economic cooperation and development the united states has approximately 3 beds per 1000 people 117 the higher rates of hospitalizations for chronic conditions that should not require hospitalization including diabetes mellitus and asthma has compounded the shortage of hospital beds during this pandemic furthermore hospital emergency departments in many areas including rural communities have not been well equipped for modern ailments or the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic 119 designing guidance can aid healthcare facilities and clinics to cope with the increasing volume of covid-19 cases and create small scale segregation rooms 120 the guidance for controlling covid-19 in healthcare settings indicated that patients should be isolated and placed in private rooms with a private bathroom moreover airborne infection isolation rooms should be used for patients who will be undergoing aerosol generating procedures such as intubation or chest compressions 121 to combat the ongoing covid-19 pandemic a dutch architecture firm suggested a studio prototype vital house constructed quickly from sustainable prefabricated wooden materials this vital house a temporary healthcare center could provide icus communication and a large green patio to enable faster patient recovery 122 building pop-up triage tents immediately outside of hospitals has been a solution employed by medical centers throughout the unites states a 14-tent 68-bed hospital in new york citys central park and a 19-feet by 35-feet tent for 40 patients in durham north carolina were constructed exclusively for covid-19 patients when the number of cases needing care exceeded the hospital capacity 123124 these standing tents in empty spaces under hospital overpasses and in proximity to emergency rooms have enabled healthcare workers to rapidly sequester crisis pandemic patients 125another environmental issue that may have amplified covid-19 transmission was the infection of healthcare workers who may have inadvertently spread the disease to patients for example covid-19 was found to have spread across four buildings of life care center a consortium of skilled nursing facilities in washington 126127 the course of events points to inadequate infection prevention and control measures in hospitals and other healthcare facilities stated by the world health organization sars-cov-2 can survive on surfaces for a few hours up to several days for example sars-cov-2 rna was identified on a variety of surfaces in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers up to 17 days after cabins were vacated on the diamond princess cruise ship but before disinfection procedures had been conducted 78 reducing the number of flat surfaces where germs can sit has been deemed another way to keep pathogens and viruses from transferring between patients and healthcare workers around the building 125 to control germs and bacteria on surfaces designers have often avoided difficult-to-reach areas or tight corners in buildings and overly-complicated designs in high-touch surfaces 128 according to markovitz hospital designers have attempted to find smart materials and infrastructure that can easily be disinfected and washed 125 also certain materials already standardized in healthcare may find application in other public spaces including antibacterial fabrics and finishes non-porous materials that already exist eg copper as well as those that will inevitably be developed to facilitate cleaning and sanitizing 128 moving forward it will also be important for architectures to immediately remove the high-touch design features of buildings 125 some large public spaces such as airports hotels hospitals gyms and offices have begun moving toward more automation to mitigate contagion this coronavirus pandemic has revealed that using technology to remotely control the most-touched surfaces and developing touch-less technology eg automatic doors voice-activated elevators cellphone-controlled hotel room entry hands-free light switches and temperature controls can significantly mitigate the spread of viruses 96much of the united states with the exception of essential workers has undergone nearly three months of social distancing in addition to shelter-in-place orders during the coronavirus pandemic compared to others who are currently employed and working from home essential workers must work outside the home these workers including healthcare workers grocery store staff or transit operators have been more likely to be african american and approximately 70 did not have a college degree 129 furthermore one in four essential workers have said that they or someone in their family is a healthcare worker an employment classification that has been considered essential throughout the united states 129 essential workers have been putting themselves at risk in order to keep others alive and maintain a functioning society through the countrys shelter-in-place orders in addition to this risk many essential workers have also been designated as economically vulnerable one in three essential workers reported living in a household that made less than 40000 usd a year and one in seven lacked health insurance 129 moreover millions of essential workers rely on government assistance programs 130131132 with a lack of options many of these workers cannot afford to quit their jobs in spite of the heightened risk to sars-cov-2 exposure through their employment a polarization has emerged among essential workers as a result of the inherent inequalities that persist within the united states for example there has been a clear economic and social distinction between a salaried pulmonologist who treats the respiratory system of covid-19 patients and an hourly waged grocery store cashier who processes and bags customer purchases yet both are considered essential aside from the difference in wages the highly educated pulmonologist has been socially revered and showered with personal protective equipment campaigns while the grocery store cashier has been largely ignored undervalued and unsupplied with simple face masks it is clear that some essential positions require relatively few educational credentials or certifications and the skills necessary tend to be easy to learn and nontechnical therefore the pool of these particular workers is large and it has been easy for employers to hire and fire these workers at-willwhile simple economic concepts such as supply and demand can only partly account for the polarization of essential workers during the coronavirus pandemic the norms of inequality within the united states contributes to the bulk of the circumstance the jobs of essential workers have been more likely to be held by women people of color and immigrants by the end of april 2019 the cdc reported that there were 4913 essential workers diagnosed with covid-19 in 115 meat or poultry processing facilities throughout 19 states and that 20 people had died 133 it was also disclosed that these processing employees communicated through language and cultural barriers lived in crowded multigenerational housing and commuted to work together likewise workers were incentivized to work through illness thereby indicating a lack of appropriate healthcare options 133 many essential workers have been poorly compensated because they were members of marginalized and underrepresented groups who generally have less political and economic capital compared to the white american male in addition to poor compensation 13 of essential workers lack health insurance and over 30 of these workers would have to borrow money to pay for an unexpected 500 usd medical bill 129 within communities of color many of whom are essential workers as stated previously covid-19 testing inequities have been observed in several areas throughout the country there has been a lack of access to covid-19 walk-up testing as well as widespread testing 134 in some observations it has been reported that physicians may be less likely to refer african americans for covid-19 testing when they arrive with signs of infection 135136137 reasons for this have included the dismissiveness of african american health complaints and the inequitable race-based or income-based hierarchy of patients 138 pilot data have shown that in comparison to white patients african american patients with covid-19 symptoms were six times less likely to receive testing or treatment 138 institutional and structural inequalities fueled by racism sexism and other forms of discrimination have impeded the ability of people of color to secure employment with livable wages healthcare access and insurance and an opportunity for upward mobility plus given the societal expectation that these groups and women in particular provide service and care this type of work has often been undervalued 139 women of color stand at the intersection of multiple oppressive identities and experience the amalgamated effects of racial ethnic and gender biases deep-rooted cultural attitudes and stereotypes about women of color have often devalued their work and deprioritized their needs 139 this has been historically and contemporaneously shown through wage disparities as an example for every dollar earned by full-time year-round working white men hispanic women earn 54 cents and african american women earn 62 cents while white women earn 79 cents 139140 the social distancing industry disruptions have greatly exacerbated the preexisting economic fragility of these women as essential workers many women of color have employment in healthcare or the service industry that places them on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic table 1 139141 although an overwhelming percentage of these women work as housekeeping cleaners 60 nursing assistants 50 and personal care aids 46 women of color also disproportionately work in several industries that have also been hit hardest by pandemic related job losses 139141 women of color and all women comprise 24 54 and 30 80 of the accommodationsfood services and healthcaresocial assistance industries respectively the two hardest hit industries of unemployment as reported by the us department of labor 139142the impact of social distancing is not just limited to economic and social inequalities geographic disparities of covid-19 cases and mortality have been just as alarming compared to other states the first case of covid-19 was not reported in louisiana until march 9 2020 yet as of june 21 2020 with more than 49497 confirmed cases and 3104 deaths louisiana ranked 7th in mortality rate 67 deaths per 100000 people 7783143 these geographic variations do not necessary function exclusively as regional or spatial imbalances but these variations are a manifestation of the residential segregation practices that have been and are still currently held in the united states 144 overwhelmingly at one point 70 of louisianas covid-19 deaths were african american despite this racial group comprising only 32 of the states population 7783145146 although african americans 54 still maintain the highest percentage of covid-19 deaths in louisiana the current racial breakdown of deaths are 44 white 62 of louisiana population 2 latinx 5 of louisiana population and 08 asian 16 of louisiana population 147 since the majority of deaths in louisiana are african americans the intersection of race or racism with this covid-19 epidemiological trend seems to be a strongly suggestive hypothesis of inequality especially since similar trends have been identified throughout the united states including illinois michigan north carolina wisconsin and even in the nations capital washington dc 148149150151 while the exact cause for this racial disproportionality in covid-19 cases and mortality has yet to be uncovered the effect of underlying racial health disparities namely kidney disease asthma diabetes mellitus and obesity that are also risk factors for covid-19 needs to be closely examined 152153154155 the notion that economic and social disparities create and perpetuate health disparities cannot be ignored as discussed previously institutional and structural inequalities have played a significant role in the social determinants of health or the conditions of birth growth living learning working playing and aging for african americans for example several african americans as well as other communities of color tend to live in food transit or recreational deserts more polluted and densely impoverished areas and have been raising children in single-parent households 156157158159160161 these social determinants of health have contributed to poorer covid-19 outcomes additionally many african americans reside in areas where people have been unable to effectively social distance such as prisons and homeless shelters 162 finally systemic racism as a barrier to healthcare treatment for african americans was present well before the coronavirus pandemic research has shown that african americans rate health-related information they receive from family members and churches more highly due to an overarching sense of medical establishment distrust stemming from historical injustices eg tuskegee syphilis experiment among this population 163164165166167 unfortunately this has impeded access to medical care and magnified existing health disparitiesthe coronavirus pandemic has also endangered communities of color through other very recognizable routes of discrimination in early april 2020 the cdc took at 180 degree turn and instructed the use of cloth face coverings such as bandanas without considering the implications of gang affiliation violence or racial profiling 168169 this created a sense of anxiety among communities of color which was not unfounded specifically african american men have been racially profiled when wearing surgical masks in an effort to reduce their covid-19 risk or have expressed a level of psychological distress due to the fear of being racially profiled 170171 a released video showed two african american men with facemask being followed in a walmart store by a police officer in wood river illinois although this incident occurred in march 2020 prior to the cdc face covering recommendation all individuals throughout the country were well within their rights to use self-protecting efforts to reduce their covid-19 risk african americans have not been the only targeted community of color there has been an increase of anti-asian discrimination because of the origination of covid-19 in wuhan china 172 the federal bureau of investigation reported that asian americans were experiencing increased hate crimes due to the coronavirus global outbreak 173 in midland texas three asian american family members including a 2-year-old baby and 6-year-old child were stabbed at a sams club store and the suspect indicated that he attacked the family because he thought the family was chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus 174 also in new york city teenagers attacked a 51-year-old woman on a city bus spewed anti-asian statements and accused her of causing the coronavirus while another 13-year-old allegedly kicked a 59-year-old man for the same racist motives in a separate incident 174 even in the midst of these remarkable times hatred and bigotry have continued to reign in the united statesepidemics are a category of disease that seem to hold up the mirror to human beings as to who we really are that is to say they obviously have everything to do with our relationship to our mortality to death to our lives they show the moral relationships that we have toward each other as people and were seeing that today 86 while there are distinct similarities and differences when comparing the 1918 and 2019 pandemics the historical accounts of the influenza pandemic and the current coronavirus pandemic have demonstrate that poverty inequality and social determinants of health create and support the conditions for disease transmission and the exacerbation of existing health conditions and disparities table 2 175 interestingly the public health response to both pandemics albeit tempered by varying levels of political resistance impacted human behavior through mandated social distancing or the use of face masks however unlike the influenza pandemic widespread daily protests and demonstrations within at least 140 american cities and throughout the world completely eclipsed and overshadowed public health orders for social distancing and public gathering prohibition during the coronavirus pandemic 176177 these protests rallied against the systemic police brutality of african americans specifically the killing of george floyd by minneapolis police and in support of the black lives matter movement 176177 this unique moment in history has illustrated the convergence of two public health crises 1 coronavirus pandemic 2 african american genocide both of which are impacted by the annihilation of institutional structural systematic and systemic racism within the united states as a new normal for post covid-19 is reimagined the fundamental dynamics and entrenched ideologies of acceptable living and equality for all need to be addressed and strongly reexamined in order for the country to move forwardsocial distancing and shelter-in-place orders have been in place throughout the country since approximately the middle of march 2020 this has bought the country some time to curb the spread of the virus limit the number of covid-19 cases and deaths reduce the healthcare system strain and allow a reflection for the preparation of the next phase 178 following the pandemic containment and mitigation phases the third suppression phase which allows for a slow emergence from the quarantine status requires essential elements in order to prevent an ascent of covid-19 infections 178 the elements include measurable benchmarks with surveilling epidemiological trends eg decline in covid-19 deaths for 14 days fortifying the healthcare system eg sufficient personal protective equipment for all healthcare workers and transforming public health infrastructure eg demonstrated ability to convey social distancing recommendations that change behavior in most residents 178179 once these elements have been implemented aspects of social distancing can be relaxed yet the old normal of living still cannot return and most likely will not return during the initial reopening of establishments gatherings should still be capped at 10 people and restaurants will need to adopt social distancing seating to welcome patrons however it is recommended by governmental and public health officials that individuals over 60 years of age and those who are medically vulnerable continue to shelter-in-place until the final phase of reopening 180 a staggered or partial reopening approach with new environmental safeguards such as temperature and ventilation checks and mandatory handwashingsanitizing at every entry and periodically throughout the day may be used for schools and businesses 179 there also may need to be a quarantine of travelers from high prevalence covid-19 areas governmental regulations may institute proof of immunity documentation or spending fourteen days in isolation before entering a new country for travelers beyond a successful initial reopening and after at least four weeks of no significant increase in new covid-19 cases the six feet social distancing measure may be paused but there should still be a ban on gatherings which exceed 50 people until four months after the initial reopening 179 throughout these phase transitions it is critical for all public health leaders political administrators and the overall general public to work together in order to control mitigate and eradicate covid-19 as stated by secretary-general antnio guterres of the united nations the coronavirus pandemic is a public health emergency that became an economic social and human rights crisis specifically by working together and respecting human rights in this time of crisis more effective and inclusive solutions for the emergency of today and the recovery for tomorrow can be achieved 181even with a new kind of normalcy everyone may still practice consistent and better hygiene with handwashing coughing and sneezing and greet and interact with each other differently 178 people may need to create new ways of meeting with friends and colleagues impressively within the past couple of decades the sharing economy has expanded and created environments with new components of how multiple people share the same spaces these shared spaces including co-work environments eg wework rooms in homes eg airbnb cars eg uber bikes eg capital bikeshare and other elements of the built environment which can increase the potential and opportunities for environmentally mediated pathways of pathogen exposure will need to be reexamined 182 the coronavirus pandemic also may accelerate the development of risk-mitigating efforts designed to reduce human-to-human interactions upgrade building ventilation and physical barriers and adopt automation technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence vision systems 183 given the severity of the pandemic and in compliance with social distancing directives many american cities significantly reduced public transit service as mentioned previously while agencies like the chicago transit authority implemented sanitation regimes to minimize the spread of the covid-19 many transit agencies may move to a new standard where face masks will always be required once anyone boards a train or bus 99 while social distancing measures prompted organizations to embrace videoconferencing virtual classrooms and telemedicine these types of interactions may become more of the norm moving forward with the fear of contagion companies have shifted their protocols of operation prior to the coronavirus pandemic many businesses were already abandoning cash payments and in the wake of the outbreak many more may permanently switch to digital only paymentsstructural building modifications eg voice-activated elevators or environmental adjustments eg telework capabilities may be a much easier acclimatization for many americans in the wake of a post covid-19 existence yet changing perceptions attitudes and behaviors that have been deeply entrenched in the american way of living will be a much more challenging hill to climb issues surrounding injustices related to many social determinants of health are not new and this pandemic has just illuminated these issues the overwhelmingly disproportion covid-19 mortality rates of african americans only highlights the need to address longstanding inequalities racism in the united states has created inequality in access to healthcare housing wealth education and employment all of which are social determinants of health that can either promote or undermine ones health and longevity in order to move forward racism needs to be addressed and there needs to be new and tailored approaches to reach those who have been disadvantaged as well as the circumstances that have been generated through racist ideologies practices and politices for instance when louisiana initially launched drive-through testing an african american 90-year-old woman walked a mile in the heat to get tested 184 this demonstrated that this covid-19 testing site was not accessible to many individuals who do not have cars or who live in transit deserts or who cannot afford private transit upon learning this public health officials targeted zip codes with the highest rates of covid-19 reported deaths and deployed testing in those areas population-based testing and contact tracing during this pandemic has been vital in order to predict where to allocate resources control the spread of the virus and implement evidence-based interventions to high-risk areas however evidence-based interventions are only achievable when there are accurate data and evidence it was not until early april 2020 that the cdc began including race and ethnicity data in its morbidity and mortality weekly report 85 many states have yet to release demographic data on deaths while sars-cov-2 may be exploiting inequalities in the united states this virus similar to past as well as future pathogens does not discriminate by race or any other social construct that man has created if covid-19 is not contained in the most vulnerable populations it will continue to spread to all communities and alter the future of human existence
this pesky flus all over town and white and black and rich and poor are all included in its tour 185author unknownprose poem on the 1918 influenza pandemicfor thousands of years disease outbreaks have devastated societies and the 2019 coronavirus pandemic is no different as densely populated and urban environmental conditions shaped the 1918 influenza pandemic the experience of the current day coronavirus pandemic is quite similar while the influenza and coronavirus pandemics occurred nearly a century apart there is one similarity of these events that is undeniable the public health response to disease outbreaks has remained virtually unchanged with social distancing and face covering efforts unfortunately the role of human behaviors and social ideologies stemmed from the darker side of humanity on the effect and response to the coronavirus pandemic has also not progressed considerably this review has revealed how the american burden of inequalities and injustices as related to environments and human behavior significantly impacts morbidity and mortality rates among the most vulnerable communities as observed with the 1918 influenza pandemic the present-day coronavirus pandemic has revealed and exposed the many inequalities that inhabit the united states however an opportunity has been presented which can allow for improvements advancements and an overall social uplift of our society

in december 2019 wuhan in the hubei province of china announced an active epidemic of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus identified as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-212 over the next few weeks infections spread throughout china and elsewhere in the world34 chinese media clinical and science institutions have reacted swiftly such that the latest virus is identified and the viral genome sequence is shared quickly worldwide2 on january 30 2020 the world health organization who announced an outbreak of public health emergency of international concern pheic5on february 12 2020 who named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus5 a consortium of foreign experts collaborating with chinese colleagues of various specializations has sought to hold on this outbreak6 the first infected cases were associated with a food market in wuhan1 coronaviruses have enveloped positive sense single-stranded rna genome infecting humans and a wide range of animals they were for the first time characterized and cultured by tyrell and bynoe in 1966 from patients with flu and common cold7 they were known as coronaviruses based on their morphology as spherical virions with a central shell and surface projections identical to a solar corona latin corona means crown8 there are four separate subfamilies the alpha beta gamma and delta coronaviruses alpha and beta coronaviruses appear to come from mammals especially from bats whereas gamma and delta coronaviruses derive from pigs and birds9 the genome length ranges from 26kb to 32kb among the seven subtypes of coronavirus that may have the ability to infect humans the beta-coronavirus is considered the most dangerous this is the one that causes significant morbidity and mortality in humans sars-cov-2 virus belongs to the genus beta-coronavirus910the four main operational genes encodes for spike protein s nucleocapsid protein n membrane glycoprotein m and a small membrane protein sm with an additional membrane glycoprotein he occurring in the hcov-oc43 and hku1 beta-coronaviruses9 figure 1 presents the sars-cov-2 structure the virus sequence is 96 similar with a bat-related coronavirus throughout the entire genome10 according to who no specific medicine or antiviral was found to treat or prevent novel coronavirus until now11 it has been noted that chinese medication cm including oral administration of protective herbal formulae the usage of cm sachets and herbal medicine fumigations etc is typically used to deter and manage novice coronavirus in china when the epidemic begins1112 chinese herbal and traditional medicines were also used in 2003 to combat sars which was the most severe infectious disease epidemic in china before covid-191113preliminary studies show that this virus shares very high genome resemblance with 2002 bat-derived sars coronaviruses14 therefore this virus was initially named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov coronavirus is a rna based enveloped entity named for its 9-12 nm long surface spikes for solar corona presence15 the coronaviral genome enclosed in the envelope bears four main structural proteins including the spike protein s which binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor and then mediates a fusion between the envelope and the cell membranes in the host cell to enable the virus reach to host cell1617 on february 11 2020 focused on phylogeny taxonomy and defining procedure by the international committee for taxonomy of viruses a coronavirus study group officially classified it as a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-218 shortly who named the disease caused by this virus coronavirus disease 2019 covid-1919 according to the current evidence covid-19 could initially be transmitted by bats and could be transferred to humans by means of pangolins20 or other wildlife sold on the maritime market in huanan but later propagated by human to human transmission14  although other possibilities of transmission are not yet excludedthe first reported patients happened in december 201915 at the beginning morbidity was very low however in january 2020 it hit a turning point a significant rise in infected patients occurred in cities outside of hubei province during the second half of this month due to the movement of people before the chinese lunar new year22 after an exponential rise until january 23 2020 the infection traveled through countries and draws significant global interest the occurrence of human-to-human infection was reported in the clusters of affected family members and medical staff23 by contact droplets and fomite1024 so far there is no proof of intrauterine infection documented25who reported over 10000 cases of covid-19 infections across china in late january 202015 on 13 february 2020 13332 new cases were registered from hubei for the first time national health commission of china in its diagnosis and treatment program trial fifth version recommended chest ct diagnosis for clinical confirmation of infection in suspected cases15 by february 19 2020 overall reported cases were 74280 in china and 924 in other 24 countries with 2009 worldwide deaths23 on april 17 2020 a total of 2200358 infected cases were reported all over the world with 1494415 active cases and 705907 closed cases of the total active cases 1437938 96 were foundto have mild symptoms and 56477 4 were tagged as serious or critical cases among closed cases 558168 79 are recovered to their normal conditions and discharged while 147787 21 deaths occurred table 1 and figure 226the virus is believed to have incubation periods ranging between approximately 2-14 days time from infection to symptoms on the basis of the following sources1 incubation time for covid-19 between 2 and 10 days has been recorded by the who272 the chinese national health commission initially expected a 10 to 14 days incubation period283 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc from united states of america assumes the incubation period of 2 to 14 days for covid-19294 doctors and health-care practitioners of leading chinese group dxycn predicts an incubation period of 3 to 7 days and up to 14 daysin a report released on february 9 2020 the incubation time was observed as long as 24 days range from 0-24 days average of 3 days30 the who stated on february 10 2020 at its press conference that a very long duration of incubation can represent double exposure 24 days was a specified point to be regarded in the sense of the studys key results31 nevertheless more recently in a jama report released on february 21 2020 a 19-day incubation period in infected patient has been identified30 hubei province registered another case with an incubation time of 27 days on february 22 202032 the incubation time period has averaged 52 days however it greatly differs between the patients according to a chinese article reported by new england journal of medicine on january 30 202028 an analysis sponsored by the holland ministry of health and released by eurosurveillance examined data for 88 identified travelers to and from wuhan which were identified as covid-19 infected patients between january 20 and 28 2020 it was calculated that the mean incubation period was 64 days the incubation duration varied from 21 to 111 days the 111-day maximum limit may be known as conservative28 a comparison with other viruses can be found in table 2who director general dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said in his inaugural remarks at the covid-19 press briefing on march 3 2020 that there is a 34 mortality rate globally in comparison seasonal influenza normally kills fewer than 1 of affected individuals34 initially at a press conference on wednesday january 29 2020 and again on february 10 2020 the who listed 2 as a mortality rate estimation however on january 29 2020 who specified that this was a very early and provisional estimate that might have changed28 on february 20 out of 55924 laboratory reported cases were 2114 reported deaths with a case fatality rate of 3835 national health commission in china released on february 4 2020 the following figures361 mortality rate was found 4 in wuhan2 fatality rate in other provinces was 0163 mortality rate was 31 in the hubei province4 97 of the china total death by covid-19 were in the hubei province5 mortality rate nationwide was 21elderly patients with specific illnesses are considered at higher risk regardless of whether they have a coronavirus or not36 patients with heart disease high blood pressure or diabetes treated with ace2-increasing drugs may have a high risk for serious covid-19 infection37 a mortality rate comparison with other viruses is shown in table 3 while the covid-19 fatality rate by age sex and with comorbidity is shown in table 4 table 5 and table 6 respectivelytypically covid-19 triggers flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough these symptoms can develop into pneumonia chest strain chest pain and difficulty to breath in elderly people and other patients who have other chronic health conditions it looks like it begins with a fever and leads to dry coughing one week after infection the conditions become harsh and lead to breath shortening with approximately 20 of patients requiring hospital treatment and medication29 the covid-19 illness appears to seldom induce runny nose sneezing or sore throat only around 5 of patients have such symptoms painful throat sneezing and stuffy nose are typically symptoms of seasonal flu or cold3940 a few patients may develop pain or hemoptysis and many may also be completely asymptomatic2441 older people with comorbidity and serious alveolar injury are more prone to experience respiratory failure42 the onset of disease will demonstrate rapid progression to organ dysfunction eg acute kidney injury shock acute cardiac injury acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and death in severe cases41 sometime patients might develop lower or normal white blood cell count thrombocytopenia or lymphopenia with increased c-reactive protein level and extended activated thromboplastin time244142 80 of infected cases are found to be mild with normal fever and flu and the patients can recover at home in short a patient having upper respiratory tract symptoms and fever with leukopenia or lymphopenia should be suspected table 7 table 8 table 9administration of chloroquine against covid-19 is experimental therefore ethical trial approval is necessary and ethically justifiable as the best treatment available ie off-label additional information on chloroquines effects and usefulness for the treatment of covid-19 patients will soon be published due to its experimental use in the emerging outbreak due to the high number of patients infected and the lack of approved drugs timely release of this information may be critical the who confirms that there is currently no evidence from randomized control trials to warn about specific covid-19 drug treatments and that unlicensed therapies can only be performed in the sense of ethically-approved clinical trials or under strict supervision of the controlled emergency use of unregistered procedures system meuri meanwhile the recommendations for clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 infection is suspected59 the authors tend to agree with this viewpoint of who to view chloroquine as experimental the outbreak is not the perfect environment for doing so but even the use of chloroquine off-label can be followed by many concerns the first being the health of patients which should be followed by close supervision the ethical approach to off-label drug use also varies from country to country raising concerns regarding equity off-label drug use could cause severe medication shortages when needed for malaria since chloroquine remains a crucial medication in the treatment of malaria in many parts of the world60for the use of chloroquine phosphate an expert consensus was published on february 20 2020 by a multicenter collaboration group of the department of science and technology of guangdong province and health commission of guangdong province preliminary measures recommended by the panel include blood tests to rule out the risk of anemia thrombocytopenia or leukopenia as well as serum electrolyte abnormalities andor hepatic and renal function dysfunctions it is recommended to rule out the development of qt interval prolongation or bradycardia and to perform patient interviews to find out visual andor mental disturbance electrocardiography was routinely recommended and quinolones macrolides ondansetron as well as various antiarrhythmic antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs which prolong the qt interval should be avoided as recommended by the panel61remedsivir is an analogue of adenosine which incorporates into nascent viral rna chains resulting in pre-mature termination recently it was recognized as a potential antiviral medication against a broad variety of rna viruses including sars  mers-cov in cultivated cells mice and non-human primates nhp models62-64 the ec90 value of remdesivir in vero e6 cells against sars-cov-2 was 176 m indicating that its working concentration is likely to be attained in nhp models the remdesivir has also effectively inhibited virus infection in a human cell line huh-7 cells of human liver cancer that is susceptible to sars-cov-265 animal experiments showed that remdesivir can significantly reduce the viral load of mers-cov in the lung tissue of infected mice enhance lung function and minimize pathological damage to the lung tissue66on february 15 2020 in china favipiravir was approved for the treatment of the 2019 novel influenza currently this drug undergoes clinical trials to treat covid-19 favipiravir is an inhibitor of a new type of rna-dependent polymerase rna rdrp67 the value of favipiravir ec50 in vero e6 cells cells used in the novel coronavirus study was as high as 67 m although more in vivo research is required to test this antiviral nucleoside it has also been shown to be 100 effective in protecting mice from the ebola virus68 preliminary results from a total of 80 patients including the experimental group and the control group have shown that favipiravir has a more potent antiviral effect than lopinavir  ritonavir43convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies are suggested therapies for the treatment of covid-19 patients convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins are used as a last resort to improve the survival rate of patients with sars whose condition continued to deteriorate after pulsed methylprednisolone therapy69 in addition some studies found a shorter hospital stay and lower mortality in patients treated with convalescent plasma70 further probability includes leronlimab a humanized monoclonal antibody ccr5 antagonist and a nucleoside rna polymerase inhibitor galidesivir both of which have shown survival benefits in many deadly virus infections and are considered potential useful candidates for treatment7172lopinavir and ritonavir are both hiv protease inhibitors that suppress the cleavage of a polyprotein into multiple functional proteins at the rajavithi hospital in thailand the infectious disease team used a combination of oseltamivir anti-influenza agent and lopinavirritonavir to successfully improve the status of patients with severe conditions73
76 baricitinib as suggested antiviral against sars-cov-2
baricitinib used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is an inhibitor of aak1 and janus kinase and is recommended to control viral replication74 machine learning models predicted that ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 drugs that disrupt these proteins can inhibit viral entry into the target cells75 the use of baricitinib in susceptible covid-19-associated patients with ongoing pneumonia should be taken with strict caution76clinical trials presently focus on the efficacy of different drugs such as immunoglobulins arbidol hydrochloride combined with interferon atomization ritonavir plus oseltamivir asc09f plus oseltamivir mesenchymal stem cell treatment lopinavir plus ritonavir hydroxychloroquine darunavir plus cobicistat methylprednisolone and washed microbiota transplantation6577 repurposing these available drugs for immediate use in treatment of sars-cov-2 infections could improve the available clinical management78 study of xiaoling xu et al suggests that tocilizumab is an important therapy in serious covid-19 patients which offered a new therapeutic approach to this deadly infectious disease79the virus sars-cov-2 is a fatal disease having a high mortality rate with a total of 2200358 certified cases and 147787 deaths recorded all over the world to date there is no efficacious proven medicinal therapy a committee of us experts has developed treatment guidelines for covid-19 patients which are regularly updated80a model drug chloroquine proposed by who could potentially work against the novel coronavirus remdesvir a nucleoside analogue it also holds promise for the use in treating covid-19 patients there are additional proposed drugs against covid-19 such as drugs approved by fda for the treatment of other pathologies including ribavirin penciclovir nitazoxanide nafamostat chloroquine and two well-known drugs having broad spectrum activity ie remdesivir gs5734 and favipiravir t-705 leronlimab a humanised monoclonal antibody ccr5 antagonist arbidol hydrochloride combined with interferon atomisation lopinavir plus ritonavir ritonavir plus oseltamivir asc09f plus oseltamivir mesenchymal stem cell treatment could also be a choice for the treatment of covid-19 patients lopinavir and ritonavir are both hiv protease inhibitors that suppress the cleavage of a polyprotein into multiple functional proteins based on historical records and human reports of sars and prevention of h1n1 influenza chinese herbal formula may be an effective solution to covid-19 prevention in high-risk populations although their usefulness in the clinic for this purpose still has to be demonstrated in short sars-cov-2 is a highly transmissible virus and clinical trials are required for finding and confirming promising drug candidates and effective vaccinesin the past two decades the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 have taken severe death tolls worldwide with 916 and 800 deaths respectively1 in late 2019 another virus with lethal respiratory infection potential identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 emerged and heralded another global pandemic2 since the outbreak in wuhan more than 200 countries and regions have reported confirmed cases the who coined covid-19 to describe coronavirus disease 2019 and declared this outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern3 as of 24 april 2020 there have been nearly 2 750 000 infections and over 192 000 deaths worldwidewithin less than 6 months covid-19 has registered a mortality record that is higher than that of sars and mers combined4 5 because of the overwhelming fatality cases caused by covid-19 much concern has been raised to determine the risk factors for poor prognosis such as advanced age and male sex3 6 previous research has reported that patients with underlying cardiovascular disease cvd were prone to viral infection and also had a greater risk of developing severe cases and being admitted to intensive care unit7 8 sars-cov-2 can attack the respiratory system by targeting ace2 however with the high tissue-specificity of ace2 expression in the cardiovascular system cardiomyocytes may be particularly prone to damage9 several studies have reported a high incidence of elevated cardiac troponin in hospitalised patients especially in those in critical conditions10 11 thus patients with cvd complications may have poor prognosis when infected with sars-cov-2 therefore here we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the available evidence to evaluate the association between underlying cvd and incident cardiac injury with in-hospital mortality risk in patients with covid-19a comprehensive search was performed in pubmed embase and web of science databases from 1 january 2020 to 14 april 2020 the following search terms were included coronavirus covid-19 2019-ncov sars-cov-2 cardiovascular disease coronary heart disease hypertension cardiac injury myocardia injury mortality death and fatality in addition the reference lists of relevant articles were reviewed for potential studiesstudies were included for the meta-analysis if they met the following criteria 1 exposure factor cvd coronary heart disease cardiac disease and chronic cardiac disease hypertension or acute cardiac injury 2 outcome interest in-hospital mortality and 3 study population adult patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection to avoid duplication we contacted the authors whose studies were conducted in the same

due to the limited data on multivariable adjusted outcomes the heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by cochrans q-statistic and i2 test if i2 50 a fixed effects model was adopted otherwise a random effects model was applied to meta-analysis meta-regression analysis was performed to test the potential sources of heterogeneity among studies sensitivity analyses were also performed by omitting one study at a time to evaluate the influence of individual study on the pooled results publication bias was evaluated by visual inspection of asymmetry in funnel plotspatients or the public

the main characteristics of the included studies are summarised in table 1 of all 10 studies two were case series design15 16 and the remaining eight were cohort studies1724 all studies were conducted in wuhan china except for one study that enrolled patients nationwide17 the patients were all accrued from the end of december 2019 to february 2020 the mean age ranged from 49 years old17 to 6819 years old and the proportion of male patients ranged from 4522 to 6721 the prevalence of cvd and hypertension ranged from 417 to 1518 and from 1717 to 4419 respectively and from 1524 to 4415 of patients experienced cardiac injury during hospitalisation table 2eight studies1517 19 2124 reported the relationship between underlying cvd and in-hospital mortality risk 2515 patients and 127 deaths in unadjusted model five studies1517 23 24 consistently revealed a significantly higher death risk in the cvd group and the remaining three studies19 21 22 reported no significant relationship between cvd and in-hospital mortality figure 2 overall the summary estimate demonstrated that patients with cvd had an approximately fivefold higher risk of mortality compared with non-cvd patients unadjusted or 485 p0001 95 ci 306 to 770 the heterogeneity across the studies was non-significant i2293 p0194seven studies1517 2224 2463 patients and 535 deaths were included for the pre-existing hypertension and in-hospital mortality analysis with unadjusted ors six studies1517 2224 reported a significantly higher mortality risk in patients with previous hypertension and the remaining study19 showed no significant association figure 3 the pooled unadjusted effect of hypertension on mortality risk was 367 95 ci 231 to 583 p0001 with moderate heterogeneity i2574 p0029for cardiac injury all eight studies15 16 1821 23 24 1429 patients and 374 deaths except one21 reported that acute cardiac injury was significantly associated with a high mortality risk in unadjusted model figure 4 the pooled effect of these studies unadjusted or 2115 95 ci 1019 to 4394 p0001 heterogeneity i2705 p0001 showed that patients with elevated troponin levels had a significant higher mortality risk than those with normal troponin levelsvisual inspection of the funnel plots did not show significant asymmetry online supplementary file 2 sensitivity analyses were conducted by systematically excluding one study at a time and the results remained consistent with the primary analyses online supplementary file 3 to explore potential sources of heterogeneity meta-regression was applied to test the influence of study design sample size mean age and male proportion none of these factors contributed significantly to the observed heterogeneity online supplementary file 4our study evaluated the impact of underlying cvd hypertension and acute cardiac injury on in-hospital mortality in patients with covid-19 our results showed a positive association between previous cvd and hypertension with fatal outcomes with unadjusted ors and 95 cis of 485 306 to 770 and 367 231 to 583 and a significant relationship between acute cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality unadjusted or 2115 95 ci 1019 to 4394the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov is a single-strand rna virus that shares several similarities with sars-cov and mers-cov in genetic sequencing and clinical presentation but is equipped with a more robust capacity for human-to-human transmission25 26 from the outset the capacity of 2019-ncov to spread and infect people in wuhan china was alarming and the infection has rippled throughout the rest of the world causing severe morbidity and mortality27 therefore there is a pressing need to identify risk factors for poor prognosis among patients with covid-19patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were found to be more vulnerable to coronavirus infection and may have poor prognoses4 previous meta-analyses systematically tested the relationship between cvd and severity of the disease but with non-uniform definitions of clinical outcome28 29 the meta-analysis by zuin et al
30 included three studies and reported a positive association between hypertension and mortality risk in patients with covid-19 our study reinforced their conclusion and found that patients with cvd history also had an almost fivefold higher risk of mortality comparing with non-cvd patients however since our results were obtained using unadjusted ors the exact role of cvd in the risk stratification of patients with covid-19 is still undetermined there may be several mechanisms that account for the high mortality risk of covid-19 patients with cvd history first patients with underlying cvd are more likely to decline into an unstable haemodynamic status when infected with 2019-ncov31 severe pneumonia places a considerable workload on cardiac ventricles which may exacerbate pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction even causing cardiogenic shock4 second inflammatory reactions caused by 2019-ncov infection might convert chronic coronary artery disease into acute coronary syndrome32 33 a profound systemic inflammation wave along with local inflammatory infiltration may lead to a hypercoagulative state and atherosclerotic plaque rupture which may culminate in thrombotic events23 third the priority of treatments in favour of limiting nosocomial viral transmission while neglecting other medical issues might predispose cvd patients to unfavourable clinical outcomes the current interim guidelines suggest that patients with st-segment elevation myocardial infarction should consider thrombolysis first in the covid-19 era34 severe adverse effects such as cerebral haemorrhage and insufficient and undesignated coronary revascularisation caused by thrombolysis can increase the risk of deathacute cardiac injury is commonly recorded in patients with covid-1935 the incidence of cardiac injury among our enrolled studies ranged from 15 to 44 which was higher than the prevalence of cvd 515 this suggested that 2019-ncov might attack cardiomyocytes through different pathways other than exacerbating the already compromised cardiovascular system 2019-ncov infection may lead to cardiac injury secondary to conditions causing oxygen supplement insufficiency such as severe pneumonia anaemia hypotension and bradycardia furthermore by attacking myocardium via the highly expressed ace2 directly 2019-ncov precipitated the release of cytokine and chemokine waves and caused myocardial inflammation even leading to fulminant myocarditis in severe cases31 36 meanwhile our results complied with guo et al18 who reported that the death risk of cardiac injury was much higher than that of pre-existing cvd their study revealed that patients with copresence of cvd and cardiac injury registered the highest mortality rate of 694 while those with only underlying cvd had a relatively favourable prognosis mortality rate of 133 furthermore elevated troponin was reported to be associated with a high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome hepatic dysfunction and acute renal injury in patients with covid-1918 37 the study by shi et al
20 demonstrated that elevated troponin was an independent risk factor for death after adjusting other confounders20 thus this index may be considered as a biomarker to predict the mortality risk of patients with covid-19 more studies are warranted to confirm this finding and provide probable suggestions on the risk stratification of patients with covid-19to the best of our knowledge our study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association of underlying cvd and acute cardiac injury with mortality risk in patients with covid-19 this meta-analysis may provide insights into the prognosis stratification of patients with covid-19 however there are some important limitations that should be mentioned first our meta-analysis was conducted on unadjusted ors due to the limited data on multivariable-adjusted outcomes the observed association of cvd and cardiac injury with mortality might be confounded by other risk factors such as advanced age and cofounder adjustment may distort our meta-analysis results towards a less significant risk thus large cohort studies with multivariate analysis are needed to provide more evidence on this issue second our study could not determine the causal effects of cardiovascular comorbidities on mortality due to the inherent limitations of observational studies future studies aiming to investigate this causal association are warranted third the heterogeneity among studies for cardiac injury was significantly high which may be caused by the study design and patient inclusion criteria however the meta-regression exploring the potential sources did not find significant results and the results remained consistent in sensitivity analyses finally most of the studies enrolled were conducted in wuhan china therefore these results should be treated with caution when extrapolated to other populations since wuhan was the initial epicentre of the outbreak these early evidence may provide clinical implications and insights for researchers and clinicians in other parts of the worldcovid-19 patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities including cvd and hypertension may face a greater risk of fatal outcomes acute cardiac injury may act as a marker of in-hospital mortality risk given the unadjusted results of our meta-analysis future well-designed studies with multivariate analysis are warranted to confirm these findingsthe coronavirus disease covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in december 2019 and has rapidly spread worldwide 1 globally the onslaught of the covid-19 outbreak on the public health system continues despite unprecedented mobilization the mortality of critical ill patients with covid-19 has been reported variously as low as 11 and as high as 61 2 3 4 5 bhatraju et al 5 reported that the ratio of patients with covid-19 over 65 years of age had died greater than patients less than 65 years of age in a 43 patients study saurabh aggarwal et al reported three patients aged 70 years or older died 6in critically ill covid-19 patients early medical intervention to reduce mortality depended on early effective assessment 7 the application of scoring systems can facilitate effective evaluation by emergency or critical care physicians to screen severe patients at present however there are no specific scoring systems for the evaluation of covid-19 patients another option is to adopt existing scoring systems that are used for predicting the mortality of severe patientsscoring systems such as the sequential organ failure assessment sofa and the more recent quick sequential organ failure assessment qsofa can help emergency or critical care physicians for prognosis and predicting mortality the sofa scoring system was developed in 1996 by an international group of experts 8 sofa describes the condition of multiple organ dysfunction through several parameters including the oxygenation index arterial oxygen tension pao2fraction of inspiration oxygen fio2 mean arterial pressure glasgow coma scalegcs creatinine or urine volume bilirubin and platelets for the respiratory circulatory neurologic renal hepatogenic and coagulation systems respectively the function of each organ systems is scored from 0 to 4 and the individual sofa scores are then summed to a total score that is between 0 and 24 a higher score infers aggravating conditions in the patients although sofa was not initially designed to predict mortality several studies revealed that the sofa score could predict morbidity and mortality and this specific application has been validated in severely ill patients 9 10 11 12 13therefore it is of interest to determine whether the sofa score could predict mortality in the covid-19 populationthe qsofa score was introduced in the third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock sepsis-3 and is composed of three clinical parameters systolic blood pressure  100 mmhg respiratory rate  22 breathsmin and altered mental status the qsofa score was created initially for the evaluation of septic patients but several recent studies have described its effectiveness for predicting mortality in patients with different diseases 1415both sofa and qsofa have widespread application to screen patients with life-threatening conditions in the emergency or critical care department 16 several studies 17 18 19 have suggested that the sofa and qsofa were high-performance assessments to evaluate the risk of mortality in critically ill patients these scoring systems can assist emergency or critical care physicians to predict mortality of such patients especially in resource-constrained scenariosthe covid-19 epidemic is a scenario of shortage of medical resources however to our knowledge no study has validated the performance of sofa and qsofa for severelycritically ill covid-19 patients this study was conducted with an aim to evaluate the prognostic value of sofa and qsofa models with regard to the in-hospital mortality of covid-19 patientsthis study was undertaken through a retrospective analysis of electronic medical records of patients managed by an emergency medical team that was deployed to wuhan the team independently managed the covid-19 ward in a local hospital that was temporarily constructed for covid-19 patients and comprised 80 bedsthe diagnosis and treatment plan of novel coronavirus 20 issued by the national health commission of china was adopted as a criterion for the diagnosis classification and treatment of covid patients in the covid-19 wardwe searched for all adult patients age  18 years who had been diagnosed with severecritical covid-19 and admitted to the ward between january 31 2020 and march 7 2020 through the computerized registration system of the ward the criterion of severecritical covid-19 is followed the diagnosis and treatment plan of novel coronavirus which can be download in

covid-19 patients is paramount to ensure early medical monitoring and interventions for these patients thus an important task of the emergency or critical care physicians is to screen patients with increased mortality from among the severely or critically ill covid-19 patients 23 however this task has become particularly difficult due to the shortage of medical resources after the covid-19 outbreak 24 a scoring system can help emergency and critical care physicians to more quickly and accurately identify patients with increased mortality each scoring system has their own advantages and disadvantages the sofa score with higher accuracy has been widely validated as a tool for this purpose across a range of healthcare settings and environments 25 however sofa is complex and time-consuming because it needs six parameters and four of them are from laboratory results while the superiorities of qsofa are simple rapid and practical but some studies suggests that qsofa has a low sensitive for in-hospital mortality in hospitalized patients with suspected infection 26 in the absence of a specific risk-scoring system for covid-19 we studied the performance of the sofa and qsofa in the evaluation of severely or critically ill patients in order to identify an effective risk-scoring system for covid-19 patientsto our knowledge this is the first research to evaluate the performance of the sofa and qsofa in predicting the mortality risk of severely ill covid-19 patients this retrospective study has investigated the performance of both sofa and qsofa scores as predictors of prognosis in severely or critically ill covid-19 patients initially we determined that a sofa score of 3 and a qsofa score of 1 were associated with mortality in severely ill covid-19 patients furthermore the study showed that the sofa score is a highly sensitive marker of in-hospital mortality in covid-19 patients and is prognostically superior to qsofa in this settingin our analysis the sofa illustrated acceptable predictive performance for in-hospital mortality on roc curve analysis in both overall and subgroup analysis at the time of admission a sofa score  3 was highly predictive of spontaneous survival in covid-19 patients the high npv in overall analysis of 9780 for sofa functions as a gate keeper by accurately identifying low-risk patientsthe greater predictive advantage of the sofa is attributable to the higher number of clinical parameters and inclusion of six important variables in the scoring system which facilitated more accurate patient stratification on univariate analysis we found that five mean arterial pressure platelets count bilirubin creatinine pao2 and fio2 of the six variables of the sofa differed significantly between survivors and non-survivors similar findings have been reported by other observational studies mo et al reported 27 that severely ill patients had a lower platelet count in a meta-analysis conducted by lippi and colleagues 28 low platelet counts were associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with covid-19 zhang et al 29 reported that a higher bilirubin level and lower oxygenation index were observed in severely or critically ill covid-19 patients furthermore higher serum creatinine levels at admission were a predictive factor of disease severity in their patients the pathogenic mechanisms underlying changes in the abovementioned clinical indicators in covid-19 patients need to be further studied although these indicators can be perceived at the very least as predictive factors of the mortality risk in critically ill patients 30the aucs of qsofa of both overall and subgroup analysis were lower than that of sofa therefore we considered the accuracy of sofa to be higher the prerequisite parameters for sofa can be determined through medical assessment and laboratory examination nevertheless there is a need to recognize that as qsofa is simple fast and acceptable accuracy it can be used in the emergency room or at admission if the parameters of the sofa cannot be acquired in timethis novel study explored the effectiveness of the sofa and qsofa scoring systems for predicting mortality risk of severely or critically ill covid-19 patients and ascertained their practical value in identifying severely or critically ill covid-19 patients with a higher mortality risk however some limitations of this study need to be considered this study is limited by the small sample size studies with a larger number of severely or critically ill covid-19 patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria would enable a more effective evaluation of the sofa and qsofa scoring systems this was a single-center study and may have been affected by a selection bias with regard to the study population multicenter studies are required to prospectively validate the clinical utility of the sofa and qsofa scores in severely or critically ill covid-19 patients moreover the prognostic value of the scoring systems among patient subgroups that were stratified by gender groups or underlying diseases was not analyzed owing to the limited sample size furthermore because of the limited availability of information details of out-of-hospital therapy and nursing care were not captured finally there are several risk-scoring tools such as the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation scoring systems that find widespread application in the critical care unit and emergency departments however in this retrospective study based on medical records the information that could be collected could only permit a calculation of sofa and qsofa scores future studies are needed to comparatively explore the performance of other scoring systems in the covid-19 patient populationthe sofa scoring systems at admission have high classification performance in predicting the mortality risk of severely or critically ill covid-19 patients and have acceptable npv for screening these patients the performance in predicting such patients of qsofa is accepted but inferior to that of sofanone

sijia liu ni yao yanruqiu and chengqi he declared there are no conflicts of interestdata on confirmed cases and deaths of covid19 were compiled and released by the center for systems science and engineering csse at johns hopkins university which compiled data collated by the us centers for disease control  prevention cdc from individual states and local health agencies we used countylevel data for 2814 us counties that had at least one case of infection as of may 1 2020 the data for new york city includes its 5 boroughs or counties manhattan bronx kings queens and richmond which were provided as a single unit in the original data set numbers of cases and deaths for kansas city missouri and jackson county home to kansas city were reported separately in the original data but were consolidated as one county we excluded cases that were assigned at the state level but were not affiliated with a specific county we calculated incidence rates and death rates per 100000 for each county and metropolitan area using the 2018 population data from the us census bureauin order to examine spatial disparities between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties we used urbanrural continuum locale codes from the us department of agriculture usda

 briefly the usda codes are based on the size of a countys urban population and its location relative to metropolitan areas of different sizes counties located inside metropolitan statistical areas msas are divided into 3 subcategories counties in the largest msas 1 million population or more are assigned a locality of 1 counties with populations between 250000 and 1 million a locality of 2 and those with populations smaller than 250000 a locality of 3 counties located outside any metropolitan area are assigned a subcategory ranging from 4 to 9 depending on the size of its urban population and whether it is adjacent to a metro area among the 2814 counties nearly 90 of all counties in the united states that have reported data on covid19 infections and deaths 431 are in large msas 370 in mediumsized msas 346 in small msas and 1667 are nonmetropolitan or rural counties additionally the census bureau classifies metropolitan counties into 2 subcategories central or urban counties and outlying or suburban counties these subcategories help to differentiate urban and suburban communities within metropolitan areasto investigate the spatial variations of covid19 cases and deaths we performed multiple regression analyses using a subset of the original data1624 counties with 16 or more casesas recommended by cdc in order to mitigate the analytical problems caused by counties with a small number of cases and to preserve the anonymity of cases
31
 confirmed cases and deaths for each county were used as the dependent variables respectively we used data on countylevel social vulnerability indices in 2018 created by the cdc as independent variables these indices included the percent of population aged 65 the percent of the population in poverty the percent minority and percent uninsured population density was considered the primary predictor since more densely populated communities make it easier for infections to spread indeed this is the rationale for the public health intervention of social distancing
32
 because older individuals have a higher prevalence of preexisting chronic illnesses and are more vulnerable to symptomatic infections we included the percent of the population aged 65 and above
33
 in light of welldocumented health disparities between rich and poor and between whites and minorities eg blacks hispanics native americans we hypothesized that the poverty level and the percentage of minority population would be positively correlated with disease burden
34
 
35
 
36
 
37
 however an assessment of the number of infections and deaths of covid19 is largely dependent on the availability of testing
38
 we therefore included the percent of the population being tested at the state level as testing data were not available at the county leveladditionally we conducted sensitivity analyses using a smaller sample that comprised only 688 rural counties and including population density as the only independent variable in regression analysis to explore whether population density is a helpful predictor or not because most rural areas are sparsely populated in the united states it was expected that population density would be less effective in predicting the variations of coronavirus infections and deaths across rural communitieswe excluded 7445 cases less than 1 of the total that were not affiliated with a specific county the covid19 pandemic has affected 90 or 2814 of us counties in all 50 states and washington dc among which large cities and their associated metropolitan areas have been affected the most new york city the nations largest city 2018 population of 84 million in its 5 boroughs recorded 167478 confirmed cases representing 157 of the nations total infections the new york metropolitan area which comprises 25 counties that span new york new jersey and pennsylvania 2018 population of 20 million accounts for nearly 37 or 394259 confirmed cases of the nations infections table 1 after the new york metro other metropolitan areas including chicago boston philadelphia detroit los angeles washington dc miami new orleans and atlanta are among the top 10 in terms of number of confirmed incident cases the top 10 metropolitan areas represent nearly 61 of all confirmed cases of covid19 in the united stateslarge metropolitan areas also have the highest number of coronavirus fatalities table 1 with 29373 deaths the new york msa accounts for nearly 47 of the total deaths nationwide followed by other msas including detroit boston chicago philadelphia los angeles washington dc and new orleans it is noteworthy that detroit and new orleans have become the second and eighth largest hotspots despite their population rankings which are considerably lower the 14th and 24th largest msas los angeles and chicago the second and third largest metropolitan areas on the contrary ranked lower in terms of both infections and deaths than their corresponding populations would suggestmore than 943 of all confirmed cases 1061223 of 1068668 as of may 1 and 963 of all deaths 62295 out of 62698 were recorded in 1447 metropolitan counties usda locale codes 13 table 2 in other words 56 59940 of all infections and 37 2333 of deaths were recorded in 1667 nonmetropolitan or rural counties usda locale codes 49 metropolitan counties especially those located in large msas with populations more than 1 million had the highest rates of infection and death rates rural or nonmetropolitan counties in general had the lowest rates for both infection and mortality especially in nonmetro counties with populations less than 19999 and not adjacent to any msa ie locales 7 and 9 figure 1 however it is noteworthy that some counties that are completely rural andor those adjacent to msas but with urban populations less than 2500 ie locale 8 had an average infection rate nearly as high as that in small msa counties ie locale 3 likewise nonmetro counties with urban population between 2500 and 19999 and adjacent to msas ie locale 6 had an average mortality rate just below large and medium msa countieswithin metropolitan areas central or urban counties had much higher incidence and mortality rates than outlying or suburban counties figure 2 in summary urban counties had the highest levels rural counties the lowest levels and suburban counties intermediate levels of incident and fatal covid19 casesmapping incidence and mortality rates at a more granular scale for example individual counties that are the building blocks of metropolitan areas allows us to visualize more detailed patterns of covid19 figures 3 and 4 as noted above it is not surprising that the highest infection rates are in large cities and their associated metropolitan areas especially the northeast corridor that stretches from boston to washington dc the midwest ie detroit and chicago and new orleans in addition to large metropolitan areas small metropolitan areas and rural counties that are far away from major cities including southwest georgia northeast arizona and northwest new mexico that spans a large portion of the navajo nation westcentral colorado and southcentral idaho show surprisingly high rates of confirmed cases an inspection of the top 25 counties with the highest infection rates shows that 3 counties are in small msas and 11 counties are rural or nonmetro see table 3 lincoln county arkansas an outlying county population 13695 in 2018 in the small pine bluff msa had the highest infection rate ie 59438 per 100000 population nearly 3 times larger than that in new york city ranked 22 with an incidence rate of 19835 per 100000 population thus several small metro areas and some rural areas are notable exceptions to the generalization that covid19 cases are limited to large metropolitan areasan examination of covid19 mortality rates underscores the observation that small metropolitan areas and some nonmetropolitan counties are disproportionately affected table 4 for example the secondhighest death rate in the nation after the new york msa is in the albany metropolis a small msa in southwest georgia population 153101 among the top 25 msas 8 are small metropolitan areas with populations less than 250000 including albany ga grand island ne houmathibodaux la farmington nm east stroudsburg pa lewiston idwa saginaw mi and flagstaff az msas of albany ga and grand island ne also rank second and third in infection rate among all metropolitan areasthe county with the highest mortality rate 2681 deaths per 100000 is randolph ga population 7087 a rural county near the alabama border table 5 among the top 25 in mortality rates 2 georgia counties dougherty and terrell are located in the albany ga metropolitan area eleven 11 are classified as rural nonmetropolitan counties that are scattered in a number of states including georgia clay early mitchell randolph turner wilcox counties indiana decatur county kansas coffey county louisiana bienville county montana toole county and oklahoma greer countyresults of regression models for covid19 incident cases are presented in table 6 as expected the variables population density percent population aged 65 and percent population tested for covid19 showed statistically significant and positive correlations with confirmed cases of covid19 population density is the strongest predictor of the variations of infections among counties and explains 43 of the variations of infections the impact of testing rates is understandable and substantiates epidemiologists call for expanding testing to control the spread of coronavirus poverty and percent minority population were not significant and showed negative correlations with incidence rates one possible explanation is that this reflects the likelihood that poverty and minority populations are factors that lead individuals to be untested the percent uninsured population showed a positive sign but was not statistically significant which could have also been affected by shortages of testing overall the regression model explained nearly half of the variation in incidence rates 45 of covid19 across 1624 counties multicollinearity was not a significant factor among the independent variables included in the model as the variance inflation factor vif values for each independent variable were as low as 2 data not shownresults of a sensitivity analysis found that when only rural counties were used population density became insignificant b  0100 std error  0072 for infections and the model explained less than 1 of the variations of infections adjusted r square  0001 this finding indicates that population density is less likely to be a risk factor for rural counties because rural areas in general have much lower population densities in comparison to their metropolitan counterpartsthe results of regression model using covid19 deaths as the dependent variable are similar to those observed in the model for confirmed cases population density remained the strongest predictor of covid19 mortality rates the variables percent older population and poverty both showed expected significant and positive associations with covid19 deaths this is consistent with the hypothesis that the elderly and the poor are at greater risks of covid19 deaths the percent of the minority population was significant but negative one possible explanation is that the data on coronavirus deaths are not disaggregated by race or ethnicity and whites were the majority in the death tolls for most counties percent of the uninsured population was positive but was not significant which could be a result of underestimates or undercounting of covid19 induced fatalities especially for those disadvantaged communities ie inner cities or remote rural communities the regression model explains 39 of the variations of covid19 across 1624 counties results from a sensitivity analysis using rural counties only and regressing mortality against population density alone were similar to the findings for infectionsthis article analyzes countrywide data from the ongoing covid19 pandemic with a focus on spatial disparities among metropolitan and nonmetropolitan communities as the covid19 epidemic in most areas of the us continues to mount these findings must be considered an interim appraisal more definitive conclusions can only be reached once the epidemic has abated and when other relevant data some not presently available are included however several notable trends are apparent large densely populated cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas are the hotspots of the covid19 pandemic both in terms of incidence and mortality in general the larger metropolitan areas including both urban and suburban areas have higher incidence and mortality rates than smaller and nonmetropolitan areas however as of may 1 nonmetropolitan areas that span 1667 counties in the united states have amassed nearly 6 or 60000 of confirmed cases and 4 or over 2300 of deaths from covid19 it is striking that the infection rates in some small metropolitan areas eg albany ga pine bluff ar grand island ne and numerous rural counties eg bledsoe tn nobles mn and marion oh ranked very high nationally likewise the mortality rates in some small metropolitan areas eg albany ga grant island ne houmathibodaux la and farmington nm and nonmetropolitan counties eg randolph early and mitchell counties in southwest georgia and toole county in montana actually exceed those of the larger cities the complete explanation for this paradox is not apparent but likely involves chance or local factors that become important in smaller communities for example the high rates in albany georgia have been traced to the presence of an infected individual at 2 funerals that were highly attended
39
 the introduction of an infected individual thus can have a disproportionate effect on disease rates when the population is relatively small but densely aggregated additionally it is likely that the limited health care facilities of small cities and rural communities are a critical bottleneck to access to services many rural areas tend to have higher poverty rates and much older populations with a higher prevalence of comorbidities these populations may be more vulnerable to symptomatic and more serious courses of disease than other populations
40

regression analyses support the hypotheses of correlations between covid19 infections and deaths and the selected socioeconomic contextual factors including population density proportions of elderly residents poverty and testing at the state level it is reasonable to suggest that densely populated areas and communities that are aging povertystricken and lack testing are more at risk of covid19 moreover results from the sensitivity analyses corroborate that population density is a more effective predictor of covid19 infections and mortality for metropolitan areas not for rural areas the unexpected results for other socioeconomic risk factors including proportion of minority and uninsured population are largely due to the use of disaggregated data undertesting or underreporting despite this weakness our findings corroborate anecdotal observations and empirical research that highlight the vulnerability of those disadvantaged communities
11
 
38
 our findings about the geographic heterogeneity and sociodemographic correlates of the covid19 outbreak can inform policy and government efforts to address the uneven distribution of covid19 cases across demographic groups and geographic areas
38
 given the fact of implementations of nationwide lockdown and social distancing practices the pandemic may be showing signs of receding in large metropolitan areas but it is predicted to continue to diffuse from cities to small places and rural communities these findings support the provision of additional testing facilities and services including mobile health clinics and telehealth services to help the rural communities that have been underserved and undertested during this pandemic
41
 
42
 
43

it is important to note that these data are subject to several methodological limitations including the ecologic nature of the analysis and biases that are related to the under and sometimes over ascertainment of cases first the primary data in this spatial study are counties not individuals thus we cannot validly conclude for example that because counties with a high prevalence of population aged 65 or above have higher mortality rates that individuals who are 65 or older will do so furthermore due to the unavailability of disaggregated data our findings were based on analysis of total counts of infections and deaths in each county prohibiting us from identifying disparities between demographic groups eg gender age or raceethnicity within the population
44
 it would obviously be valuable to conduct more indepth analysis using individuallevel data to examine racialethnic disparities in infection and mortality rates if data on racialethnic breakdowns are released by health agencies at later stages our focus in this early analysis is to identify regions with geographic disparities in order to probe the underlying causes behind these thus the ecologic approach is a valid and appropriate first step in this processascertainment bias is another important potential limitation the incidence rate obviously depends on the frequency of testing shortages of testing equipment remain a critical problem for both disease control and epidemiological analysis therefore low prevalence rates in many areas especially sparsely populated rural counties are likely artifacts of lower rates of testing as validated by the positive association of infections and testing rate at the state level in our regression analysis
38
 thus underascertainment should disproportionately reflect poorer more rural counties whose true prevalence rates will likely be higher than recorded conversely the data are also susceptible to inflation of mortality rates that can occur when individuals who are ill from etiologically unrelated diseases succumb to these diseases while they are infected in large metropolitan areas such as new york city thousands of individuals may die each day due to noncoronavirus causes such as lung cancer cardiovascular disease etc in many individuals the coronavirus infection doubtlessly exacerbated their preexisting illness and in this way causally contributed to their deaths however deaths from these underlying causes in the presence of a positive covid19 serological test is likely to be recorded as a coronavirus death even if the contribution of the virus to death was modest that is some deaths that under nonpandemic circumstances would be attributable to noncoronavirus causes likely will be counted as deaths due to coronavirus the actual autopsy rate in the present health crisis is expected to be exceptionally low this type of ascertainment bias likely would have complex and different effects in rural than in metropolitan areas for example in rural areas a lower rate of testing would fail to identify some decedents as coronavirus cases and likely would lead to an underestimate of the effect of the virus on mortalityin summary our analysis found that covid19 infections and deaths are not surprisingly highly concentrated in large cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas however equivalently high rates were found in small cities and nonmetropolitan or rural communities communities with high proportions of elder populations high poverty rates and high population density are found at high risk of covid19 moreover the magnitude of infections and deaths is positively associated with testing rates at the state level which supports expanding testing capacities to undertested areas especially rural communities to stem the spread of the virus these findings are subject to ascertainment biases and should be considered provisional guides to the geography and underlying risk factors of the pandemic in the united statesin 1972 a veterinary surgeon in england oldham 1972 wrote a letter to the editor of pig farming supplement entitled how it all began he described the appearance of a new disease on some english swine farms characterized by acute watery diarrhea in feeder pigs fatteners and sows while suckling pigs were not affected the syndrome was called too standing for the other one or also tge2 and both these denominations referred to its clinical similarity to tge a common cause of viral diarrhea in pigs in europe at that time an important difference with tge was however that neonatal pigs were not affected since these denominations were considered unsatisfactory from a scientific point of view the name of the new syndrome was quickly changed to epidemic diarrhea-edthe first ed outbreak occurred on a farm in the spring of 1971 and the second 6 months later at a distance of 2 miles from the former suckling piglets were not affected but pigs of 10 weeks and older and also adults showed an acute diarrhea lasting one week the outbreak lasted 34 weeks on the farm during the autumn of 1971 and also the following winter several new outbreaks were reported a clinical diagnosis and possibility for differentiation from tge was thus based on the high morbidity in fatteners and adult animals in the absence of disease in neonatal and freshly weaned pigs in most of these diarrheal cases tgev was excluded by laboratory examination the fact that ed was observed on farms with a recent history of a tge outbreak and thus in tgev immune animals increased the conviction that tgev was not involved during 1972 ed spread rapidly between pig farms particulary fattening herds mortality was rare and the effect of an outbreak was estimated at about 2 weeks feed costa similar disease pattern was observed during the early seventies in belgium and a rapid spread occurred to neighbouring countries in western europe here also suckling pigs were not affected and remained free of diarrhea even when their mothers suffered from a watery diarrhea during several days some neonatal pig mortality could occur by starvation because the sick mothers often suffered from agalactiaan additional sign observed in belgium and later also reported in gemany but not mentioned in england was that some fatteners were found dead particularly towards the end of the fattening period and this occurred repeatedly in some farms but not in others a mortality rate as high as 3 could be encountered this was not due to dehydration accompanying the diarrhea but animals suddenly died from acute back muscle necrosis while the clinical link with an ed infection was clear the pathogenetic background has never been revealed belgian pigs were highly stress positive at that time and a severe belly ache often observed in adult animals during an outbreak of ed may have been a triggerin general as no baby pig mortality occurred due to the ed agent not very much attention was given to this new diarrheal syndrome and the etiology was not intensively investigated however it was assumed that a viral agent was involved since bacteriological examination of faecal material did not reveal a specific bacterial cause none of the known porcine viruses could be associated and a new virus was therefore suspectedmuch changed in 1976 when wood 1977 from the veterinary investigation centre in norwich england described a new diarrheic syndrome it differed from ed in that it now affected pigs of all ages including neonatal and suckling pigs mortality was variable restricted to young piglets and averaged around 30 this new disease now resembled tge more closely than ed did but tgev was again excluded using direct immunofluorescence on intestines and applying established serological techniques available for detection of anti-tgev antibodies now a differentiation with tge on a clinical basis only became difficult often impossible this new syndrome was called ed2 to differentiate it from the 1971 ed1 where no baby pigs were involved ed2 was economically much more important than ed1ed2 also quickly spread to the european continent and was recognised in belgium in 1977 reports from other countries including the netherlands germany france bulgaria hungary and switzerland followed soon in belgium mortality rates in neonates on breeding farms varied considerably they could be as high as 80 large variation from 30 to 80 and the average was 50 variation in mortality in neonatal pigs was litter bound not explained at that time but also farm bound where it appeared to be associated with farm size still many small family farms at that time farm structure one or several farrowing units number of neonatal pig litters present at the start of the outbreak number of pregnant sows due to farrow within one week of the appearance of disease signs and possibly other factors differences in virulence of virus isolates was not given any attentionthis new evolution to ed2 with the involvement of baby pigs and its larger economic impact yielded better opportunities for collecting material for etiological studies for experimental reproduction of the disease and for the development of virological and serological techniques in 1978 chasey and cartwright 1978 reported the detection of virus like particles and pensaert and debouck 1978 described the isolation of a new coronavirus-like agent cvla from diarrheic pigs with both research groups succeeding in reproducing diarrhea in experimental pigs soon after the isolation of this new coronavirus extensive pathogenesis studies were performed in colostrum deprived pigs with one of the belgian isolates designated coronavirus cv777 isolated in month 7 of 1977 which became the prototype strain for pedv in europe debouck and pensaert 1980 debouck et al 1981 ed2 was soon named porcine epidemic diarrhea ped caused by ped virus pedv a denomination which still stands at presentfrom the early studies with pedv in neonates debouck and pensaert 1980 debouck et al 1981 it was soon clear that the pathogenesis resembled very much that of tgev experience gathered from research with tgev helped much in the approach to study this new enteric disease lack of success to cultivate the virus in cell cultures forced to produce clean virus stocks by oral inoculation of colostrum deprived pigs performing surgery 18 h later and rinsing the in vivo produced virus from the lumen of the infected small intestines during 12 h while keeping the pig in the incubator debouck and pensaert 1980 such clean pig adapted virus stocks served for experimental pig inoculation experiments and to produce an hyperimmune serum for the preparation of a conjugate for an immunofluorescence if conjugate to detect the virus in tissues serological tests were developed to detect antibodies by elisa callebaut et al 1982 and to study possible relationship with other coronaviruses by immuno-electron microscopy pensaert et al 1981 genome analysis of the ped isolates was not available at that timeby immuno-electron microscopy and if pedv was not related to any of the known porcine coronaviruses tgev haemagglutinating encephalo-myelitis virus pensaert et al 1981 some discrete relationship with members of the genus alpha-coronavirus was later demonstrated using other and more sensitive tests the origin of pedv was thus unknown and no potential parent coronavirus could be indicatedan elisa test was soon used for routine serology callebaut et al 1982 a crucial question was whether or not the ed1 agent and ed2pedv were related or whether ed2pedv was totally new infectious material containing the ed1 agent from earlier outbreaks was not available a retrospective serological survey was carried out on sow sera that had been collected in slaughterhouses in belgium starting in 1969 and thus prior to the emergence of ed1 in 1972 on the european continent antibodies to pedv were not found in sera collected in 1969 but were present in 7 of the sows collected in 1971 in 42 of the sows in 1975 and in 32 of the sows in 1980 these results indicated that the coronavirus ped had been responsible for first ed1 outbreaks for the ed2 outbreaks and thus it can be accepted that pedv emerged in 1971 but later widened its host tropism from growing and adult swine towards neonatal pigs this finding was interesting from an evolutionary point of viewthus pedv that presumably started as a cause of diarrhea in 1971 in feeders fatteners and adult swine had suddenly acquired tropism for neonatal pigs and now became a rather devastating disease but even after the emergence of ed2pedv some outbreaks on breeding-finishing farms still did not involve neonatal pigs while it was assumed that both ed1 and pedv were co-circulating in the swine population it is also possible that some farms had experienced an earlier ed1 infection and that immune sows protected their offspring against pedv by lactogenic immunity while groups of fattening pigs had become susceptible it must however be mentioned that cross-protection between ed1 and pedv has never been studied also after a first epidemic phase of the new pedv the virus often persisted on breeding-finishing farms in weaned and feeder pigs endemic ped the sow population was immune protecting its offspring while feeder pigs became susceptible after loosing their maternal protection the highly variable and mixed clinical picture was at that time ascribed to the possible co-circulation of the original ed1 agent and its presumed variant pedv in the population genome analysis was not available and ed1 infectious material is also now no longer available to retrospectively examine this issueed2pedv is likely a variant of ed1 that variants of pedv relatively easy emerge is not unusual as animal coronaviruses are known to easily undergo genetic alterationsrecombination and insertions and deletions have repeatedly been demonstrated in pedv by genome analyses of isolates during more recent outbreaks in asia and in the usa fan et al 2012 li et al 2016 jarvis et al 2016 vlasova et al 2014 oka et al 2014even now 2016 in recent cases of ped in europe varying types of clinical manifestations either with or without affection of neonatal pigs are observed see laterthe question on the origin of pedv and thus of its presumed ancestor ed1 agent in 1971 is unanswered there are no indications for a possible evolution from another known so called parental coronavirus even after comparative studies with the known coronaviruses using detailed genome analyses of different genes including the s gene so far only discrete antigenic relationship involving the n protein but without any cross protection was detected with some of the other animal members of the genus alphacoronavirus such as feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv tgev porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv canine coronavirus ccov and mink coronavirus mcv by the use of monoclonal antibodies to the n proteins of the human alphacoronaviruses nl63 and 229e no cross reactivity was detected with pedv sastre et al 2011 the only alphacoronavirus in which also the m proteins cross reacts with pedv is mcv have et al 1992the nucleotide sequence of the pedv nucleocapsid gene and of typical coronavirus motifs show that pedv within the region of the genome sequenced shows indeed greatest homology to the human 229e tgev prcv fipv ccov and feline enteric coronavirus fecv bridgen et al 1993 it is interesting to mention that similar to pedv several of the other alphacoronaviruses including the human 229e tgev prcv ccov fecv and fipv use the cellular receptor aminopeptidase n apn for virus entry into cells in their host weiss and navas-martin 2005 and this seems to be a common evolutionary characteristic still the genetic and antigenic diversity between pedv and the other alphacoronaviruses is very largealso no cross-reactivity has been reported between pedv and the coronaviruses belonging to the beta gamma or delta generathe genomic data presented above and the use of the same cellular receptor suggest a common origin of some of some of these alphacoronaviruses a carrier-wild animal species as source of the virus as often described with other coronaviruses cannot be excludedsoon after its detection experimental studies in neonatal pigs revealed that target cells of pedv were limited to the epithelium covering the intestinal villi and the pathogenesis was thus highly similar to that of tgev debouck and pensaert 1980 debouck et al 1981 cv777 virus infection in the villous enterocytes in neonatal pigs caused rapid cell desquamation throughout the small intestine within 2436 h after inoculation which was somewhat slower than observed with tgev still the villous atrophy induced by pedv was so abrupt and extensive that rapid and severe dehydration occurred leading to death in neonatal pigs due to this similarity in pathogenesis with tgev much of the scientific knowledge acquired on tge diagnosis immunity prevention could be almost invariably applied to ped an apparent difference with tgev probably of minor importance from a clinical point of view was that epithelial cells on colonic villi were also infected but desquamation was not observed still now it is a question if this colonic site of replication contributes to disease severity ped diarrhea in fatteners and sows is often accompanied by an apparent belly ache a clinical sign not seen with tge and the question arises if the colon infection may contribute to this clinical manifestationresults of pathogenesis studies obtained in caesarean derived colostrum deprived neonatal pigs upon inoculation with the european prototype strain cv777 of the seventies were practically identical to those observed more recently in asia and in the usa epidemics with the so-called original us pedv strains jung et al 2014 stevenson et al 2013 kim and chae 2003a point of debate in the pedv evolution particularly since its occurrence in asia and its emergence the usa is the arising of pedv genetic variants influencing virulence the history in europe here presented allows to assume that ed2pedv was a variant of ed1 which had acquired tropism for intestinal enterocytes in neonatal pigs this new tropism expanded and increased the virus virulence since a vulnerable age became affected and piglets mortality became an important economic aspect of the disease currently two major pedv variants are described in the usa upon routine genome analyses of usa isolates the first also called original us pedv  appears to be highly virulent while the second the so called s-indel strains standing for insertions and deletions in the s gene of the virus are associated with milder clinical outbreaks similar genotypic variants have been detected in asia the s-indels already before 2010 and the highly virulent since 2010 when adopting this genomic identification it appears that cv777 is classified as a s-indel isolate apparently belonging to a different cluster compared to the us indels carvajal et al 2015 considering the pathogenesis and virulence of the european prototype strain cv777 of the seventies as evaluated by the sites and degree of replication and the degree of villous atrophy no real difference exists with the more recent highly virulent original us pedv isolates from the usa for example the pig adapted c777 when experimentally inoculated in neonatal piglets caused villous atrophy with villous length reduction from the normal value of 700900 m to as low as 200300 m throughout the small intestine and within 636 h after the start of the diarrhea debouck et al 1981 coussement et al 1982much depends on how virulence of pedv is determined if virulence of a pedv isolate is considered merely from the point of view of virus-neonatal pig interaction with parameters such as duration of incubation period rapidity and severity of enterocyte desquamation degree and extent of atrophy of villi production of virulent virus quantities and severity of diarrhea then cv777 can be classified as highly virulent despite its identification with s-indel isolatesthat s-indels isolates do not systematically mean low virulence was recently shown in a us study chun-ming et al 2015 in which 4 litters of 34 days old suckling pigs were inoculated with the s-indel iowa 106 strain in the presence of their ped negative mothers the severity of clinical signs and the mortality of the pigs varied between the 4 liters from 0 to 75 severe clinical signs were observed in 2 of the 4 litters two of the 4 sows developed diarrhea it was observed that despite similar background of sows and environment in this experiment the severity of disease was rather variable it appeared that the pigs body weight at birth and the sows health conditions and lactation were influential factors in the same experiment mentioned above chun-ming et al 2015 one litter was also inoculated with an original us pedv strain of high virulence it was concluded that virulence of the s-indel isolate was generally lower based on the longer incubation period the shorter duration of diarrhea more limited regions of virus infection overall lower pig mortality 18 vs 55 for original and some other additional parametersthe sites and extent of the deletions or insertions and the seqence differences in the s gene may play an important role in a recent publication chen et al 2016 the pathogenicity differences between 3 uspedv prototype strains and a s-indel-variant stain were compared in conventional neonatal pigs under experimental infections and enteric disease as evidenced by clinical signsfecal virus shedding gross and histopathological intestinal lesions were significantly lower for the s-indel strainhoweverthe molecular basis for the virulence differences were not elucidatedsince the early beginning in europe it was clear that ped disease can show much variability even in different litters of pigs particularly when suckling their mother such differences and the high variation in pig mortality in different litters from 30 to 80 was an observation also made in the seventies in europe when the first epidemic occurred and the reason was never unravelledeven more variability is experienced when virulence and severity of ped disease is related to the interaction virus-farm population and thus in field outbreaks the result of a ped outbreak will be much more difficult to predict to evaluate and to define since next to possible virulence differences of the isolates and next to variation among litters in suckling pigs many additional factors play a role in determining the clinical outcome of the infection they include immune status of sows dose of virus exposure on the farm herd size and pig farming management and others all of which may be interacting in a different way moreover the procedures applied for intentional infection feed back of the sow population to speed up the induction of immunity to be passively transfered to the litter could be considered as a potential cause of worsening of the clinical status of the suckling pigs in fact that practice can also be a source of other pathogens for giltssows andor for newborn piglets it is thus possible that particularly in a fully susceptible pig population and even with pedv strains of similar virulence the mortality rates and losses are much higher in some continents or regions or farms with extensive and highly industrialised pig farming the overall health status of the population apparently also plays an important rolewhile genomic changes surely will occur in ped virus isolates it is advised to be careful when associating them with virulence changes when a different clinical picture is observed on farms it is often too hastily concluded that variants with varying virulence have arisen based on genome analysis only and without testing for virulence factors in experimental pigswhile genome analysis is certainly useful and may be directional repeated comparative animal inoculation experiments with so called new isolates clinically denominated as candidate virulence-variants need to be carried out in a standardized way before solid conclusions about virulence are made this is indicated by the large variations very often observed with one and the same isolate the neonatal non suckling pig preferably colostrum deprived is reliable and even essential for this purpose parameters as duration of incubation period a timewise follow up of site and degree of villous affection in the small intestine are needed and must be repeated before calling a pedv isolate a variant with impact on virulence it should be stressed that pig adapted virus strains should be used as it is known that major genomic modifications can arise when pedv is cell culture passaged as well in porcine as in non-porcine cells such as in vero cellsthe epidemiology of ped in europe has been and still is quite puzzling pedv outbreaks in the late seventies and early eighties occurred both on breeding and fattening swine farms acute outbreaks with neonatal pig mortality were encountered in the breeding-fattening farms which became infected for the first time pedv often became endemic in farrowing-finishing farms successive groups of pigs became infected upon weaning and after losing their lactogenic protection from their immune mothers so that the virus could persist whether the virus persisted or not after the original outbreak was somewhat unpredictable as it could also disappear from the farm the farm size number of sows and its structure number of units played a role also ped persistence regularly occurred in fattening farms using the system of continuous introduction of feeder pigs originating from numerous and different breeders a typical case of persistent diarrhea caused by pedv lasting 10 months on a breeding-finishing farm was described in the netherlands pijpers et al1993 and this was a feature regularly observed in europe in the eighties recent experience in the usa 20132015 has shown that management practices adopted in the epidemic phase of the infection can turn ped to a endemicenzootic and long lasting form jung and saif 2015pedv infections were a regular cause associated with viral diarrheal picture in weaned and feeder pigs in a serological study in belgium in 1986 pedv was associated with diarrhea in 13 out of 16 groups of feeder pigs after arrival in fattening farms callebaut et al 1986but the virus remained prevalent in the swine populations of western europe during the eighties a serosurvey in belgian sows using sera collected in slaughterhouses and thus mostly originating from different farms showed pedv antibodies 32 in 1980 and 19 in 1984 similar percentages of sows were positive in germany on 3 regional locations france spain the netherlands and bulgaria while no antibodies were found in scandinavia northern ireland usa or australia debouck et al 1982 in 1982 antibodies were detected in sera received from taiwan the first evidence of the presence of pedv in asiaas the eighties advanced fewer outbreaks on breeding farms were seen even though the virus was still detected but the general economic impact of ped had become lower in belgium in 1992 17 groups of feeder pigs from 15 commercial finishing herds using the all in-all out production system were examined for serocoversion to pedv and tgev none of the groups seroconverted to tgev while 7 seroconverted to pedv with diarrhea observed in all 7 van reeth and pensaert 1994 in an hungarian study published in 1996 55 of 92 faecal samples from weaned pigs with diarrhea tested positively for pedv nagy et al 1996during the nineties an acute ped outbreak which was described in spain involving a fattening unit of 5000 pigs with diarrhea starting in 79 weeks old pigs in one barn affecting pigs from 20 to 90 kg and subsequently spreading to the other barns carvajal et al 1995 an isolated outbreak was described in 1998 in england in a large finishing herd where weaners were brought in over a 2 month period and positive sows were found in the breeding herds supplying the weaners pritchard et al 1999 but no further epidemic of ped occurred despite a very low pedv seroprevalence as only 19 of fatteners from 64 different finishing units were positive for antibodies to pedvmay 1996january 1997interest from a disease and economic point of view became very low in europe and no further research was performed on ped practically no serosurveys were carried out a serological survey in sows from farrow to finish herds carried out in belgium in 1996 revealed that gilts were positive for pedv antibodies in only 2 of the 144 considered farms and in 1997 72 fattening farms were examined for pev antibodies and none were positive pensaert unpublishedit appeared that pedv except for a focal case was disappearing from the european swine population towards the turn of the century for this reason no attention or follow up was given anymore to this viral infection while its field of interest had fully moved to asiahowever a somewhat atypical ped outbreak occurred unexpectedly in the po valley in northern italy in 2006 martelli et al 2008 it occurred between may 2005 and june 2006 in an area densely populated with pigs the outbreak started with four cases occurring in fattening farms from may to july no clinical cases were detected during august and september in october two new cases appeared the first in a fattening unit and the second in the nursery of a three-site production unit the disease spread during the winter of 20052006 affecting more than 60 farms including fattening units as well as farrow-to-finish or farrow-to-weaner farms some pedv positive farms were still detected between mid-2006 and the end of 2007 but the disease progressively disappeared sozzi et al 2014 from 20082014 only sporadic outbreaks were observed in grower and finisher herds efsa 2014 this epidemic in italy in 20062007 inclined us to forecast a new episode of ped epidemics in europe but it did not occurrecently and due to an increased attention following the 2013 epidemic in the usa single or limited ped outbreaks have sporadically been diagnosed in europe one case in ukraine dastjerdi et al 2015 occurred in a 5000-sow farm 240 farrowings a week and mortality in pigs less than 10 days old approached 100 the virus was closely related to original us strains reported form north america sequence identity of 998isolates from other cases reported from belgium theuns et al 2015 holland van der wolf et al 2015 france grasland et al 2015 germany stadler et al 2015 hanke et al 2015 and portugal mesquita et al 2015 and italy alborali et al 2014 were on the basis of genetic sequence closely related to each other when sequenced they were classified as s-indel strains and the german isolate showed 994 identity to the oh851 strain isolated in the usa in january 2014 vlasova et al 2014 the size and clinical disease in these outbreaks were very variable the outbreak involved in belgium 1 fattening farm no mortality in france 1 farrow to finish farm mortality 12 in pigs at one week and 25 at weaning in germany 4 farms 2 fattening with 15 and 2 mortality 2 breeding with 70 and no mortality respectively and in portugal where it started in one farm with pig mortality but not further defined and where the virus spread to 43 other pig farms during a period of 3 months from these data it can be seen that again there was much and unexplained variation in ped clinical disease and outcome except for the possibility of the outbreak in ukraine it is very doubtful that the other european isolates have anything to do with those involved in the us epidemic similar focal cases must have occurred in europe before the us outbreak but were most likely neither recognized nor diagnosed nor reported as ped s-indel strains have been present in europe as cv777 appears to be the earliest known representative carvajal et al 2015it is remarkable that in many european countries no large epidemic occurred despite several indications that the breeding population in their densely populated swine raising regions is negative for antibodies to pedv and thus presumably fully susceptibleit is difficult to understand why a virus such as pedv has gradually regressed in the swine population in europe in the absence of any special control measures vaccination has not been applied and no control programmes have been installed the puzzling aspect is that during the last decennia pedv was and still is focally present in europe and did not cause an epidemic despite the high numbers of susceptible-seronegative farms and despite the very dense swine populations in some regionsone would expect that a virus such as pedv which replicates to very high titers in swine and which can easily and rapidly spread from one swine farm to another would be able to maintain itself in the swine population as previously explained once an outbreak has occurred on a breeding farm pedv virus could persist easily when successive litters of pigs after losing their lactogenic protection at weaning become a susceptible target for infection in fact persistence for a virus such as pedv would be almost as a natural feature similar to the endemic character observed with other porcine enzootic enteric viruses such as swine rotaviruses swine enteroviruses and others tgev cannot serve as an example here because in europe it has largely been eliminated from the swine population due to the emergence in the early eighties of the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv prcv is a tgev deletion mutant which has acquired respiratory tropism and shows an epidemiological advantage of rapid aerogenic spreading while causing a protective immunity to tgev endemic prcv has thus replaced tgev in europeit would be interesting to study the mechanisms behind the regressionwaning of pedv in europe could it be that the virus has a non swine ancestor which has temporarily become adapted to swine but which is not really swine-borne such evolution would not be unique for animal coronaviruses could it be that the virus can maintain itself in the population only when present at a sufficient high dose allowing it to continue the infection chain but once reaching a low level quantityeg on a farm basis is not longer able to do so the waning of pedv has apparently not occurred in parts of asia within its 23 decennia of presence on that continent to the same degree as it did in europe and it will be intriguing to closely follow the epidemiological course and evolution of pedv in the usa once the epidemic phase has passedcoronavirus disease-19 covid-19 is the disease caused by 2019-ncovsars-cov-2

we demonstrated that in patients diagnosed with covid-19 d-dimer elevation upon admission was common and was associated with both increased disease severity and in-hospital mortality d-dimers are one of the fragments produced when plasmin cleaves fibrin to break down clots the assays are routinely used as part of a diagnostic algorithm to exclude the diagnosis of thrombosis however any pathologic or non-pathologic process that increases fibrin production or breakdown also increases plasma d-dimer levels 13 examples include deep vein thrombosispulmonary embolism arterial thrombosis disseminated intravascular coagulation and conditions such as pregnancy inflammation cancer chronic liver diseases post trauma and surgery status and vasculitis among adults admitted to the emergency room infections instead of vtepe are the most common reason for d-dimer elevation 14 in the present study no patient had confirmed pedvt which supports the application of d-dimer in covid-19 not just as a diagnostic tool for thromboembolism in addition only three patients in the elevated d-dimer group 3185 16 with d-dimer levels of 428 mgl 890 mgl and 710 mgl had isth-dic scores of  5 which is laboratory evidence compatible with overt dic thus the majority of the included patients with d-dimer elevation in our study did not have overt dic due to the retrospective nature of the study and small number of patients with isth-dic score consistent with overt dic it is difficult to tell from our data if d-dimer elevation is related with dicseveral studies have shown that d-dimer levels are associated with severity of community-acquired pneumonia and clinical outcome 7 15 however d-dimer has not been used as a biomarker for viral pneumonia 16 17 though d-dimer elevation has been observed in articles describing the clinical features of covid-19 whether the level of d-dimer is a marker of severity has not been examinedin the present study there is a significant correlation between d-dimer levels and disease severity stratified by the area of affected lungs on chest ct oxygenation index as well as clinical staging according to the interim guideline in addition a higher percentage of d-dimer elevation was seen in the present study than previously reported 2 5 this may be due to the higher percentage of severecritically ill cases referred to our hospital which is another demonstration of the correlation between d-dimer level and disease severity this suggests that the assay may be used early as a marker of severity before chest ct scans or as a complement to ct and clinical stagingin-hospital mortality was also associated with increased d-dimer levels suggesting that the assay may be used as a single useful biomarker for clinical outcome in patients with covid-19 zhou et al reported that d-dimer  1 gml is a risk for mortality 6 the study objective design population and statistical analysis of zhous study and those of ours are different zhous study was a retrospective cohort study to describe risk factors for mortality and clinical course which included patients who had been discharged or had died by january 31 2020 the mortality rate was higher compared to that in our study 283 vs 69 to explore risk factor for mortality zhou et al chose age coronary heart disease sofa score lymphocyte and d-dimer as variables for multivariable logistic regression model d-dimer was defined as a categorical variable in the analysis and levels of  05 gl  05 to  1 gl and  1 gl were chosen the laboratory method for d-dimer assay was not described in the present case control study we focused on the predictive value of d-dimer for in-hospital deaths using receiver operating characteristic analysis in the analysis d-dimer is defined as a continuous variable testing used immunoturbidimetric assay with reference range of 0050 mgl sysmex cs5100 despite the differences in study design and analysis the findings and conclusions of the two studies are not inconsistent zhou et al concluded that the potential risk factors of older age high sofa score and d-dimer greater than 1 gl instead of levels of  05 gl or  05 to  1 gl could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis we found that when using the cutoff value of 214 d-dimer levels upon admission for in-hospital mortality has an auc of 0846 the sensitivity and specificity are 882 and 713 respectively the findings of this present study suggest that an elevated d-dimer level on admission  214 mgl may identify patients at higher risk for in-hospital mortality and therefore inform physicians about suitable candidates for intensive care and early interventionit is worth noting that the findings suggest associations between d-dimer levels and disease severity and mortality only evidence is still lacking as to the causal mechanisms and whether the associations are specific effects of sars-cov-2 infection or are consequences of systemic inflammatory response in sars-cov-2 infection dysregulation of coagulationanti-coagulation cascades results in worsening lung pathology 18 in influenza the pathogenesis by augmenting viral replication and immune pathogenesis can be attributed to an aberrant coagulation system including both the cellular and protein components 19 the pathological features of covid-19 include diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation pulmonary edema with hyaline membrane formation and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates dominated by lymphocytes which greatly resemble those seen in sars and mers coronavirus infection 20 21 presumably the observed d-dimer elevation signify a hyperfibrinolysis state and increased inflammatory burden induced in sars-cov-2 infection in our logistic regression model to estimate risk factors associated with mortality systematic anticoagulation therapy was not significantly associated with reduced risk of mortality however in a recent observational study including 2773 hospitalized covid-19 patients paranjpe et al found that treatment dose anticoagulant was associated with a reduced risk of mortality especially among patients who required mechanical ventilation 22 and longer duration of treatment was associated with a reduced risk of mortality adjusted hr of 086 per day 95 ci 082089 p  0001 whether anticoagulation therapy confers a survival benefit in patients hospitalized for covid-19 needs further research with prospective randomized trials currently the potential benefits need to be weighed against risk of bleedingthis study has some limitations first the current study was done in a single center the overall mortality 69 was lower compared with that reported in other studies done in wuhan 2 6 and considerably higher than those reported by other provinces 5 23 further researches may be needed when extrapolated to wider patient population second the study is retrospective in nature the patients included were not systematically assessed for the presence of pedvt but only when clinically suspected third we did not look into the value of serial d-dimer monitoring in assessing covid-19 patientsin conclusion d-dimer levels are commonly elevated in patients infected with sars-cov-2 significantly higher levels are found in those with critical illness and may be used as a prognostic marker for in-hospital mortalitycoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a current pandemic disease caused by the positive-sense rna virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 along with the highly infectious capacity of the virus the mortality rates have been reported to range from 1 to 51 it has been reported that patients with covid-19 and hypertension may have an increased risk for adverse outcomes in unadjusted epidemiological studies summarizing the characteristics of the covid-19 epidemic in china despite limited sample sizes previous studies have reported that hypertension had a hazard ratio hr of 170 95 confidence interval ci 092314 to 305 95 ci 157592 for mortality respectively23 however neither of these previous studies has adjusted for confounding factors for example age which is emerging as the strongest predictor of covid-19-related death34angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is required for viral entry of sars-cov-25 ace2 is widely expressed in the human body with expression found in the gastrointestinal tract heart and kidney and alveolar cells in the lungs67 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors aceis and angiotensin receptor blockers arbs are the two types of reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas inhibitors widely used for treating hypertension and heart and renal failure there are reports in animal models8 and humans9 suggesting that the expression of ace2 may be increased after treatment with an acei or arb some reports incriminated only arbs10 which might augment patients susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation11 although the effects of aceis or arbs on ace2 in humans are still inconclusive previous findings have led to a growing concern that aceis or arbs may increase or decrease mortality in patients with covid-191213 therefore evidence of the impact of these medications in patients with covid-19 is urgently neededhere we investigated 2877 consecutive patients admitted to huo shen shan hospital which is a hospital dedicated solely to the treatment of covid-19 in wuhan china we tested the hypothesis that treatment of hypertension especially with raas inhibitors might impact on the mortality of patients with covid-19this is a retrospective observational study comparing the association of both hypertensive status and antihypertensive treatment class with mortality among hospitalized patients with covid-19 all patients admitted to huo shen shan hospital wuhan china from 5 february to 15 march 2020 with confirmed covid-19 were included in this study huo shen shan hospital was opened by the government on 5 february 2020 and assigned to treat exclusively covid-19 patients patients with covid-19 included in this study were diagnosed according to world health organization interim guidance and diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia from the the national health commission of china1415 in brief clinical manifestations of covid-19 are defined as the development of fever andor respiratory symptoms computed tomography ct imaging showing characteristics consistent with covid-19 or normal or decreased white blood cell wbc count and normal or decreased lymphocyte count in the early stage of the disease patients with a suspicious epidemiological history ie contact with novel coronavirus-infected people or patients from wuhan who have fever or respiratory symptoms plus any two clinical manifestations or no clear epidemiological history but with all three clinical manifestations were considered as possible covid-19 case patients who were considered as possible covid-19 cases with or without laboratory confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection were admitted to the huo shen shan hospitalthe confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection was defined as suspect cases with one of the following serological findings i real-time fluorescent reverse transcriptionpcr rtpcr positive for new coronavirus nucleic acid ii viral gene sequence highly homologous to known new coronaviruses and iii sars-cov-2-specific igm or igg are detected in serum or sars-cov-2-specific igg is detectable or reaches a titration of at least a four-fold increase during convalescence compared with the acute phasethis study was approved by the national health commission of china and the institutional review board at huo shen shan hospital wuhan china written informed consent was waived by the ethics committee of the designated hospital for patients with emerging infectious diseasespatients demographic characteristics and clinical data symptoms comorbidities laboratory findings and outcomes during hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records by two investigators rz and yc all data were independently reviewed and entered into the computer database by two analysts cg and ycthe primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during hospitalization other endpoints included the time elapsed between onset of symptoms and discharge the rates of use of invasive mechanical ventilation and the severity of covid-19 the severity of covid-19 was categorized as mild severe or critical mild included non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia cases severe was characterized by dyspnoea respiratory frequency 30min blood oxygen saturation 93 pao2fio2 ratio 300 andor lung infiltrates 50 within 2448 h critical cases were defined as respiratory failure requiring mechanic ventilation septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunctionfailure116 the final date of follow-up was 1 april 2020 and the median duration of follow-up hospitalization was 21 1232 daysthe diagnosis of hypertension was given by the patients physician prior to the infection with sars-cov-2 these data were collected from patients documented medical files eg the diagnosed patients with antihypertensive drugs and blood pressure 14090 mmhg upon admission were still identified as with a history of hypertension there was no formal committee to adjudicate the status of hypertension however these diagnoses were rechecked by two individual investigators rz and yc during data collection using office systolic blood pressure 140 mmhg andor diastolic blood pressure values 90 mmhg17 as the criteria
figure 1 shows the flow chart of the study the antihypertensive regimens were in principle unchanged during hospitalization whenever the patients had previous prescriptions before admission discontinuation or alteration of the antihypertensive treatment during hospitalization was at the physicians discretion those who required antihypertensive medication during hospitalization with no prior prescription or those who had discontinued the medications prior to admission were treated with calcium channel blockers ccbs or diuretics the cohorts of without antihypertensive and with antihypertensive treatments as well as the cohorts of raas inhibitors aceiarbs and non-raas inhibitors beta-blockers ccbs or diuretics  were stratified at the time of their admission and according to their pre-admission medications there were 15 patients no death events taking spirolactone but were categorized in the non-raas inhibitors group in the analysis patients were included in the raas inhibitor cohort whenever at least one raas inhibitor an acei or arb was prescribed disregarding whether or not they were treated with a beta-blocker ccb or diuretics nevertheless a sensitivity analysis was performed by including patients who were treated solely with one medication supplementary material online table s3

studies have found that women are less susceptible to viral infection than men possibly because of the protection of x chromosome and sex hormones which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity28 at the same time men tend to be associated with bad lifestyle habits such as smoking and underlying diseases as a result the majority of critical or mortal patients are male as the bodys immunity declines with age elderly patients are more likely to develop critical illness or even die therefore when the patient is male over 65 years old and smoking the patient has a higher risk of developing critical illness or deathwhen patients are combined with basic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension the body is in a state of stress for a long time and the immunity tends to be low moreover the long-term history of diabetes and hypertension will damage the vascular structure and it is more likely to develop into critical disease in infection patients with chronic heart disease are more likely to be infected due to their weakened heart function and low immunity when infected with sars-cov-2 they are more likely to have acute cardiovascular events and develop into severe diseases when the patient has previous respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the patients lung function is damaged they have lower resistance to the virus and are prone to developing ards thus underlying diseases such as diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease or respiratory disease are risk factors for disease progression this is consistent with the analytical results in this paperthe common clinical manifestations of covid-19 patients are fever cough and sputum6 when the patients immune response is low it may manifest as normal body temperature shortness of breath or dyspnea suggests poor lung function and lacking of oxygen therefore when the patient is found to have difficulty in breathing or no fever it is necessary to be alert for further deterioration of the patients conditionviral infection will cause inflammation in human body various inflammatory factors produced by the inflammatory storm can cause systemic immune damage and even cause multi-organ failure when the patients laboratory indicator shows pct  05 ngml there is a higher risk of progression to critical illness study showed that the total number of wbc in the early stage of the disease is normal or reduced6 however wbc  4  109l means a better clinical outcome in this paper therefore when the total number of wbc is found to be higher than the previous one the patient may be associated with other infections that aggravated the disease at this moment the clinicians might pay more attentions to these patients and improve treatment when ast  40ul ldh  245ul and cr  133 moll it indicates that the liver and kidney dysfunctions have been involved and corresponding treatments should be taken in time to prevent further deterioration of the disease current studies have shown that up to 20 of covid-19 patients have abnormal coagulation function6 monocytes and tissue cells are activated after injury causing the release of cytokines and the expression of tissue factors and finally causing the hypercoagulability of blood it will increase the risk of thrombosis and more likely to cause ischemia and hypoxia due to the embolization of the viscera which leads to the progression of the disease to critical disease or death when the d-dimer  05mgl it indicates the hypercoagulability of blood and suggests the deterioration of patients at the same time sars-cov-2 can cause myocardial injury by direct andor indirect action the direct injury is to infect cardiomyocytes by identifying ace2 receptor while the indirect injury may be caused by inflammatory storm inducing by immune response andor oxygen supply imbalance inducing by acute respiratory distress syndrome when hs-ctni  28pgml it strongly suggests the possibility of further deterioration of the patients conditionthe quality of the literature included in this study is high the analysis is rigorous and the conclusions drawn by the study are highly credible however this metaanalysis also has some limitations a most of the studies included in this meta-analysis were cross-sectional studies with insufficient demonstration ability b most of the patients in our meta-analysis were chinese and our aim was to use the findings of this study to predict the overall profile of patients including other countries and races c more detailed patient information such as iconograph and oxygen at ion index was not available in most studies at the time of analysis the conclusions of this meta-analysis still need to be verified by more relevant studies with more careful design more rigorous execution and larger sample sizethis study analyzed the risk factors for progression to critical illness or death in covid-19 patients to help assessing patient status and identify critical patients early pay close attention to these risk factors and when relevant laboratory risk value appears timely and personalized treatment regimens are needed to enhance the efficacy and reduce the risk of deathsince december 2019 some hospitals in wuhan city hubei province have successively found multiple cases of unexplained pneumonia with a history of exposure to the south china seafood market which have now been confirmed as an acute respiratory infection caused by a new type of coronavirus infection the coronavirus isolated from the lower respiratory tract of patients with unexplained pneumonia in wuhan this time is a new type of coronavirus belonging to the genus  and named as a new type of coronavirus disease covid19 as to march 13 81 003 confirmed cases of covid19 in china and a total of 3181 deaths nationwide with a crude fatality rate of 393 from the existing data the mortality rate of covid19 is lower than the pneumonia which caused by sarscov 96

after more than 2 months of treatment experiences we have accumulated some data in the detection of covid19 and the treatment of critical illness at present there have been a few clinical reports on the characteristics and outcomes of covid19 patients but the evidences are quite insufficient especially for several and critical cases based on these we collected the clinical data of severe and critical covid19 patients in five designated hospitals and analyzed their clinical characteristics laboratory indicators treatment regimens and shortterm clinical outcomes in order to provide help for the clinical treatment and prognosis judgment of severe and critical covid19 patientsin this retrospective multicenter study we retrospectively reviewed 161 severe and critical covid19 patients who

in hospital table 5 besides the mean hospital stay of deaths was 2166  1118 days while the mean hospital stay of discharged patients was 1842  1277 daysthe mortality rate was 2413 3469 3600 and 2424 in patients aged 44 years patients aged 4559 years patients aged 6074 years and patients aged 75 years respectively further comparison analysis revealed that no difference was found among these four group patients p  525 figure 1 notably ards p  001 and mods p  008 correlated with increased mortality rate while electrolyte disorders p  249 and hypoproteinemia p  248 did not associated with mortality risk figure 2in this study we overviewed the clinical features postadmission complications treatments and outcomes in 161 patients with severe and critical covid19 which observed several key findings a fever and dry cough were the most common symptoms of severe and critical covid19 patients b blood routine indexes hepatic and renal function indexes and inflammation indexes were commonly abnormal in severe and critical covid19 patients c ards was the most common complication followed by electrolyte disorders mods and hypoproteinemia in severe and critical covid19 patients and d the mortality rate was as high as 3106 in severe and critical covid19 patientsaccording to 20122018 the mers global death factors survey mers patients aged 60 years exhibited the highest incidence of severe and critical illness as well as the highest mortality rate
3
 meanwhile an earlier study focusing chinese covid19 patients observes their median age is around 41 years
4
 our study disclosed that the mean age of severe and critical covid19 patients was 5938 years indicating the severe and critical disease is more popular in aged population which might result from that the elders had poor immunity and increased basic diseases in terms of gender we found that the proportion of men was about twice as that of women in severe and critical covid19 patients which might be due to the men were more commonly outside and in public place instead of women in severe and critical covid19 patients and the complications such as lung diseases were also more common in men so as to medical history we observed that hypertension and diabetes were most common in severe and critical covid19 patients which was in line with the conditions of mers
5

with regard to the clinical symptoms of severe and critical covid19 patients on admission we observed that fever and dry cough were the most common symptoms which were in accordance with findings in previous studies of covid19
6
 and were similar to patients with merscov and sars coronavirus infection
7
 
8
 in terms of laboratory indexes we discovered that blood routine indexes hepatic and renal function indexes and inflammation indexes were commonly abnormal in severe and critical covid19 patients these might be account of that a covid19 mainly acted on lymphocytes especially t lymphocytes which was similar to sarscov
9
 and merscov
10
 therefore affected the blood routine indexes b covid19 viral particles spread through the respiratory mucosa induced a cytokine storm in the body generated a series of immune responses and caused changes in peripheral leukocytes and immune cells such as lymphocytes
11
 therefore elevated the inflammation level which was also similar to conditions in merscov
12
 and sarscov
13
 and c severe and critical covid19 were accompanied with mods including hepatic and renal dysfunctionso as to postadmission complications in severe and critical covid19 patients we observed that ards was the most common complication followed by electrolyte disorders mods and hypoproteinemia meanwhile ards and mods were closely correlated with worse prognosis in severe and critical covid19 patients and therefore it was essential to timely monitor and prevent ards and mods potency however electrolyte disorders and hypoproteinemia were not associated with prognosis but the latter was previously reported to be independent risk factor for severe merscov infection
14
 and serum albumin could reflect nutritional status therefore related to severe and critical covid19 in aspect of treatment regimen all the treatment procedures were set according to the guidelines and accumulating clinical experience based on antiviral drugs and other supported treatments and among the antiviral drugs the most commonly used was lopinavir and ritonavir tabletsthe clinical outcome of covid19 patients is an essential issue to be explored according to a previous metaanalysis the mortality rate of covid19 patients ranges from 20 to 44
15
 meanwhile the severe covid19 patients present with a higher mortality rate of 81 but at the time of this study disclosed 890 patients were still in hospitalization and therefore the mortality rate might be greatly underestimated
16
 as to outcome of criticalill covid19 patients seldom report is disclosed in this study we found that the mortality rate was as high as 3106 in severe and critical covid19 patients which was higher than previous studies these might be to be a the longer followup duration of our study and b criticalill patients were also included in our study furthermore the previous study reveals that the mortality rate of severe mers is around 4375
5
 which is higher compared to severe and critical covid19 patients in our study as to healed and discharged rate 4845 severe and critical covid19 patients realized it which was acceptable notably we observed that a small proportion of patients who were discharged in accordance with the current discharge standard were tested positive for the new type of coronavirus nucleic acid again within 14 days of isolation and returned to hospital for treatment therefore we suggested at least three consecutive negative tests were a necessity for dischargesome limitations existed in this study firstly since this was a retrospective study potential bias and residual confounding might exist secondly all the patients were retrieved from icu database and therefore these patients might not represent all general severe and critical covid19 patients thirdly there were still a proportion of patients in hospitalization and therefore the mortality rate and discharged rate might be influencedin summary severe and critical covid19 presents with high mortality rate and occurrence of ards or mods greatly increases its mortality risk therefore it is essential for early intervention to prevent mildmoderate covid19 from progressing to severe and critical covid19 and early prevention of ards and mods is also important as so to improve the prognosis of covid19we conducted an electronic search of pubmed medline web of science and scopus to identify journal articles published in english from december 2019 to april 2020 using the medical subject heading or text words coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 or sars-cov-2 or cardiac injury or biomarkers or inflammation and cardiac involvement fig 1 we search for articles that reported on observational studies or clinical trials promoting any relation between cardiac involvement inflammation and covid-19 we considered articles eligible for initial inclusion if they focused on this subject citations of relevant articles were reviewed to capture additional studies we also manually searched the reference of previous reviews and all records that received a full-text review few additional articles before our search years were included if they were referenced in existing articles and included pertinent important data for this present article no randomized trials neither interventional studies were available at this time in this investigation hence observational studies long-term prospective cohort studies case-control or cross-sectional studies were also included in this article to be eligible for inclusion studies had to be written in english be published in a peer-reviewed journal provides outcome data on cardiac injury inflammation and covid-19 this study was in accordance with the ethical standards of our institutional research committee and with the 1964 helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards the included studies were first categorized by whether the study compared clinical outcomes between cardiac involvement and inflammation in covid-19 patients after the initial search the authors separately screened all abstracts based on the eligibility criteria any abstracts or articles for which there was disagreement or uncertainty were reviewed again and discussed until consensus was reachedalhogbani11 described the evidence from a coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis manifested as myocardial edema and acute myocardial injury of the apical and lateral walls of the left ventricle this regional myocardial injury may result from direct viral myocardial infection and inflammation however according to a recent pathological study performed by xu et al17 there was scarce interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in the myocardial tissue without substantial cardiac muscle tissue damage in their patient with covid-19 suggesting that the coronavirus might not directly impair the heart nevertheless this is just their proposal based on the pathological findings of only 1 patient who acquired covid-19 in wuhan on the other hand in the study performed by guo et al5 plasma troponin t levels were positively linear correlated in a significant manner with plasma high-sensitivity c-reactive protein crp levels indicating that myocardial injury may be closely associated with inflammatory pathogenesis during the progress of disease considering that most of the patients were elderly people with a probable association of coronary heart disease whether the myocardial injury was directly associated with sars-cov-2 infection is still unclear direct evidence demonstrating that sars-cov-2 infects the myocardial tissue or pericardial effusion liquid in patients with covid-19 is currently lacking of interest is that with hundred of thousands of bodies available for autopsy studies no prospective investigation has been reported so far elucidation of the disease pathogenesis and prospective histopathological studies are crucial for future proper treatment in case of renewed outbreaksanother plausible mechanism involves the ace2 the latter is a human cell receptor with a strong binding affinity to the virus spike protein of sars-cov-2 since ace2 is also highly expressed in the heart it is reasonable to hypothesize that covid-19induced cardiac injury might be mediated by ace21216 ace2 is a key counter regulatory enzyme that degrades angiotensin ii to angiotensin-17 thereby attenuating its effects on vasoconstriction sodium retention and fibrosis although angiotensin ii is the primary substrate of ace2 that enzyme also cleaves angiotensin i to angiotensin-19 and also participates in the hydrolysis of other peptides ace2 is expressed broadly including in the heart and kidneys and the lung alveolar epithelial cells2022the complexity underlying the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas clearly shows the different responses to different modulators in the presence of sars-cov 2 infection fig 2 the enzyme active sites of ace and ace2 are distinct therefore ace inhibitors in clinical use do not directly affect ace2 activity23 experimental animal studies have shown mixed findings with respect to the effects of ace inhibitors and arb on ace2 levels or activity in tissue2430 some studies have shown that arb may increase messenger rna expression or protein levels of ace2 in tissue2430 while others showed no effect27 these ostensibly inconsistent results demonstrate the complex raas responses and emphasize the notion that findings from experimental animal studies may not extrapolate to similar physiological responses in humans this fact shows the importance and relevance of human studies performed on this matter to shed more light for comprehensionat least theoretically the drug-induced increased ace2 expression produced by acei or arb might aggravate lung injury of patients with covid-19 however henry et al31 in a previous clinical study showed a beneficial effect of acei in patients admitted with viral pneumonia they retrospectively investigated the impact of ace inhibitors and statins on the rates of intubation and death in 1055 adult patients with a positive respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction test they found lower rates of death and intubation in those patients with continued use of ace inhibitors odds ratio 025 95 confidence interval ci 009064 during the hospital stay moreover those patients on ace inhibitors before hospital admission and subsequently discontinued the medication had a higher mortality than those patients who were not on ace inhibitor before admission they observed a significantly reduction of the pulmonary inflammatory response and cytokine release caused by virus infection31 in addition mortensen et al32 found a significant decrease in mortality length of stay and mechanical ventilation in patients taking ace inhibitors or arb who were hospitalized with pneumonia and compared with a matched cohortthe study done by kuba et al33 provided the first genetic proof a molecular evidence for the severe lung failure and mortality associated with sars-cov they demonstrated that infections with sars-cov resulted in ace2 downregulation through binding of sars-cov spike protein to ace2 which contributed to the severity of lung pathologies they further showed that this severity could be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway33 as the authors mentioned the fact of providing a molecular link between sars-cov pathogenesis and the role of the raas in lung failure envisioned a novel target in the therapeutic management recombinant ace2 protein could not only be a treatment to block virus spreading but modulation of the renin-angiotensin system could also be utilized to protect patients with covid-19the beneficial effect of aceiarb may be related to a compensatory increase in ace218 however the evidence regarding the use of aceiarb in patients with covid-19 infection is still emerging and larger prospective randomized clinical studies are required at present for patients with covid-19 who previously used aceiarb the use of these drug agents may not need to be discontinued based on current dataanother possible mechanism involved in cardiac injury may be the increased cytokine secretion during covid-19 in a previous research 46 patients with established clinical diagnosis of sars-cov were prospectively studied by li et al18 they found significantly higher left ventricular index of myocardial performance 042  013 vs 033  009 p  0001 longer isovolumic relaxation time 1029  157 vs 816  147 milliseconds p  0001 lower flow propagation velocity 696  157 vs 838  197 cms p  0011 and doppler-derived cardiac output 469  101 vs 549  104 lmin p  0001 were observed during acute infection when compared with those at 30 days a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction correlated moderately with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level r  0605 p  0001 whereas a higher index of myocardial performance correlated weakly with an increase in creatine kinase level r  038 p  0016 in this 30-day echocardiographic follow-up study they found that reversible subclinical diastolic left ventricular impairment appears to be a common finding in acute sars-cov infection even among those patients without underlying cardiac disease they suggested that left ventricular dysfunction in the acute phase of the disease might be attributable to the cytokine storm syndrome resulting from an overaggressive host immune response to sars-cov infection18huang et al1 found that severely ill patients with covid-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit had higher plasma levels of cytokines including interleukin il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and igg-induced protein 10 they also had higher plasma levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha and tumor necrosis factor  indeed this is a serious life-threatening disease with clinical features of systemic inflammation methemoglobinemia hemodynamic instability and multiple organ failure the trademark clinical endorsement of cytokine storm syndrome is a severe uncontrolled and dysfunctional immune response involving the continuous activation and proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophages some other markers of inflammatory response such as crp procalcitonin and leukocytes were also found to be significantly increased among patients who suffered from cardiac injury1the infection-related increased cytokine release is identified by an elevated plasma level of several inflammatory biomarkers various inflammatory serum markers that are shown to be elevated in patients with covid-19related cardiac injury are crp procalcitonin ferritin d-dimer il-2 il-7 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor igg-induced protein 10 chemokine ligand 3 and tumor necrosis alpha therefore the storming activation and secretion of these inflammatory cytokines can lead to apoptosis or necrosis of myocardial cells in covid-1913 in this regard huang et al1 demonstrated an imbalance of t helper 1 and t helper 2 responses resulting in a cytokine storm which may have contributed to myocardial injury in patients with covid-19 the release of inflammatory cytokines after infection may cause reduction in coronary blood flow and decreased oxygen supplyanother interesting factor to consider is the presence of preexisting cvds might also render patients to be more susceptible to covid-19induced heart injury shi et al3 demonstrated that patients with cardiac injury had a history of coronary heart disease 30 and hypertension 60 which were significantly more prevalent than in those patients without cardiac injury wang et al2 found very similar percentages in their patients who were critically ill with covid-19 25 had underlying heart diseases and 58 had hypertension it is reasonable to assume that patients with predisposing cvds such as coronary artery disease or heart failure are susceptible to cardiac injury and once such patients are infected with covid-19 myocardial ischemia or infarction and left ventricular systolic dysfunction are more likely to occur ultimately leading to a sudden deterioration the intrinsic inflammatory process within the atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary walls is exacerbated during the systemic inflammatory response in covid-19 making them susceptible to fissure initiating an acute coronary syndrome19altered myocardial demandsupply ratio in association with increased cardiometabolic demand in the myocardial tissue can result in myocyte hypoxia this alteration in the context of systemic infection associated with acute respiratory illness-related hypoxia can further impair myocardial oxygen demandsupply relationship and lead to acute myocardial injury16 in addition the systemic inflammation also causes endothelial dysfunction and increases the procoagulant activity of the blood which can further contribute to the formation of occlusive thrombi over a ruptured coronary plaque in the context of inflammation and hypoxemic state in covid-19 atrial fibrillation may supervene worsening the prognosis and developing heart failure19viral diseases can harm myocardial cells through direct myocyte damage by the virus and by systemic inflammatory responses han et al34 studied and analyzed in detail the main laboratory markers associated to cardiac injury in covid-19 patients and investigated the correlation between heart injury and severity of the disease they specifically analyzed serum levels of creatine kinase isoenzyme-mb myohemoglobin myo cardiac tni ultra-tni and n-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide nt-probnp in 273 covid-19 patients their patients were divided into 3 groups according to strict diagnostic criteria of their clinical condition mild 198 cases severe 60 cases and critical 15 cases the positive rate of myo ultra-tni and nt-probnp was higher in severe cases and critical cases as compared with mild cases the differences among the groups were statistically significant p  005these findings showed that higher concentrations in venous blood of creatine kinase isoenzyme-mb myo ultra-tni and nt-probnp were associated with the severity and mortality of covid-19 of note the authors analyzed these 4 cardiac injury parameters between the death n  24 and alive patients n  249 all 4 parameters were significantly higher in the death than in the alive group p  0001 therefore the authors concluded that careful monitoring of the myocardial enzyme profiles is of great importance in reducing the complications and mortality in covid-19 patients34 in this context an interesting meta-analysis was performed by lippi et al39 in a total number of 341 patients they found that tni plasma values were significantly increased in patients with severe covid-19 compared with those patients with milder forms of the disease therefore it seems rational to assume that initial measurements of serum biomarkers of cardiac injury should be performed immediately after hospitalization for covid-19 patients and further in-hospital monitoring may help identifying a subset of severe cases with possible cardiac involvement and consequently predict progression towards a worse clinical scenarioguo et al5 performed a retrospective single-center case series study to analyzed 187 patients with confirmed covid-19 the mean age was 5850  1466 years they evaluated the association of underlying cvd and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with covid-19 of 187 patients 144 patients 77 were discharged from the hospital and 43 patients 23 died overall 66 353 patients had underlying cvd including hypertension coronary heart disease and cardiomyopathy and 52 278 exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated troponin t tnt levels the mortality during hospitalization was 76 for patients without underlying cvd and normal tnt levels 133 for those with underlying cvd and normal tnt levels 375 for those without underlying cvd but elevated tnt levels and 694 for those with underlying cvd and elevated tnts fig 3 patients with underlying cvd were more likely to exhibit elevation of tnt levels compared with the patients without cvd 545 vs 132 plasma tnt levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity crp levels   0530 p  0001 and nt-probnp levels   0613 p  0001 during hospitalization patients with elevated tnt levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias and the use of glucocorticoid therapy 712 vs 511 and mechanical ventilation 596 vs 104 were higher compared with patients with normal tnt levels the mortality rates of patients with and without use of aceiangiotensin receptor blockers was 368 and 256 therefore the authors concluded that myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of covid-19 while the prognosis of patients with underlying cvd but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury interestingly these authors demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin t and plasma high-sensitivity crp levels biomarkers of cardiac injury and systemic inflammation respectively fig 4 guo et al5 observed 52 278 patients who exhibited myocardial injury as demonstrated by elevation of troponin t levels and the mortality was markedly higher in these patients with elevated tnt levels than in those with normal tnt levels 596 vs 89 there was nearly 70 mortality in those covid-19 patients who had underlying cvd and elevated troponin t levels in addition their data on nt-probnp showed that its serum elevation and the presence of malignant arrhythmias were significantly more common in patients with elevated tnt levels moreover the serum levels of nt-probnp were significantly correlated with tnt levels in this respect gao et al35 studying 54 patients with covid-19 reported that the best cutoff value of nt-probnp was 88 pgml for predicting in-hospital death they found it to have an excellent sensitivity and good specificity fig 5 patients with high nt-probnp values had a significantly increased risk of death comparing to those with low values after adjustment for potential risk factors nt-probnp was independently correlated with in-hospital death35 the results of these 2 latter studies argue in favor of the concept that the greater the cardiac injury the greater the ventricular dysfunction in covid-19 patients also patients with underlying cvd are more prone to experience myocardial injury during the course of their covid-19there is no known direct association between the sars-cov-2 itself and the qt interval prolongation in the electrocardiogram of covid-19 patients however there is known association to prolonged qt interval and cardiac arrhythmias among certain drug agents that may be utilized in the therapeutic management of covid-19 hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been utilized as potential pharmacological agents in the prophylaxis or therapeutic management in covid-19 both drug agents are known to provoke malignant ventricular arrhythmias in certain patients4042 hydroxychloroquine acts on the entry and postentry stages of sars-cov-2 via effects on endosomal ph and the resulting underglycosylation of ace 2 receptors that are required for viral entry since it may prolong the qt interval and develop ventricular arrhythmias it should be given with extreme cautious in association with other qt interval prolonging drugs fig 6 there are case reports of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus showing hydroxychloroquine-induced qt interval prolongation and developing torsade de pointes4344 azithromycin is increasingly recognized as antibiotic that may cause qt prolongation malignant ventricular arrhythmias nonpause-dependent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia torsade des points and increased risk for sudden cardiac death45 there are very limited data evaluating the safety and clinical outcome of combination therapy with these 2 pharmacological agents and the effect of their combination on qt interval or arrhythmia risk has not been studied therefore multiple randomized clinical trials are currently ongoing studies table 3 shows certain care and safety considerations to considerthe novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 appears to be more transmittable with greater infectivity and somehow similar or higher morbidity and mortality depending on the area considered as compared with sars and mers49 so far there is a greater incidence of patients with sars-cov-2 who have developed severe pneumonia pulmonary edema acute respiratory distress syndrome cardiovascular compromise or multiple organ failure and death oudit et al46 previously demonstrated that the sars-cov genome was positively detected in the myocardial tissue in 35 of the patients with sars-cov infection this raises the possibility of direct damage of cardiomyocytes by the virus itself sars-cov-2 may share the same mechanism with sars-cov because the 2 viruses are highly homologous in genome4748 animal experimental studies have shown that some strains of coronavirus infection may seriously affect the heart for example coronavirus infection may induce cardiomyopathy that results in cardiac chamber dilatation and impairment of systolic function simulating dilated cardiomyopathy in rabbits49 in this context of cardiomyopathy it is interesting to note that dong et al50 reported 4 end-stage heart failure patients who were infected with covid-19 2 of them with severe illness presentation all 4 patients were male had typical lymphopenia and had significantly increased crp level three patients had elevated tni in the later evolution period and tni increased significantly a few days before death moreover the levels of crp and brain natriuretic peptide were significantly higher an interesting finding was that the tni level of the 2 critically ill patients increased significantly by more than 20-fold indicating important myocardial injury patients with end-stage heart failure seemed to be older have more comorbidity poor general condition a greater myocardial injury and higher mortality rate after covid-19according to the novel knowledge acquired from recent studies on covid-19 those patients who manifested cardiac injury presented with more severe acute illness requiring noninvasive or invasive ventilation compared with patients without cardiac injury they also manifested clearly abnormal laboratory radiographic findings and mortality in half of the hospitalized patients it is worth comparing these cardiovascular findings in covid-19 with those of sars of about 15 years ago49 yu et al10 studied the cardiovascular complications of sars in 121 hospitalized patients they observed that hypertension occurred in 504 of these patients 719 developed persistent tachycardia including 40 with continued tachycardia during outpatient follow-up therefore tachycardia could not be explained by fever which had already subsided by then it was neither explained by coexisting hypotension which was only present in a comparatively small number of patients although tachycardia-related cardiovascular complications were common in patients with sars they were generally self-limiting and not associated with mortality other types of cardiac arrhythmias were uncommon in patients with sars transient atrial fibrillation occurred in only 1 patient who had no history of cardiac disease therefore the cardiac arrhythmiaassociated effect of the coronavirus that causes sars is low in total 47 39 patients developed arterial desaturation that needed oxygen therapy however only 18 15 patients were admitted into intensive care unit only 6 5 patients died and all of them due to pneumonia10 in contrast with that from sars findings more than half of the patients with cardiac injury experienced in-hospital death with covid-19 indicating that this novel coronavirusinduced cardiac injury is associated with major adverse clinical outcomes and worse prognosis3 indeed cardiac injury was found to be independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with covid-19myocardial injury and common pathways of inflammation are significantly associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality and overall fatal outcome of covid-19 we identified several potential mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage namely coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis ace2 receptor binding affinity to the virus spike protein increased cytokine secretion and hypoxia-induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis myocardial injury was found to be related to cardiac dysfunction ventricular arrhythmias and it was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with covid-19 inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury there was a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin t and plasma high-sensitivity crp levels biomarkers of cardiac injury and systemic inflammation respectively although there are several possible mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage the exact mechanism of cardiac injury needs to be further explored in well-designed clinical studies strong efforts and continued research of the cardiovascular complications and identification of risk factors for poor prognosis in covid-19 are steadily needed given the high infectivity and lethality of covid-19 and the enormous economic and social impact of the worldwide outbreak elucidation of the disease pathogenesis and prospective histopathological studies are crucial for future treatment in case of renewed outbreakscvds are still the number one killer in the world and represent the leading noncommunicable epidemic since numerous patients with cvd are using aceiarb drug agents clinical studies may be necessary to explore the potential associations of these pharmacological drugs with the susceptibility and prognosis of covid-19 despite the theoretical concerns and physiological uncertainties concerning the effect of raas inhibitors on ace2 ace inhibitors and arb drug agents should be continued in patients with covid-19 in otherwise stable condition5153 this is a position supported by multiple medical and scientific societies that needs to be explored by randomized clinical trials to search for the potential associations of these pharmacological drugs with the susceptibility and prognosis of covid-19the high morbidity and mortality of covid-19 its monumental economic burden and social impact the despair of a new pandemic outbreak and the thread of potential utilization of novel sars-cov-2 as biologic weapons make it a preponderant necessity to better comprehend the therapeutic management of this lethal disease emerging as an acute infectious disease covid-19 may become a chronic epidemic because of genetic recombination therefore we should be ready for the reemergence of covid-19 or other coronaviruses in the near futurenothing to declarewe thank dr angelica helga neumann for her excellent technical assistance and constant support in the making of this article and miss felicita torales for her help with the literature searcha series of pneumonia cases of unknown origin emerged in wuhan the hubei province of china in december 2019 and the clinical presentations were most similar to viral pneumonia 1 this pneumonia is a newly recognized illness that has spread rapidly across the country and around the world a few days after the initial outbreak chinese scientists managed to identify a novel coronavirus 1 which was later named severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this virus is classified as a  cov of group 2b and has at least similarity in genetic sequence to severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus sars-cov-1 sars is a zoonosis caused by sars-cov-1 which first appeared in china in 2002 and spread to 29 countries in 2003 causing a global outbreak with 8903 cases 2coronaviruses are viruses with single-stranded rna enveloped by a fat-coated substance this virus belongs to the coronaviridae family and is encountered in humans and mammals although coronavirus infection is generally mild the previous two betacoronavirus epidemics namely sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has caused a cumulative case of 10000 patients with a 10 case fatality rate for sars-cov-1 and 37 for mers-cov 34the clinical spectrum of sars-cov-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically ill cases the previous studies reported only the epidemiological findings the clinical presentation and the clinical outcomes however more specific information identifying critically ill patients remains unknown recently cardiac injury has been reported to be associated with mortality 5 the mortality of critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia is substantial 6 older patients with comorbidities and adult respiratory distress syndrome ards are at increased risk of death 6 therefore studying the association of acute cardiac injury with the mortality in covid-19 is essential and justified for prevention and preparation in the hospitals facing these global pandemicsin this systematic review and meta-analysis we aimed to explore the association between acute cardiac injury and mortality the need for intensive care unit icu care acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and severe covid-19 in patients with covid-19we included all research articles in adult patients diagnosed

 all of the studies were retrospective observational most of the included studies defined cardiac injury as hs-ctni elevation above 99th percentile there are studies that did not specify their definition of cardiac injury however these studies presumably used similar definition to the existing studies fig 2

in december 2019 a series of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology emerged in wuhan central
china with a population of 11 million people and was thought to be related to an exposure
from huanan seafood wholesale market 12 this condition was later confirmed to be the coronavirus disease 2019
covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 different
from normal pathogens this virus is powerful and has extended rapidly to other chinese
cities and countries thus leading to the widespread of pneumonia 35 the number of covid-19 cases has sharply
increased in china and by 13 times outside china and the number of affected countries
tripled consideration its alarming levels of spread and severity the world health
organization characterized covid-19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 covid-19 poses a great
public health and clinical burden worldwidethe epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 have been
reported sars-cov-2 infection has a wide clinical spectrum including asymptomatic
infection mild respiratory disease and severe pneumonia with acute respiratory failure and
even death hematological changes including lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia have been
reported in patients with covid-19 similar to sars in 2003 67 abnormal coagulation is a common complication of
covid-19 and is manifested by pulmonary vascular leakage intravascular thrombosis and
disseminated intravascular coagulation thrombocytopenia is also a common clinical
manifestation associated with poor outcome in patients with community-acquired pneumonia
8 platelets not only contribute to hemostasis but also
participate in inflammation and host defense response the latter is especially important
when the lungs are infected although many cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported in
patients with severe viral pneumonia and thus is a suggestive clinical characteristic of
covid-19 the association of baseline platelets and changes with adverse covid-19 outcome
remains unclearhere a hospital-based cohort study was conducted in all patients with laboratory-confirmed
covid-19 to evaluate the association between platelets at admission and mortality
particularly the dynamic changes of circulating platelets and its role in the disease
progressiona retrospective cohort study was conducted on 383 patients with covid-19 in the central
hospital of wuhan from january 2 2020 and followed to march 1 2020 covid-19 was
diagnosed according to the world health organization interim guidance 9 only patients with laboratory-confirmed human infection from throat swab
specimens were enrolled and those with malignant tumors post craniocerebral operation
died on admission treatment with anti-platelet drugs and transferred to other medical
institutions were excluded all enrolled patients were followed up until discharge or
death the requirement for informed consent was waived due to the urgency to collect data
on the emerging sars-cov-2 this study was approved by the ethics committees of the
central hospital of wuhancase report forms nursing records laboratory findings and radiological characteristics
were reviewed by a team of physicians who treat patients with covid-19 demographic

ratio were collected at admission additional platelet parameters including plateletcrit
pct  mean platelet volume mpv fl platelet distribution width  and platelet
larger cell ratio p-lcr  were also gathered according to the test
projectmanual and reagent instructions of the central hospital of wuhan the normal
reference interval of platelet count was 125350  109l therefore
thrombocytopenia was defined as a blood platelet 125  109l and
non-thrombocytopenia was defined as a blood platelet 125  109l acute physiology and chronic
health evaluation ii scores apache ii sequential organ failure assessment and curb-65
criteria were determined within 24 h after admission data on all treatment measures
including antibiotic antivirus glucocorticoid and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and
respiratory support were acquired during hospitalization throat swab samples were
collected from all suspected patients at admission and the laboratory confirmation of
sars-cov-2 was performed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
according to the manufacturers protocol beijing genomics institution and geneodx
biotechnology co ltd repeated tests for sars-cov-2 were performed in confirmed patients
to verify viral clearance before hospital dischargebaseline characteristics as continuous and categorical variables were presented as median
interquartile range and n  respectively and examined by mannwhitney
u test 2 test or fishers exact test where appropriate the association
between baseline platelet parameters and mortality risk was estimated by cox proportional
hazards regression models in terms of the following confounders age sex baseline
comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hypertension diabetes
chronic kidney disease cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease glucocorticoid
and immunoglobulin might affect the hematopoietic system and these treatments are common in
clinical practice in addition decreased lymphocyte count represents the progression of the
disease c-reactive protein represents the overall inflammation and augment blood lactate
represents acute lung injury tissue hypoxia andor oxygen debt and associated mortality
critical patients 10 therefore we also considered these in
regression models smoothing spline presenting the association of baseline platelet levels
and platelets change with subsequent mortality was generated by utilizing the generalized
additive model survival curve was plotted using the kaplanmeier method and examined using
the log-rank test all statistical analyses were performed using r software the r
foundation httpwwwr-projectorg version 361 and empowerstats httpwwwempowerstatscom xy solutions inc boston ma unless
otherwise indicated a two-sided significance level of p  005 was used to
evaluate statistical significanceamong the 383 covid-19 patients with median 18 days range 4 to 50 days follow-up
period 334 872 were discharged and survived and 49 128 died the clinical
characteristics of all patients stratified by admission platelets are presented in table i the median age was 46 years and 162 423 patients were
male no significant differences in comorbidities were observed between patients with
thrombocytopenia and non-thrombocytopenia patients with thrombocytopenia at admission
were likely older and had a higher apache ii score than those with non-thrombocytopenia
most patients were administered with antibiotics and some were treated with ribavirin
883 oseltamivir 256 and arbidol 209 empiric systemic glucocorticoid therapy
582 and intravenous immunoglobulin 561 were used for anti-inflammatory treatment
noninvasive ventilation was used on 51 patients 133 the thrombocytopenia group had a
higher proportion of noninvasive ventilation therapy 265 vs 105 and mortality rate
309 vs 89 than those without thrombocytopenia the dynamic changes in platelet
count from day 1 to day 14 after the onset of the disease were tracked to determine the
major clinical features observed during covid-19 progression compared with that for
non-survivors the level of platelets showed an increasing trend for survivors after
admission p  005 figure 1 additionally
platelets were negatively associated with apache ii score higher of which indicates the
higher disease severity at admission figure 2
at admission patients with thrombocytopenia had lower white blood cell neutrophil and
lymphocyte count and higher levels of procalcitonin and c-reactive protein compared with
those without thrombocytopenia table i remarkable differences
were found in the levels of total bilirubin aspartate aminotransferase blood urea
nitrogen creatinine and d-dimer these indicators were significantly higher in patients
with thrombocytopenia than in those without thrombocytopenia decreased levels of
pao2fio2 were observed in the thrombocytopenia group compared with
those in the non-thrombocytopenia group analysis of platelet parameters revealed that
patients with thrombocytopenia had lower levels of platelets and pct and higher levels of
mpv and p-lcr than those without thrombocytopeniacox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for several death-related risk factors
at admission including age sex baseline comorbidities lymphocyte count blood lactate
c-reactive protein glucocorticoid therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin the results
revealed that after adjustment for potential confounders platelets and pct were independent

iii in the analysis of 261 patients with a platelet count below
200  109l the association was still robust a smoothing spline was further
plotted to visually present the non-linear relationship between platelets at admission and
mortality we observed the mortality decreased with elevating platelet count and the curve
gradually tends to be gentle when platelet count 200  109l figure 3a continuous tracking of the changes in platelets within the
first 7 days after admission revealed that when platelets increased the risk of death
decreased during the treatment and vice-versa figure 3b further
analysis showed that the worst outcome was noted in the subgroup of patients with a platelet
level 200  109l at admission and decrease in 7 days followed by patients
with a platelet level 200  109l at admission and increase in 7 days
patients with a platelet level 200  109l at admission and decrease in
7 days and patients with a platelet level 200  109l at admission and increase in 7 days

patients with covid-19 usually have a rapid progression of pneumonitis and even develop
ards and death among the 383 covid-19 patients enrolled most were admitted with platelets
in the normal range and a few had thrombocytopenia although the majority of current
studies revealed a decreased number of platelets in groups with severe covid-19 67 no research has investigated the
dynamic changes of platelets and estimated the association of baseline platelets and
platelets change with subsequent mortality in patients infected with sars-cov-2 in the
present study clinical characteristics were compared between patients with and without
thrombocytopenia cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to adjust for several
death-related risk factors at admission our study highlights the following a
thrombocytopenia at admission was associated with mortality that is almost three times
higher than that in patients without thrombocytopenia b platelet count was an independent
risk factor for covid-19 mortality and c the dynamic changes of platelets were closely
related to death during treatment our study highlights that platelet monitoring might be
important for covid-19 prognosisenhanced platelet activation leading to platelet deposition in damaged pulmonary blood
vessels has been supported by various clinical studies and thrombocytopenia is an important
feature of sars 1112
thrombocytopenia has exceeded 50 incidence rate in patients with sars and is an important
indicator of poor prognosis 1315 a
meta-analysis with 1779 covid-19 patients reported that thrombocytopenia was associated with
threefold-enhanced risk of severe covid-19 and an lower platelet count was observed with
mortality 16 similar to this study the current work confirmed
that thrombocytopenia at admission is associated with death in patients with covid-19
platelets in patients with sars are negatively correlated with their svcam-1 levels svcam-1
is involved in adhesion and chemotaxis and contributes to early vascular injury and
suppression of t cell function vascular injury or immunosuppression may explain the poor
outcome 17 by using the cox regression model for multivariate
analysis we found that platelets and pct are independent risk factors that predict death
although platelets were routinely measured daily the role of platelets and pct in
predicting the outcome of patients with covid-19 has not been previously reported and the
correlation between platelet dynamics and disease prognosis has not been studied different
platelet thresholds have been used in epidemiological studies for the incidence risk
factors and consequences of thrombocytopenia among critically ill patients 1819 in our cohort a non-linear
relationship between platelets at admission and mortality was observed and the trend tends
to be gentle when platelet count 200  109l figure
3a further analysis showed that patients with a platelet level
200  109l at admission and decrease in 7 days had the highest mortality
rate whereas those with a platelet level 200  109l at admission and increase in 7 days
had the lowest mortality rate moreover thrombocytopenia had a close relationship with
prognosis even within the normal reference range the dynamic changes of platelets within
the first 7 days after admission were negatively correlated with the prognosis cox
proportional hazards regression models displayed a 40 decrease in mortality risk for every
50  109l increase in platelets in summary platelet count is an important
prognostic marker for patients with covid-19 and the dynamic levels of platelets during
treatment are closely associated with death pct was calculated from platelet count and its
levels at admission still retained a detrimental effect on clinical outcome 20the mechanism of sars-cov-2 on thrombocytopenia is poorly understood but several potential
explanations are considered 21 histological examinations of
lung necropsy from patients with covid-19 revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with
cellular fibromyxoid exudates and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates as
dominated by lymphocytes this finding has raised the possibility of immunopathological
damage for lung tissues 22 damaged lung tissues would cause
platelet activation and aggregation in the lungs and thrombi formation at the site of the
injury may lead to the consumption of platelets and megakaryocytes in addition sars-cov-2
induces a low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulopathy state characterized by the
elevation of d-dimers and fibrinogen and further increases the consumption of platelets in
damaged lungs the lungs may be the sites of platelet release from mature megakaryocytes
23 inflammation and long-term oxygen treatment also result
in extensive alveolar damage and other pulmonary pathological changes the pulmonary
capillary bed is morphologically altered thus further affecting the lung megakaryocyte
fragmentation and megakaryocytopoiesis the increased consumption and decreased production
of platelet may affect thrombocytopenia similar to sars coronavirus sars-cov-2
thrombocytopenia may involve other mechanisms this new condition may directly infect
hematopoietic precursor cells and inhibit their growth cd 13 and cd66a are expressed on
human bone marrow cd34 cells sars-cov-2 may induce growth inhibition by binding to the
cd13 or cd66a of hematopoietic cells and bone marrow stromal cells resulting in abnormal
hematopoiesis and immunodeficiency 21 the body undergoes
immune-mediated hematopoietic stem cell damage thereby further leading to
thrombocytopeniathis study is subjected to several limitations first as an observational study we cannot
conclude that the reported associations between platelet parameters and mortality are
causal second we cannot exclude the possibility of remaining residual confounding or
unmeasured potential confounders third the pathological mechanism of platelet parameters
in the progression of covid-19 remains poorly defined and further clinical and basic
research are necessary to clarify this issue although this study is the first to identify
the association between platelet parameters and mortality risk in patients with covid-19 a
large-scale and multi-center study is warranted to confirm these findingsthis hospital-based cohort study among 383 confirmed patients with covid-19 revealed an
association of baseline platelets and platelets change with subsequent mortality hence
monitoring platelets during hospitalization may be important in the prognosis of patients
with sars-cov-2diabetes mellitus dm is a complex chronic disease characterized by high blood glucose absolute and relative insulin deficiency it includes type1 diabetes type 2 diabetes and special type diabetes among them the morbidity of type 2 diabetes was the highest the global prevalence of t2 dm in 2017 is estimated to be 463 billion1 in 2017 the total number of deaths caused by high fasting plasma at all ages was 65 million of which type 2 diabetes accounted for 1 million deaths2 novel coronavirus pneumonia covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is seriously endangering human life and health and property safety march 11 2020 by the world health organization who announced as a global pandemic3 many early studies have found that patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes are more severe and have worse prognosis48 a number of retrospective analysis of patients with covid-19 showed that the prevalence of diabetes patients increased in varying degrees and the condition was usually more serious than that of general patients911 the analysis in china by chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc shows that the mortality combined with diabetic patients is 73 while the overall mortality is 2312 the national institutes of health in italy reported that the prevalence of diabetes in patients who died of sars-cov-2infection was 35513 according to the preliminary data from the american centers for disease control and prevention on march 28 2020 diabetes is the most common basic health condition among the people infected with sars-cov-2 about 109 furthermore it is estimated that 32 of the patients who need to be admitted to icu14 diabetic patients are more likely to suffer from serious infection due to hyperglycemia chronic inflammatory state microcirculation damage and other factors15 it was found that type 2 diabetes may increase the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 in the lung16 the novel coronavirus pneumonia is promoted by ace2 as a binding site of sars-cov-2 but the decrease of ace2 expression may result in severe lung injury after infection17 serious infections serious diseases and glucocorticoids can damage insulin sensitivity so infectious diseases lead to high mortality of diabetic patients18 however covid-19 mortality combined with diabetes is still not clear the duration age gender race and blood glucose control of diabetes may have effect on the mortality of covid-19 our study will solve that by meta-analysis and it is very necessarythe report of

 the outbreak was caused by a novel sars coronavirus sarscov in 2012 another epidemic of novel coronavirus broke out in the middle east region and spread globally and in the winter of 2019 yet another novel coronavirus outbreak occurred this overview aims to compare and contrast the similarities and differences of the these three major episodes of coronavirus epidemics we also aim to highlight the pediatric perspective of these entities which generally has received less attention in current literaturesars is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the sars coronavirus sarscov the origin of sarscov is still unsettled and remains a controversial subject to date sarscov is phylogenetically divergent from other coronaviruses associated with human infections such as oc43 nl63 229e and hku1 but is closely related to civet and bat covs
4
 however none of the currently known bat severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronaviruses sarscov is thought to be the direct ancestor of sarscov
5
 sars was the first severe and readily transmissible new communicable disease of the 21st century
6

the epidemic first started around midnovember 2002 in guangzhou where at least two patients had atypical pneumonia of unknown cause
7
 the initial cases were meat handlers who had regular contact with wild game
4
 shortly after similar cases were reported in five cities in guangdong province however no escalation of public health measures was announced by february 2003 the outbreak had unfolded and there were 305 cases reported with five mortalities
7
 later in the same month the sars outbreak started in hong kong initiated by a physician who traveled from guangzhou to hong kong the virus quickly spread within his admission hospital and into the broader communitybetween november 2002 and july 2003 this outbreak of sars in southern china caused an eventual 8098 cases worldwide resulting in 774 deaths reported in 29 countries with the majority of cases in china and hong kong 96 casefatality rate according to the who
8
 in hong kong 1755 people were infected and 299 died 386 infected cases were healthcare workers and eight of them died
8
 
9
 no case of sars has been reported worldwide since 2004 however suspicious cases were reported from time to time
3

the incubation period for sarscov is between 2 and 10 days with a mean of 5 days and up to 13 days symptoms usually develop 2 to 10 days after the initial infection the immune response includes immunoglobulin m igm antibody to the sarscovthis peaks during the acute or early convalescent phase week 3 and declines by week 12 igg antibody is produced later and peaks at week 12
10

the first symptom of sars is fever of 38c 1004f or higher followed by nonspecific flulike symptoms such as chillsrigor muscle aches and pain headaches diarrhea sore throat runny nose and malaise the symptoms usually last about 2 to 7 days affected patients may develop a dry cough shortness of breath and pneumoniain severe cases the patient can develop respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in the sars outbreak of 2003 about 9 of patients with confirmed sars infection died
11
 the mortality rate was much higher for those over 60 years old with mortality rates approaching 50 for this subset of patients
11

in the sars epidemic there were around 135 pediatric sars cases reported worldwide the majority of them in hong kong
12
 
13
 
14
 
15
 
16
 in pediatric cases the presenting features can be nonspecific hence a postive contact history and environmental exposure became very important diagnostic clues fever was a consistent symptom in all affected children and lasted for a median duration of 6 days while other common symptoms included cough 60 and nausea or vomiting 41
12
 
13
 
17
 teenage patients present with symptoms of malaise myalgia chill and rigor in addition to cough and respiratory symptoms similar to those of adults while the younger children presented mainly with cough and runny nose
13
 the symptoms and clinical course were milder and shorter in young children lymphopenia was an important laboratory finding but more severe among teenagers
13
 the most prominent radiological features included patchy infiltrates opacities and areas of consolidation predominantly in the lower lobes
14

no pediatric mortalities were reported in the literature
12
 in a case series of 43 children with sars in hong kong five required picu care and one patient required invasive ventilatory support
17
 
18
 children who were 12 years of age or younger generally had a milder illness and more favorable outcome
12
 the pathophysiology of a milder disease course in children is not clear and proposed yet putative mechanisms include relatively low dosage of ribavirin shorter course of corticosteroids and a less mature immune system resulting in less autoinflammatory injury in the young
19

followup of sars patients at 6 months after the illness only showed mild residual changes in exercise tolerance and pulmonary function
12
 osteonecrosis was reported in children whose sars treatment included steroids they remained mostly asymptomatic and managed conservatively
16

there were two reported cases of transmission from children to adults and no reports of transmission from children to children
6
 as to vertical transmission in all reported cases of maternal sars during pregnancy the infants survived and no perinatal transmission was detected
6

in summary respiratory symptoms are milder and nonrespiratory symptoms are present in pediatric patientsmiddle east respiratory syndrome mers is a viral respiratory infection caused by the merscoronavirus merscov like sarscov merscov is a betacoronavirus likely derived from bats with camels as an intermediate host a strain of mershcov known as erasmus medical center emc2012 that was isolated from an infected person in london in 2012 was found to have a 100 match to a virus that affected egyptian tomb bats camels have been shown to have antibodies to merscov and are believed to be involved in its spread to humans but it is still unclear how and to what extend this contributed to the outbreak
20

the first identified case occurred in 2012 in saudi arabia and most cases have occurred in the arabian peninsula
20
 on 22 september 2012 the united kingdom informed who of a case of acute respiratory syndrome with renal failure in a previously healthy 49yearold male qatari national with travel history to saudi arabia and qatar the health protection agency confirmed the presence of a novel coronavirus human betacoronavirus 2c who coined the interim case definition of severe respiratory disease associated with novel coronavirus on 25 september which was revised on 29 september to severe acute respiratory infections associated with novel coronavirus infection sari associated with ncov notably the definition of sars for surveillance is not used while the symptoms and viral etiology all fulfilled the sars definition the department of health in hong kong included severe respiratory disease associated with novel coronavirus as a statutorily notifiable disease originally named human coronavirus emc2012 the virus was finally given the name middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscovfrom september 2012 to january 2020 who has been informed of a total of 2519 laboratoryconfimed mers cases globally including 858 associated deaths 344 casefatality rate from 27 countries it is not known if this staggering mortality is related to elusive milder cases that had escaped identification cases of mers mainly originated from countries in the middle east and 84 of human cases have been reported in saudi arabia
21
 cases have also been reported in france germany and the united kingdom with all european cases having had a direct or indirect connection to the middle east in france and the united kingdom there had been limited local transmission among close contacts who had not been to the middle east but had been in contact with a traveler who recently returned from the middle east the largest outbreak outside middle east occurred in the republic of korea in 2015 resulting in 186 cases and 39 deaths
21
 no cases of mers have been reported in hong kongthe mean incubation period for merscov is 52 days and ranges from 2 to 13 days symptoms may range from mild to severe and include fever cough diarrhea and shortness of breathspread between humans typically involves close contact with an infected person humantohuman transmission has been limited and mainly among family members and healthcare workers there have been clusters of cases in healthcare facilities where infection prevention and control practices were suboptimal however its spread was uncommon outside of hospitals
20
 
22
 overall 179 of the cases reported were healthcare workers
21
 there have been no reports of sustained humantohuman transmission thus its risk to the global population is currently deemed to be fairly low
20
 the high morbidity associated with mers may be spurious due to bias of inadequate sampling that had missed a much larger denominator with elusive milder cases
23

as of 2019 there was no specific vaccine or treatment for the disease a number of antiviral medications were being studied
20
 the who recommends that those who come in contact with camels wash their hands frequently and not touch sick camels and that camelbased food products should be appropriately cooked in essence symptomatic and supportive treatments constitute therapiesof the cases reported to who 208 had mild to no symptoms while 465 had severe disease or died
21
 mers is typically more severe in those with other health problems more than half of the reported cases had had comorbidities eg diabetes mellitus hypertension heart disease chronic renal failure or lung disease which might explain the high mortality rate
20
 
21
 the overall risk of death may be lower than reported as those with mild symptoms may be undiagnosed
24

the rate of pediatric merscov infection is relatively low in comparison to adults
23
 a large saudi arabian study that screened for merscov by polymerase chain reaction pcr testing in a selected atrisk population including 8032 children 14 years old found 01 who tested positive when compared with 07 in adults
25
 the most common source of infection was household contact and acquired infection within a healthcare facility
26

approximately 42 of affected children are asymptomatic
26
 the most common presenting symptoms are fever 57 vomiting 28 diarrhea 28 and cough 14
26
 the severity is lower in comparison to the adult population in one series of 31 pediatric cases only one patient required intensive care support and there were no deaths
26
 only two fatal pediatric merscov cases were found in the literature and both cases had comorbidities infantile nephrotic syndrome and cystic fibrosis
27

the culprit of the recent pandemic in 2020 termed by the who as coronavirus disease2019 covid19 is yet another novel coronavirus now named sarscov2 the ultimate origin of sarscov2 is believed to be bats with a possible unknown intermediate host possibly pangolins transmitting the virus to humans
28
 
29

in december 2019 a provincial health commission in china reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown cause in wuhan of hubei province the symptom onset date for the first patient identified was 1 december 2019
30
 according to wuhan health officials the pneumonia appeared to be viral in nature and patients were placed in isolation potential causes including influenza avian infleuenza adenovirus sarscov and merscov were ruled out
31
 since there was highly suggestive evidence that the outbreak was associated with exposure in wuhans huanan seafood wholesale market the market was closed on 1 january 2020
32
 from 31 december 2019 to 3 january 2020 a total of 44 cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology from wuhan of hubei province were reported to the who the virus was identified to be a new type of coronavirus on 7 january 2020 thailand reported the first case outside china on 13 january 2020 subsequently cases were reported from other provinces in china japan and south korea the epidemic has since been spreading rapidly and exponentially worldwide the first known serious outbreak outside mainland china happened on the diamond princess cruise ship where more than 700 people were infected and six died the first case in hong kong was confirmed on 22 january 2020 in a patient who returned from wuhan
33
 at the time of writing there are in excess of 36 million confirmed covid19 cases and more than 257 000 deaths globally the casefatality rate being 7
34
 however in the absence of sufficient testing to determine the true levels of morbidity this number should be viewed as an approximationthe mean incubation period for sarscov2 is estimated to be between 2 and 14 days with an average of 5 days
35
 there is evidence of humantohuman transmission through droplets or direct contact and precautions should be practiced in the healthcare settings to prevent airborne transmission which may be underestimated among many uncertainties about this novel virus
36
 there have been confirmed cases in healthcare workers and the reported cases were 38 and 20 of the total confirmed cases in china and italy respectively
31
 
37
 
38
 with the ascertainment of asymptomatic carriage the risk of transmission within the community is very high
39
 the most common symptoms include fever cough dyspnea myalgia or fatigue
30
 in a series of 41 cases only a few patient had prominent upper respiratory tract signs even though abnormalities in chest computed tomography ct images were detected among all patients
30
 ct chest scans have a higher sensitivity for diagnosis of covid19 as compared with pcr swab samples and the findings include bilateral subpleural groundglass opacities with air bronchograms illdefined margins and a slight predominance in the right lower lobe
40
 
41
 indeed ct chest abnormalities are now diagnostic criteria in the latest novel coronavirus diagnosis and treatment plan published by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china
42

in a report of 72 314 cases prepared by the chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc a majority 809 of the cases were classified as mild while 47 were critical cases
31
 the age group 80 years old had the highest casefatality rate at 148
31

treatment is mainly supportive as no antiviral treatment has been clinically proven to be effective against sarscov2 and there are no standard treatment guidelines recommended by the who the protease inhibitors lopinavirritonavir can be considered but the results of a recent clinical trial are discouraging
43
 remdesivir and chloroquine have been shown to have good inhibitory effect on sarscov2 in vitro
44
 remdesivir is now undergoing phase ii clinical trials in treating patients with covid19
45
 hydroxychloroquine sometimes in combination with azithromycin has been widely used in both europe and the us with little evidence of efficacy and early analyses point to increased risk and higher mortality
46
 
47

longterm outcome for covid19 patients is yet to be determined the guangdong centre of disease control and prevention reported that about 14 of recovered patients were tested postive for sarscov2 in followup checks several weeks after discharge this is deemed most likely due to residual rna in clinical samples rather than reinfection
48
 given that a robust test has yet to be developed speculations about results of the testing include false negativity at the time of discharge inadequate specimen less desirable site of specimen acquisition eg specimen taken from the throat vs the nasopharynx testing discrepancies new tests finding the virus in the lower respiratory tract and reinfectionfortunately infants and children have rarely been involved in the recent covid19 outbreak a systemic review of the literature showed that children accounts for 1 to 5 of diagnosed covid19 cases
49
 in the united states 17 of the reported covid19 cases were under 18 years old while in mainland china and italy 13 of the reported covid19 cases were less than 19 years old
50
 
51
 
52
 contact and travel history are common in a case series of 28 confirmed pediatric patients in china all were either family clusters or had a close contact history
53
 the first reported pediatric case in hong kong was an imported case with a 16yearold boy returning from the diamond princess cruisemost infected children had relatively milder symptoms and recovered within 1 to 2 weeks
53
 several of the patients had no overt clinical symptoms and were found by positive screening of infected close contacts
53
 a study reviewing the epidemiology of 2135 pediatric cases in china revealed the proportion of severe and critical illness to be higher in the younger age group in particular infants
54
 in the report by the us centres for disease control and prevention among the aged less than 1 year with known hospitalized status 62 were hospitalized compared to 41 to 14 among those aged 1 to 17 years
50
 around 2 of the pediatric cases require admission to the intensive care which is low comparing to the adult population
55
 there were less than 10 pediatric deaths reported worldwide
31
 
50

children may play a major role in communitybased viral transmission and there were evidence of covid19 infections in children occurring early in the epidemic
56
 
57
 there is no convincing evidence of vertical transmission to neonates so far with only a couple of studies finding igm in neonatal blood but no viral rna in samples from the respiratory tract
58
 
59
 however early onset covid19 disease in neonates has been reported
60

the reason for the decreased incidence in childhood is yet to be clarified but it has been postulated that children are less susceptible to covid19 because of lesser maturity and function of ace2 receptor the cell entry receptor of sarscov2 compared to adults
61
 
62
 
63

officials and experts compared similarities and differences of the acronyms and believed that they are all novel and impactful syndromes they may have fever respiratory symptoms history of contact or travel an animal vector and a novel coronavirus and significant mortality and morbidity there are relatively minimal or no differences in these acronyms except for the nomenclatures table 1 the fact that a significant number of patients with covid19 are mildly symptomatic vs patients with sars and mers with low mortality rates reflects that sarscov2 resembles other common circulating respiratory viruses however the lack of any population immunity against sarscov2 gives it the ability to cause high attack rates which can overwhelm and cripple healthcare systems if not managed carefullysimilarities and differences between sars mers and covid19 are tabulated hereunder table 1 it is perhaps unnecessary to coin confusing and seemingly different acronyms for each of these recurring epidemics and coronaviruses
1
 
64
 
65
 the virus for covid19 could have been called cov19 or the epidemic caused by sarcov2 as sars19 assuming the next cov epidemic may recur every 8 years in 2027 the epidemic can be called covid27 and the virus cov27 they are often severe always acute and have pneumonia with respiratory tract symptoms among the more severe cases in other words severe acute respiratory syndromes presenting with severe acute respiratory symptoms are here to stay and they are just like sars
3
 
66

the syndrome approach as in sars as opposed to disease approach as in covid has its pros and cons table 2
1
 
67
 health organizations and authorities should provide consistent definitions for index surveillance epidemiological and prognostication studies and refrain from the temptation of coining unnecessary new terminology to describe essentially the same conditions when outbreaks of severe respiratory infection occurs
13
 
65
 travel or contact history is pivotal in formulating management protocol during any outbreak when the pathogen is not initially clear
2
 
68
 history of travel or contact provide important clues to emerging infections as evidenced during coronavirus outbreaks in 2003 and 2012 swine influenza pandemic in 2009 as well as the avian influenza outbreak in 2013 in 2003 the who coined the term sars for severe acute respiratory syndrome in patients with a relevant travelcontact history and pneumonia symptoms any patient in an epidemic area with fever and cough would be diagnosed as sars by who definition in 2003 the clinical features are essentially the same as for any respiratory viral infections or pneumonitis toward the end of the 2003 epidemic sarscov was identified to be the culprit subsequently it was realized that the clinical features of many patients with laboratory sars confirmed by laboratory testing were neither severe nor respiratory in nature nevertheless imprecise definition carries serious public health implications as patients may be erroneously quarantined and cities stigmatized conceptually we could think of the infections as a confluence of factors pathogens viral bacterial exposure travel contact history vector bat camel infectious status exposed but not infected asymptomatic carrier infectious disease syndrome during early phrase of disease as in sars and mers and disease during late stage when the process becomes apparent as in covid19apart from the epidemics and novelty of names these coronavirus are similar in nature and not particularly novel in their clinical presentation lower prevalence of these coronavirus diseases in children might be explained by lower exposure in the pediatric population and as the symptoms are less severe and can even be asymptomatic in children some cases are not diagnosed research to compare the immunopathogenesis of children and adults in responding to sarscov2 infection might lead to discovery of the possible pathogenesis and treatment strategies for these recurrent novel coronavirus diseases if the opportunity to study this is missed during this epidemic we might need to wait for another few years before this mystery can be solvedthe most vulnerable population of the society might be the answer to the treatment of coronaviruslessons to learn in the past 17 years since the first sars outbreak include a coronavirus could cause a major global public health crisis every 8 to 9 years b sars mers and covid19 are overlapping syndromes that may be associated with severe ards and associated with different coronaviruses c pediatric infection by novel coronaviruses is milder and d treatment is primarily symptomatic in nature at the time of writing the most urgent issue at present is to control the covid19 pandemic vaccination could be an answer to this crisis but it is likely to take more than a year to develop and manufacture at scale for the worldwide population as the global battle against the coronavirus continues alertness in personal hygiene mass maskwearing in the community early prompt quarantine vigilant contact tracing surveillance program for testing suspected cases and measures to prevent healthcare related transmission are all the key factors to our success in the global management of coronavirus disease pandemicthis review compares three distinct entities sharing a commonality of a virus the pediatricians view is relief that children are globally far less affected by these infections and the threat is predominantly that asymptomatic children may transmit the virus to vulnerable adults the larger view however is that the current epidemic is by far more concerning in its impact on morbidity and mortality around the globe it stands to reason that some of the pernicious profile of todays pandemic is related to delayed recognition of its magnitude and virulence that allowed for spread that went out of control starting in china and followed by the us however the disturbing questions about this apparent evolution from relatively smallscale epidemics to a global pandemic are whether this has to do with a serendipitous evolution of a virus with inherently more potent infectivity and transmissibility and if so what are the determinants of these characteristics whether beyond the virus there might be environmental changes that have occurred over the twodecade history of these infections that enhance its spread such as rising temperatures or other yet to be determined atmospheric changes it is hoped that because of the devastation that covid19 carries in its wake large efforts will be invested in a search for answers to these questions and with that we will all be able to be wiser in dealing with the threats of the future this will require the combined efforts of a global community since the current events clearly manifested our interconnectedness and interdependence and hence shared vulnerability in the face of a calamity of previously unexperienced magnitudesince december 2019 patients with unexplained pneumonia have been found in wuhan hubei province china
1
 on 7 january 2020 chinese authorities confirmed that the cause was a novel coronavirus that had not been previously identified different from other coronaviruses such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov in 2012 to 2015 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov in 2003 on 12 january 2020 the world health organization who temporarily named this new virus 2019 novel coronavirus 2019ncov with the spread of the disease novel coronavirus cases have been found in other parts of china and other countries in the world as an ongoing coronavirus outbreak the chinese government has paid great attention to this situation on 21 january 2020 the national health commission of the peoples republic of china announced 2019ncov pneumonia as a category b infectious disease and preventive and control measures were taken according to category a infectious diseaseon 30 january 2020 the who declared that the 2019ncov epidemic constitutes a public health emergency of international concern soon after that the novel coronavirusinfected pneumonia was officially named covid19 coronavirus disease 2019 by the who on 11 february 2020 at the same time the international virus classification commission announced that the novel coronavirus was named sarscov2 with the development of pathogenic testing and the continuous accumulation of clinical cases people have acquired a certain degree of knowledge and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease this article presents the currently known epidemiological characteristics clinical manifestations laboratory findings and experiences in the prevention and treatment of covid19 providing references for the prevention and treatment of this diseasesarscov2 is the seventh type of coronavirus isolated in humans this coronavirus belongs to the genus  and has an envelope its particles are round or oval often polymorphic and 60 to 140 nm in diameter the genetic characteristics of sarscov2 are significantly different from those of sarscov and merscov current research shows that sarscov2 has more than 85 homology with bat sarslike coronavirus batslcov zc45
2
 therefore it is now believed that the original host of sarscov2 may have been rhinolophus sinicus
3
 a study team from south china agricultural university pointed out that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts of sarscov2 through which the virus may spread to humans relevant research teams are being organized by the chinese government to further support this view the outbreak is considered to be closely related to wuhans huanan wholesale seafood market
4
 
5
 
6
 
7
 epidemiological surveys have shown that 27 of 41 people with the earliest onset have visited the market
8
 post hoc investigations also revealed that there was a wildlife trade in this market and sarscov2 has also been isolated from the markets environment humantohuman transmission emerged shortly thereafter
9
 patients with covid19 have become the main source of infection covid19 may be capable of transmission during the incubation period
10
 
11
 these patients are difficult to diagnose and isolate in time which causes great difficulties in the prevention and control of the disease however up to date there is no enough evidence to support the role of asymptomatic patients in the transmission of covid19 in addition the presence of the virus can be detected in patients during the recovery stage especially in fecal specimens requiring longer detoxification times indicating the possible risk of fecaloral transmission
11
 sarscov2 is a positivestranded rna virus that is susceptible to gene mutation and recombination but so far no significant mutations have been found in humans or the environment
2
 
12

at present droplets inhaled into the respiratory tract and contact transmission are considered to be the most important routes of transmission there is no direct evidence showing that covid19 can be transmitted through aerosols the who believes that further evidence is needed to assess the possibility of aerosol transmission however some of the observations suggest that aerosol propagation is possible under the condition of long exposure to high concentrations of aerosols in a relatively closed environment in the early stages of the outbreak of sarscov2 pneumonia it is uncertain whether stool samples from patients are infectious however lu et al
2
 using a computer structural simulation found that the sprotein of sarscov2 can bind to human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 in the spatial conformation after that letko et al
13
 synthesized the sprotein of sars and the receptorbinding domain rbd of sarscov2 in vitro and reacted with known human coronavirus receptors respectively as a result the rbd of sarscov2 is similar to the s protein in sars and it can directly bind to human ace2 ace2 is a metalloproteinase belonging to a type i transmembrane glycoprotein and it can be expressed in the small intestine
14
 
15
 in our laboratory it was also found that nucleic acid amplification testing of stool samples can still be positive for a long time after oral swab samples become negative in addition a large number of clinical studies have shown that a certain proportion of sarscov2 pneumonia patients develop symptoms of diarrhea
10
 
16
 it can be concluded that during the development of the disease there is a greater possibility of the virus in the stool recently sarscov2 has been isolated from the stool of confirmed patients in wuhan and shenzhen china and in the united states
17
 indicating that the virus can replicate and survive in the digestive tract however it is not clear whether the infection and transmission are caused by eating food contaminated with the virus through the analysis of the current epidemic situation some scholars believe that viruses in feces may be retransmitted by the aerosol formation of viruscontaining droplets sarscov2 also has adverse effects on fetuses and infants including restricted intrauterine growth premature birth spontaneous abortion and perinatal death
18
 however the possibility of intrauterine mothertochild transmission of covid19 is very low and neither of the two existing retrospective clinical studies have found direct evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission
19
 
20

covid19 is an emerging infectious disease so the population is not immune and is generally susceptible a report
16
 delineated 1099 patients with sarscov2 pneumonia from 552 hospitals in 31 provincesprovincelevel municipalities of china and found that the median age was 470 years old interquartile range iqr 350580 and that 419 of patients were females sarscov2 pneumonia was diagnosed throughout the whole spectrum of age a total of 09 of patients were aged below 15 years old another chinese analysis of 4021 confirmed cases showed that people of all ages were generally susceptible the study found that 7145 of patients were 30 to 65 years old and children under 10 years old accounted for 035
21
 those in close contact with patients with sarscov2 pneumonia including the family members of patients are at high risk for developing the sarscov2 infection medical staff who treat patients also have a high risk of infection nine percent of the patients admitted to zhongnan hospital of wuhan university from 1 to 28 january 2020 were the medical staff
22
 by the end of 29 january 2020 survey data from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces in china showed that the infection rate of medical staff was as high as 209
16

according to a who report as of 23 march 2020 the world has reported 332 930 confirmed cases of covid19 including 81 601 cases in china and 251 329 cases in other countries outside china the average mortality rate in china was 40 327681 601 while the average mortality rate outside china was 45 11 233251 329 hubei province the worstaffected province in china had an average mortality rate of 47 316067 801 the area in hubei province with higherthanaverage mortality rates in hubei province was wuhan 50 252450 006the mortality rates in other severely affected provinces in china were relatively lower than those in hubei province with mortality rates of 06 81428 in guangdong 17 221274 in henan 01 11240 in zhejiang and 04 41018 in hunan the above results are shown in figures 1 2 3 according to the available data the mortality rate of covid19 in china is lower than those of sars 10
23
 and mers 40
24
 by 23 march 2020 965 31603276 of the deaths caused by sarscov2 pneumonia in china was in hubei province and the earlier the onset of disease was the higher the mortality rate suggesting that the pathogenicity may gradually decrease as the virus spreads which may also occur because of the improving ability of medical staff to diagnose and treat the disease the national health commission of china notified on 4 february 2020 that the population is generally susceptible to the virus and more than 80 of the deaths are elderly people over 60 years old at the same time more than 75 of the deaths have underlying diseases overall men are linked to a higher risk of death the specific data in this section are shown in table 1a singlecentered retrospective observational study from one hospital of wuhan
29
 found among 52 critically ill patients with sarscov2 infection 32 615 patients had died at 28 days and the median duration from intensive care unit admission to death was 7 iqr 311 days in the nonsurvivors compared with survivors nonsurvivors were more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 26 81 vs 9 45 and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation 30 94 vs 7 35 a total of 30 81 of 37 patients requiring mechanical ventilation had died by 28 daysaccording to the data
30
 by 11 february 2020 among the 422 medical institutions involved in the diagnosis and treatment of sarscov2 pneumonia in china a total of 1716 medical workers were diagnosed with confirmed sarscov2 pneumonia among the 1688 confirmed cases with severity grading data 873 14741688 of the infected medical staff were in hubei province and 104 of the infected medical staff were seriously ill a total of 640 10801688 of new coronavirus infections among medical workers occurred in wuhan and the proportion of critically ill patients was 177 medical workers in other parts of china accounted for 127 2141688 with a proportion of critically ill patients of 70 the proportion of critically ill patients among medical workers in wuhan has gradually decreased from a peak of 389 to 127 by early february 2020 the average mortality rate for the 1688 diagnosed medical staff was 03the spread of sarscov2 pneumonia in china can be roughly divided into three stages 55 of the patients who developed symptoms before the end of december 2019 are related to the exposure at wuhans huanan wholesale seafood market therefore the first stage of epidemic transmission mainly occurred in a local outbreak among people with a direct contact history at the seafood market only 86 of the patients who became ill after 1 january 2020 had a history of exposure to wuhans huanan wholesale seafood market suggesting that the epidemic of sarscov2 pneumonia had now shifted to the second stage the community dissemination stage
31
 interpersonal and cluster transmission occurred in multiple communities and families in wuhan during this period

25 january 2020 was chinese new year also known as the spring festival which is the most important festival in china with the festival approaching a large number of migrant workers and people new to wuhan began to leave wuhan to travel to their hometowns in other provinces in china for family reunions or to start a vacation in other countries with the movement of people the epidemic quickly spread to other parts of china and other countries around the world and reached the stage of largescale transmission causing widespread concern in the international community
32
 
33

a retrospective study of 425 patients with sarscov2 pneumonia at the beginning of the epidemic before 22 january 2020 found that the average incubation period of the disease was 52 days 95 confidence interval 4170 and the p95 was 125 days in the early stages the epidemic doubling time was 74 days which means the number of infections doubled every 74 days the r0 was estimated to be 22 which means infecting two healthy people for every sick person
31
 additionally the who assessed the r0 of this epidemic as between 14 and 25
7

at the beginning of the outbreak the average time from onset to the first visit and the average time from onset to hospitalization was 58 and 125 days respectively for patients who developed the disease before 1 january 2020 and 46 and 91 days respectively for patients who developed disease between 1 and 11 january 2020
31
 a retrospective analysis of approximately 4021 confirmed sarscov2 pneumonia patients from various regions in china found that the average time from onset to confirmed diagnosis was 5 days and this time window was getting shorter as the epidemic progresses
21
 the confirmed times for patients who developed the disease before 14 january during 14 to 22 january and after 22 january were 14 6 and 1 day respectivelythis shows that with the development of the epidemic situation the diagnostic ability of chinese medical staff is rapidly improving the average time from symptom onset to the hospitalization of critically ill patients was 7 days and the average time from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis was 8 days which was significantly longer than that of mildly ill patients the average time from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis in death cases was 9 days and the average time interval from symptom onset to death was 95 days therefore early detection early diagnosis and early treatment are effective methods for reducing the severity and mortality of the disease
21

based on the analysis of existing retrospective studies

28
 the main manifestations of sarscov2 pneumonia patients were fever 896 15631745 and dry cough 670 11701745 additionally a small number of patients had symptoms such as the stuffy nose runny nose sore throat myalgia and diarrhea a total of 902 11571283 of patients had normal or decreased leukocyte counts 734 9821337 of patients had decreased lymphocyte counts and 812 11191378 of patients had abnormal pulmonary imaging it can be seen that patients with sarscov2 pneumonia had a fever andor respiratory symptoms in the early stages of onset the white blood cells were normal or reduced or with lymphocytopenia the proportion of abnormalities on chest computed tomography or xray was high
34
 therefore meeting two of the above three clinical manifestations at the same time with an epidemiological history or both conforming to the above three clinical manifestations was presented as the diagnostic criteria for suspected cases in chinas guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of covid19 if the suspected case has a positive result for a nucleic acid amplification assay or serological evidence immunoglobulin m igm antibody specific to sarscov2 was detected 35 days after onset or the titer of igg antibody specific to sarscov2 was increased by four times or more in the recovery period compared with the acute phase the case can be classified as confirmed according to statistics the proportion of critically ill patients among the confirmed cases is approximately 234 11985120
16
 
21
 the above results are shown in table 1 most of the 14 cases in children reported in the existing literature table 2 had an epidemiological history related to wuhan and almost all had family members that were confirmed patients except for one child who failed to see a doctor in time the others were all in mild condition among the seven cases reported in the existing literature outside china except for one case where the patient died the remaining cases were in stable condition table 3according to the latest data as of 23 march 2020 more than 73 159 patients with sarscov2 pneumonia have recovered and been discharged hubei and wuhan reported no new confirmed or suspected cases for 5 consecutive days and the number of confirmed cases continued to drop these results indicate that chinas preventions and treatments against covid19 have achieved good results in the past month or so china has issued a series of national recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections caused by sarscov2
45
 these recommendations have now been updated to version 7 recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection caused by sarscov2 in children were also drafted by the national clinical research center for child health childrens hospital zhejiang university school of medicine to further standardize the protocol for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection in children caused by sarscov2
46
 chinese medical workers have gradually formed some effective diagnosis and treatment strategies and methods in clinical practice of antiviral therapy and symptomatic treatment including a comprehensive series of diagnosis and treatment methods such as respiratory support circulatory support and immunity improvement to accelerate recovery
47
 antiviral drugs ganciclovir acyclovir and ribavirin and neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir paramivir zanamivir etc commonly used in clinical practice are ineffective on covid19 and are not recommended drugs that are possibly effective on covid19 include remdesivir lopinavirritonavir lopinavirritonavir combined with interferon convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies
48
 however the efficacy and safety of these drugs for sarscov2 pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials chinese researchers recently discovered that the antimalarial drug chloroquine phosphate has an effect on the treatment of sarscov2 pneumonia through drug screening and clinical trials preliminary evidence suggests that chloroquine phosphate can significantly reduce the exacerbation rate of patients with sarscov2 pneumonia has an antipyretic function can accelerate pulmonary inflammation recovery shorten the negative time and increase the negative conversion rate of viral nucleic acids and shorten the course of the disease in addition chloroquine phosphate is relatively safe and no serious adverse reactions related to the drug have been found so far the drug has been included in the latest edition of the chinese diagnosis and treatment guidelines for sarscov2 pneumonia treatment updated on 3 march 2020 to expand the scope of clinical trials however the efficacy of this drug should be further evaluated in clinical application use should be discontinued when there is an intolerable side effect patients with covid19 treated with chloroquine phosphate must have a normal electrocardiogram before medication the combination uses chloroquine phosphate with macrolides including azithromycin or other drugs that may cause a prolonged qt interval are prohibited in china however a study from france showed that azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination in covid19 patients in this study among hydroxychloroquinetreated patients six patients received azithromycin to prevent bacterial superinfection under daily electrocardiogram control 100 of patients were virologicaly cured

 although the study sample size was small the results require further confirmation however the study offers an insight whether this compound could be useful as chemoprophylaxis to prevent the transmission of the virus especially for health care workersthe principle of treatment for severe and critically ill cases is to actively prevent and treat complications treat underlying diseases prevent infection and provide timely organ function support based on symptomatic treatment clinical warning indicators and early intervention for patients were explored to reduce mortality additionally new treatments such as convalescent plasma therapy were developed the convalescent plasma therapy was developed using a virusfree plasma containing hightiter sarscov2 specific antibodies donated from rehabilitated patients this therapy will be applied clinically after virus inactivation antibody titer determination and multiple pathogenic microorganism determination on 22 january the chinese research group incorporated the preparation of exempt plasma from rehabilitated sarscov2 pneumonia patients into the scientific research emergency project the first plasma from patients with a recovery period was collected on 1 february 2020 and coronavirusfree plasma was then prepared on 9 february 2020 the first severely ill patient received sarscov2free plasma treatment at a hospital in wuhan and more patients subsequently received the therapy clinical studies have shown that sarscov2free plasma is safe and effective for critically ill patients the therapeutic method has been added to the latest guidelines version 6 for critically ill patients in addition china has organized several research groups to explore the role of chinese medicine in the prevention and treatment of covid19 and has achieved a certain effectzhejiang province is one of the provinces with the largest number of sarscov2 pneumonia patients in china as of 23 march 2020 a total of 1240 patients with sarscov2 pneumonia were diagnosed of which 1193 recovered and were discharged the most important thing is that to date only one patient has died from sarscov2 infection in this province the medical staff in this province have formed a unique zhejiang experience a within 72 hours of disease onset a combination of lopinavirritonavirabidol and interferon nebulization is used for antiviral treatment to reduce the damage to the cells caused by viral expansion and replication b glucocorticoids are mainly used in critically ill patients suffering inflammatory cytokine storm inhibition of excessive inflammation through timely administration of glucocorticoids in the early stage of inflammatory cytokine storm effectively prevents the occurrence of ards and protects the functions of the patients organs for patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation indicators rapid imaging progress and excessive inflammatory response the use of glucocorticoid in the short term 35 days is appropriate and the recommended dose is no more than equivalent to methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mgkgd some critically ill patients should use methods such as artificial liver and plasma exchange to block the cytokine storm c effective oxygen therapy is performed for patients d infection is actively prevented e nutritional support is strengthenedin clinical practice some mild patients can quickly progress to critical patients some characteristics of these patients were summarized in the diagnosis and treatment of covid19 trial version 7 from china in adults the following conditions indicate a worsening of the disease a progressive decline of peripheral blood lymphocytes b peripheral inflammatory factors such as interleukin 6 and creactive protein increased progressively c progressive increase of lactic acid d intrapulmonary lesions progress rapidly in a short period of timechildren with the following conditions are prone to develop into critical cases a increased respiratory rate b poor mental response and lethargy c progressive increase of lactic acid d imaging findings showed bilateral or multilobular infiltration pleural effusion or rapid progression in the short term e infants under 3 months of age or have underlying diseases congenital heart disease pulmonary dysplasia of the airway malformation of the respiratory tract abnormal hemoglobin severe malnutrition etc or have immunodeficiency longterm use of immunosuppressive agentsafter treatment covid19 patients can be discharged if they meet the following conditions temperature returns to normal for more than 3 days respiratory symptoms improve significantly pulmonary imaging shows significant improvement of acute exudative lesions negative nucleic acid test of respiratory tract specimens such as sputum and nasopharyngeal swab for two consecutive times sampling time should be at least 24 hours apart however it is now found that about 01 of patients will be tested positive for nucleic acid again after discharge

 there are many reasons for the positive nucleic acid test of discharged patients

 the reagent itself detection method sampling method and so on will affect the positive rate in addition the possibility of disease recurrence cannot be ruled out too genomic analysis of the virus from different regions different periods and different sources of patients revealed that sarscov2 was stable and showed no major variation so once the patient is cured with immunity against the virus there is little chance of reinfection the detection of sarscov2 specific igm and igg antibodies is an effective means to determine whether a patient has immunity against sarscov2 but these patients still have the potential to infect others therefore after the patient is discharged from the hospital it is recommended to continue the isolation management and health condition monitoring for 14 days here are some tips and considerations for selfisolation wear a mask live in a single room with good ventilation reduce close contact with family members separate meals good hand hygiene and avoid outdoor activities it is also recommended to visit the hospital for reexamination on the 14th and 28th days after dischargein the early stages of the epidemic the chinese government adopted the principles of four early and four centralization to address the epidemic so that the epidemic situation was effectively controlled the socalled four early principle is early detection early reporting early isolation and early treatment early detection and isolation of sarscov2infected people moving the prevention and control barrier forward accelerating the gridbased management of the community improving detection capabilities optimizing the diagnosis and treatment process and shortening the diagnosis time can effectively block the spread of the epidemic and reduce the infection rate the principle of four centralization is to centralize patients centralize experts centralize resources and centralize treatment patients with severe illness are centralized at the best hospital with the strongest comprehensive capacity for treatment at the same time to centralize resources and experts to treat critically ill patients multidisciplinary and comprehensive individualized diagnosis and treatment are applied in accordance with one person one strategy and finally the mortality rate is effectively reducedin addition more than 37 000 medical staff from other parts of china participated in the treatment of patients with sarscov2 pneumonia in wuhan hubei which fully reflects the noble qualities and good professionalism of chinese medical staffit has not been long since the occurrence of sarscov2 pneumonia there are relatively few reports in the literature and some opinions need to be further verified by multicenter big data in addition infectious diseases have different characteristics at different stages whether some of the findings and opinions have always been applicable needs further evaluationthe sarscov2 originated from the huanan seafood market in wuhan with bats as the likely original hosts and pangolins as potential intermediate hosts the current source of the disease is mainly patients infected with sarscov2 patients in the incubation period may also become sources of infection covid19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact and the population is generally susceptible the epidemic has experienced the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage caused by the wuhans huanan wholesale seafood market exposure and is now in the stage of largescale transmission caused by the spread of the epidemic the r0 at the beginning of the epidemic was 22 with an average incubation period of 52 days the proportion of critically ill patients was 234 the mortality was lower than those of sars and mers and 965 of the deaths occurred in hubei province where the outbreak first occurred among them elderly men with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate in the process of fighting against the covid19 chinese

acute pneumonia cases of unclear etiology were identified in wuhan city the capital of hubei province in china 13 the pathogen has been reported as a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the world health organization who has made the assessment that coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic because the disease is still spreading rapidly around the world especially in the united states spain and russia 4 as of may 26 a total of 82993 cases 4634 deaths were confirmed in china including 50340 cases 3869 deaths in wuhan city 5the national health commission of china has issued a series of diagnosis and treatment recommendations and suggested classifying the disease into four grades mild moderate severe and critical 5 recent studies have reported the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the varied severity grades of covid-19 1 2 68 the underlying mechanisms of the novel coronavirus leading to disease exacerbation and organ dysfunction remain to be further explored due to the high mortality and the lack of effective treatments in critically ill patients 7 9 early identification and prediction of these patients are crucial what are the risk factors for severe illness or death 10 how can we identify groups that are most likely to have poor outcomes so that we can focus prevention and treatment efforts 10 these studies are needed huang et al 8 reported that patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu had more severe clinical symptoms and more abnormal serum parameters however fewer studies have been published that confirm an early and sensitive biomarker to estimate the disease severity and prognosis of covid-19 during our clinical work against the covid-19 epidemic in wuhan we observed a high incidence of hypocalcemia in critically ill patients therefore we hypothesized that serum calcium levels were associated with the disease severity and prognosis of patients with covid-19 this study was performed to test this hypothesis and explore the causes of hypocalcemiathe median serum calcium levels were 212 iqr 204-220 mmoll on admission we divided the patients into three groups based on the serum calcium values 20 mmoll defined as group a n  43 20-22 mmoll defined as group b n  137 and 22 mmoll defined as group c n  61 as shown in table 2 significant differences in the clinical variables except for serum creatinine were found among the three groups and the same differences were found between groups a and b p 005 there were also differences in the clinical variables except for wbc count p 007 and serum creatinine p 0244 between groups a and c whereas differences in the variables except for wbc count p 060 alt p 0839 the lowest spo2 p 0328 and serum creatinine p 0635 were found between groups b and c these results indicated that patients with lower serum calcium levels had worse clinical variablesof the 241 patients 26 were tested to determine levels of parathyroid hormone pth and 25-hydroxy-vitamin d vd according to clinical needs the median serum calcium level of the 26 patients was 213 iqr 203-216 mmoll the median pth level was 5527 iqr 4273-7315 pgml and the median vd level was 1020 iqr 820-1265 ngml all of these patients had low levels of vd vd deficiencythe spss scatterplots and correlation analyses of serum calcium and the blood biomarkers are shown in figures 1 and 2 the serum calcium levels were significantly positively correlated with lymphocyte count figure 1a p 0001 albumin levels figure 1b p 0001 vd levels figure 1c p 0004 and lowest spo2 figure 1d p 0001 whereas they are significantly negatively correlated with crp figure 2a p 0001 d-dimer figure 2b p 0001 and pth figure 2c p 0048 levels these results indicated that hypocalcemia may be associated with imbalanced vd and pth in the acute phase of covid-19ards developed in 19 of 241 79 patients and liver injury developed in 16 66 aki developed in 14 58 and cardiac injury developed in 12 50 patients during the research period twelve patients received mv and 7 patients received crrt as shown in table 3 significant differences in the clinical severity and outcome variables were found among the abovementioned three groups a b and c p 0001 and between groups a and c p 0001 there were also differences in all these variables except for liver injury incidence p 0201 no differences were found between groups b and c p 005 these results indicated that patients with serum calcium values 20 mmoll had higher 28-day mortality and a higher incidence of organ injury moreover the serum calcium values were significantly lower in patients who died and in patients with mods septic shock and organ injury requiring mv or crrt p 0001 table 4roc curves were also performed to assess the associations between serum calcium and mods septic shock and 28-day mortality as shown in figure 3 the area under the curves aucs of mods figure 3a septic shock figure 3b and 28-day mortality figure 3c were 0923 p 0001 0905 p 0001 and 0929 p 0001 respectively optimal cut-off points of serum calcium values were derived from the roc curves the optimal cut-off point for mods was 2035 mmoll the sensitivity was 882 and the specificity was 826 the optimal cut-off point for septic shock was 201 mmoll the sensitivity was 1000 and the specificity was 843 the optimal cut-off point for 28-day mortality was 201 mmoll the sensitivity was 1000 and the specificity was 857 figure 4 shows the significant differences in the 28-day mortality among groups a b and c the 28-day mortality of group a was significantly higher than that of groups b or c p 0001 no difference was found between groups b and c p 005this clinical retrospective study investigated the correlations between serum calcium and clinical severity and outcomes in patients with covid-19 the incidence of hypocalcemia was 747 we found that patients with lower serum calcium levels especially 20 mmoll had worse clinical variables higher incidences of mods and septic shock and higher 28-day mortality hypocalcemia may be associated with imbalanced vd and pth in the acute phase of covid-19 the overall mortality was 41 10241 whereas the mortality of critically ill patients was increased to 400 1025the who declared that covid-19 was a pandemic because the disease is still spreading rapidly around the world 4 more than 5700000 patients have been diagnosed with covid-19 worldwide and nearly 360000 have died 4 although the national health commission of china and the who have issued a series of diagnosis and treatment recommendations the mortality of critically ill patients is still extremely high the underlying mechanisms of the novel coronavirus causing organ dysfunction are yet unknown it is crucial to identify the risk factors for severe illness or death 10 however few reports have been published to establish an early and sensitive biomarker to predict the disease severity and prognosis of covid-19 in this study we found that serum calcium levels were associated with the disease severity and prognosis of patients with covid-19hypocalcemia is common in critically ill patients the causes of hypocalcemia include oversecretion of pth vd deficiency decreased dietary intake hypoproteinemia hypomagnesemia drug interactions and so on 15 hypocalcemia was defined as a serum calcium level less than 22 mmoll in our clinical laboratory at present there is no specific severity grading system for hypocalcemia previous studies reported that serum calcium levels less than approximately 20 mmoll were associated with worse clinical outcomes in critically ill patients 1517 therefore we divided patients into three groups based on serum calcium values of 20 mmoll 20-22 mmoll and 22 mmoll we found that patients with serum calcium values 20 mmoll had higher 28-day mortality and a higher incidence of organ injury the findings of this study were consistent with previous reports however this was the first study to investigate the correlations between serum calcium and clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19 these results suggested that correcting hypocalcemia could be an important strategy to improve the prognosis of patients with covid-19 especially for patients with serum calcium values less than 2 mmoll in addition our study also revealed that hypocalcemia was associated with hypoproteinemia and imbalanced vd and pth in the acute phase of covid-19 hypoproteinemia and vd deficiency were also common and correlated with increased mortality in critically ill patients 18 19 therefore improvement of hypoproteinemia and imbalanced hormone levels may also be useful in the treatment of covid-19increased crp alt tni and d-dimer levels and lymphocytopenia were present in most critical covid-19 patients 2 7 8 our results also showed that patients with lower serum calcium values had higher levels of crp alt tni and d-dimer and lower lymphocyte counts the serum calcium values were significantly correlated with lymphocyte count and crp and d-dimer levels moreover crp and d-dimer were also indicators to predict the prognosis of critically ill patients 19 the findings of this study were consistent with previous reports and confirmed that serum calcium levels were associated with the disease severity and prognosis of patients with covid-19 the lung is the main organ affected by this disease in this study the median lowest spo2 was 970 iqr 960-980 range 80-99 and the spo2 values were significantly positively correlated with serum calcium levels patients with serum calcium values 20 mmoll had higher ards incidence while patients with ards also had lower serum calcium values these phenomena indicated that hypocalcemia might be crucial in the development of ards early diagnosis and treatment of hypocalcemia may alleviate organ injury in the acute phase of covid-19some limitations of the study should be discussed because of our single-center retrospective design and small sample size the results might be inconclusive and the accuracy should be confirmed by large-scale prospective clinical studies moreover because the study was not based on pathophysiological models the results were hypothesis generating and the exact mechanisms of hypocalcemia and vd deficiency should be tested by more fundamental experiments in addition the values of serum calcium were of total calcium rather than ionized calcium in this study which may not precisely reflect the extent of decreased calciumin conclusion this retrospective clinical study found that the incidence of hypocalcemia and vd deficiency was very high in patients with covid-19 hypocalcemia may be associated with imbalanced vd and pth levels patients with lower serum calcium levels especially 20 mmoll had worse clinical variables higher incidences of mods and septic shock and higher 28-day mortality the overall mortality of covid-19 was 41 whereas the mortality of critically ill patients was 400from february 10 to february 28 2020 adult patients age 18 years with confirmed covid-19 admitted to our specialized isolation units tongji hospital of huazhong university of science and technology in wuhan were enrolled in this clinical retrospective study patients with chronic organ dysfunction eg hepatic or renal dysfunction terminal cancer immunodeficiency and a history of long-term use of hormones were excluded written informed consent was waived by our institutional review board because this was a retrospective study that assessed deidentified data and included no potential risk to patients the diagnosis of covid-19 was made according to the who interim guidance and the recommendations of the national health commission of china 4 5 and confirmed by rna detection of sars-cov-2 in the clinical laboratory of tongji hospitalan identified case of covid-19 was defined as a positive finding by real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens 4 5 7 only laboratory-confirmed cases were enrolled in the analysis the clinical

risk of mortality 11 the diagnostic criteria of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards were in accordance with the berlin definitions 12 the definitions of acute kidney injury aki were based on the 2012 kidney disease improving global outcomes kdigo guidelines 13 cardiac injury was defined if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers eg troponin i were more than twice the reference upper limit or new abnormalities were found in electrocardiography and echocardiography 2 liver injury was defined if serum levels of hepatic biomarkers eg alanine aminotransferase were more than twice the reference upper limit or if there was disproportionate elevation of alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate aminotransferase ast levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels 14 multiple organ dysfunction syndrome mods was defined as the combined dysfunction of two or more organsthe baseline clinical characteristics including age sex days from onset to admission initial symptoms or signs and clinical classifications were collected from electronic medical records and all laboratory tests were performed according to the clinical needs of patients the levels of serum calcium c-reactive protein crp alt albumin creatinine troponin i tni and plasma d-dimer and white blood cell wbc count lymphocyte count and the lowest spo2 within 24 hours of admission were recorded the hormone levels associated with blood calcium eg parathyroid hormone 25-hydroxy-vitamin d were also recorded all blood parameters were detected by the clinical laboratory of tongji hospital moreover the numbers of patients with ards aki cardiac injury liver injury septic shock and mods and patients receiving noninvasive ventilation niv high-flow nasal cannula hfnc mv and continuous renal replacement therapy crrt were also recorded the primary endpoints were the development of septic shock mods and 28-day mortality the secondary endpoints were the other disease severity parameters eg organ injury or notthe kolmogorov-smirnov test was first performed to test the normal distribution of the data normally distributed data were expressed as the means  standard deviation and were compared by t tests abnormally distributed data were expressed as the medians interquartile ranges iqr and were compared by the mann-whitney u test or the kruskal-wallis test categorical variables were presented as absolute numbers or percentages and were analyzed using the 2 test or fishers exact test to take into account the repeated nature of the variables analysis of variance anova for repeated measurements of the general linear model was implemented receiver operating characteristic roc curves were used to evaluate the associations between serum calcium and septic shock mods and 28-day mortality ibm statistical package for the social sciences spss version 220 ny usa software was used for statistical analysis and p 005 was considered statistically significant spss scatterplots and a correlation analysis were performed to evaluate the relevance between serum calcium and blood biomarkers the statistical methods of this study were reviewed by qiao liu a biostatistician from the center for disease control and prevention of jiangsu province in chinapneumonia from a new novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 virus was detected in wuhan china in december 2019 and spread worldwide the outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by world health organization who on january 30 2020 and announced a name for the new coronavirus disease covid-19 since the reporting of the first case covid-19 has so far affected 232 countries and has infected over 6 million people globally 1 in india covid-19 has currently more than 456251 total cases out of which 183384 are active cases and has claimed 14483 lives so far this figure keeps changing every day though the number of cases of covid 19 is increasing day by day due to relief in lockdown measures and migration of people it is intriguing to note that so far the mortality has remained at a lower level in the indian subcontinent than in other countries with similar numbers of covid-19 infections table 1

 even with poor infrastructure and health facilities found in india compared to other countries with more robust health facilities such as in italy spain united kingdom and united states of america the mortality data in india is a fraction to that seen in western countries indias recovery rate from covid-19 is higher than those of many nations at the same level of infection and can be due to high suspicion of diagnosis timely detection and treatment the possible reasons behind lower mortality figures in india is ambiguous with many theories described for this we try to elucidate various reasons for lower mortality rate in the indian subcontinent due to covid-19it is acknowledged that the elderly population makes up a high proportion of the covid-19 mortality across all countries 23 the western natives are significantly older than their asian and african counterparts india is a young nation according to a report by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation the share of its youth is expected to be 3433 of the total population of india by 2020 4 availability of universal health care and the social culture of family ties and protection of the elderly in india support high self-rated health amongst elders 5certain immune variations such as genetic or acquired differences might separate people who fall severely ill and develop pneumonia with covid-19 from those who contract the infection but hardly develop any discernible symptom 6 such differences in fatality rates could be linked to genetic variations in sars-cov-2 but the current literature pertaining to this is lacking individual genetic variation may help to explain different immune responses to a virus across a population in particular understanding how variation in hla may affect the course of covid-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease 7studies have found that higher mortality rate in western countries is due to genetics the cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike s proteins to cellular receptors sars-cov-2 receptor ace2and on s protein priming by host cell proteases serine protease tmprss2 the mechanisms of sars-cov-2 infection have been explained by a recent study that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 responsible for the cleavage of angiotensin i and angiotensin ii as the host cell surface receptor allowing for the viral infection covid-19 sars-cov-2 infection causes decrease of ace2 expression leading to severity of the lung damage 8 the presence of d allele of ace1 genes is associated with a reduced expression of ace2 genes which results in fewer ace2 receptors thus lower chance of infection but increasing the severity of lung damage this di polymorphism shows an important geographical variation low d allele frequencies have been reported in asians as compared to the european population and could be the cause of more severe pulmonary infection due to covid-19 and deaths 9the hla gene variant has been tied to high rates of severe symptoms of severe adult respiratory syndrome sars a coronavirus related to covid-19 the occurrence and development of sars-cov-2 depend on the interaction between the virus and the individuals immune system 10 the genes responsible for proteins that prevent the immune system from attacking the body itself come in several variants it has been shown that people with some variants are more susceptible to the corona virus than those with the others and that these variants may be specific by region 11an indo-us team of researchers has found that indians compared to other world populations carry more natural killer cells that can detect and terminate infections at an early stage 12mutations are a part of the natural life cycle of any virus the indian council of medical research icmr the apex health research body of india is planning to study the genetic diversity of the virus to study the evolution of sars-cov-2 and to evaluate if the present strain has evolved or is the same as the initial strain it has been believed that higher mortalities seen in some of indian regions may be due to a mutant more virulent strain of the sars-cov-2 virus 13 many mutations observed in the sars-cov-2 sequences are therefore expected the current estimates for the mutation rate of sars-cov-2 are about one mutation in two weeks currently there are at least 11 different strains of sars-cov-2 the causative agent of covid-19 in the worldresearchers at cambridge university found that the virus may have mutated as it spreads from asia to europe becoming more resilient to conditions in europe and thus deadlier however not enough data is available on different strains 14 the study identifies three strains of virus a b and c type a is prevalent in us and australia type b wuhans major virus type b is prevalent in patients from across east asia c variant is the major european type found in early patients from france italy sweden and england 14recently scientists identified several hundreds of point mutations in sars-cov-2 across the genome they elucidate the link between the constant change and variable virulence with an increase in mortality and morbidity they noted 47 key point mutations located along the entire genome that might have impacted in the virulence and response to different antivirals against sars-cov-2 15furthermore eaaswarkhanth et al have reported that s-d614 g strains may be virulent and lead to increasing its severity in the infected individuals especially in europe where this mutation is prominent it is also plausible that the sars-cov-2 mutations giving rise to different phylogenetic clades are responsible for the obvious death disparities around the world 16there are some suggestions that temperature variation and humidity may also be important factors affecting the covid-19 mortality 1718 coronavirus spread is slow in hot and humid weather and spreads easily in dry and cold conditions 19 warmer asian countries saw the infection spread more slowly than europe and the us with the start of summer in india and with temperatures more than 3540 centigrade the infection rate has not been coming down indicating that this may not be such a relevant factorhigh infection and death rate due to covid 19 can also be due to stringency of lockdown usa sweden iran and turkey did not implement strict curbs and have high rates of mortality indias 21 days of complete national wide lockdown was one of the most stringent in the world for keeping the number of cases down 20 the current low levels of mortality are surely a pointer of what happened before the lockdown began it is also possible that covid-19 has had a substantial mortality impact but that the total deaths have not risen because the complete lockdown reduced non-covid deaths recent unlocking of restrictions in india has seen a rise in the numbers of reported infections and mortality 21lack of bcg vaccination has been claimed to be a possible explanation for the high heterogeneity of infectionmortality rates across involved countries the widespread use of bcg vaccination for prevention of tuberculosis tb in india may be the reason for lower rates of covid-19 the bcg vaccine is an approved vaccine product by the fda for people who have not been previously infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and who are at a high risk of being infected with this bacillus it appears that in countries with routine bcg vaccination the pandemic appears to be less severe as this vaccine is a general immune-system enhancer the bcg vaccination has been given to indian children since 1948 countries without universal policies of bcg vaccination italy netherlandusa have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing bcg policies countries that have a late start of universal bcg policy iran 1984 have had high mortality in elderly population hence this explanation demands more in-depth research and explanation 22 bcg vaccine is currently being trialed to reduce the frequency and severity of covid-19 23 it is hoped that the vaccine will increase the trained immunity so that the immune system is boosted against coronavirus sars-cov-2indians suffer repeated attacks of respiratory viruses that keep their immune system primed destroying pathogens attempting to attack could be one important factor this has probably also provided prevention from sars and mers-cov nutritional factors tough life unhygienic conditions poor community hygiene etc may also be responsible for repeated respiratory infections 24obesity rates are higher in the us and the western world than in india the prevalence of obesity in the usa around 40 versus a prevalence of 62 in china 20 in italy and 24 in spain 25 a recent study has demonstrated that hospitalized patients younger than 50 with morbid obesity bmi 40 kgm2 are more likely to die from covid-19 26 patients with obesity are associated with impaired immune response endothelial dysfunction decreased functional residual capacity in the lungs and hypoxemia and expression of ace2 in adipose tissue which has high affinity to the sarcov2 virus 2728the effects of covid-19 on the health of racial and ethnic minority groups are still emerging however current data suggest a disproportionate burden of illness and death in this cohort 29 factors that influence racial and ethnic minority group health include economic and social conditions these groups also find it difficult to access resources during outbreaks such as covid-19 racial residential segregation and living in densely populated areas does not allow principles of social distancing and underlying health conditions 30 as such scientific studies that result in improved understanding of covid-19 may lead to more targeted and effective community and health care systembased interventions in the future hence analyzing the disproportionate affliction of the black and ethnic minority group will be essential 31the covid-19 pandemic struck india in early march ie later than in other countries and hence there is a substantial delay in the reported infections and fatality in india the spread to all countries from china was almost simultaneous indias response was initiated on 8th january much before who declared covid-19 as a public health emergency the screening of travelers from abroad at airports and at ports was started exceedingly early in jan 2020 all incoming travellers including indian nationals arriving from or having visited china italy iran republic of korea france spain and germany after february 15 2020 were quarantined for a minimum period of 14 days 33 however in many other countries the usa uk and eu countries did not resort to any such measuresanti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine was suggested to reduce the covid-19 risk in health workers with potential for retinal and cardiac toxicity this drug has diverse modes of action including inhibition of cytokine storms in the host cell which work against the viral infections and help prevent deaths 34 the recent study found that covid-19 infections are higher in countries where malaria islessendemic and lower in countries where malaria is highly endemic large numbers of mortality in health care professionals across the globe have been observed during pandemic 35 in india indian council of medical research icmr recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine in asymptomatic health professionals who cared for suspected or confirmed covid-19 cases early in the rise of the pandemic this may have prevented more fatalities in the western countries 3637 however there is no hard evidence that hydroxychloroquine reduces the risk of covid-19 so far a recent article in the lancet journal about hydroxychloroquine role and use has been retracted 38the covid-19 pandemic has devastated the global population by hitting the health individuals it is a highly contagious disease and has caused a high rate of mortality particularly in high risk individuals the pattern of infection and mortality rates has varied significantly amongst the countries surprisingly more affluent countries with greater healthcare resources have been more affected by it and have seen higher mortality rates compared to less affluent countries like india and other southeast asian nations we have analyzed and discussed several factors that may be responsible for such discrepancyno funding receivednonethe ongoing outbreak of the corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy 1 2 3 on 30 january 2020 the world health organization who declared it to be a public health emergency of international concern as of 10 march 2020 more than 105 countries 114253 cases of covid-19 and 4000 deaths have been reported all over the world of which the number of confirmed patients in china has gradually decreased but is increasing rapidly in other countries especially in italy south korea and iran and there are lots of doctors engaged in combating it 45 the sars-cov-2 was first reported in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from three patients in wuhan jinyintan hospital and was confirmed as the cause of covid-19 on january 24 2020 6 after deep examining the full-length genome we found that the virus belongs to the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage in the phylogenetic tree 7 and is a new human-infecting beta-coronavirus which had previously not been detected in humans or animals it is named covid-19 by the who and sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses as it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov 8 it shares more than 8799  identity sequencing with the bat sars-like coronavirus and it shares more than 80  identity nucleotide with the original sars epidemic virus 9 10 11 coronavirus spike s glycoproteins promote entry into cells they are the main target of antibodies and bind with high affinity to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor in humans in a manner similar to sars-cov 12 13 14 however the sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the s1s2 subunits which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from sars-cov and sars-related covs 1516 at present research reports that the incubation period in most people range from 1 to 14 days with a median of 56 days but the incubation period may even be as long as 24 days 17 the reproductive number r0 for sars-cov-2 although still preliminary is estimated between 2 and 3 suggesting a higher pandemic potential than sars 18 fever or cough may be the major symptom but asymptomatic individuals have also been identified as potential sources of infection 19 at present we think that the new coronavirus is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact but transmission from an asymptomatic carrier appears to be possible 20 a report of 9 pregnant patients suggests that perinatal transmission is unlikely but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding 21 although viral rna is found in stool whether it can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route still needs to be confirmed by subsequent investigations 2223 recently some patients were found to be re-positive after being treated with negative nucleic acid tests twice and symptoms disappeared it is difficult for us to decrease the severity of covid-19 owing to the complex structure and unclear physiological mechanism with the increasing number of confirmed cases the clinical investigation of patients and antiviral treatment solution has been insufficient and there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease in order to prove more accurate conclusions on the prevalence of comorbidity and relation of clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with covid-19 we searched the relevant literatures and carried out single arm meta-analysis to describe epidemiological clinical characteristics complications and outcomes of patients confirmed to have 2019-ncov infection and to compare the severity between diabetes or hypertension and non-diabetes or non-hypertension patients our findings provide vital guidance for current clinical work on the prevention and treatment of 2019-ncov infectiona computerized search spanning january1 1980 to march 10 2020 was conducted in medline sino med embase and cochrane library databases the following search terms were used in all possible combinations corona virus disease-2019 mesh or 2019 novel coronavirus mesh or sars-cov-2 mesh or covid-19 mesh or 2019-ncov mesh the search was limited to human subjects there was no language limitation the titles and abstracts of potentially relevant studies identified by the computerized search were reviewed full-text articles were obtained for detailed evaluation and eligible studies were included in the systematic review the inclusion criteria were the following randomized controlled trial clinical trials and series cases patients who were of either sex and had been diagnosed with covid-19 all patients with laboratory-identified sars-cov-2 infection who had had both real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction detection of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid positive in throat swabs or lower respiratory tract and ct scanning of the lung inclusion of the epidemiological clinical characteristics laboratory and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcome clear description of the clinical characteristics such as comorbidities including hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease and malignancy and the signs and symptoms such as fever cough fatigue and dyspnea clear description of the outcomes including the major complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards acute cardiac injuryaci acute kidney injuryaki shock and incidence of severity and mortalitythe exclusion criteria were the following absence of clinical characteristics treatment outcome clinical experience and case reportstwo authors independently extracted data by reviewing all titles and abstracts of the searched papers if any disagreement on the choice of the literature exists a third evaluator will join in to make the decision the following information was recorded from the included trials first author year of publication number of participants and residence of patients basic data about gender age and diagnosis were extracted and analyzed to evaluate the proportion of comorbidity such as diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease and malignancy the proportion of symptoms such as fever cough fatigue and dyspnea the proportion of clinical complications including ards aci aki and shock and the severity and mortalitytwo readers independently extracted and reviewed the data from the enrolled studies to ensure consistency the quality of the included studies was assessed by the newcastleottawa scale in order to objectively evaluate the publication bias of the included studies the egger test with p  005 as the existence of publication bias was performed and those with larger values were considered as having no publication biasthe single arm meta-analysis of proportions and 95 ci was calculated for the clinical symptoms complication outcome and for each of the selected comorbidities using stata 150 the presence of heterogeneity among the identified studies cochrans q and the extent of heterogeneity i 2 index were examined as described previously all original data included in the literature were first transformed by double arcsine method to make them conform to normal distribution and then analyzed in stata the initial conclusion obtained by meta-analysis was then restored using formula psintp2 2 to reach final conclusionwe performed sensitivity analysis to assess the stability of the results and investigate the influence of each study by omitting a single study sequentially using the egger test we found no evidence of bias in any of the lag periodsthe initial 1057 citations were identified based on a study of the subject and a summary of the literature of which 694 articles were thereafter excluded because of duplication after reviewing the title and abstract of the remaining 81 studies only 34 full-text studies were evaluated for further assessment and 13 obviously irrelevant records were excluded eventually 21 clinical studies 61724 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 were consistent with the inclusion requirements a detailed study flow-diagram is shown in fig 1
 the basic characteristics and quality of the included studies were illustrated in table 1
twenty-one studies were selected with a total of 47344 patients 24419 male and 22925 females representing approximately 40  of the who confirmed one clinical trial investigated the characteristics of patients in singapore and all others came from china mainly in wuhan systematic analysis of the studies describing the epidemiological demographic and clinical features of covid-19 cases and reporting of the prevalence of a number of chronic diseases in the infectious disease was undertaken the number of cases in the selected studies varied by approximately 3722-fold and ranged from 12 to 44672 cases the sex ratio male to female was 106 and the overall average age of the subjects was greater than 40 years forty-one cases reported in jinyintan hospital are the earliest confirmed cases patients treated in wenzhou hospital almost are mild but xiaobo yang et al reported 52 cases with covid-19 that were all critical patients all studies detailed the pre-treatment biochemical characteristics and subsequent treatmenteighteen studies reported the comorbidity of diabetes only 7 of them introduced the proportion of severity 14 studies reported hypertension and 6 of them introduced the proportion of severity 13 studies reported malignant and 12 studies reported cad with regard to symptoms 20 studies recorded fever and cough 12 studies reported fatigue and 15 studies reported dyspnea seven studies recorded the complication of ards and aci and shock was recorded in 4 and 5 studies respectively fifteen studies showed critical patients and 12 research reported mortality all studies provided incidence data of at least one kind of comorbidity symptom or complication sixteen forest plots were used to illustrate the prevalence of comorbidities in covid-19 from the selected studies and to inspect the heterogeneity of the individual findings meta-analysis of the identified studies showed that the most prevalent clinical symptoms were fever 856  95ci 813899  and cough 657  95ci 601714  followed by fatigue 424  95ci 322526  and shortness of breath 214  95ci 153275  fig 2
 there was significant heterogeneity cochrans q in the estimates of clinical symptoms among the examined studies p  0001 with an i2 index varying from 874  to 951  the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension comorbidities was 77  95ci 6193  and 156  95ci 126186  respectively the incidence of cardiovascular disease and malignancy was 47  95ci 3162  and 12  95ci 0518  respectively fig 3
 the case complications including ards risk ranged from 56 to 132  with the pooled estimate at 94  acute cardiac injury 58  95ci 07108  acute kidney injury 21  95ci 0637  and shock 47  95ci 0986  were also present fig 4
 the risks of severity and mortality rate ranged from 126 to 235  and from 20 to 44  with pooled estimates at 180 and 32  respectively the percentage of severe cases in diabetes and hypertension cases was 445  95ci 270619  and 417  95ci 264569  respectively fig 5
sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the stability of pooled results among the 21 studies the significant results were not obviously altered after sequentially omitting each study in the pooled results comparing the incidence of mortality after excluding the report by chaolin huang et al the heterogeneity decreased significantly or  0719 95  ci  02771865 p  0497 i  28  and showed that there was no significant difference in preventing the ards rate between the two groups hence it was regarded as a result of heterogeneity likewise the other studies were considered as the source of heterogeneity because the heterogeneity significantly changed and showed that there was no significant difference in preventing ards between the two groups when each of these studies were excluded from the pooled results comparing the incidence of ards a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether the exclusion of this study would alter the result and exclusion of this study from the meta-analysis did not substantially influence the resultsin this part of the study ards was used to assess publication bias egger test results showed pr  jzj  100 therefore we believe that the risk of publication bias is low in this meta-analysisthe outbreak of covid-19 has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by who by march 10 2020 the epidemic had spread to 25 countries around the world in accordance with the experience of china surgical masks are in widespread use which is beneficial to prevent the acquisition of covid-19 in addition italy started taking measures to block traffic and lockdown villages with the rising incidence of covid-19 all over the world feasible and effective messaging about the clinical characteristics of covid-19 is greatly needed therefore the focus of this analysis was to evaluate the prevalence of symptoms comorbidity complications and different outcomes in china and singapore the meta-analysis identified 21 published studies that assessed this proportion there are few published rcts because of the rapid development of the epidemic and there are limited medical resources in addition to the presence of uncontrollable risk during treatment much of the evidence of effects cannot be adequately studied in randomized trials such as long-term and rare outcomes therefore we analyzed all retrospective studies in this study for the main results we found that the cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults and there is no difference in susceptibility between male and female fever is the most common symptom in patients with 2019-ncov infection the most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension and diabetes which are associated with the rapid development of severe illness ards and aci may be the main obstacles for patients to treatment recovery the severity and mortality of patients with 2019-ncov infection is lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers but the prevalence of covid-19 is much higher than sars and the merstwo coronaviruses have previously caused significant outbreaks associated with more critical disease the sars coronavirus in 20022003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus that emerged in 2012 43 44 45 a lot of studies have reported the clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 but there is a lack of studies on the relation of severity and mortality with comorbidity similarly there is no meta-analysis published on complications for patients covid-19 infected therefore this is a novel systematic review and meta-analysis due to the inadequate evidence we present this meta-analysis by consolidating multiple studies to enable enhanced clinical decision making in the future we report here a cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-ncov infection patients had serious sometimes fatal complications and were admitted to the designated hospital clinical presentations greatly resemble sars-cov patients with severe illness developed ards aki aci or shock and required icu admission and oxygen therapyhowever despite a comprehensive analysis there are also many limitations that should be taken into consideration in our meta-analysis first the studies included in the meta-analysis were not all rcts second in the literature-included studies the treatment of every hospital is not completely similar third owing to the treatment by grading of mild ordinary and critical the severity of patients in different hospitals varies greatly in addition as the cause and physio pathological mechanism was unknown at the onset of emerging infections the treatment in wuhan was only based on clinical experience leading to a higher complication and mortality fourth partial missing information in a few articles may lead to biased results we have attempted to contact investigators or study sponsors to verify key study characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data moreover clinical and methodological heterogeneities were observed in several parameters in the meta-analysis given the variation in intervention techniques patient composition and preferences among different cities true heterogeneity and poor methodological quality could also lead to an asymmetric plot in the future larger higher quality clinical trials should be conducted and we will conduct a more detailed subgroup analysis to explore the sources of heterogeneity to obtain a more reliable conclusion and more effort should be made to answer these questions in future studiescovid-19 is an emerging infectious disease of global public health concern our results note the similarity of clinical symptoms and complications between covid-19 and previous beta-coronavirus infections the incidence of severity and mortality of covid-19 is much higher than that of ordinary influenza and the prevalence of chronic diseases including diabetes and hypertension is rising as populations age and lifestyle and dietary habits change in addition we found that diabetes and hypertension are closely related to severity and mortality improving the protection against covid-19 in persons with chronic disorders is essential last but not least there is a need to limit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health-care workers thus preventing transmission amplification events and preventing further international spreadthe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this papercoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and is the most recently discovered member of the coronavirus family since late december 2019 covid -19 has caused initially a local epidemic in wuhan china and subsequently a global pandemic involving 212 countries areas or territories approximately 35 million cases and 250000 deaths were recorded worldwide as of may 20201  increasing experience with this disease has led to the understanding that it is not just an illness of the respiratory system but that there are significant cardiovascular effects recent works by huang et al2 and guo et al3 not only demonstrated that a considerable number of hospitalized patients diagnosed with covid-19 exhibited cardiac injury represented by elevation of cardiac biomarkers such as troponin but that those who developed cardiac injury had a significantly higher mortality than those without moreover a multivariable analysis of 416 patients found that cardiac injury was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with covid-194 therefore the purpose of this study was to present a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature to investigate the incidence of cardiac injury its correlations with co-morbidities and outcomes and its possible mechanisms in the global covid-19 populationwe performed a systematic literature search in pubmed and embase we used the following search terms coronavirus and cardiac injury or myocardial injury or myocarditis or troponin the search was limited to chinese and english and all articles from jan 1 2020 to may 30 2020 were reviewedoriginal studies that reported cardiac injury as elevated troponin levels were included review articles meta-analysis and case reports were excluded an aggregate data meta-analysis was performed the extracted data included the number of patients enrolled in each study age gender co-morbidities coronary artery disease cad diabetes dm hypertension htn and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases copd laboratory values c-reactive protein crp procalcitonin and nt-pro brain natriuretic peptide nt-probnp mortality and other outcome measures including intensive care unit icu admission respiratory failure in need of mechanical ventilation and shockthe primary outcome was defined as all-cause mortality if mortality in patients with or without cardiac injury was not directly reported the mortality rate of patients with cardiac injury was calculated as the ratio of deceased patients with cardiac injury to the overall number of patients with reported cardiac injury the secondary outcome was defined as any one of death icu admission respiratory failure in need of mechanical ventilation or shock5review manager 53 cochrane london uk was used to perform data analysis continuous variables were extracted and analyzed using standard mean differences smd median with interquartile range was converted to mean with standard deviation using the equations delineated by hozo et al6 dichotomous variables were analyzed using the mantel-haenszel method and the random effects model a 95 confidence interval was selected and the results were expressed as odds ratio p value of less than 005 was considered statistically significant statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the i2 statistic publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots sensitivity analyses were performed to identify potential heterogeneity by leaving out each studya total of 242 abstracts resulted with the search term as of may 30 2020 each abstract was reviewed by the authors and 65 studies that reported cardiac injury or troponin were reviewed in full figure 1

8 these case reports should ring a bell on the potential involvement of the cardiovascular system in a wider range of covid-19 patients worldwide more than a dozen studies have reported incidence of cardiac injury in hospitalized covid-19 patients ranging from 7 to 44 2 3 4

4 the pooled analysis of four studies did not achieve statistical significance thus whether male patients were more likely to develop cardiac injury still needs more evidenceseveral studies have looked into cardiovascular co-morbidities in covid-19 patients in li et als meta-analysis of 6 studies22  the prevalence of htn dm and cardio-cerebral vascular diseases were 171 97 and 164 chen t et al21 reported that hospitalized covid-19 patients with cardiovascular co-morbidities were more likely to develop cardiac complications in the multivariable analysis carried out by wang l et al23  history of cardiovascular disease was an independent predictor for death this was consistent with another multivariate analysis from chen c et al20  on the other end of the spectrum guo et al 3 pointed out that a significant number of patients with these co-morbidities did not progress to cardiac injury and had relatively favorable outcomes according to china cdc weekly in february24  809 of all covid-19 patients hospitalized and non-hospitalized with cardiovascular co-morbidities had only mild symptoms with no mortality 138 severe symptoms and only 47 critically ill among 44672 confirmed cases consistent with previous reports hospitalized covid-19 patients with history of htn and copd were more likely to develop cardiac injury in our analyses whether cad or dm was independently associated with higher incidence of cardiac injury in covid-19 patients still needs further investigation only a trend for difference without statistical significance was revealed in this pooled analysis for cardiac injury in patients with cad or dm compared with those withoutin addition to demographics and co-morbidities substantially elevated levels of nt-probnp were also observed in patients who developed cardiac injury during their hospitalization this pointed to one possible explanation of the high mortality rate in patients with cardiac injury acute decompensated heart failure in cases reported by many groups patients sometimes developed heart failure and required inotropic support 18 19 zhou f et al15 reported that 23 of hospitalized covid-19 patients 44191 patients developed heart failure symptoms this ratio increased to 52 in those who died 2854 patients guo et al3 not only reported a positive correlation of tnt levels in covid-19 patients with nt-probnp 0613 p0001 but also showed a dynamic increase of nt-probnp during the hospital course exclusively in patients who eventually died together with our analysis these data proposed a new area of investigation of whether covid-19 patients with cardiac injury died from heart failurecardiac injury and its association with patient outcomes was also examined both shi et al4 and chen c et al20 performed multivariable regression analysis and both reported that cardiac injury was an independent predictor of mortality however in the analysis performed by wang l et al23  cardiac injury was only predictive of fatal outcomes in univariable analysis but failed to achieve significance in multivariable analysis lippi et al conducted a preliminary meta-analysis of troponin levels in covid-19 patients and found that it was increased in covid-19 patients with severe disease than in those without25 in this analysis 14 studies were integrated to look into how cardiac injury affected outcomes in hospitalized covid-19 patients it was discovered that hospitalized covid-19 patients with cardiac injury had a significantly increased mortality rate compared to those without with an or of 1732 the mortality rate of hospitalized covid-19 patients with cardiac injury was found to be 726  this mortality rate was significantly higher than any mortality rates reported so far guo et al3 described a mortality rate of 6944 2536 patients for patients who developed cardiac injury and also had underlying cardiovascular diseases and 3750 616 patients for those with cardiac injury but without cardiovascular co-morbidities shi et al4 reported a mortality rate of 512 4282 patients in patients with cardiac injury this extremely high rate of mortality among patients with cardiac injury is alarming revisiting the studies included in our analysis we discovered that in two studies by zhou f et al15 and deng et al14  death rate among patients with cardiac injury were particularly high 970 3233 patients and 985 6566 patients respectively these extreme rates may have skewed the overall mortality rate higher and needed to be considered with caution when the two studies with high mortality rates zhou et al and deng et al were excluded in the analysis the overall rate of primary outcome was 648 210324 patients with or 1283 95ci 793-2075 p000001 compared to patients without injury the rate of secondary outcomes was 666 255383 patients with or 1446 95ci 976-2142 p000001 compared to patients without injury both primary and secondary outcomes were similar in direction and slightly smaller in magnitude it is important to note that these high rates of mortality were only associated with covid-19 patients who were hospitalized and could not be applied to those who did not require hospitalizationcurrently several editorials and review articles have elaborated on the possible etiologies of cardiac injury the mainstream hypotheses include 1 damage caused by cytokine storm triggered by the virus22  2 type ii demand ischemia due to hypoxemia caused by the dominating respiratory failure26  and 3 direct myocardial injury by viral infiltration27 a few autopsy reports were available that described pathological involvement of the heart xu et al28  observed the presence of interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in the heart but no substantial tissue damage another chinese pathology report by yao et al29 described three patients who died of covid-19 in chongqing china they observed enlarged and necrotic cardiomyocytes with infiltrative phagocytes and rare cd4 t cells in all three patients the hypothesis of cytokine storm as a cause of cardiac injury was solidified by huang et al2  whose study revealed higher plasma levels of il2 il7 il10 gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf in covid-19 patients admitted to the icu this analysis was also consistent with this hypothesis by showing significantly elevated inflammatory markers including crp and procalcitonin in patients with cardiac injury compared to those without in order to further elucidate the cytokine storm hypothesis more studies are needed to compare inflammatory marker between covid-19 patients with or without cardiac injuryin april 2020 direct involvement of coronavirus particles in the myocardium was reported in an italian patient30  the patient has significantly increased hstni and collapsed into cardiogenic shock as indicated by dr libby in his recent perspective 31  mechanisms of cardiac injury in covid-19 patients lie on a spectrum on one end direct viral invasion could cause fulminant myocarditis as shown in the italian case on the other end pre-existing lesions in susceptible patients could be exacerbated by cytokine storm from inflammatory responses together with increased oxygen requirements in patients with respiratory distress type ii demand ischemia should also be kept in minddue to the high risk of mortality in hospitalized covid-19 patients with cardiac injury early screening with cardiac biomarkers electrocardiograms and echocardiograms is warranted in patients who are at higher risk of developing cardiac injury these patients are older and often have history of htn and copd we hope early detection with appropriate triage and support would help reduce the incidence of cardiac injury in hospitalized covid-19 patients and the dangerously high rate of mortalitythis study is limited in several ways first limited number of studies reported cardiac injury in covid-19 patients second only four studies directly compared hospitalized covid-19 patients with or without cardiac injury moreover a small number of studies did not define or had different diagnostic criteria of cardiac injury and therefore could not be included in the analysis third most studies reported their continuous variables as median with interquartile range in order to analyze some of these continuous variables conversion to median with standard deviation was necessary which might introduce bias in our resultsour meta-analysis revealed that cardiac injury was common in hospitalized covid-19 patients and its incidence was similar between the chinese and the western population the overall mortality of patients with cardiac injury was alarmingly high cardiac injury was significantly associated with older age and co-morbidities including htn and copd early screening triage and support is warranted to help reduce the incidence of cardiac injury in hospitalized covid-19 and its associated mortalitycoronavirus disease covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a global pandemic that initially started in wuhan china and spread extremely quickly making its way to over 180 countries as the novel coronavirus continues to evolve there are still many limitations to our knowledge of who exactly this virus would impact critically older adults and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes have shown worse prognosis 1 diabetic patients have increased morbidity and mortality rates and have been linked to more hospitalization and intensive care unit icu admissions 1 people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd or any respiratory illnesses are also at higher risk for severe illness from covid-19 2 the risk of contracting covid-19 in patients with copd is found to be 4-fold higher than patients without copd 2a retrospective study of middle-aged and elderly patients with covid-19 found that the elderly population is more susceptible to this illness and is more likely to be admitted to the icu with a higher mortality rate 3 the age-related changes in the geriatric population may be due to the changes in lung anatomy and muscle atrophy which results in changes in physiologic function reduction of lung reserve reduction of airway clearance and reduction of the defense barrier function 3the clinical outcomes and length of stay directly correlate with the underlying conditions and age of the covid-19 patient researchers in china studied 344 patients in the icu with covid-19 of the 344 subjects 133 patients died on the 28th day with a median survival of 25 days 4 of these patients there were many with different comorbidities with 141 patients having hypertension 4 in survivors the median duration of hospitalization for a negative test result was 12 days 4 furthermore another study conducted in china studied 633 covid-19 patients of whom 247 patients had at least one comorbidity and that concluded that older individuals greater than 60 years were more likely to exhibit a more severe form of covid-19 disease 5 during the study 25 patients with a median age of 693 years died giving an effective mortality rate of 377 5it has been concluded that the older the patients are the more likely they are to succumb to the covid-19 disease in the usa the centers for disease control and prevention cdc uses covid-net in 14 states to monitor the demographics of covid-19 patients who are being hospitalized 6 from march 1 through 30 2020 there were a total of 180 patients on covid-net of which 893 of the patients had an underlying comorbidity 6 of the 180 patients 944 aged 65 years and older had at least comorbidity 6 the most common comorbidities found were obesity hypertension and diabetes mellitus 6 the purpose of this paper is to review these comorbidities given that most patients with severe covid-19 cases had comorbidity furthermore we would like to examine specific comorbidities in relation to the covid-19 disease progression and outcomes based on the literature report since the outbreakan electronic literature search was performed using pubmed google scholar ebscohost mendeley and medline plus the search was limited to peer-reviewed articles published from january to april 20 2020 an article was selected if it included keywords such as coronavirus covid-19 sars-cov-2 clinical features comorbidity diabetes and hypertension articles were then reviewed and included based on the applicability to the topicconfirmed and reported cases of covid-19 have a wide range of symptoms from mild complaints such as fever and cough to more critical cases associated with difficulty in breathing 7 some of the most common symptoms include cough fever chills shortness of breath sob muscle aches sore throat unexplained loss of taste or smell diarrhea and headache 8 symptoms can start as mild and become more intense over 5 to 7 days worsening if pneumonia develops in patients 8 approximately 1 out of 6 infected individuals become seriously ill and develop difficulty in breathing especially in the elderly with underlying health conditions 9a meta-analysis study of covid-19 patients as depicted in fig 1 showed fever 888 as the most common symptom followed by dry cough 68 and fatigue 33 10 other symptoms noted were productive cough 285 sob 17 muscle pain 144 sore throat 114 and headache 102 10 the least common symptoms were diarrhea 44 nausea and vomiting 41 rhinorrhea 32 abdominal pain 016 and chest pain 011 10symptoms of covid-19 may appear anytime from 2 to 14 days after exposure therefore 14-day quarantine is recommended 7 the average incubation period for covid-19 is approximately 52 days 11 in wuhan china the most common symptoms observed from the onset of this outbreak include fever cough and fatigue while some features that were not so prevalent were sputum production headache hemoptysis and gastrointestinal gi symptom such as diarrhea 12 13 another study that was conducted in beijing china showed that the average age of patients with covid-19 was 355 years and had a mean of 35 days from the onset of symptoms to admission in the hospital 14 the same study also showed that fever was present in 875 of patients which persisted for 65 days and symptoms resolved 25 days after a negative test result 14some individuals who are infected do not develop any symptoms at all and about 80 of positive cases recover from the disease without any treatment 9 however there have also been instances of transmissions of covid-19 from one person to another before the person became aware of being sick or the symptoms were so mild that the person did not know heshe had the illness 15 it becomes essential to seek medical attention immediately if a person suspects that heshe may have been infected or is a confirmed case of covid-19 experiencing respiratory distress has blue lips is in constant pain or has pressure in the chest 7 also it is important to note that covid-19 is more infectious than sars-cov and mers-cov due to its numerous epidemiological and biological characteristics 16due to covid-19 being a relatively new and understudied disease the data available is limited however from the cases that emerged it was observed that comorbidities increase the chances of infection 7 based on current information and clinical expertise the elderly especially those in long-term care facilities and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions are at a greater risk of getting covid-19 7 the elderly a vulnerable population with chronic health conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular or lung disease are not only at a higher risk of developing severe illness but are also at an increased risk of death if they become ill 15 people with underlying uncontrolled medical conditions such as diabetes hypertension lung liver and kidney disease cancer patients on chemotherapy smokers transplant recipients and patients taking steroids chronically are at increased risk of covid-19 infection 7a meta-analysis study on covid-19 comorbidities as depicted in fig 2 had a total of 1786 patients of which 1044 were male and 742 were female with a mean age of 41 years old 10 the most common comorbidities identified in these patients were hypertension 158 cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions 117 and diabetes 94 10 17 the less common comorbidities were coexisting infection with hiv and hepatitis b 15 malignancy 15 respiratory illnesses 14 renal disorders 08 and immunodeficiencies 001 10patients with moderate to severe asthma are at a disadvantage because this virus affects their respiratory tracts leading to increased asthmatic attacks pneumonia and acute respiratory distress 7 according to the cdcs morbidity and mortality weekly report 346 of patients aged 18 to 49 years old have an underlying chronic lung disease such as asthma 6 in iran a case study reported that genetic predisposition to covid-19 can increase the probabilities of getting infected with sars-cov-2 and can lead to death from this virus 18 this genetic predisposition was seen in 3 brothers in iran who were 6 years apart in age 54 60 and 66 years who died due to covid-19 despite no identified comorbidities and living separately from one another 18 as of january 2 2020 wuhan china had 41 patients admitted to the hospital who tested positive for covid-19 of which 73 3041 were men with a median age of 49 years old 66 2741 of these patients had been exposed to the huanan market 32 1341 had underlying diseases such as diabetes 20 841 hypertension 15 641 and cardiovascular 15 641 12 patients who are hiv positive along with a low cd4 count and not on antiretroviral therapy have a higher risk and incidence of other medical issues including covid-19 7 according to the international aids society ias people who are human immunodeficiency virus hiv positive taking antiretroviral treatment and do not have a low cd4 count will have the same risk of having covid-19 as one without hiv 19 20as depicted in fig 3 a population-based surveillance report via covid-19-associated hospitalization surveillance network covid-net reported clinical data on 1478 covid-19-positive patient hospitalizations from march 1 to march 30 2020 6 among the 1478 patients studied 12 of adults showed clinical data of underlying medical conditions with the most prevalent being hypertension 497 and obesity a close second 483 6 other medical conditions included chronic lung disease 346 diabetes mellitus 283 and cardiovascular diseases 278 6covid-19 can cause severe disease leading to hospitalization in icu and potentially death especially in the elderly with comorbidities 21 according to the cdc 8 out of 10 deaths reported in the usa occurred in adults 65 years old and above 7 roughly 80 of covid-19-positive cases result in full recovery from the illness without any hospitalizations or interventions 9 there are still many facts that we do not know about covid-19 due to gaps in knowledge therefore many studies are underway to better understand this virus 15wuhan china had 41 patients admitted to the hospital who tested positive for covid-19 from december 16 2019 to january 2 2020 and the clinical outcomes are shown in fig 4 12 of the 41 patients with confirmed covid-19 in the hospital 100 had pneumonia 29 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 15 exhibited an acute cardiac injury and 12 acquired a secondary infection 12 the majority of these patients 68 were discharged 17 remained hospitalized 10 ended up in the icu and 15 ended in death 12from february 20 to march 5 2020 a study was conducted in evergreen washington on the characteristics and outcomes of 21 critically ill patients with confirmed covid-19 diagnosis 22 this study showed that 71 of these patients required mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory arrest was seen in all of them 22 within 72 h of developing ards 53 of these patients showed increasing severity of respiratory problems leading to poor short-term outcomes and a higher risk of death 22 as of march 17 2020 the mortality rate was 67 in these patients with 24 critically ill and 95 discharged from hospital 22as shown in the cdcs mortality and morbidity weekly report in fig 5 case mortality increased as the patients age increased 21 23 among the age group  19 years no icu admission or mortality was reported 21 covid-19 has also been noticed in children but the disease took a more moderate course when compared with adults the prognosis was also seemingly better and deaths were infrequent 24on april 29 2020 who reported over 3 million confirmed covid-19 cases worldwide with over 200000 of these cases resulting in mortality 25 the majority of these deaths are within the usa with over 50000 followed by italy with over 25000 and spain with over 20000 25 new york is being hit the hardest by the novel coronavirus spreading across the usa with more cases and deaths per capita than any other state table 1 reports that over 86 of covid-19 deaths involved at least one comorbidity according to the new york state department of health 26multiple comorbidities are associated with the severity of covid-19 disease progression many of the poorer outcomes for covid-19 have been related to cardiovascular comorbid conditions 27 however this may be a direct result of the cardiovascular condition itself or attributed to other comorbidities along with a cardiovascular condition 27 patients with type 2 diabetes were also more likely to have increased severity of covid-19 28 in a cohort study of 7337 patients with covid-19 with and without type 2 diabetes it was shown that those with type 2 diabetes required increased interventions for their hospital stay versus those that were nondiabetic 28 it was shown that those with poorer blood glucose control had an all-around increased mortality rate than those with better glucose control 28 the study concluded that patients with blood glucose specifically those in the range of 39 to 100 mmoll had overall decreased composite adverse events and mortality 28 it was noted that poor blood glucose control resulted in a substantially increased risk of complications and death 28 among other comorbidities chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd has also been associated with poor disease progression a meta-analysis of multiple studies in china found that there was a four-fold increase in mortality in patients with preexisting copd that were diagnosed with covid-19 29 in this analysis the smoking status of patients and severity of covid-19 were also studied only one study was found to have an association with smoking and severe course of covid-19 29 after this study was removed there was no significant association with smoking and severe covid-19 disease 29patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure associated with the novel coronavirus may be linked to a prothrombotic coagulopathy 30 the autopsy of covid-19-related deaths revealed dispersed microthrombi in the pulmonary vasculature demonstrating an occlusive etiology of respiratory failure 30 a 38 to 100 improvement was noted in three cases with covid-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and respiratory failure following treatment with intravenous iv antithrombotic alteplase 30 the results although reassuring were transient in two of the three cases with recovery succumbing posttreatment 30 the use of anti-thrombolytic therapy needs to be further studied to ascertain that the results are due to treatment and not chance alone 30 a retrospective meta-analysis including 1558 covid-19 patients was conducted until march 1 2020 on subjects with underlying comorbidities and the risk for acquiring covid-19 31 common comorbidities such as hypertension copd diabetes and cardio-cerebrovascular disease were observed to be the more significant risk factors in subjects when compared with other underlying disease states 31 other than intense supportive measures a definitive treatment has yet to be identified 31 authorities speculate that subjects with comorbidities were linked to a more severe disease outcome when infected with the novel coronavirus when compared with patients with no underlying disease 31 the study was met with barriers due to the diminutive sample size and some subjects having more than one underlying comorbidity 31 in literature and earlier research underlying diseases increase the mortality rate in patients who acquired covid-19 with cardiac disease and diabetes being the most significant risk factors 32 once again insufficient sample size and inadequate time have led to limitations in the data collected 32over 180 countries have been affected by covid-19 resulting in mass death worldwide as cases evolve globally it has been noted that persons with underlying chronic illnesses are more likely to contract the virus and become severely illdue to sars cov-2 being a relatively new virus the data available is limited however patients with comorbidities have more deteriorating outcomes compared with patients without covid-19 patients with history of hypertension obesity chronic lung disease diabetes and cardiovascular disease have the worst prognosis and most often end up with deteriorating outcomes such as ards and pneumonia also elderly patients in long-term care facilities chronic kidney disease patients and cancer patients are not only at risk for contracting the virus but there is a significantly increased risk of death among these groups of patientsof the cases reported worldwide symptoms of covid-19 ranged from mild respiratory disease to severe illness which requires intubation and mechanical ventilation since there is a period where the patient is asymptomatic and the incubation period is between 2 and 14 days it is difficult to establish an early diagnosis much less curb the transmission of the infection if the patient is unknowingly exposed however within this period if respiratory symptoms develop it is important to seek immediate caretherefore patients with comorbidities should take all necessary precautions to avoid getting infected with sars cov-2 as they usually have the worst prognosis these precautions include regular handwashing with soap and water or use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer limiting person-to-person contact and practicing social distancing wearing a face mask in public places and overall limiting going to public areas at this time unless it is necessary hence there is a need for a global public health campaign to raise awareness on reducing the burden of these comorbidity illnesses causing deaths in covid-19-infected patientssince december 2019 a cluster of acute respiratory illness now known as novel coronavirusinfected pneumonia ncip and has spread throughout china and now to 195 other countries and territories

 on 7 january 2020 a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 previously known as 2019ncov was identified in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of the ncip
5
 studies have shown that the disease caused by sarscov2 recently named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 by world health organization who could induce symptoms including fever dry cough dyspnea fatigue and lymphopenia in infected patients in more severe cases infections causing viral pneumonia may lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and even death

6
 most of the initial cases of covid19 the disease caused by sarscov2 were all related to huanan seafood wholesale market which sells aquatic products live poultries and wild animals
2
 the first batch of cases identified later showed no exposure or even no relation to huanan wholesale market and the humantohuman transmission was confirmed moreover nosocomial infections were reported in some health care workers

7
 the number of fatalities due to covid19 is escalating however at this time there are no specific vaccines or treatments for covid19 most therapy consists of empirical antibiotics antiviral therapy oseltamivir and systemic corticosteroids which may have a limited effect on a fatal outcome evidence is now accumulating that the condition of some patients with covid19 deteriorates rapidly as of 20 may 2020 whos online covid19 situation dashboard reveals there have been 4 801 202 confirmed cases of covid19 including 318 935 deaths thus identifying the prognostic predictors of mortality in patients with covid19 might be useful for assessing the disease severity and making optimal treatment decisions the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio nlr has been suggested as a simple marker of the systemic inflammatory response in critical care patients
8
 
9
 it has also been reported as an independent prognostic factor for noninfectious diseases such as acute myocardial infarction stroke and several types of cancers
10
 
11
 
12
 in addition nlr has been shown to be an independent indicator of both shortterm and longterm mortality in critically ill patients
13
 therefore the nlr is a systemic inflammatory marker and a potential predictor of clinical risk and outcome in many diseases to our knowledge the utility of nlr to predict mortality in patients with covid19 has not been studied yet based on the previous studies we hypothesized that nlr might relate to the disease severity and mortality in patients with covid19 in the current study we sought to investigate whether nlr is a prognostic factor in patients with covid19all adult age 18 years old patients who were diagnosed with covid19 according to who interim guidance were screened and those who died or were discharged between 11 january 2020 and 3 march 2020 were included in our study data were collected from patients who were cured and discharged or who died without a cure confirmation of covid19 enrolled in this study was diagnosed according to the guidance for corona virus disease 2019 6th edition released by the national health commission of china

all patients age more than 18 years and having neutrophil and lymphocyte counts results within 24 hours after admission were included in this study patients who missed the neutrophil and lymphocyte records or with chronic hematological disorder were excludedthe electronic medical records of the patients were reviewed by a trained research team of physicians in wuhan third hospital  tongren hospital of wuhan university epidemiological clinical laboratory treatment and outcome data were analyzed patient data included demographics medical history exposure history comorbidities symptoms signs laboratory findings and treatment antiviral antibiotic and corticosteroid therapies and respiratory support all data were checked by two physicians hc and js and a third researcher sn adjudicated any difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewersbaseline characteristics were presented as median with interquartile range iqr for continuous variables and as number with percentage for categorical variables comparisons between continuous variables were analyzed by the student t and mannwhitney u test based on variable distribution and categorical variables were analyzed by the 
2 test the data were tested to the kolmogorovsmirnov normality test for homogeneity of variance to assess the relationship between the nlr and inhospital mortality we did the receiver operating characteristics roc curve and reported area under the roc curve next we grouped the patients based on the cutoff value of nlr during hospitalization in addition to adjust potential confounding with variables we did a multivariate regression analysis the following variables were considered for multivariable adjustment age gender smoking status laboratory data comorbidities and intensive care unit icu length of stay the results were reported as hazard ratio and 95 confidence interval 95 ci all statistical processes were performed with the statistical package for the social sciences 200 spss inc chicago il a twosided p value less than 05 was considered statistically significantfrom 11 january 2020 to 3 march 2020 a total of 1004 patients diagnosed with covid19 were admitted to wuhan third hospital  tongren hospital of wuhan university of these 40 of these patients had died of covid19 the median age of nonsurvivors was 68 iqr 5879 years which was significantly older than survivors 62 5070 years male sex was more predominant in nonsurvivors 27 675 than in survivors 466 483 in the laboratory examination the levels of white blood cell wbc count neutrophil count serum creatine kinase creatine kinase isozyme lactate dehydrogenase blood urea nitrogen serum creatinine hydroxybutyratedehydrogenase ctni ddimer ntprobnp alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase bilirubin and hscrp were higher in nonsurvivors but levels of platelets lymphocyte albumin total cholesterol highdensity lipoprotein lowdensity lipoprotein levels were lower all p  05 in addition the number of comorbid diseases diseases diagnosed at admission or related to previous medical history in nonsurvivors was significantly higher than that in survivors especially renal insufficiency respiratory failure and cerebrovascular disease one important finding is that the median nlr value was 4906 range 25716970 in nonsurvivors and 411 range 244812 in survivors with a large difference between the two groups p  001 the baseline characteristics medical history and major laboratory findings of the two groups were shown in table 1nonparametric roc analysis showed that the cutoff value of the roc curve as the optimal threshold for inhospital mortality was 1175 that is when nlr was more than 1175 the model had the strongest predictive ability with an area under the curve of 0945 and 95 ci of 0917 to 0973 figure 1 sensitivity of 975 specificity of 781 and yoden index of 0756 we further divided patients into two groups using nlr greater than or less than or equal to 1175 as the criterion to compare the clinical characteristics of patients with a high nlr and those with a low nlr table 2after multivariate logistic regression analysis highnlr remained independently associated with inhospital death in addition we found that higher levels of hscrp ntprobnp and blood urea nitrogen as well as history of hypertension respiratory failure digestive system diseases and cerebrovascular diseases were also independently associated with inhospital mortality table 3in this study we found there was an association between nlr and the clinical outcomes in patients with covid19 following sarscov2 infection most of the patients presented lymphopenia and elevated levels of infectionrelated biomarkers more interestingly a higher number of neutrophils and a lower number of lymphocytes that is the increase of nlr were found in nonsurvivors with covid19 compared to survivors nlr has been shown to be a simple standalone method for evaluating systemic inflammation neutrophils play a central role in the innate immune response resulting in multiple organ failure and lethality of severely injured patients in contrast lymphocytes play a major role in the inflammatory response therefore a high nlr indicates an imbalance of the inflammatory response and may be a surrogate marker of disease severity in infectious diseases such as sepsis and bacteremia
16
 based on the roc curve analysis the nlr showed the significant performance to predict inhospital mortality the cutoff level for the nlr was 1175 figure 1 our study supports that a high nlr is a strong predictor for inhospital mortality in patients with covid19 nlr is a convenient marker of systemic inflammation and infection outperforms the predictive ability of absolute leukocyte lymphocyte or neutrophil counts and has been demonstrated to be a useful biomarker for predicting bacterial infection included pneumonia
9
 
13
 
17
 furthermore nlr is shown to predict outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease
18
 as well as solid tumor malignancy
19
 in addition higher nlr has been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in patients with acute pancreatitis and was identified as a significant predictor of icu admission and a longer length of stay
20
 increasing clinical data suggest that the nlr might be a powerful predictive and prognostic indicator for severe covid19
6
 
21
 
22
 consistent with previous findings that several patients infected with sarscov2 had a high neutrophil count and a low lymphocyte count during the severe phase
6
 the increased mortality rate in patients with nlr found in our study indicated a serious disturbance in the internal environment and potential critical condition in severe infected cases
23
 in general increased nlr was common among patients with covid19 which become more pronounced in severe cases on the basis of these we suggested that covid19 might damage lymphocytes and the immune system was impaired during the course of the disease consistent with the findings from chen et al
24
 we observed that the overall fatality rate for confirmed covid19 cases was higher in male than in female patients with the risk of death rising with age for both sexes furthermore we observed that 925 of patients had at least one underlying disorder ie renal insufficiency respiratory failure and cerebrovascular disease and a higher percentage of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in nonsurvivors than survivors in consistent with those reports
2
 
6
 these findings suggested that covid19 is more likely to infected those elder men with chronic comorbidities due to weaker immune functions older patients often present with atypical signs and symptoms and have multiple comorbid conditions which often leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment and even death indeed these patients are at higher risk of covid19 hospital admission icu admission and inhospital death than are young adults
16
 
25
 physicians may find it timeconsuming and difficult to completely assess older patients however nlr is a biomarker that integrates two wbc subtypes representing two inversely and related immune pathways it represents an easily accessible objective parameter can be readily calculated from differential wbc counts more stable for measurement than the individual wbc counts and less affected by conditions that could change the individual cell counts
26
 the nlr is beneficial for clinicians to inform their understanding of the severity of covid19 a high calculated nlr may therefore aid in determining outcome risk need for close clinical monitoring and urgent effective treatment samaras et al
27
 proposed a targeted approach for highrisk patients
25
 our results may also help in the early identification of older patients at higher risk of covid19our results show a significant increase in mortality with increasing quartile of baseline nlr in patients with covid19 the main reason for this difference may be due to an insufficient number of patients with low nlr in our study another reason is that part of patients in our study included had a diagnosis of sepsis in patients with covid19 which may suggest a more severe inflammation in patients in our studysystemic inflammation is associated with the development and progression of covid19 recent studies have shown increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers were associated with poor outcomes in covid19
21
 nlr may serve as an additional inflammatory biomarker mainly because it reflects the systemic inflammatory and stress responses with neutrophils rising and lymphocytes apoptosis
28
 
29
 a study of patients with trauma and systemic inflammatory response syndrome showed lymphopenia was associated with high mortality the lymphocytes were important in the regulation of an appropriate inflammatory response and low circulating lymphocytes may perpetuate a harmful inflammatory status
30
 high nlr in patients is associated with high levels of inflammation de jager et al
31
 showed that nlr predicts bacteremia was better than conventional inflammation markers like creactive protein wbc count and neutrophil count a recent study showed that nlr as well as other inflammatory factors like lymphopenia and plasma calprotectin are independent predictors of increased allcause mortality in moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in stable phase and not in treatment with systemic glucocorticoids
32
 thus we supposed increased nlr values could predict the poor outcome in covid19 patients on the evidence of the association between nlrrelated inflammation and disease severitythis study has some important limitations to consider first it was a singlecenter and retrospective observational study subject selection bias could not be avoided and the causal relationship between nlr and mortality could not be drawn therefore our findings need to be confirmed in a prospective multicenter study second our primary outcome was allcause inhospital mortality so we could not analyze the cause of specific mortalities the exact mechanisms underlying the association between nlr and mortalities in elderly individuals are not certain third nlr value is influenced by comorbidities and medications that affect the neutrophil and lymphocyte count forth systemic inflammation may cause mortality but further studies are needed to identify the exact mechanisms we only analyzed nlr at admission however there may be a specific pattern in serial nlr examination if there is an association between serial nlr and mortality then this association could have more specificity in predicting mortality as previously discussed our study only shows an association so there is a limitation of the clinical implications thus more studies are needed to identify the associations between nlr and causespecific mortality in elderly individualsin summary we found high nlr was associated with poor outcome in critically ill patients with covid19 nlr was an independent risk factor for predicting allcause inhospital mortality in covid19 patients thus the nlr at admission may represent a surrogate marker of disease severity however we need more external validation to use the nlr in the clinical

wg xh and yz the manuscript was written by xy and wz and revised by dl and sn all authors read and approved the final manuscriptthe worldwide outbreak of a new type of coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus 2 causing coronavirus disease covid-19 has rapidly changed societies in the first 3 months of 2020 covid-19 was first reported in december 2019 in wuhan the capital of hubei province china 1 as a response to a broader disease threat china placed restrictions on travel in and out of wuhan on january 23 2020 but the virus was detected in europe already in january in countries such as france january 24 2020 and finland january 26 2020 2 currently it is not known how long there were active covid-19 cases circling in europe before different countries started to react to the epidemic the first death caused by covid-19 outside asia occurred in france on february 15 2020 in italy the number of infections started to rise rapidly in the last week of february 3 during march 2020 almost all european countries placed at least some restrictions in an effort to prevent a further uncontrolled spread of the virusmuch of the focus of covid-19 discussion and research has centralized on epidemiological factors the reproductive number r0 of covid-19 has been considered higher than that of sars in a recent review study the average r0 of covid-19 was found to be 328 with a median of 279 4 viral shedding of the novel coronavirus is also long median 20 days in survivors and nonsurvivors have died on average after 18-19 days of illness onset 56 case fatality and infection fatality ratios have been recently reported for china being 367 and 066 respectively 6 in europe similar estimations have not been made yet but covid-19 mortality has been particularly high in some regions such as lombardy italy data shows major country variations in the spread and mortality rates of covid-19 within europe but reasons behind the spread of the disease and subsequent mortality remain partly unexplained different countries have also responded to the epidemic at different rates which gives a starting point for our investigations on societal and psychological factors related to the spread of covid-19 a social scientific perspective could help us understand covid-19 mortalitysocial factors are important in epidemics which should always be understood in their ecological context 7 this means for example that social activity has an impact on the spread of viruses european countries vary greatly in terms of population density and there are also differences in the number of social contacts people have and interact with on a daily basis in addition there are major cultural differences in the physical distance people keep when interacting with their close friends and other people 8 for instance southern european countries have been traditionally considered as contact cultures in comparison to noncontact cultures such as north europe and asia 8-10 during an epidemic both the physical and social closeness of people are factors that explain the spread of the diseaseanother important social factor explaining the spread of viruses is trust trust in institutions and other people is considered an important factor in the well-being and overall functioning of societies 1112 institutional trust can be a crucial part of epidemic management and prevention because trust in public systems and authorities such as health care systems influences how people use services and follow instructions 13 trust in institutions becomes important after disruptive events such as terrorist attacks natural disasters or epidemics 1415 research evidence from previous epidemics showed that those who had lower trust in the government were less likely to take precautions against the ebola virus disease in liberia and congo during the 2014-2016 outbreak 1617 similar findings were also noted during the 2002-2004 sars outbreak in hong kong 18 great trust in authorities has also been associated with carrying out avoidant behaviors during the swine flu epidemic in the united kingdom 19dozens of studies have previously demonstrated significant country differences in institutional trust making it an essential societal element to consider 2021 trust in state institutions is typically highest in nordic countries finland denmark iceland norway sweden which also rank high in different welfare statistics worldwide 22 elsewhere in europe institutional trust is found to be low particularly in eastern european countries but also in southern european countries such as italy 2324 determinants of institutional trust vary across different sides of europe but the perceived lack of responsiveness of political and governmental entities often results in low received trust from the public in east central europe older individuals and women have been found to show more trust toward institutions while trust in political institutions is lower among more educated people 25 in southern european countries such as italy and spain socialization experiences are largely associated with low institutional trust and attitudes toward political institutions are deeply rooted in cultural legacy 26 in other words institutional trust is lowest in those countries characterized as contact cultures the combination of social closeness and lack of trust in authorities might turn out to be lethal within europe at least for older adultsthe aim of our study was to examine country variations of covid-19 mortality in europe by analyzing social risk factors that may explain the spread of the disease restrictions and control measures and institutional trust we expected to find societal differences especially in the capability of coping with this crisis situationthis study was based on an analysis of european social survey ess data on 25 european countries n47802 data were from 2016 ess8 except for bulgaria cyprus and slovakia whose data were from 2012 ess6 and denmark with data from 2014 ess4 ess data sets are openly available for research purposes at the ess web site 27 additional country information was received from eurostat and the world bank covid-19 mortality and incidence figures were drawn from the database built by the coronavirus resource centre at johns hopkins university 28 the data were updated april 15 2020 for this article country restrictions were drawn from the official websites of states and ministries and other related webpages created for the purpose of providing covid-19 updatesess data are publicly available and downloadable at the ess website the collection of their self-reported data is based on informed consent and subscribes to the declaration of professional ethics of the international statistical institute all ess surveys have gone through ethical review by the ess european research infrastructure consortium research ethics board 29 our analyses focused on creating country-level information and no observations at the individual level were used other used data were also publicly available all data and code are available via open science framework 30covid-19 mortality and incidence time series data were collected for 25 european countries and covered 84 days of the covid-19 epidemic january 22 to april 14 2020 incidence rates were also collected but they are treated only as controls because countries differ a lot in their testing rates hence mortality figures provide more accurate information on the spread of the epidemic from february to april 2020information on country restrictions included national bans or restrictions these included bans on public events curfews country border closures restrictions on restaurant operations and elementary school contact teaching public events curfews or unauthorized outings were reviewed and applied from the date when the first nationwide restriction became effective country border closures were determined starting from the date when all the borders of the country were closed restrictions on restaurant operations and elementary school contact teaching were calculated from the date when at least some national restrictions became effective restrictions varied in exact content and accuracy across countriesgeneral country information includes the size of the population population density persons per square kilometer old-age dependency ratio ie ratio of people aged 65 years or older gender ratio life expectancy at birth health care expenditure euros per inhabitant and number of tourist arrivals per year self-reported country information included perceived sociability household size the proportion of older people living with children and perceived institutional trustthe perceived sociability was measured with a question how often do you take part in social activities compared to others of same age the given responses were 1 much less than most 2 less than most 3 about the same 4 more than most and 5 much more than most household size was based on respondents information on how many people live regularly in their household the proportion of older adults living with children was calculated by grouping respondents aged 65 years or older according to whether they currently live in the same household with children institutional trust was measured by respondents trust in five institutions namely parliament politicians political parties the police and the legal system respondents were asked how much they personally trust these institutions on a scale from 0 to 10 in which 0 meant no trust at all and 10 meant complete trust reliability of the measure was good with cronbach alpha ranging from 082 to 092 in the analyses institutional trust was categorized as very low 19 or less low 20-22 high 23-29 and very high 30 or more for an illustrative map and as low less than 23 and high 23 or more based on the median for a random effects regression modelall statistical analyses were conducted with stata 16 software statacorp daily covid-19 mortality during the covid-19 epidemic in europe was analyzed with multilevel mixed effects linear regression models in the multilevel models the dependent variable was the square root transformed daily mortality count the count was based on daily follow-ups on covid-19 mortality cases for each country starting from the first confirmed infection and ending april 14 2020 this resulted in follow-up periods that varied between countries from 82 days in france to 37 days in cyprusto assess the relationship between the daily mortality count and our main theoretical variables we conducted three separate models model 1 included perceived sociability model 2 included timing of national restrictions and model 3 included institutional trust as an independent variable all models controlled for the following between-country factors average household size population population density old-age dependency ratio life expectancy at birth health care expenditure per inhabitant high tourist arrival dummy variable based on median and the length of the follow-up period for each country in addition our models included time as a within-country predictor of mortality the end point of our follow-up period april 14 2020 was coded as the zero point for our time variable preceding days had negative values in descending order until the first day of the countrys follow-up period thus time was used to estimate the within-country change in mortality during the epidemic and the between-country variables estimated the country differences in mortality except time and high tourist-arrival dummy variables all independent variables were mean centered before adding them into the regression modelsall models were conducted with maximum likelihood estimation we estimated huber-white standard errors that were robust to within-country clustering and modelled our residuals to account for the autocorrelated error structure of our longitudinal data the models included random intercept and random slope for time with unstructured covariances we reported regression coefficients and corresponding 95 confidence intervals and p values for the fixed part of our models and standard deviation with 95 confidence interval for the random effectsthe progression of covid-19 mortality before and after the first covid-19 death were analyzed with random effects models to account for clustering at the country level we modelled the amount of daily deaths in low and high institutional trust cutoff point median value 23 after the first covid-19 death time0 which was used as a reference category we then analyzed countries reacting late restrictions placed after the first covid-19 death and early restrictions placed before the first covid-19 death in both analyses each time point day was allowed to have a separate coefficient for the covid-19 mortality value presented as deathsmillion persons models are presented as figures and they are adjusted for population density gender old-age ratio the proportion of those 65 years or older living with children life expectancy and tourist arrivals models included country restrictions as daily varying dummies 0no control 1controldescriptive statistics on the 25 european countries are shown in table 1 the spread of the covid-19 epidemic has been fast everywhere but our findings reveal significant differences between countries the most impacted countries in europe by april 14 are italy spain and france see table 2 all of these countries were also significantly late to implement national restrictions for example italy placed national restrictions almost 2 weeks after the first covid-19 incident see figure 1 france already had 1 death case in february and was the slowest to react nationwide it is highly likely that during these days the virus was able to spread fast in the population which explains the later mortality figuresour multilevel linear regression models analyzed the daily mortality in 25 countries tables 3 and 4 the fixed effect of time was a significant predictor of mortality in all of the models indicating the increasing trend in deaths during the crisis period according to the random part of our models however there was a between-country variation in this trend in addition to a within-country change we found that between-country factors significantly predicted mortality model 1 shows that the perceived sociability predicted higher daily mortality model 2 shows that late restrictions were associated with higher numbers of covid-19 deaths model 3 shows that institutional trust was negatively associated with daily covid-19 mortality figures of our control variables population density life expectancy at birth health care expenditure per inhabitant high tourist arrival and the length of the follow-up period were positively associated with daily mortality yet the significance of these associations varied between modelsthe final part of the analysis focused on the role of institutional trust and reaction time figure 2 shows the map of europe and the average number of deaths per million inhabitants in the analyzed 25 countries categorized in four country groups based on their level of institutional trust the map demonstrates that those countries with low institutional trust have more deaths per million inhabitants on average compared to countries with high trust we analyzed the difference between countries with low vs high perceived institutional trust using a random effects regression model figure 3 shows development after the first covid-19 death case in low- and high-trust countries there are no statistically significant differences between the curves both curves indicate increases in mortality 2 weeks after the first covid-19 death case and there were no statistically significant differences between them figure 4 shows deaths per million inhabitants for countries reacting late and early we can see how the number of deaths per day varied in the 24 days following the first national restrictions and there is a statistically significant difference between the curves increases in mortality were more rapid in those countries reacting late than those reacting early for example 23 days after the first covid-19 death there were 25 times more deaths in late-reacting countries 456 deathsmillion 95 ci 334-578 than in early reacting countries 183 deathsmillion 95 ci 102-265the starting points for this study were the major country differences observed in covid-19 mortality and the related societal and cultural differences as well as how people act in different societies during the current crisis situation we analyzed social risk factors that may explain the spread of the covid-19 restrictions and control measures and institutional trust in an attempt to understand the prevailing country differencesour analysis showed that there were major variations in reactions to the worldwide epidemic we were able to show that mortality was significantly associated with the studied social factors perceived sociability was associated with higher covid-19 mortality even after adjusting for a number of control factors this might be important in understanding why the virus has been able to spread so fast in some countries such as italy which also has a dense population the results also reflect previous cross-cultural findings showing that italians and spanish people have smaller social personal and intimate distances compared to many other european nations 8 these countries also have strong intergenerational ties which may explain why so many older adults got sick 31one of the key points of our analysis is however that the covid-19 mortality is tied to societal processes we found major differences in how fast countries were reacting to the covid-19 outbreak compared to china european countries had time to react yet national restrictions were placed late those countries that are now being hit the hardest by the disease were also the ones that were slowest to react nationwide most notably italy spain and france our models showed that late national restrictions predicted a higher number of deaths despite the unity provided by the european union european countries were not working together against the emerging disease threat and the regulations progressed slowly taking one step at a time there were also delays in putting the restrictions into action some countries have also taken different strategies to the covid-19 epidemic in scandinavia for example sweden has adopted less restrictions than denmark finland and norway sweden also had a higher number of deaths per inhabitants at the time of this writing this example shows that even within similar neighboring countries national precautions to covid-19 have been differentwe were able to demonstrate in our analysis that institutional trust was a protective factor this is in line with previous studies indicating that people with higher institutional trust are more likely to follow the advice and guidelines given by the health authorities 1617 in our analysis covid-19 mortality figures have progressed differently in low-trust countries and high-trust countries remarkably some low-trust countries such as italy spain and france were not only late in placing restrictions but had to place harder measures later such as curfews because people were simply not following the recommendations not to socialize with each other despite hard measures these countries have also had to sanction disobedient citizens for example the ministry of interior in italy reported intensive controls and over 100000 people were caught by the police for breaking the curfew 32epidemiologists have not necessarily given enough attention to the societal and social psychological factors explaining epidemics although there have been virus epidemics before the crisis caused by covid-19 has created a unique global situation demonstrating how poorly the previous epidemics eg sars and middle east respiratory syndrome have prepared countries to deal with this disease 33 what has made the covid-19 situation unique when compared to other epidemics has been the rapid spread of the virus and the unusually hard restrictions placed to prevent physical contact and closeness between people as european countries in general rely on individual freedom and democracy it is difficult to close and shutdown societies completely it becomes crucial to understand how different societies are capable of handling the crisis situation this is typically reflected in the literature as societal resilience and institutional trust is an important part of it 14 as the crisis is not over later developments will reveal what kind of role institutional trust eventually had on the wider picture which also involves factors related to social contacts between people and timely restrictions placed within societies our analysis was limited to a relatively short follow-up period and the inability to control for all possible factors involved we also wish to note that variations across countries exist this involves for example the fact that high-trust countries have adopted different societal strategies to tackle the covid-19 crisis future studies should continue using social scientific evidence in the investigations of worldwide epidemicsbariatric surgery has been used for decades to treat patients with severe obesity in 2016 global guidelines established through the diabetes surgery summit dss an international consensus conference series formally recognised gastrointestinal surgery as a standard therapy for type 2 diabetes this practice is known as metabolic surgery1 during the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak under unprecedented pressure to free up inpatient capacity and because of intraoperative risks for viral contagion among patients and staff hospitals worldwide have been obliged to postpone most elective operations including bariatric and metabolic surgery increased hazards of severe covid-19 complications in patients with obesity type 2 diabetes or both2 3 4 5 further support the rationale for a pause in elective surgery during the peak of the pandemicthe return to normal services will be gradual with surgeons competing for reduced capacity to address a backlog of elective procedures hence access to bariatric and metabolic surgery will continue to be constrained given the uncertainty regarding the effects and duration of the covid-19 outbreak combined with the progressive nature of obesity diabetes and related conditions delaying bariatric and metabolic surgery could increase the risks for morbidity and mortality in surgical candidates the risk of harm however is variable among individuals depending on the type and severity of disease and their indications for bariatric and metabolic surgery the traditional weight-centric criteria for patient selection in bariatric surgery which are still commonly used today do not reflect severity of disease6 and they therefore cannot be used to prioritise treatment based on actual clinical needs furthermore physical distancing policies and continued lockdowns might limit adherence to lifestyle interventions worsening metabolic deterioration among candidates for bariatric and metabolic surgery additionally reduced access to non-urgent care during the covid-19 pandemic might impede postoperative monitoring for potential surgical and nutritional complicationsa clear and urgent need therefore exists for strategies to mitigate harm to patients during and after the covid-19 pandemic these approaches should include non-surgical interventions to optimise metabolic and weight control in patients awaiting surgery telemedicine protocols for postoperative surveillance and use of appropriate criteria to triage surgical candidates during a foreseeable period of reduced capacity for elective surgery to address these issues the dss1 organisers directed a group of international experts to assess the effect of the covid-19 pandemic on candidates for surgical treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes our specific aim was to develop criteria to help prioritise bariatric and metabolic surgery for when elective surgery is resumed and beyondsurgery ameliorates a wide range of conditions and diseases both acute and chronic emergency surgery is required when acute problems pose immediate threat to life organs or limbs and must be done without delay elective surgery refers to operations that can be planned and scheduled in advance these procedures however are not optional because they can have important life-changing implications when access to elective surgery is reduced doctors should prioritise patients with the greatest need or with a greater risk of harm from delayed treatment in some health-care systems elective surgery is categorised into urgent semi-urgent or non-urgent7 8 urgent elective surgery is required within 30 days for conditions that might deteriorate quickly semi-urgent conditions are those that although not likely to deteriorate quickly could reasonably cause severe pain or dysfunction or further harm if delayed beyond 3 months non-urgent elective surgery is planned for conditions that are unlikely to cause substantial discomfort dysfunction or harm if treated within 1 yearalthough some complications from bariatric and metabolic operations can require emergency surgical treatment eg haemorrhage leak or intestinal obstruction most bariatric and metabolic procedures represent genuine elective surgery to date however no consensus exists for criteria to identify urgent semi-urgent or non-urgent indications in bariatric and metabolic surgery on the basis of the type and severity of patients conditionslaparoscopic surgery involves aerosol-generating techniques such as carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum electrocautery and ultrasonic shearing these techniques could easily increase the risk of viral contagion for staff9 10 including with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 upper gastrointestinal endoscopy another aerosol-producing procedure is also commonly done before bariatric and metabolic surgery patients undergoing major surgery are at risk of life-threatening inflammatory complications such as infection including from viruses the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis11
although there is no conclusive evidence that laparoscopy or upper endoscopy can promote covid-19 transmission postponing elective metabolic and bariatric interventions during the acute phase of the covid-19 outbreak seems sensible except for urgent revisional surgery or emergency endoscopic interventions for complications eg haemorrhage stoma stenosis or leaksdespite the potential for a higher risk of contagion the laparoscopic approach in bariatric and metabolic surgery is associated with substantial benefits compared with traditional open surgery especially in patients with severe obesity these benefits include lower rates of mortality and complications including pulmonary and procedural and shorter hospital stays12 13 for these reasons laparoscopic access should remain the preferred approach over open techniques when elective bariatric and metabolic surgery resumes appropriate personal protective equipment should be used however given the increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection for staffobesity increases the risk of complications from viral respiratory infections during the 2009 influenza h1n1 pandemic in california 91 of people who died had obesity and higher bmi was associated with mortality14 in patients admitted to intensive care for sars-cov-2 class 23 obesity bmi 35 kgm2 is an independent risk factor for disease severity5 similarly patients with diabetes have augmented risk for severe covid-19 and mortality2 3 4 5
several mechanisms have been suggested to increase the risk of complications from viral infections in obesity and type 2 diabetes including low-grade chronic inflammation with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines reduced natural killer cell number and activity and impaired antigen-stimulation responses15 16 17 another factor that might have a role in the relationship between obesity diabetes and increased risk for complications is that sars-cov-2 enters host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 ace2 receptor ace2 transforms angiotensin 2 to angiotensin14 15 16 17 18 19 20 thereby reducing vasoconstriction sodium retention inflammation and metabolic degeneration21 chronic hyperglycaemia downregulates ace2 expression22 and further reduction of ace2 during covid-19 infection could contribute to hyperinflammation and respiratory failure in patients with type 2 diabetes23 people with obesity are also prone to hypoventilation syndrome cardiovascular disease24 heart failure25 and other conditions that could increase the risk of covid-19 mortalitywhen elective bariatric and metabolic surgery resumes the pandemic will be contained but sars-cov-2 will probably still circulate in the population given the risks of severe complications from covid-19 in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes we recommend that covid-19 screening should be mandatory preoperatively for patients considering bariatric and metabolic surgerydiabetes is a major cause of morbidity and death including from cardiovascular renal neurological and retinal complications approximately two-thirds of people with diabetes die of cardiovascular disease with a relative risk 1826 times greater than in people without diabetes26 the biological progression of type 2 diabetes characterised by declining -cell function and continuing insulin resistance is manifested clinically by deteriorations in multiple parameters including hba1c fasting and postprandial glucose levels the uk prospective diabetes study27 reported significant associations between hyperglycaemia and development of diabetes complications or death and a 21 risk reduction for any diabetes-related endpoint with each 1 absolute hba1c reductionfactors beyond hyperglycaemia can also influence type 2 diabetes prognosis in the triad study28 29 predictors of all-cause mortality at 4 years and 8 years of study follow-up included older age male sex non-hispanic white race lower education and income longer duration of diabetes lower bmi hypertension macrovascular disease retinopathy nephropathy and neuropathy among the specific predictors of cardiovascular mortality were also treatment with insulin with or without oral medication higher ldl cholesterol history of nephropathy transient ischaemic attack stroke angina myocardial infarction coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease and use of antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering medicationsobesity increases the risks of many other illnesses including diabetes hypertension dyslipidaemia liver disease coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease many cancers cholelithiasis infertility psychosocial dysfunction osteoarthritis chronic kidney disease and now also covid-19 together these complications powerfully reduce quality of life and exacerbate obesity-associated mortality even before covid-19 obesity reduced life expectancy by 520 years30 notably higher all-cause mortality is associated with obesity class 2 bmi 35399 kgm2 and 3 bmi 40 kgm2 corresponding to candidates for bariatric surgery but not with class 1 obesity bmi 30349 kgm231
obesity hypoventilation syndrome and obesity-associated heart failure substantially increase mortality obesity hypoventilation syndrome represents the combination of obesity and chronic daytime hypercapnia32 33 the prevalence of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is highest among patients with a bmi of more than 50 kgm234 mortality from untreated obesity hypoventilation syndrome can be as high as 24 at 152 years after diagnosis35 obesity heart failure is associated with increased mortality and for each 5-unit increase in bmi heart failure-related mortality increases by 14 times36
since bmi alone does not reflect obesity-related mortality and morbidity staging systems such as the kings obesity criteria37 and edmonton obesity staging system eoss38 have been developed to assess individual patients risk on the basis of evidence of subclinical established or end-stage comorbidities39 retrospective application of eoss to data from the national health and nutrition examination survey showed that patients in stages 24 of eoss have increased all-cause mortality compared with stages 0 or 1 this finding supports the idea that the presence type and severity of obesity-related complications in addition to bmi39 should inform decision making about the prioritisation of treatment especially surgerynon-alcoholic fatty liver disease is characterised by excess hepatic fat its more aggressive form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis includes hepatocyte injury inflammation and fibrosis40 41 42 these two conditions affect 2025 of the western population with rates rising worldwide40 43 66 of patients with obesity and diabetes have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis44 45
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis can lead to cirrhosis in 1520 of cases liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma46 beyond liver-related mortality non-alcoholic steatohepatitis can substantially increase microvascular and macrovascular complications and cardiovascular mortality in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes40 41 42 43 47 48 non-randomised trials suggest that roux-en-y gastric bypass resolves the histological features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in up to 80 of patients49 50
randomised clinical trials and observational studies show that in patients with all classes of obesity bariatric and metabolic surgery promotes greater long-term weight loss than the best available non-surgical interventions regardless of the operation chosen47 51 52 53 multiple observational studies also indicate that bariatric and metabolic surgery lowers long-term risk of all-cause mortality compared with matched non-surgical patients54 55 56 57 58 59 data from eight observational studies involving a total of 635 642 patients suggest that bariatric and metabolic surgery is associated with a reduced risk of all types of cancer odds ratio or072 95 ci 059087 and obesity-associated cancer or055 95 ci 03109660 61 62 without exception each of the 29 all-cause mortality studies published to date shows that patients who have bariatric and metabolic surgery live longer than matched non-surgical controls54 55 56 57 58 59 63 64
concerning type 2 diabetes at least 12 randomised controlled trials comparing bariatric and metabolic surgery with conventional diabetes therapies ie lifestyle plus medication in patients with type 2 diabetes show that surgery is superior for control of hyperglycaemia reduction of cardiovascular and overall mortality risk improvement in quality of life and reduction in risk of renal complications1 65 66 the safety of bariatric and metabolic surgery compares favourably with that of most elective operations including hysterectomy cholecystectomy and knee replacement surgical treatments for diabetes are highly cost-effective with the cost per quality-adjusted life-year ranging between us3200 and 13 0001 65 67
based on this evidence dss guidelines which have been formally endorsed by 56 worldwide medical or scientific organisations and recognised by payers worldwide recommend the consideration of bariatric and metabolic surgery for appropriate candidates including those with only class 1 obesity who do not achieve adequate glycaemic control with medical therapy1
the delay of bariatric and metabolic surgery that is occurring due to covid-19 will augment the burden of disease among surgical candidates this increase will particularly affect patients with type 2 diabetes given that metabolic surgery causes remission of hyperglycaemia in most cases65 the likelihood of hyperglycaemia remission however depends upon how soon an operation is done during the natural history of diabetes algorithms designed to predict surgical remission eg diarem-2 ad-diarem diabetter and abcd68 69 70 71 consistently show that longstanding disease is one of the most powerful indicators of failure to achieve this benefit72 remission rates drop off notably after 10 years of diabetes moreover the sos study73 reported substantially lower type 2 diabetes remission among patients with only 4 years of known disease than in those with 2 years of known disease thus delaying metabolic surgery reduces the chances of diabetes remissiondelayed metabolic surgery might cause even greater harm to patients with type 2 diabetes who are at higher risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and mortality especially when medications and lifestyle interventions are not achieving adequate metabolic control patients without diabetes but with severe respiratory obesity hypoventilation syndrome cardiac or renal complications of obesity and individuals for whom weight reduction is crucial to advancing time-sensitive and life-saving treatments eg organ transplants also have greater risks of harm from delaying bariatric and metabolic surgerypatients with surgically remediable metabolic diseases especially diabetes incur more health-care costs per day than do those without these conditions all studies that compared costs for 15 years between surgical and non-surgical patients found that pharmacy expenses decrease substantially after bariatric and metabolic surgery compared with matched non-surgical patients74 75 76 77 78 primarily due to lower diabetes medication costs69 hence metabolic surgery decreases daily health-care costs especially for patients requiring multidrug therapy the longer surgery is delayed for these patients the less cost-saving it becomesvarious non-surgical options can be used to mitigate the harm from delaying bariatric and metabolic surgery and to manage patients who have had surgery panel 1
 regarding the need to optimise glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes especially those with advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications79 we considered available evidence of pharmacological strategies that promote weight loss such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists glp-1ra or sodiumglucose cotransporter 2 sglt-2 inhibitors or both80 glp-1ras reduce hba1c by about 181 while promoting clinically relevant weight loss82 sglt-2 inhibitors however might be contraindicated with covid-19 because of concerns about potential subclinical vascular congestion and risk of acute metabolic decompensation associated with these drugs83
panel 1diabetes surgery summit recommendations for managing bariatric and metabolic surgical candidates and postoperative patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic
non-surgical options to mitigate harm from delaying surgery

glycaemic control should be optimised in patients awaiting metabolic surgery for type 2 diabetes especially for those with advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications this is desirable to prepare for surgery and also in case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infectionin patients who do not achieve glycaemic targets with lifestyle modifications and metformin the addition of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist glp-1ra or sodiumglucose cotransporter 2 sglt-2 inhibitor or both can advance the combined goals of improving metabolic control and causing weight loss or limiting weight gain use of sglt-2 inhibitors however is not recommended in the case of acute coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 infection because of concerns about potential subclinical vascular congestion and risk of acute metabolic decompensation associated with these drugsfor patients with multiple weight-responsive comorbidities who face prolonged waiting times for surgery dietary or pharmacological interventions for weight control might become necessarydiets with higher protein content and lower glycaemic index can be effective and should be consideredamong patients already taking weight-loss medications efforts should be made to continue the drugs until surgery is scheduled since rapid weight regain is predictable when they are discontinuedin countries where weight-loss medications eg phentermine orlistat glp-1ras naltrexonebupropion and phenterminetopiramate are accessible clinicians could consider their use when weight loss or weight maintenance is important such as for patients with multiple weight-responsive comorbidities

management of patients who have had surgery

telemedicine strategies that are supervised by specialist bariatric and metabolic surgery providers should be usedin people with persistent or recurrent type 2 diabetes after surgery weight-reducing diabetes medications eg glp-1ras should be considered weight maintenance should also be encouraged in patients with type 2 diabetes remission to mitigate risk of disease recurrencethere is insufficient evidence to justify deviations from current evidence-based recommendations for postoperative nutritional care in patients who have had bariatric and metabolic surgeryto minimise risk of nutrition-related complications providers should engage with patients at the same intervals as in current guidelinesclinical signs eg weight visual changes rash weakness oedema or anasarca and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms eg nausea tingling bowel-habit changes and fatigue of nutritional deficiency must be assessed during virtual clinic sessionsroutine laboratory tests eg albumin thiamine b12 vitamin a vitamin d iron and calcium should not be deferred but obtained at standard intervals particularly for patients who had operations with greater risk of nutrient malabsorption such as long-limb diversionary proceduresurgent face-to-face meetings and laboratory tests are mandated when symptoms suggest severe biochemical deficiencies or surgical complications eg intestinal obstruction or acute cholecystitis

preparation for surgery and surgical technique

misconceptions and stigma about obesity and bariatric and metabolic surgery might further penalise candidates for surgical treatment of obesity and diabetes in times of limited resources clinicians policy makers and hospital managers should recognise the seriousness of the diseases that require metabolic and bariatric surgery and ensure that these operations are not further delayedgiven the risks of severe complications from covid-19 in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes covid-19 screening should be mandatory preoperatively for patients considering bariatric and metabolic surgerydespite the potential higher risk of contagion for staff the risk and benefit of a laparoscopic approach remain favourable for patients and should be preferred over the use of open techniquesappropriate personal protective equipment should be used as recommended by professional bodies and public health agencies to minimise risk for staff and operators
we also considered available data regarding the efficacy of dietary or pharmacological interventions for weight loss84 85 86 87 88 or both as a strategy to achieve weight loss or weight maintenance in patients with multiple weight-responsive comorbidities who face prolonged waiting times for bariatric and metabolic surgery regarding strategies to maximise surgical outcomes in patients who have already had surgery our recommendations are based on results from studies investigating the efficacy of pharmacological approaches in people with persistent or recurrent type 2 diabetes after surgery among these individuals a recent study89 showed that the glp-1ra liraglutide can reduce hba1c by 12 with up to 5 additional weight loss we reviewed existing evidence-based recommendations for postoperative nutritional care79 to define safe and pragmatic methods of virtual consultation by telemedicine panel 1the prioritisation of any elective operation should seek to facilitate access according to clinical need maximise equity of access and minimise the harm from delayed access we have adapted previous categorisations of elective surgery7 to define an objective prioritisation system reflecting these principles for bariatric and metabolic operations panel 2

standard access surgery after 90 days

patients conditions are unlikely to deteriorate within 6 monthsonly mild dysfunction or symptomsdelaying surgical treatment beyond 90 days is unlikely to significantly reduce effectiveness of surgery
given the factors contributing to morbidity and mortality in obesity and type 2 diabetes surgical prioritisation should be based on disease-specific considerations for patients with type 2 diabetes we suggest that surgery be prioritised for patients at increased risk of morbidity and mortality this risk would be indicated by poor glycaemic control despite maximal medical therapy use of insulin previous cardiovascular disease albuminuria and chronic kidney disease non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or multiple cardiometabolic comorbidities28 insulin use is a meaningful prioritisation criterion because it correlates with increased cardiovascular mortality28 and reduced quality of life92 moreover metabolic surgery reduces or abolishes the need for insulin in most patients1 47 52 to mitigate the risk of substantially reducing treatment efficacy we suggest prioritising surgery in patients with more than 5 years of diabetes this suggestion is based on evidence that individuals with shorter diabetes duration have greater chances of achieving disease remission92 whereas type 2 diabetes duration of 810 years remits far less often postoperatively1 65 93
the severity of obesity-associated symptoms eg mobility issues or joint pain as a consequence of extremely high bmi regardless of comorbidities must also be considered when establishing priorities equally important is the effect of obesity-related conditions that increase morbidity and mortality eg obesity hypoventilation syndrome chronic kidney disease or severe obstructive sleep apnoea38 the availability of non-surgical options that slow disease progression ie pharmacological diabetes treatments achieving adequate glycaemic control reduces need for prioritisation expedited access to surgery should also be considered when bariatric and metabolic operations are used as adjuvant therapy to enable other time-sensitive treatments that are made unfeasible or unsafe by excess weight poor metabolic control or both figuremany candidates for bariatric and metabolic surgery are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from comorbid conditions for these patients access to surgical treatment should be prioritised on the basis of disease-focused clinical needs rather than primarily on bmi to mitigate harm from delaying surgery this approach is especially needed in periods in which access to surgery is reduced as in the current covid-19 pandemic societal crises often spur developments that provide benefits long after the storm passes disease-oriented medically meaningful strategies to triage patients seeking metabolic surgery after the covid-19 crisis should help prioritise patients in more urgent need both now and long into the future
we did a rapid narrative literature review for this personal view for references about the effect of viral infections including coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 on diabetes obesity and laparoscopic surgery we searched pubmed for articles in english published between jan 1 2002 and april 10 2020 we used combinations of terms such as sars h1n1 coronavirus covid-19 sars-cov-2 diabetes obesity bmi laparoscopy endoscopy severe acute respiratory syndrome acute respiratory distress syndrome and co-morbiditieswe also reviewed recent guidelines from professional organisations and public health agencies about elective surgery and the covid-19 pandemic for evidence about the benefits of bariatric and metabolic surgery the predicting factors of morbidity and mortality from type 2 diabetes obesity non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and the classification of elective surgery we reviewed recently published systematic reviews and consensus statements by major scientific societies and relevant individual articles cited in these documentsmembers of the expert panel were selected on the basis of their previous participation in the diabetes surgery summit series and their relevant expertise additional experts were also invited to join the group and provide complementary expertise or ensure global representation or both a subgroup of the expert panel did a first appraisal of the evidence and draft recommendations and they generated the first draft of the report synthetising the literature review in response to each specific query the entire expert group then engaged in online discussion to further appraise the evidence and refine the final consensus recommendations
the temporal dynamics of viral pathogens depend on several factors including transmission properties of the virus and the survival immune response and spatial distribution of the hosts eg may 1983 anderson  may 1991 in general viruses that show low pathogenicity and prolonged infectiousness are likely to exhibit relatively high and constant prevalence anderson  may 1979a and can therefore be termed endemic in contrast viruses that spread rapidly have a shorter duration of infectiousness and cause higher host mortality or immunity are more likely to generate discrete epidemics anderson  may 1979b epidemic diseases are characterized by rapid changes in the prevalence of infection and may disappear from the host population for extended periods such pathogens are likely to require high host densities for invasion and persistence and the extent of outbreaks should increase with the size of the susceptible host population may 1983 onstad  carruthers 1990 anderson  may 1982 jaffee et al 1992the populationlevel impact of viral infections will depend on their effects on host survival and reproduction may 1983 dobson  mccallum 1995 recent empirical and theoretical studies have shown that virulence can be advantageous to the parasite and is not necessarily a sideeffect of novel hostparasite combinations eg allison 1982 ewald 1983 anderson  may 1991 herre 1993 lenski  may 1994 levin 1996 although transient impacts of novel parasites can be immense few studies have addressed the longterm effects of disease in wildlife populations grenfell  gulland 1995 most wildlife diseases are studied via incidental post mortems and manipulative experiments in natural populations are often impossible dobson  mccallum 1995viruses have been implicated as the cause of several major declines in carnivore populations young 1994 for example canine distemper virus cdv killed over 70 of the last remaining colony of freeliving blackfooted ferrets thorne  williams 1988 and phocine distemper killed over 18 000 harbour seals in northern europe osterhaus  vedder 1988 rabies has been suggested to cause population decline in wolves ethiopian wolves and african wild dogs eg macdonald 1980 kat et al 1995 weiler garner  ritter 1995 sillero king  macdonald 1996 ballard  krausman 1997 laurenson et al 1998 perhaps the beststudied example is the canine distemper virus cdv outbreak that struck the serengeti lions and several other species in late 1993early 1994 roelkeparker et al 1996 also see alexander  appel 1994 alexander et al 1995 cdv originated from the large population of domestic dogs surrounding the serengeti ecosystem and killed 35 of the serengeti lions within 6 months over 85 of the lions were infected and many victims showed neurological disorders encephalitis and pneumonia while this outbreak followed a welldefined onset many other viral epidemics have been inferred solely from crosssectional serological surveys eg olmsted et al 1992 spencer  morkel 1993 creel et al 1997 and detailedlongterm investigations of viruscarnivore interactions are rare grenfell  gulland 1995 dobson  mccallum 1995in the present study we evaluate temporal changes in the exposure of african lions to six different viruses these viruses show a variety of transmission modes symptoms and durations of infectiousness in domestic carnivores table 1 for example both feline immunodeficiency virus fiv a lentivirus closely associated with hiv and feline herpesvirus permanently infect their hosts and do not elicit lasting immunity table 1 in contrast canine distemper virus cdv feline calicivirus feline coronavirus and feline parvovirus generally cause only temporary infection although a small proportion of infected hosts may persist as asymptomatic carriers using serological data from two different lion populations we first classify these viruses as either endemic or epidemic we estimate the timing of each epidemic by combining the temporal pattern of seroprevalence with information on the lions ages at the time of sampling we then examine the relationship between the extent of each epidemic and the proportion and density of susceptible hosts in the population finally we measure the impact of viral infection on lion mortality and birth rateslions have been studied continuously in the serengeti since march 1966 and in the ngorongoro crater since 1963 packer tatar  collins 1998 all animals are individually recognized from natural markings packer  pusey 1993 and most have been regularly observed since birth pusey  packer 1994 and thus the precise age is known for each individual blood samples were collected in the serengeti each year between 1984 and 1994 and the crater lions were sampled in 1984 1985 1987 and 1991 see table 2 for annual sample sizes these samples were originally collected for genetic assay obrien et al 1987 packer et al 1991ab and to investigate the cdv outbreak in 1994 roelkeparker et al 1996 serological assays were later performed to assess the lions exposure to fiv olmsted et al 1992 brown et al 1994 cdv roelkeparker et al 1996 and feline leukaemia herpes parvo corona and calicivirus hofmannlehmann et al 1996 over 300 lions were also tested for felv but none showed detectable levels of antigens hofmannlehmann et al 1996 table 3 summarizes the precise assays and criteria used to determine serostatus for the remaining six viruses many animals were tested repeatedly and repeat samples are included in any descriptive analysis but excluded from all statistical tests unless an animal seroconvertedlions are considered to be immatures until 4 years of age most females do not start breeding until well after their third birthday while males do not attain breeding status until they are about 5 years old packer et al 1988 1998 the serengeti study area covers the southeastern quarter of the serengeti national park this 2000 km2 area consists of two contrasting habitats acacia woodland and opengrass plains see packer et al 1988 lions on the plains live at lower densities and endure lower levels of food availability than their woodlands counterparts the ngorongoro crater is located about 90 km to the southeast of the serengeti study area and the crater lions enjoy higher and more consistent levels of food availability than the serengeti lions hanby bygott  packer 1995 however the crater is a small isolated population 80100 animals with an associated loss in genetic diversity compared to the much larger serengeti population obrien et al 1987 packer et al 1991b which includes an estimated 20003000 animals schaller 1972 hanby  bygott 1978consistent with a pattern of chronic infection the lion populations showed constant and high levels of seroprevalence for fiv and feline herpes virus rates of fiv infection did not vary significantly across years for either adults or immatures fig 1a or by sex cf courchamp et al 1998 combining data from all years small cubs quickly seroconverted to fiv  and this trend was similar in the serengeti and ngorongoro crater fig 2 all but two of 374 animals in the serengeti and ngorongoro were positive for herpes virus fig 1b including all eight cubs sampled before their first birthdayeach of the remaining four viruses appeared to be absent from the serengeti for 412 years followed by a sudden resurgence in the frequency of seropositive hosts fig 3 the sporadic nature of these widespread infections is most conspicuous in the youngest age classes and the precise timing of each outbreak differed between the serengeti and ngorongoro crater
cdv seroprevalence varied between years in the serengeti in both adults and immatures fig 3a the sharp rise in 199394 in cdv seroprevalence of adults and immatures was due to the outbreak documented by roelkeparker et al 1996 whereas the declining adult seroprevalence in the mid1980s reflected an earlier outbreak the ngorongoro crater lions also appear to have been infected before 1984 with no further epidemics before the end of the sampling period in 1991 see fig 4
parvovirus annual seroprevalence of adult lions varied somewhat in the serengeti and the seroprevalence of immatures varied significantly among years fig 3b immatures showed the highest frequency of exposure in 1985 see hofmannlehmann et al 1996 and in 1992 none of the immatures in ngorongoro crater tested positive for parvovirus see below
coronavirus annual seroprevalence in the serengeti only varied significantly in immatures fig 3c in ngorongoro crater there was evidence of new infections between 1984 and 1991 but our sample size was inadequate to confirm significant variation between years
calicivirus seroprevalence varied across years in the serengeti but varied most dramatically in immatures fig 3d immatures showed the highest seroprevalence in 1985 and 199091 calicivirus was absent from ngorongoro crater hofmannlehmann et al 1996the four epidemic viruses showed fluctuating prevalence in each study population often increasing in discrete outbreaks the timing of these outbreaks can be estimated from the seroprevalence data in conjunction with the age of each study animal for example out of all the serengeti lions sampled between 1984 and october 1993 only those animals that had been born before july 1981 were seropositive for cdv fig 4a every lion born after 1981 was seronegative for cdv until 199394 when a new epidemic swept through the population infecting lions of all ages fig 4b this pattern strongly suggests that the virus had been absent from the serengeti from 1981 until the end of 1993 data from ngorongoro suggest that cdv infected the crater lions sometime in 1980 but then disappeared from the population for the following 11 years the youngest seropositive animal had been born in june 1980 but no animal born later than this date had been infected by the end of our last sampling effort in 1991 fig 4csimilar heterogeneities in the ageprevalence data could be discerned for the other three viruses and one example from each virus is plotted in fig 5 we interpret the marked discontinuities in seroprevalence for these viruses to indicate a high rate of infection similar to the cdv outbreak of 1994 fig 4b in support of this assumption almost all of the putative outbreaks simultaneously infected multiple prides and included cubs as well as adults the only exception was an outbreak of calicivirus in 1987 that infected only a few members of a single pride located along the northern boundary of our serengeti study area the approximate enddates of outbreaks of each virus are summarized in table 4 except for the 1994 cdv epidemic where comparable data are not yet available these dates are presumed to have been the beginning of prolonged intervals where no new seroconversions occurredbesides these extreme discontinuities in exposure the seroprevalence data also suggest several earlier outbreaks through a stairstep pattern for example fig 4a shows that virtually all animals born between 1970 and 1977 were seropositive for cdv during the 198493 sampling period whereas animals born in 197881 showed a consistently lower prevalence this pattern may be most easily explained by two epidemics that ended in 1977 and 1981 a similar pattern is evident for calicivirus where separate epidemics resulted in a higher seroprevalence for animals born in 197986 than for those born in 198790 fig 5cif these viruses do occur in discrete epidemics antibody titres and seroprevalence should both decline in the years following an outbreak because the strength of each individuals immune response weakens through time however we only resampled enough individuals to test this prediction directly for two viruses fifteen parvo animals were resampled between the 1985 and 1992 parvovirus outbreaks their titre levels declined significantly n  13 animals whose titre levels changed t  15 p  005 signedranks test and two seropositive animals became seronegative after 125 and 425 years respectively only two cdv animals were resampled in the 1980s and both showed a decline in antibody titres between 1985 and 1987including all animals that were old enough to have been exposed to each virus seroprevalence consistently declined after the presumed end of each epidemic fig 6 responses to three viruses cdv calici and parvovirus declined at a remarkably similar rate but coronavirus response declined more rapidly as predicted individual titre levels also declined through time for cdv t  808 n  139 seropositive animals p  00001 r

2  05535 n  7 p  00552 and the relationship becomes highly significant if we include the 1987 calicivirus outbreak that did not spread beyond a single pride t  421 r
2  07434 n  8 p  00056although the overall trend in fig 10 is quite striking the data are based on very rough approximations and on only 13 outbreaks per virus within each virus only calicivirus shows a trend in the same direction as the overall pattern the paired outbreaks of parvovirus and coronavirus show slight trends in the opposite direction to the overall pattern but it is perhaps more noteworthy that the two points in each pair are so similar this suggests that epidemics of parvovirus and coronavirus each spread with a typical magnitude and each strike at a typical level of seroprevalence noteworthy too is the possibility that parvovirus may consistently infect a higher proportion of susceptibles than does coronavirus perhaps due to a longer persistence outside the host weeks for parvovirus vs hours for coronaviruswe can only provide limited data on the precise cause of mortality in these animals most lions simply disappear from the study area and most observed fatalities result from direct combat with other lions or from injuries sustained during prey capture packer et al 1988 the only clearcut examples of death due to disease occurred during the cdv outbreak in 1994 roelkeparker et al 1996 in the following section we rely on a demographic analysis to determine whether any of these viruses is associated with widespread mortality or infertility these assessments depend on whether the virus is endemic or epidemicbecause only two lions tested negative for herpesvirus we lack a control group with which to compare infected animals we are therefore unable to measure effects of herpes infection on host fitnessalthough virtually every lion was fiv by the age of 4 years fig 2 about 20 of 12yearolds were fiv thus we restrict our analysis to the longterm survival of young animals in domestic cats fiv infection is permanent and inflicts most mortality 35 years after the initial infection see table 1 if fiv is similarly harmful to lions we would expect fiv lions to suffer a shorter life expectancy than fiv lions of a comparable age note though that all the fiv animals presumably contracted the virus by their fourth birthday and our analysis therefore contrasts the survival of animals infected early in life vs those that would have been infected at a later age
figure 11 shows the annual agespecific mortality of lions according to their fiv status as yearlings top or as 2yearolds bottom data are plotted separately for males and females because of their contrasting life histories as subadults packer et al 1988 fiv did not measurably increase mortality either in the short term when fiv animals were presumably still uninfected or in the long term overall seven fiv animals survived  10 years although these data are too limited to detect subtle effects on mortality we have seen no clinical signs of immune deficiency except during the cdv outbreak in 1994 cdv is immunosuppressive but there was no association between clinical pathology and fiv status of cdv victims roelkeparker et al 1996 further we found no evidence that coinfection with any of the other viruses influenced longevity of fiv individuals all statistical tests nonsignificantthe entire adult population was fiv  so we cannot assess the effects of viral infection on fecundityoutbreaks of each virus occurred at 412year intervals table 4 we therefore restricted our analysis to the annual mortality of lions 4 years old since these cohorts consisted entirely of susceptibles at the onset of each outbreak cub mortality is of particular interest here since most diseaseinduced mortality is restricted to kittens in domestic cats table 1 survival rates in young lions depended on age and fluctuated from year to year fig 12 but there was no consistent pattern associated with any particular virus for example cub survival was significantly reduced during the calicivirus outbreak of 1980 2  1935 df  1 p  00000 although cub survival was also belowaverage in the calicivirus outbreak of 1985 cubs enjoyed higher survival than average during the 1990 calicivirus epidemic only the 1994 cdv outbreak inflicted lower survival on every agegroup with significant declines for yearlings 2  2409 df  1 p  00000 and 3yearolds 2  1061 df  1 p  00011 however neither the 1981 cdv outbreak in the serengeti nor the 1980 outbreak in ngorongoro had any appreciable impact on lion survival although two serengeti lions developed myoclonus in 1981without clear signs of illness we cannot rule out the possibility of a spurious association between a single disease outbreak and a year of low survival however the cdv outbreak of 1994 was welldocumented and included clearly observed cases of seizures and myoclonus roelkeparker et al 1996 this suggests that the high survival rates during earlier outbreaks of cdv may have been due to nonpathogenic strains of the virus it was not possible to estimate the extent of the earlier cdv epidemics but it is at least noteworthy that cdv in 1994 was the most extensive of any documented outbreak and struck the largest population of susceptibles unfortunately we have been unable to collect any blood samples from ngorongoro crater since 1991 so we cannot test whether the recent decline in this population see fig 7 was associated with a viral outbreak a domestic dog with cdv was found on the crater rim in october of 1994 cleaveland 1996 and several of the ngorongoro crater lions were conspicuously ill at about the same time but none showed neurological symptoms of cdvwe measured fecundity as the proportion of females that gave birth during a particular year because of high adult seroprevalence for all viruses adult females could only have been susceptible to a virus if the interval between outbreaks was sufficiently long this analysis is therefore restricted to seven widelyspaced outbreaks in the serengeti and only includes young and hence susceptible females because of agerelated changes in fecundity packer et al 1998 as well as mediumterm ecological variations hanby et al 1995 we compare the reproductive performance of 413yearold females over the first 2 years before andor after each outbreak as in the mortality analysis none of the four viruses consistently inflicted a significant loss in fecundity although there seems to be a recurring effect of cdv fig 13 again it is possible that there were strain differences as fecundity was slightly lowered during the 1985 parvovirus and calicivirus outbreaks the high annual variation around the 1990 calicivirus and 1993 coronavirus epidemics is difficult to interpret and presumably reflects other ecological factors such as annual variations in prey availability population density and social disruption see packer et al 1988temporal variation in seroprevalence indicates that both fiv and herpesvirus are endemic in these lion populations both show consistently high prevalence figs 1 and 2 and both appear to be relatively harmless although it is difficult to compare the fitness of infected and uninfected hosts in domestic cats fiv follows a similar aetiology as hiv in humans pedersen et al 1987 yamamoto et al 1988 torten et al 1991 and like hiv in humans fiv appears to have infected domestic cats only recently rigby et al 1993 carpenter  obrien 1995 we could find no evidence that fiv status influenced lion mortality fig 11 nor did we observe any obvious signs of immunodeficiency or clinical pathology in fiv individuals but see poli et al 1995 phylogenetic analysis of fiv sequences in our study animals suggests that lions have been hosts to the virus for long periods of time brown et al 1994 and an attenuated effect from fiv infection may have arisen through a variety of coevolutionary mechanisms reviewed by carpenter  obrien 1995 alternatively studies of domestic cats suggest that fiv may be more pathogenic in individuals that are coinfected with felv courchamp et al 1997 thus the low impact of fiv in these lions may be because they are not coinfected with felvthe remaining four viruses showed high temporal variation in seroprevalence indicative of epidemic outbreaks of disease figs 3 and 4 these outbreaks typically occurred after a large number of susceptibles were recruited into the population fig 8 and the extent of each outbreak apparently depended on the size of the susceptible host population figs 9 and 10 previous studies have documented the existence of threshold host densities for the establishment of pathogens in natural populations jaffee et al 1992 dobson  hudson 1995 dobson  meagher 1996 in the lions calicivirus parvovirus and to some extent coronavirus showed evidence that viral invasion required a threshold density of susceptible hosts fig 8 minimum estimates of susceptible host density varied among the viruses and ranged from 75 to 200 animals in the serengeti study area which includes about 10 of the overall serengeti lion populationviruses that were associated with higher initial rates of spread as estimated by our measure of incidence also required the highest threshold densities of seronegative hosts for example calicivirus and coronavirus outbreaks occurred when susceptible host densities were relatively low and were associated with smaller increases in seroprevalence in contrast parvovirus required a larger number of susceptibles and infected a larger proportion of susceptibles during outbreaks cdv is both the exception and the rule for this pattern cdv infected numerous carnivore species in the late 1970s as well as in 1994 reviewed in roelkeparker et al 1996 cleaveland 1996 so the susceptible population of only 75 lions in 1981 and over 200 lions in 1994 actually included uncounted numbers of susceptible canids hyenas and other large felids however the lion population was not only large but also 100 susceptible during the 1994 cdv epidemic and over 85 of the lions were infected within a few monthsnone of the epidemic viruses consistently lowered host fitness the 1994 cdv outbreak was conspicuously harmful as emphasized by the sharp decline in the serengeti population see fig 7 and the 1980 calicivirus epidemic may have inflicted considerable cub mortality but other outbreaks of these same viruses appeared to be essentially harmless indeed none of these viruses regularly inflicted the same degree of mortality observed in domestic cats table 1 sequence data are only available for the 1994 cdv strain roelkeparker et al 1996 so we cannot make similar assessments of coevolutionary history as for fiv nor can we comment on genetic differences between strains of the same virus however strain differences in pathogenicity have been well documented in other morbiliviruses besides cdv eg rinderpest plowright 1982 it is also possible that all of these viruses were harmful to some extent but our demographic analysis was too coarsegrained to detect their effects the timing of each outbreak was estimated retrospectively we could not control for confounding interactions with other ecological variables and the lions were no doubt coinfected with additional pathogens and parasites no field analysis could ever provide the sort of comparisons that would be available from controlled experiments dobson  mccallum 1995
dobson  mccallum 1995 and jaenike 1998 have shown that host populations can be limited by pathogens that inflict moderate effects on host mortality and moderate to large effects on fertility out of all the viruses included in this study only cdv appears to be sufficiently virulent to cause measurable declines in the serengetingorongoro lion populations cdv caused considerable mortality in 1994 and may have lowered host fertility during the 1981 and 1994 outbreaks however cdv entered the lion population in discrete widelyspaced epidemics and these epidemics have been sufficiently infrequent to inflict lasting consequences the serengeti population recovered rapidly from the 1994 epidemic regaining its former size by the middle of 1997 fig 7 domestic dogs are the primary reservoir for cdv in the serengetingorongoro region cleaveland 1996 and the dog population has grown dramatically with the growing human population over the past 30 years raising the prospects of more frequent extensive and virulent cdv epidemics in the lions and other wild carnivores attempts to inoculate this reservoir against cdv are currently underway kaare  cleaveland 1997data analysis was supported by

foundation cornell university and the union bank of switzerland we thank the anonymous referees for their extensive commentsthe outbreak of novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 first reported in wuhan china that contributed to an increased morbidity and mortality was declared to be a major worldwide pandemic by the world health organization who 1 since then recent advances in understanding the pathological progression and transmission of coronavirus disease covid-19 have contributed to efforts toward the development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies although coronaviruses covs were initially contemplated to be a cause of multifaceted diseases in mammals and birds with its origin in bats 2 the evolution of this virus has resulted in its increased pathogenicity in humans covs in general were deemed important in veterinary responses however since the outbreak of human coronavirus hcov causing severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov in 2003 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 and the recent outbreak of sars-cov-2 it has been labeled as an emerging pathogen in humansgiven their high pathogenicity in humans and the extent of global impact caused by the hcov outbreaks in the past two decades it has been a topic of great interest hence the mechanistic action of this virus is being thoroughly investigated by researchers the causative agent of the current pandemic presenting as a viral pneumonia sars-cov-2 is a group of large enveloped rna viruses under the coronaviridae family classified specifically under the nidovirales order 3 the cumulative line of evidence demonstrates that sars-cov-2 shares 796 of sequence identity to the sars-cov outbreak in 2003 at a genomic level while the genomic sequence is almost 96 identical to the bat coronavirus 4 which provides a significant insight to understanding covid-19 and its origin while understanding the origin and the evolution of sars-cov-2 is imminent the clinical manifestation of this virus in humans and the increasing number of symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers every day presents growing concern for public healththe aggressive growth in numbers of emerging cases suggests the rapid spread of the virus in nave population and improvement in diagnostic capability during this covid-19 outbreak however there is an increasing evidence of epidemiological disparity in disease burden between urban and rural areas 567 the differences in the urban and rural areas can highly determine the influence of a viral pandemic in terms of viral transmission diagnostics morbidity and mortality 5 these differences mainly arise from the socioeconomic factors access to healthcare and pandemic preparedness given the higher percentage of us rural population being old age  60 individuals with obesity body mass index bmi  30 and associated co-morbidities along with their smoking status these factors puts them at higher risk of infection and severe complications arising from covid-19 hence this review aims to provide an insight on the modality and transmission dynamics of the sars-cov-2 clinical characteristics persistent with the virus and further discuss efforts toward the development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies to combat its progression in humans this review also aims to assess the challenges of the covid-19 pandemic in rural settings based on the past pandemic experiences and the overall effect on rural populationthe databases of this research included

96 references and citations were utilizedthe articles were reviewed based on their abstracts to find out the relevancy to this study conclusively the findings were presented under the subheadings of pathogenesis of covid-19 transmission dynamics of covid-19 clinical characteristics persistent with covid-19 pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention and finally challenges in rural populationcovs normally cause enteric diseases in several animal species and affect the respiratory tract of mammals including humans and lead to mild-to-severe respiratory tract infections 8 studies report five major protein regions for hcovs such as replicase complex spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid proteins that function in viral structure assembly and replications 9 the overlapping open reading frames orfs of replicase complex orf1a and orf1b encode 16 non-structural proteins nsp of viral rna synthesis complex through proteolytic processing 10 the nsp12 is a viral rna-dependent rna polymerase together with co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 possessing high polymerase activity a recent study showed 944 similarity in the amino acid sequences of the seven conserved replicase domains in orf1ab of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 4 the spike s is a transmembrane glycoprotein that comprises two domains s1 and s2 which play a pivotal role in mediating viral infection through binding the host receptor 1112 the interaction between the s1 domain and its cognate receptor triggers a conformational change in the s protein which then promotes membrane fusion between the viral and cell membrane through the s2 domain 13 the three short insertions in the n-terminal domain as well as changes in four out of five of the key residues in the receptor-binding motif compared with the sequence of sars-cov are the key differences recently found by scientists in the s gene of sars-cov-2 4 the major host cell receptors utilized by all hcovs are aminopeptidase n by hcov-229e 14 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 by sars-cov 15 and hcov-nl63 1617 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 by mers-cov 18 and 9-o-acetylated sialic acid by hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 1920a recent study showed that covid-19 is able to utilize the same membrane-bound ace2 as an entry receptor in ace2-expressing cells with higher affinity than sars-cov and does not use other coronavirus receptors 421 ace2 is highly expressed in the mouth and tongue facilitating viral entry in the host and in lungs it is expressed in lower lungs on type i and ii alveolar epithelial cells after infection sars-cov-2 entry starts with the binding of the spike glycoprotein expressed on the viral envelope to ace2 on the alveolar surface the binding of sars-cov-2 to ace2 stimulates the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the whole sars-cov-2 and ace2 complex inducing fusion at the cell membrane 22 the membrane fusion and endosomal cell entry is facilitated by the low ph in the cellular environment and ph-dependent endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins 8 once inside the cells sars-cov-2 exploits the endogenous transcriptional machinery of alveolar cells to replicate itself and spreads through the entire lung 8 the nucleocapsid helps for packaging the viral genome through protein oligomerization as the infection progresses it deleteriously affects the normal activity of most of the ciliated cells in the alveoli that clear the airways with a consequent progressive accumulation of debris and fluids in the lungs and eventually leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in addition to the alveolar cells in the lungs ace2 expression has been reported in other organs including the kidney the heart and the gut 23 which supports the commonly reported co-morbidities of covid-19 such as acute kidney injury aki cardiac damage and abdominal painas the first cases of the covid-19 were linked to direct exposure to the huanan seafood wholesale market of wuhan china animal-to-human transmission was initially presumed 2425 however subsequent cases revealed the scope of human-to-human transmission through the individuals in the incubation stage or showing symptoms through the widespread information available and recent increase in understanding of the sars-cov-2 the virus appears to have an incubation time ranging from 2 to 14 days 26272829 a recent report suggested that the symptomatic patients had higher viral loads detected in the nose and throat following the onset of their symptoms 30 these viral loads peaked around 56 days following the symptoms onset 31 consequently the asymptomatic patients had a viral load similar to symptomatic patients 30 hence such human-to-human transmission through symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers caused the epidemic to gradually grow over weeks eventually becoming a global pandemic the human-to-human transmission is mainly through the inhalation of respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing and through contact of infected surfaces then mediating the infection through the mouth nose or eyes 32 transmission via the inhalation of exhaled respiratory droplets may occur as aerosol droplets that can survive for prolonged periods mediating long-range human-to-human transmission via air movement inhalation of virus-laden fine particles could transport the virus into deeper alveolar and tracheobronchial regions which could increase the chance of infective transmission and oxidant pollutants in air can impair the immune function and attenuate the efficiency of the lung to clear the virus in the lungs pro-inflammation injury and fibrosis from inhaled airborne particulate matters combined with an immune response or cytokine storm induced by sars-cov-2 infection could enhance the infection severity 32 since human-to-human transmission is the primary mode of transmission of the virus the international public health response toward mitigating covid-19 has largely been based on socialphysical distancing isolation of cases and quarantine measures 25further studies have also shown that infectious viruses including covs can survive for long periods outside of the host organism increasing the opportunity for transmission via touch 33 it has been reported that sars-cov-2 can last about three days on plastic and stainless steel surfaces about one day on cardboard surfaces and about four hours on copper surfaces 3435 despite these evidences this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads cdc apart from that covs were previously reported to remain infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks 36 which adds another potential transmission route if the quality of personal hygiene is poor however the mode of transmission for covid-19 through contaminated water does not have enough scientific evidence hence requires further studies to validate itamong the earlier studies covid-19 was reported to have a mean serial interval of 75 days which is defined as the delay between disease onset dates in successive cases in chains of transmission 37 using the data from the serial interval distribution the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 22 37 the identification of these characteristics is important as the study extensively inferred the doubling of covid-19 every seven days since each patient transmitted the infection to an additional 22 individuals similarly other modeling studies estimated the basic case reproduction rate ranging from 2 to 647 while who published their early estimation to be ranging from 14 to 25 38394041covid-19 may present with a range of symptoms in humans varying from mild cold-like symptoms to severe life-threatening respiratory tract infections the infection begins with the gradual onset of symptoms following an incubation period of 214 days after exposure 2627282942 on the basis of disease severity clinical manifestations can be categorized as mild 81 severe 14 and critical 5 as noted in the covid-19 positive patients 41 the initial infectious stage is characterized by mild constitutional symptoms and upper respiratory tract infection 41 the most frequently experienced symptoms include fever dry cough sore throat sputum production fatigue shortness of breath and headache 42 this is followed by other vague symptoms such as nasal congestion rhinorrhea sneezing malaise muscle pain drowsiness and myalgia 2941434445 with the number of cases increasing worldwide other symptoms have also been reported which are ever evolving and differ depending on the population studies however the question whether these symptoms are directly correlated with covid-19 manifestation remains elusive and requires further scientific and clinical evidencefollowing an antecedent of 59 days of primary viral manifestations these initially mild symptoms manifest as a progressively advanced disease accompanied by pneumonia and ards which is the most ominous feature of this infection 29414346 other secondary manifestations which could be present are rnaemia as a continuum of ards chronic dyspnea tachypnea hypoxia diarrhea abdominal pain metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction 41424748 moreover in critical cases the virus can also trigger severe complications such as sepsis and septic shock multiple organ dysfunction and acute cardiac and renal injury 29414243 these complications are also linked with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines 2949 and hematological changes including leukopenia 337 lymphopenia 832 and thrombocytopenia 362 49 critical cases with secondary infections may also present co-infections of bacteria and fungi 43in addition to these overt symptoms there has been a growing concern for asymptomatic cases 50 these immunocompetent viral carriers present asymptomatic infections not manifesting any symptoms which unanimously pose an imminent danger and may have grave outcomes recent studies have signified the emergence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections as a potential portal of viral transmission that needs vigilant control to detect and mitigate these community-acquired infections 37465152 individuals with viral tolerance present a potential challenge in the annihilation of this infection especially in rural america with inadequate health care infrastructure and high rates of chronic clinical issues 53 consistent with recent studies the majority of critically ill covid-19 patients are known to have some underlying chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease diabetes and chronic respiratory disease 29414245 these clinical conditions are also a significant health issue in the rural population therefore such patients are more vulnerable to developing severe covid-19 symptoms 545556575859as there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccine recommended specifically for sars-cov-2 infection for potential therapy of humans till date scientists are endeavoring to find drugs to treat this disease currently the treatment is symptomatic and oxygen therapy is considered as the major treatment intervention for patients with severe infection 41 pharmacological interventions that can prevent a mild state from progressing to the severe or critical state will significantly improve the overall prognosis of the disease in order to reduce disease worsening and the mortality rate developing an effective approach to modulate the immune system or suppress reactive cytokine production is of crucial importance studies are currently testing the efficacy of existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs in inhibiting sars-cov-2 replication the major drugs that exhibited promising inhibitory effects are remdesivir and chloroquine remdesivir is an adenosine analogue that cause premature termination of viral replication and has been recently recognized as a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of rna virus including sarsmers-cov5 infections in various experimental models 6061 reports show that remdesivir can inhibit covid-19 infection efficiently in a human cell line human liver cancer huh-7 cells which is sensitive to covid-19 39 recent studies have also reported that remdesivir yielded promising results in the treatment of a patient with covid-19 in the us 46 and further studies are currently under progress to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug chloroquine is an antimalarial drug known to exert a potent antiviral effect by virtue of its ability to increase the endosomal ph required for viruscell fusion and interfere with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of sars-cov 62 a study demonstrated that chloroquine could function at both entry and at post-entry stages of the covid-19 infection in vero e6 cells and has an immune-modulating activity which may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo 39 hydroxychloroquine is an antirheumatic drug with a similar chemical structure to chloroquine and exhibits a strong immunomodulatory capacity which prevents inflammation flare-ups and organ damage 63 it can also increase the intracellular ph interrupt toll-like receptor tlr signaling and subsequent attenuation of proinflammatory signaling activation and production of cytokines such as type i interferons interleukin-1 il-1 and tumor necrosis factor- tnf- 64 as severe covid-19 can be due to the overactivation of the immune system triggered by covid-19 infection hydroxychloroquine can be suggested to attenuate the progression of the disease from mild to severe ifn- is a broad-spectrum antiviral used to treat hepatitis and is reported to inhibit sars-cov reproduction in vitro 65 lopinavirritonavir a medication used to treat the human immunodeficiency virus hiv is also found to exhibit anti-sars-cov activity in vitro and in clinical studies 66 ribavirin a nucleoside analogue with a broad-spectrum of antiviral effects exhibited lower risk of ards and death when used in combination with lopinavirritonavir 65 favipiravir is a new type of rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor reported to possess anti-influenza virus activity and is capable of blocking the replication of flavi- alpha- filo- bunya- arena- noro- and other rna viruses 67 so clinical trials of favipiravir on covid-19 infection have now been initiated by the clinical medical research center of the national infectious diseases and the third peoples hospital of shenzhen other potential drugs include type ii transmembrane serine protease tmspss2 inhibitors and bcr-abl kinase inhibitor imatinib the ability of these drugs to block the entry and inhibit the fusion of virions with the endosomal membrane may provide anti-coronal activity 6869as discussed earlier in the light of recently published reports 2019-ncov can utilize ace2 as an entry receptor in ace2-expressing cells with higher affinity than sars-cov suggesting potential drug targets for therapeutic development 4 ace2 also plays an important role in the renin-angiotensin system ras and the imbalance between aceang iiat1r pathway and ace2ang 17mas receptor pathway in the ras will lead to multisystem inflammation and studies have shown that ras inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure 70 one of our previously published articles highlights the possible interactions between a cytochrome p450 cyp-derived arachidonic acid metabolite 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid 20-hete and ras 71 the findings showed that 20-hete-induced hypertension in cyp4a2-transduced rats is associated with ras upregulation and can be abrogated by ace inhibition or angiotensin type 1 receptor at1r blockade the study evaluates the effect of lisinopril losartan 20-hede 20-hete antagonist 20-hydroxyeicosa-6z 15z-dienoic acid and het0016 an inhibitor of 20-hete in modulating ras ace and various downstream signaling molecules involved in the pathway hence our findings will also provide some valuable lead for the ongoing and future investigations on therapeutic interventions against covid-19 as the pandemic continues to affect increasing an number of people scientists around the world are actively exploring the efficacy and safety of the drugs in the treatment of covid-19 and the findings need to be validated in further preclinical and clinical trialsnon-pharmaceutical public health measures are vital in curtailing disease spread 414572 to constrain local transmission and to reduce the impact of the covid-19 pandemic the who has recommended non-pharmacological interventions that are specifically geared to limit the spread of the infection from person to person and reduce the number of mortalities 41 strategies to mitigate the transmission entail personal and community-based actions 29 non-pharmacological interventions are perhaps some of the most effective ways to prevent widespread mortality of the disease by slowing the rate of infection to a manageable level that healthcare systems can withholdpersonal interventions include frequent hand washing after every 1520 min 29 use of hand sanitizers with 60 alcohol content wearing face masks encouraging people to cover their mouth and nose during coughing and sneezing keeping a distance from sick people avoiding contact with face and mouth with unwashed hands 4145 and self-quarantine when a person feels unwell 41 whereas community-based mitigation strategies include social distancing avoiding crowded areas and restriction on public gathering and non-essential traveling 2941in addition to these measures studies have shown the supportive effects of herbal or nutritional interventions including immune-boosting nutrients and herbs that can help overcome upper respiratory tract viral infections 73 complementary therapies that can boost the immune response at the initial stage of covid-19 infection might be a prudent approach to overcome the symptoms associated with this infection 74 there has also been evidence that traditional or herbal medicine has helped improve the condition of patients with covid-19 or those who presented with symptoms a study in the chinese population following traditional chinese medicine found that patients who were treated with qingfei paidu decoction qpd a herbal chinese traditional medicine a combination of 4 different herbal formulas consisting of 21 herbs in total were found to have an effective cure rate of over 90 against 701 confirmed cases of covid-19 7576 in light of this evidence the chinese government promoted this herbal treatment to be used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients who have or are suspected to have covid-19 qpd was also recommended by the korean governments guidelines for severe cases of covid-19 76 combined remedies of both herbal medicine and western medicine were also found to be more effective than using western medicine alone in treating patients with covid-19 77furthermore in response to the current pandemic who recently supported the use of scientifically proven traditional medicines the recognition by who toward traditional herbal and complementary medicine included the use of the medicinal plant artemisia annua against coronavirus which is being used by african countries the use of artemisia annua was also boosted by madagascar in the form of an herbal drink widely known as covid-organics although there is ample evidence present for the positive effects of this medicinal plant 78798081 who advised testing the efficacy and adverse side effects of this plant through rigorous clinical trials before prescribing it to covid-19 affected patients therefore non-pharmacological interventions suggested by who and used by other countries possess potential defense against the spread of this infection even when drugs and vaccines will be available these measures can provide protection to the individuals exposed to the virus by limiting the symptomatic complications arising from covid-19 eventually reducing the overall mortality rate future studies are recommended to provide valid and reliable containment measures to control the local transmission of this infectionthe worldwide escalation and clinical manifestation of covid-19 despite constant efforts from the healthcare workers and respective governments to minimize its impact may still be underdiagnosed studies have demonstrated that the risk of mortality from covid-19 is significantly higher in the aging population including patients with pre-existing comorbidities reflecting on earlier data 80 of the mortality related to covid-19 was noted among adults aged 60 years 82 these observations raise serious public health concerns considering that 193 of the us population resides in rural areas with the average age of rural americans being 733 years 83 us consensus there is also a high rate of obesity in rural populations 54 this is important as there are indications that a possible reason for a higher mortality rate for covid-19 in italy compared to china could be the fact that there is a higher percentage of obesity in older adults in italy noting a similar pattern that occurred with the h1n1 pandemic 84 besides this rural areas tend to have a higher percentage of smoking within the population 85 covid-19 being a respiratory illness individuals with a smoking history have higher chances of being affected by the virus and having a severe case that requires ventilation is compounded while several strategies have been adopted to prevent the spread in urban populations preventing the transmission dynamics and the spread of covid-19 in rural regions have received limited attention although rural regions have limited human mobility and relatively lower population densities than urban settings 86 the extent of morbidity and mortality might be significantly higher in the viral-inflicted rural population making the containment and mitigation of viral transmission unmanageableapart from the potential significant impact of covid-19 on the aging population in rural america the rural healthcare delivery system remains relatively under-resourced rural areas across the world have been greatly impacted by pandemics in the past and it is clear with covid-19 that there are on-going issues related to the infrastructure in these communities that have not been addressed previous pandemics such as the h1n1 influenza a caused high mortality rates in rural turkey and these deaths were directly linked to lack of advanced intensive care unit icu facilities with preliminary ventilator support 87 this could easily contribute to the existing problem among other issues such as late diagnosis and late antiviral therapy the limited availability of icu facilities is still an issue in rural areas particularly in the united states although there has been a trend of an increasing number of icu beds being added to hospitals these icu beds have been found to be concentrated in large urban hospitals while small-to-medium hospitals had decreased icu capacity 88 as noted previously severe cases of covid-19 can require ventilation which is primarily available in icus with rural populations having less access to these resources the mortality rate can rise besides a lack of icu availability the healthcare in rural america has noted a significant disparity in terms of the distribution of professional resources such as lack of healthcare workers major healthcare institutions and overwhelming financial burden as compared to urban settings 89 limited physicians healthcare training opportunities delayed care disparities in patient demographics older population and substandard quality of healthcare are already reflected in overall health outcomes as the mortality is higher in rural populations 90 these observations suggest lack of pandemic preparedness in rural america hence the global spread of covid-19 may significantly impact rural communities to a greater extentthe effectiveness of covid-19 pandemic mitigation primarily requires a high level of participation from each individual such as having adequate knowledge of the viral transmission engaging in appropriate self-care following self-hygiene guidelines and social distancing which are fundamental in avoiding preventable hospitalizations 29 however due to lower socioeconomic resources in a rural setting there is limited literacy specially health literacy among the rural population which may exacerbate the impact of covid-19 in rural areas 91 the cumulative line of evidence have demonstrated that poor adult literacy is strongly correlated with reduced health knowledge and self-management skills reduced physical and mental health higher rates of hospitalizations and increased morbidity and mortality 929394 hence the consequences of covid-19 pandemic for the rural population will depend partly on the health risk communication and viral awareness pandemic communication gaps may increase vulnerability among rural populations which may trigger disease misconceptions uninformed policies insufficient planning and fostering non-resilience predisposing the population to communicable viral risks 95one way to potentially fix this gap could be by using and ensuring that the local news media ie local news channels local newspapers have accurate current and practical advice for their viewers rural areas rely heavily on media specifically local media for their information yet a study on a rural area in california found that in general many local news sources did not include important information about health issues that were affecting the area 96 while dealing with covid-19 it is imperative we use these key news sources to reach areas that traditional media will not if accurate data and advice can be presented in these sources it can be an indispensable asset in preventing the reach of inaccurate misconceptions and increase participation in community-based mitigation strategiesthe viral outbreak of covid-19 declared as a global pandemic continues to overwhelm the healthcare system with increasing number of patients presenting with clinical symptoms of this coronavirus this increasing rate of incidence of this contagion presents with its own challenges burdening healthcare institutions global economy impacting the physical and mental health of people worldwide although several strategies have been adopted to mitigate the effects of this viral outbreak the rural population has been largely ignored despite the high risks of morbidity and mortality among this population this review aims to provide a clinical insight into the outbreak of covid-19 outlining the pathogenesis transmission dynamics and clinical characteristics of the patients tested positive for this virus figure 1 although the development of a sars-cov-2-specific vaccines is still under clinical trials this review discusses pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that are widely being used by healthcare professionals to manage the symptoms and combat the impact of the virus on patients finally this review provides an outline of the challenges and implications of covid-19 in a rural population given that a large percentage of the population in a rural setting are frail subjects with pre-existing comorbidities individuals with obesity and individuals having a smoking history who are at higher risk of mortality considering the age stratification pre-existing co-morbidities such as obesity smoking status along with limited healthcare access resources and health literacy the rural population might be at a significant risk because of the dynamic nature of the pandemic a conceptual framework is required for current and post-pandemic stages of covid-19 inclusive of strategies to mitigate the risks of this contagion in the rural populationsince the first reported case of coronavirus disease covid-19 in china on december 31 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has infected 5592890 people and killed 353334 people worldwide as of may 28 2020 according to the world health organization who 1 in the last 3  4 months there has been an overflow of scientific and non-scientific information on sars-cov-2 and covid-19 the relationship between age and covid-19-associated morbidity or mortality has also been addressed among health professionals and the general population the surge of infected patients beyond the limits of medical systems has raised social concerns on whether age should be considered in determining treatment intensity 2 the perception that young peoples morbid condition is relatively less severe also lowered their awareness of preventing infection in some regionsone of the most critical issues dealt by clinical and public health professionals during the pandemic is the spectrum of illness severity this affects the triage diagnostic and therapeutic decision making and prognostic expectations therefore understanding covid-19-associated morbidity and mortality according to age is important however the data published in each country are inconsistent because of multiple reasons such as different populations extent of available laboratory tests and medical systems hence we reviewed covid-19 epidemiology data published from several countries to identify any consistent trends in the relationship between age and covid-19-associated morbidity or mortality we also reviewed the literature for studies explaining the difference in the host response to sars-cov-2 infection according to agecovid-19 fatality rates vary significantly depending on the country it was 006 in qatar and 1625 in belgium as of may 26 2020 3 this variation in fatality rates may be due to differences in healthcare adequacy andor epidemiological characteristics of patients the frequency of diagnostic screening in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients may also influence the rate 4 however there is a consistent and clear pattern of an age-based exponential increase in fatality rate regardless of the geographic region according to the korea centers for disease control and prevention the overall case fatality rate cfr was 237 in 11344 patients with confirmed cases on may 28 2020 but it was much higher in the elderly 109 in patients aged 70  79 years and 266 in patients 80 years 5 in another analysis of 44672 cases in china diagnosed as of february 11 2020 the overall cfr was 23 however the cfr was 80 in patients aged 70  79 years and 148 in patients aged 80 years 6 in the report released by the higher institute of health of italy the overall cfr on march 26 2020 was 92 which was four times higher than that in korea or china however the pattern of increasing fatality with age was similar to that in korea and china the cfr was 1 in the age group of 50 years and rapidly increased in the age group of 60 years reaching 169 and 244 in the age group of 70  79 years and 80 years respectively fig 1a 7 in terms of death per 100000 individuals in the population as of may 11 2020 data from the new york city department of health and mental hygiene and as of may 8 2020 data from the office for national statistics of united kingdom clear patterns of age-based exponential increase in fatality has been observed fig 1b 89influenza the most commonly reported pandemic disease in human history had a w-shaped mortality distribution during the pandemic fig 1c 1011 this atypical pattern of mortality with an elevated relative or absolute risk of death in middle-age groups is usually explained by differences in age-related susceptibility to infection affected by pre-existing age-related immunity 11 as sars-cov-2 is a novel virus introduced to human this type of mortality distribution is unlikely to be expected however the age-related pattern of covid-19 fatality differs from that of other respiratory viral infections wherein the severity pattern is often described as a u-shaped curve with morbidity and mortality concentrated at extreme age groups younger children and the elderly population-based studies of seasonal influenza have typically shown this type of mortality distribution according to age fig 1c 12 several cohort studies have shown that the hospitalization rate of influenza was highest for the age group of 0  4 years compared to that in other age groups which indicates that children under the age of 5 years could be more vulnerable to influenza andor more severely affected 1314 as the hospitalization fatality rate was relatively low for the age group of 0  4 years 1314 the mortality curve based on 100000 individuals showed a much smaller peak in this age group than in the elderly age group however this type of mortality peak has not been observed thus far in children affected with covid-19 which suggests that children could be less susceptible to the infection or experience less severe symptoms and have a low cfrthe dynamics of age-specific mortality for covid-19 is relatively familiar because they mirror other major causes of mortality especially chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease fig 1d 15 promislow et al have shown that the mortality rate doubling time mrdt of all-cause mortality 9 years in the united states was approximately the same as that of covid-19 reported in the new york city 16 in other words the increasing case fatality or mortality rate with age is not a specific finding for covid-19 however many scientists and media have paid considerable attention to age as a risk factor for mortality in covid-19 this might be due to the surge of infected patients within a short period hence the death pattern  high mortality in older people  became more apparentinvestigating the susceptibility to infection unlike mortality or case fatality in the general population is more complicated because mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients may not have been tested and there is an uneven chance of being exposed to the source of infection depending on the groups closure of child care facilities preschools and schools vs non-closure of long-term care facilities the case rate of covid-19 by age has been reported to have wide regional variability according to new york city data as of may 11 2020 the cfr of covid-19 in the general population cases per 100000 seemed to increase with age fig 2a 8 contrarily in korea as of may 10 2020 where diagnostic tests were performed intensely in groups associated with certain religious gatherings regardless of any symptoms the cfr seemed to be highest in the 20  29-years age group fig 2b 5 natale et al have compared the relative illness ratio rir by age between different countries fig 3 17 in their study as of mar 30 2020 the rir in spain and italy increased with age while in china and korea 18 middle or younger age groups seemed to have a higher rir this could be explained by more extensive testing performed in china and korea than in other countries which would help to better measure the morbidity among young age groups in italy and new york city where there was a surge in the number of covid-19 patients in a short period it is likely that the viral test was performed first in individuals with more apparent or severe symptoms while asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients were not tested overall these findings suggest that susceptibility to symptomatic infection seems to increase with age but susceptibility to infection is probably similar among different age groupsamong covid-19 patients elderly patients have a higher mortality rate due to high cfr and symptomatic infection rate approximately 80 and 90 of deaths have occurred in patients aged 70 years and 60 years in korea and italy respectively 57 a similar pattern was observed in other countries affected by covid-19 several studies have reported old age to be a significant risk factor for covid-19 mortality 1920 age also affects the time from hospitalization to death and viral clearance 2122 in an animal study sars-cov-2 caused more severe interstitial pneumonia and viral replication in lung tissues of old monkeys than in those of young monkeys 23in immunopathology vulnerability to an infection in the elderly is usually explained by immunosenescence 24 immunosenescence is quite complicated briefly in old age the production of nave t and b cells decreases and the function of innate immune cells is impaired hence cells involved in the innate immunity do not get activated efficiently during an infection and progression to an adaptive immune response does not occur in a coordinated manner 24 these changes reduce the effectiveness of viral clearance and increase the likelihood of triggering a dysregulated immune response in which cytokines are released extensively by activated immune cells resulting in a cytokine storm 25 another well-recognized feature of aging immunity is chronic subclinical systemic inflammation also known as inflammaging inflammation is a key pathogenic mechanism in covid-19 hence inflammaging has been estimated to contribute to the poorer outcome in elderly patients with covid-19 26some scientists have claimed that the biologically plausible pathomechanism explaining the difference in vulnerability to sars-cov-2 infection involves the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement ade 27282930 ade is a well-known cascade of events by which viruses may infect susceptible cells through interactions between virions complexed with antibodies and fc receptors where they are more extensively endocytosed and eventually replicated more efficiently 31 the antibodies that bind to virions could be neutralizing or non-neutralizing antibodies which were previously formed in response to sars-cov-2 or other coronaviruses with similar antigenicity to that of sars-cov-2 the fact that the seroprevalence of community-acquired coronaviruses among adults was very high 90  100 32 but not in pediatrics was presented as an evidence 33in addition to the aging immunity or ade there are several other factors related to aging that could be reasons for higher mortality and morbidity in the elderly the average number of comorbid conditions steadily increased with age according to liu et al elderly covid-19 patients had a significantly higher performance score than young and middle-aged patients 34 in addition older adults living in long-term care facilities are at the highest risk because of their chronic illness and the impact of congregate housing 35based on published data sars-cov-2 infection seems to affect children less frequently and less severely than adults according to the data published from different regions the proportion of children among covid-19 patients was quite low 21  24 in china 13 in italy 28 in australia and 70 in korea 5673637 in the largest pediatric study to date that analyzed 2143 children infected with sars-cov-2 58 children showed severe and critical illness 38 contrary to the pediatric study 185 patients were severe and critical among all age groups in an analysis of 44672 chinese cases with covid-19 6 among children dong et al found that infants were relatively more vulnerable to sars-cov-2 infection and the proportion of severe and critical cases was 107 38 however because the study also included suspected cases not laboratory confirmed cases 659 of study population the possibility of pathogens other than sars-cov-2 responsible for such clinical observations remains controversial in other studies even though very small number of cases was reported a severe outcome in infants was not observed 394041 although these findings were not similar to the generally accepted fact that children aged 5 years were more vulnerable to respiratory viral infections there was a common aspect with the previous finding observed in sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov epidemics which also had a children-sparing pattern 424344 stockman et al reported that the clinical outcome of sars was more favorable in children aged 12 years of age than in other age groups 43 no deaths were reported in children with sars-cov infection 44 in the mers-cov epidemic only two pediatric deaths were reported both of which had serious comorbidities infantile nephrotic syndrome and cystic fibrosis 454647thus far there is no clear explanation for the children-sparing pattern of sars-cov-2 infection the following hypotheses have been reported in the literature 1 the possibility that children are less frequently exposed to infection sources due to closure of child care facilities preschools and schools 2 children are less susceptible to the infection itself and 3 children are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms hence the number of cases is underestimated 484950 more evidence and studies are needed to prove the hypotheses however recently bi et al reported the result of tracing 1286 close contacts in china children were as likely to be infected as adults infection rate in children aged 10 years 74 vs population average 66 but less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms 51a milder symptom or low cfr in children with sars-cov-2 infection could be explained by the interaction between host immunological response and viral pathogen mechanism 4850 as the differences in the distribution maturation and function of viral receptors in the host are frequently reported as a possible reason for the age-related difference in infection angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 a receptor for sars-cov hcov-nl63 and sars-cov-2 has attracted increasing attention ace2 plays a key role is in catalyzing the hydrolysis of angiotensin ii into angiotensin 17 which has an antihypertensive and profibrotic effect 5253 following viral entry ace2 expression is downregulated 54 downregulation of ace2 expression leads to compensatory overproduction of angiotensin ii by ace angiotensin ii in turn stimulates its type 1a receptor which increases the lung vascular permeability and potentiates lung pathology 555657 in a study conducted by xie et al ace2 expression was observed to dramatically decrease with aging in a rat model 58 low levels of ace2 have been detected in patients with underlying chronic conditions which generally do not affect the pediatric population 5359 these findings suggest that increased levels of ace2 receptors in lung pneumocytes in children may have a protective effect from severe clinical manifestations of sars-cov-2 infection 485060more active and rapid innate immune response to an antigen and an elevated number of b lymphocytes t lymphocytes and natural killer cells are also suggested as an immunological mechanism for children to resist an infection 616263 however these general immunological characteristics of children are insufficient to explain the children-sparing pattern of sars-cov-2 which is a distinctive feature from other respiratory viral infectionsas it is known that many children are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms there are increasing concerns on childrens role in transmitting disease however the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain the majority of the children infected with sars-cov-2 reported thus far have a documented household contact often showing symptoms before infected children suggesting the possibility that children are not an important reservoir for sars-cov-2another emerging children-related issue is a multisystem inflammatory syndrome mentioned in a scientific brief report published by the who on may 15 2020 64 the report describes clusters of children and adolescents requiring admission to intensive care units these children have a multisystem inflammatory condition with some features similar to those of kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome in europe and north america 656667 this syndrome has not been reported in other regions thus far but the full spectrum of the disease is still unclear hence special attention should be warranted to all children with covid-19 68the cfr and susceptibility to symptomatic covid-19 is higher in the elderly as there is no definitive therapeutic drug or a vaccine prevention is the only and the most important strategy for older adults the added strain of social distancing on this vulnerable population should be acknowledged and managed furthermore studies on immunopathology for determining the severity of sars-cov-2 infection are warranted to develop more effective therapeutic and preventive strategiesthis is the third time in less than two decades that the world authorities are facing an epidemic with high transmissibility caused by subtypes of a coronavirus munster et al 2020 gorbalenya 2020 the first epidemic occurred during 20022003 in guangdong province china the disease was termed severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and was caused by a newly identified coronavirus that was named sars coronavirus sars-cov lin et al 2006 sars-cov infected 8000 individuals from several countries and resulted in 774 deaths the second epidemic occurred in 2012 in the middle east this disease was termed middle east respiratory syndrome and was caused by a new virus called mers coronavirus mers-cov mers-cov infected 2494 individuals and resulted in around 860 deaths munster et al 2020 at the end of 2019 a third epidemic occurred this was caused by another new type of coronavirus designated by the world health organization as sars-cov-2 the resultant disease was named coronavirus disease covid-19 the disease is now a worldwide pandemic gorbalenya 2020the recently emerged sars-cov-2 was first identified in the city of wuhan hubei province china the virus infects humans and a variety of animals mainly pigs and bats velavan and meyer 2020 infection results in a spectrum of clinical manifestations which are mainly respiratory ranging in severity from benign to lethal and it is sometimes asymptomatic velavan and meyer 2020 fehr and perlman 2015in an attempt to understand these epidemics studies have examined factors that could influence the spread of coronaviruses chan et al 2011 in general three factors affect the epidemiology of communicable diseases the agent of transmission the host and the environment lin et al 2006historically the occurrences of sars were partly associated with environmental factors lin et al 2006 an ecological study conducted in china found that air pollution was associated with lethality in individuals affected by sars this was attributed to the fact that short- or long-term exposure to certain pollutants can compromise lung function cui et al 2003 another environmental factor was air temperature lin et al 2006 identified for the first time that the incidence of sars was 18 times higher at lower air temperatures than at higher temperatures the authors reported that respiratory system diseases are more common in colder environments and that the virulence of agents deteriorates at higher climatic temperatures as they may not be able to withstand the environmental changes in addition they pointed out that the transmissibility of sars-cov in terms of climatic fluctuations is similar to that of the influenza virus furthermore the incidence of influenza increases significantly with low temperatures and high relative humidity park 2020 indicating that climatic factors can significantly affect viral transmissionin the case of sars-cov-2 meteorological factors seem to influence the spread of the virus oliveiros et al 2020 bao et al 2016 oliveiros et al 2020 identified that the speed of transmission was positively correlated with temperature and correlated with humidity thus it is expected that if the temperature rises to 20 c transmission rates increase by an average of 18 days regarding temperature and mortality rate a study conducted in four chinese cities found that colder temperatures had a greater effect on mortality bao et al 2016 this is in contrast to the results of the study by li et al 2019 which showed that both cold and heat can adversely impact the mortality resulting from respiratory syndromeson the basis of the assumption that different climatic conditions play a significant role in the course of covid-19 it is essential to identify associations between environmental factors such as average maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation and demographic density and sars-cov-2 transmission and covid-19 mortality in humansdata for the period from december 1 2019 to march 30 2020 were collected for meteorological variables weather station data were extracted from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa database daily data from meteorological stations were segregated by country and the following variables were recorded precipitation average temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature noaa 2020 daily averages of each meteorological variable for the different countries were calculated finally data on daily infection and death rates were extracted from world health organization reports who 2020the demographic density of each country was used as a control variable with data obtained from the food and agriculture organization and world bank population estimates for the year 2018 world bank 2020 the countrys time of exposure to the epidemic was calculated from the temporal distance in days between the first case registered in the territory and the time of study a summary of the variables is provided in table 1
to analyze the association between the number of cases of and deaths from covid-19 and climatic aspects we used eq 1 as estimated by a panel data strategy wooldridge 20021yituixitdtit
where y
it is the dependent variable total number of cases of sars-cov-2 infections or total number of deaths from covid-19 for 249 countries i over the period t from december 1 2019 to march 30 2020  is a constant u
i is the control for specific characteristics of the countries that are fixed over the analyzed period and x
it is a vector that includes all explanatory variables of the model including the variable of interest that is the mean temperaturein addition we included other controls that may be related to the disease such as average rainfall and the countrys time of exposure to the epidemic we included as binary variables d
t which captures specific effects associated with the months of january and february and 
it which is the error term of this equation that includes all factors that are associated with y
it and are not included in the equationthe advantage of this strategy in relation to a traditional ordinary least squares estimate is that we can control for some country-specific factors that are fixed in time and associated with the number of deaths associated with sars-cov-2 infectiontwo specific outcomes measures were considered for the first we analyzed the influence of climatic variables on sars-cov-2 infections and for the second we analyzed the influence of climatic variables on covid-19 mortalitythree estimates were tested for each outcome and are shown in fig 1
 the first included only the average temperature the second included the average temperature minimum temperature maximum temperature precipitation and the countrys time of exposure to the epidemic and the third included the average temperature minimum temperature maximum temperature precipitation the countrys time of exposure to the epidemic population density and a variable to capture the specific month effects complete specification
table 2
shows the results of correlation analysis between the number of confirmed covid-19 cases and the average temperature by country in the first estimated model there is a negative correlation between the two variables the significance of this relationship remains even after the inclusion of additional variables such as maximum and minimum temperatures averages and time of exposure to the disease even with the complete specification that includes two binary variables capturing specific effects for the months of the year and controlling for population density the results suggest that an increase in temperature is associated with a decrease in the number of infectionsthe coefficients shown in table 2 cannot measure causality there are several other factors that can affect the variable of interest on which we do not have information such as the number of beds and the patients respective levels of social isolation however an association was observed between the climate and the number of covid-19 cases these models appear to be quite robust particularly after the incorporation of controls such as additional climate variables and also month fixed effects
table 3
shows the results of correlation analysis between covid-19 mortality and climatic variables for this outcome measure there were no significant associations between the coefficients and mortality or average temperature it is possible that factors other than climate are related to mortality in the first estimate we evaluated only the relationship between covid-19 mortality rates and the average temperature by country which was significant in the second estimate we included the average minimum and maximum temperatures as well as the countrys time of exposure to the disease and did not identify any significant association in the last estimate in addition to the controls already included in the previous specification we also incorporated binary variables to capture any effects that were specific to this period however no significant correlation was identified between covid-19 mortality rates and temperatureseveral factors can influence sar-cov-2 transmission including environmental variables population density and medical care wang et al 2020 this study aimed to identify the associations between environmental variables and sars-cov-2 transmissioncovid-19 mortality a negative correlation was identified between temperature and the number infectionsalthough it is known that the influence of temperature on human health can vary between countries and even regions hajat and kosatky 2010 the findings of this study are in agreement with the current literature in that temperature influences the transmission of viruses that cause respiratory syndromes such as the influenza virus park 2020 and sars-cov-2 ma et al 2020 by investigating the relationship between temperature and respiratory diseases studies have indicated that sars-cov and the influenza virus survive only under certain climatic conditions and that their transmissibility is sensitive to rising temperatures jaakkola et al 2014 chan et al 2011 similar to the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 wang et al 2020the influenza virus is more transmissible at lower temperatures lowen and steel 2014 because cold weather results in the weakening of host immunity increasing susceptibility to infection kudo et al 2019 considering that the transmissibility of coronaviruses is similar to that of the influenza virus lin et al 2006 it can be assumed that these mechanisms also apply to the transmission of sars-cov-2 wang et al 2020in the model in which we considered only the average temperature the observed correlation indicated that for every one degree fahrenheit increase in temperature there was a reduction in the number of infections by 144 casesday under the composite model estimate 3 of outcome measure 1 the association was stronger in that there was a decrease in the number of infections by 640 casesday for each degree increase in temperaturethe second finding of this study was the significant association between mortality and average temperature which was not maintained when other variables were added indicating that non-climatic variables may be related to covid-19 mortality this finding differs from the findings of ma et al 2020 who stated that temperature and covid-19 mortality are negatively associated one possible reason for the conflicting results is the limited geographical scope of the study by ma et al which focused only on china and its climate our study included data from a range of countries and climatic regionsenvironmental factors that influence the relationship between temperature and mortality such as latitude bao et al 2016 humidity jaakkola et al 2014 kudo et al 2019 air pollution cai et al 2007 and sociodemographic factors such as age sex and income bao et al 2016 have been reported chan et al 2011 reported that people who live at low latitudes have a relatively weak adaptive capacity to cold and a strong adaptive capacity to heat and the reverse has also been shown high humidity which is associated with low temperatures is an important factor in the transmissibility of the influenza virus either by conserving virulence or weakening the host by cooling the body or drying the respiratory tract jaakkola et al 2014a study reported that temperature and humidity are associated with a higher risk of covid-19 wang et al 2020 therefore although humidity was not considered in our research because of the lack of information on this variable from some meteorological stations precipitation seems to be an important factor that must be considered we found that there was a positive correlation between precipitation and sars-cov-2 transmission showing that for each 1-in increase in precipitationday there was an increase of 5601 casesdayanother result concerns the countrys time of exposure to sars-cov-2 as expected this variable also showed a positive correlation showing that for each additional day of exposure there was an average increase of 1573 casesday this finding is consistent with the behavioral evidence on sars-cov-2 transmission that is after community infection transmission follows the same geometric progression correia et al 2020it is important to mention that our study only interpreted the significance of the coefficients and not their magnitude because of the probable existence of endogeneity in the estimated relationships considering that a series of regressors are associated with temperature and disease mortality at the same timethis is the first global study covering all countries affected by covid-19 we examined the associations between climatic variables and sars-cov-2 transmission and covid-19 mortality the findings showed a negative correlation between a countrys average temperature and the number of covid-19 cases the absence of a correlation between mortality and the average temperature and a positive correlation between the countrys time of exposure to the virus and the number of cases in addition this study reported that precipitation as an important factor in the transmissibility of the virusthis research provides important information that can inform the decisions of local and global health authorities as climatic variations are associated with the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 new policies to reinforce health systems or social isolation methods can be adopted depending on temperature and precipitation patternsas a limitation we highlight the absence of humidity data in view of its important role in the virulence of respiratory syndromes however because of the current data restrictions this factor could not be considered and it should be included in future studies we also suggest that future studies focus on micro-regions to capture temperature patterns and include variables related to solar radiation

the authors declare that they have no conflict of interestthis is an observational cohort study of all patients with covid-19 admitted to six covid-designated icus at three emory healthcare acute-care hospitals in atlanta georgia from march 6 2020 to april 17 2020 covid-19 status was based upon a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction assay performed either by the georgia department of public health a referral laboratory or the hospital-based clinical laboratory during the study period icu capacity enabled the timely admission of all patients

the median time from icu admission to death was 9 days iqr 514 dour early experience with this large cohort of critically ill patients with covid-19 demonstrates a mortality rate of 309 overall which is substantially lower than the 5097 reported in the published literature to date 16 additionally the 357 mortality for the approximately three-quarters of patients in our cohort who required mechanical ventilation is also markedly lower than previous reports these data indicate that a majority of critically ill patients with covid-19 can have good clinical outcomes and support the ongoing use of mechanical ventilation for patients with acute respiratory failurein some of the earliest reports of covid-19 from wuhan mortality rates among those admitted to icus ranged from 52 to 62 and increased to 8697 among those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation 5 6 15 16 in more recent data from the united kingdom 67 of those who had received mechanical ventilation died as compared with 22 of patients intubated with viral pneumonia in the preceding 3 years 3 early reports of smaller cohorts from seattle where some of the first covid-19 outbreaks occurred in the united states indicated that 5067 of patients admitted to the icu and 7175 of those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation died 1 2 a recently published report from new york found 245 mortality among those who required mechanical ventilation but with 722 of patients still admitted to the hospital 4taken together these reports have raised concerns that survival among those receiving mechanical ventilation is exceedingly poor 1114 in contrast to the majority of prior reports our data provide evidence that mortality rates in covid-19 can be comparable to those seen with ards and other infectious pneumonias 710in our cohort mortality was associated with older age with 425 mortality in those age 65 and above as compared with 113 in those under age 55 mortality was also associated with severity of illness on arrival to the icu and need for icu interventions including mechanical ventilation vasopressor support renal replacement therapy and inhaled vasodilators approximately half of our cohort received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and nearly one-quarter received at least one dose of a study drug as part of the actt trial remdesivir vs placebo but there was no difference in survival for either of those groups finally although eight patients 37 are still admitted to the icu at the time of this report 131 604 have been discharged from the hospitalseveral local and regional considerations may have influenced the observed outcomes first the arrival and peak of the covid-19 pandemic in georgia were later than in many of the regions from earlier reports this delay provided time to establish organizational structures acquire equipment prepare personnel create consensus-driven clinical protocols and align resources across a large healthcare system in addition while patient volumes did merit the redesignation of several specialty icus as covid-icus all critically ill patients with covid-19 were admitted to preexisting icus and cared for by critical care teams with experience managing acute respiratory failure and at standard patient-to-provider ratios further while an analysis of the impact of clinical interventions on survival is beyond the scope of this brief report our internal guidelines emphasized early intubation and standard lung-protective ventilation strategies future studies are needed to better understand the impact of individual patient risk factors clinical interventions and treatments and health system factors that can improve mortality in the face of this global pandemicin a cohort of critically ill adults with covid-19 we report an early mortality rate of 309 overall and 357 for patients who received mechanical ventilation although there may be a several factors underlying these findings these results suggest that most patients with acute respiratory failure from covid-19 may recover even with severe disease requiring intubation and mechanical ventilationwe would like to extend our most profound thanks and gratitude

china1 over the next 3 months the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 illness commonly called covid-19 has affected more than four million people globally with over 14 million cases in the usa itself making it the new epicentre of the illness followed by much of western europe the mortality rates from different parts of the world show vast differences but studies have consistently shown that the presence of comorbidities specially type 2 diabetes mellitus significantly increases mortality in patients with sars-cov-2 with an or of 28525 a study from china also showed that patients in the intensive care unit with sars-cov-2 infection were more likely to have underlying diabetes 222 vs 59 than others6 certain forms of hypophysitis thyroiditis and adrenalitis have viral aetiologies changes in endocrine functions observed during the previous coronavirus outbreak with sars-cov led to considerable morbidity and were important predictors of mortality therefore it is imperative to know the endocrinopathic impact of sars-cov-2 illness the purpose of this review is to highlight the available data on endocrine changes in such patients and to recapitulate the existing knowledge from previous coronavirus outbreaks for better risk stratification and management of patients with sars-cov-2 infectionall articles reporting endocrine changes in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov patients were considered electronic database of pubmed was searched using medical subject headings mesh terms related to sars-cov-2 sars-cov and different hormones since the sars-cov outbreak occurred in 2002 search results were limited to january 2002 onwards to consider articles pertaining to the outbreaks of both the viruses a considerable number of articles were in the chinese language and were included after being translated into english this was supplemented by handsearching reference lists for additional studies and case reports similarly google scholar database was handsearched studies listing type 2 diabetes mellitus as a risk factor of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov were excluded since they did not mention any biochemical changes articles about corticosteroid induced hyperglycaemia audio interviews and articles detailing the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system raas inhibitors were excluded an initial search showed 1585 articles finally 17 of them were included figure 1a detailed histopathological study on the effects of sars infection on the thyroid gland was done during the sars-cov outbreak7 there was extensive injury of the parafollicular cells and follicular epithelium with the destruction and exfoliation of epithelial cells into the follicle leading to its disruption these changes were responsible for lower levels of thyroid hormones noted in clinical studies parafollicular cells are responsible for calcitonin production and they could not be identified on he sections in the tissue sample from patients with sars damage to interfollicular tissue including parafollicular cells may adversely affect calcitonin production an interesting finding was the absence of inflammatory infiltrate and features of cellular necrosis supporting the hypothesis of extensive apoptosis responsible for thyroid injurythe pathology data of the thyroid gland in patients with sars-cov-2 infection have been published by yao et al they conducted minimally invasive autopsies from different organs in patients who had died of sars-cov-2 and investigated the pathological changes8 they reported no abnormalities in the thyroid follicular morphology but did note lymphocytic infiltration in the interstitium none of the tissue immunohistochemistry and pcr analyses detected sars-cov-2 in the thyroid gland these findings are at variance with those reported in sars-cov though the patient characteristics in the two studies were nearly the same however irrespective of pathological findings most of the studies found a similar pattern of biochemical changeslimited data suggest that the thyroid gland and the hypothalamopituitarythyroid hpt axis are directly affected in sars-cov-2 illness a study of 274 patients with sars-cov-2 showed that thyroid stimulating hormone tsh and free triiodothyronine t3 concentrations were significantly lower in deceased patients 07 miuml and 28 pmoll than in recovered patients 14 miuml and 43 pmoll the difference in the thyroxine t4 levels was not statistically significant9
a study by wang et al reported that serum levels of t3 and t4 in patients with sars-cov were significantly lower than those in the control group and low t3 levels correlated with disease severity serum t3 and t4 levels were decreased respectively in 94 and 46 of 48 patients with sars-cov during the acute phase and 90 and 38 during the convalescent phase of the disease10 the authors also noted lower levels of tsh in these patients dysfunction of the hpt axis caused a diminished level of serum tsh in patients with sars-cov despite low serum t3 and t4 no significant difference in serum parathyroid hormone level was observed between patients with sars-cov and the control group during the acute or convalescent phases of the illnesschanges in thyroid hormone levels may persist after clinical recovery leow et al studied sars-cov survivors for hormonal derangements 3 months after recovery and noted that 67 of the patients had developed biochemical hypothyroidism11 the majority of these patients 75 had a central aetiology and only 25 developed primary hypothyroidism with positive antibodies and continued to receive thyroid hormone replacement at the end of the study on follow-up changes in the thyroid profile of the patients with central hypothyroidism had normalised central hypocortisolism was also present in 66 of patients who had central hypothyroidism the authors suggested a dysfunctional hpt axis as evidenced by the results of thyroid hormones and the coexistence of central hypocortisolismthese studies suggest for the monitoring of thyroid function tests during acute illness as well as during convalescence of sars-cov-2 with the possibility of replacement therapy as indicated there were reports of recovery of thyroid function in 3 6 months in sars-cov patients implying reassessment of survivors of the current pandemic11
many viruses such as enteroviruses coxsackie b virus12 retroviruses rubella mumps cytomegalovirus epstein-barr and varicella zoster virus have been implicated in the development of diabetes mellitus in humans13
coronavirus has also been reported to cause diabetes in animal and human studies in a case report of a foal it was suggested that the pancreas could have had direct viral damage due to coronavirus leading to diarrhoea and transient diabetes mellitus simultaneously14
it has been demonstrated that coronaviruses enter human lungs pancreas and other tissues by interacting with the ace2 receptor the expression of ace2 is much stronger in pancreatic endocrine tissue compared with the exocrine tissue15 the extent of tissue damage by sars-cov is a direct function of the level of expression of tissue ace2 thus sars-cov viruses may damage pancreatic islets and cause acute insulin dependent diabetes mellitus but not acute pancreatitisthe pancreatic biopsy findings in sars-cov-2 patients have been identical to the previous studies in sars-cov patients yao et al reported no obvious abnormalities in the epithelial cells in the exocrine pancreas however degeneration of a few islet cells was noted8
it was observed that patients with mild sars-cov who did not receive glucocorticoid medications during the disease course had a higher level of fasting plasma glucose fpg on the first day of hospitalisation than those who had non-sars pneumonia new-onset diabetes developed in 51 of sars-cov patients who had no previous diabetes and received no steroid treatment during illness15 hyperglycaemia was an independent predictor for mortality and morbidity in sars-cov patients with and without a history of diabetes mellitus4 yang et al demonstrated that before steroid treatment the mean fpg level was significantly higher in sars-cov patients deceased vs survivors vs non-sars pneumonia group 9752 vs 6530 vs 5110 mmoll p001 hyperglycaemia fpg70 mmoll before steroid treatment was significantly associated with death or 33 after adjustment for age and gender there was an incremental rise in mortality with increasing fpg another interesting association noted was between hypoxaemia and higher fpg levels4 among patients with no known history of diabetes and before the commencement of steroid therapy those who had hypoxaemia arterial oxygen saturation 93 had higher fpg levels than those who did not have hypoxia in both the survivor 8749 vs 6321 mmoll and deceased 9848 vs 7215 mmoll groups it was estimated that for every 10 mmoll increase in fpg the hr increased by 108-fold for death and 107-fold for hypoxia morbidity in both survivors and deceased patients irrespective of steroid dosage elevated fpg values started falling in the third week indicating gradual recovery of islet cell functionabout half a billion people are currently living with diabetes worldwide patients with diabetes had a poorer outcome in previous epidemics of sars-cov and h1n1 epidemics16 17 the clinical course of sars-cov-2 infection in patients with diabetes and without other comorbidities was recently reported by guo et al from wuhan china18 patients with diabetes may present with milder symptoms initially but they were at higher risk of rapid progression to severe pneumonia uncontrolled cytokine storm and hypercoagulable state contributing to a poorer prognosis interleukin-6 il-6 level was found to be higher in sars-cov-2 cases with diabetes than those without diabetes wang et al hypothesised that sars-cov-2 infection in patients with diabetes might trigger stress condition and increase secretion of hyperglycaemic hormones such as glucocorticoid and catecholamines resulting in elevated blood glucose abnormal glucose variability and diabetic complications in turn leading to higher mortality and morbidity rates in these patients19
a study of 99 sars-cov-2 patients demonstrated that 52 of patients had elevated blood glucose with a mean glucose value of 74 mmoll20 wu et al
21 showed that sars-cov-2 patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome ards had higher glucose levels 74 vs 54 mmoll compared with patients who did not develop ards hr 113 similarly in sars-cov-2 patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms increased glucose level was an independent risk factor for severecritical illness on multivariate analysis or 24222 sars-cov-2 patients with diabetes are at high risk of progressing rapidly with ards and septic shock ma et al recommended fpg of 4461 mmoll 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose 2 h pg 6178 mmoll in mild cases and fpg 78100 mmoll 2 h pg 78139 mmoll for critically ill patients of sars-cov-223
to sum up sars-cov infections damage islet cells causing acute temporary diabetes high fpg and associated metabolic changes lead to increased morbidity and mortality in these patients in addition pre-existing diabetes may be considered a risk factor for poorer outcomes of sars-cov-2 pneumonia intensive blood glucose monitoring and insulin therapy to obtain optimal metabolic control may improve the outcome of these patients tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody against il-6 may have a role in patients with diabetes to control overexpressed il-6 it is being used off-label currently and a randomised controlled trial is testing its utility24 the european society of endocrinology statement advises patients with diabetes to avoid physician office visits and seek telephonicelectronic consultations for optimal control of blood sugar they need to get an early referral to emergency services in case of possible symptoms of sars-cov-225
the histological changes in adrenal glands of the patients dying from sars-cov were described by ding et al from postmortem biopsy samples26 they noted that the adrenal medulla had been infiltrated by mainly the monocytes and lymphocytes another interesting finding was the focal necrosis of the gland in addition vasculitis of the small veins of the adrenal medulla was present no similar studies have been conducted in sars-cov-2 patients until date however there are reasons to believe that similar adrenal gland changes could occur given the similarity of the viral structure and mechanism of entry into human host cellssars-cov genome sequences have been detected in the cytoplasm of numerous neurons in the hypothalamus and cortex27 it might induce either hypophysitis or directly affect the hypothalamus leading to hypothalamicpituitary dysfunction leow et al
11 studied hypocortisolism in patients who had recovered from sars-cov patients with an intact hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal hpa axis at the time of acquiring sars-cov were included in the study these patients also had symptoms like lethargy malaise lassitude fatigue weakness orthostatic dizziness anorexia apathy anxiety and depression after recovery three months after recovery 393 of patients had hypocortisolism of which 833 had central hypocortisolism as depicted by low adrenocorticotropic hormone acth levels it was interesting to note that the majority of these patients had not received any systemic glucocorticoids as part of the treatment for sars ruling out the possibility of hpa axis suppression by exogenous corticosteroid use the hypocortisolism was however transient and resolved in 625 of patients within a year with an average duration of 5931 months these patients also reported resolution of symptoms including orthostatic hypotension in comparison to the start of the study six patients 25 continued with residual hypocortisolism at 1-year follow-up and one of them still required hydrocortisone replacement a quarter of the patients also revealed transient biochemical thyroid changes with some patients developing both a central hypothyroid and hypoadrenal state with the hpa axis affected more frequently than the hpt axis the authors also found low levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate dheas in 131 patients after adjusting for age sex and menopausal status dheas replacement could further ameliorate symptoms in those with dheas deficiencyfindings from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 patients suggest for actively monitoring biochemical changes like serum cortisol and acth shall these biochemical changes go unnoticed it may complicate post-sars recovery symptomatic patients with orthostatic hypotension may require physiological doses of hydrocortisone replacement until hpa axis recovery in addition patients with adrenal insufficiency and cushings syndrome are at increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection and should adhere to enhanced preventive stepschanges in the cells of anterior pituitary were noted in biopsy samples of sars-cov patients28 on immunohistochemical staining the number of somatotrophs thyrotrophs and corticotrophs was reduced while the number of lactotrophs and gonadotrophs was significantly increased these findings correlated with biochemical abnormalities of increased prolactin luteinising hormone and follicle stimulating hormone in sars-cov reported earlier in chinese literatureseasonal and the h1n1 influenza a virus h1n1 pandemic have been associated with increased severity and greater risk of morbidity and mortality in obese persons compared with normal weight persons being overweight and obesity both negatively impact cellular immune response to h1n1 influenza29 obesity is associated with several chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus obstructive sleep apnoea and surfactant dysfunction in the lungs which may increase the risk of complications of sars-cov-2 the intensive care management of patients with severe obesity is always very challenging and difficult30 it is likely that obesity is an independent risk factor for severe sars-cov-2 illness and should be further investigatedearly studies have linked the increased mortality rates in sars-cov-2 patients with the presence of diabetes mellitus increased glucose levels have been associated with the development of ards and worsening of sars-cov-2 illness requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation hyperglycaemia can be a useful predictor to assess patients and triage them effectively to provide early management strategies strict glucose management is required in such patients to reduce mortality central hypothyroidism and central hypocortisolism seem to occur commonly in patients infected with coronavirus these changes are usually transient and occur during the illness or after recovery this crucial information calls for reassessment of survivors of the current pandemic and identifying these changes early with prompt management can prevent further complications prospective randomised clinical trials cohort studies and pathology studies of sars-cov-2 patients are ongoing and may further elucidate the mechanisms of these endocrinopathies translating into better treatment of patients affected by this virusa series of viral pneumonia cases were confirmed in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 a new coronavirus was identified and named by the world health organization first as 2019ncov then sarscov2 as the cause of the disease covid19 while the pathogenesis and aetiology of sarscov2 infection is still not completely known it has been observed that it is genetically similar to sarscov and merscov1 and that the incubation time is between 1 and 14 days2 unlike other human coronaviruses some patients had lowgrade fever or were even asymptomatic yet remained infectious recently snakes have been suggested as the natural reservoirs of sarscov2 assuming that the huanan seafood wholesale market was the origin of the virus3
fatal cases of covid19 were first reported in an announcement by the health commission of hubei province on 11 january 2020 claiming no evidence of humantohuman transmission4 however it was later confirmed that some patients did not have a history of exposure of the huanan seafood wholesale market cases outside of hubei were first confirmed on 20 january 2020 as of 2 february 2020 over 17 000 cases were confirmed in china with a hospital fatality rate of 21 whereas in hubei province was 31 significantly above the rest of china figure 1 data from the nhcmost fatal cases were reported in china with very limited clinical data available in this context the present study reviewed publicly available data aiming to provide health professionals and authorities with useful observations concerning mortality given the lack of data from a control group the present work focuses on clarifying fatal casesfor each of the measure studied a confidence interval for the central tendency was calculated eg proportion for male mean for age the computation was done in a spreadsheet microsoft office excel version 2016 a regression model was estimated by regressing the time from hospital admission to death on other variables the computation was done with the software r and the adjusted r
2 was used for the model selection criterion moreover different functional forms were attempted to ensure normally distributed residuals free from autocorrelation and heteroskedasticityfortysix fatal cases were identified and included in the study including 39 cases in hubei5 6 7 one in chongqing8 two in henan9 two in heilongjiang10 one in hebei11 and one in sichuan12 of the seven cases outside hubei three had a travel history to wuhan demographic and common clinical characteristics are illustrated in table 1 the average age was 706 years n  45 95 ci 520805 with no significant difference between men and women t test p  80 eightyfour percent of all deceased patients were of age 60 or above men accounted for 674 95 ci 520805 of all deceased patientswhile the time from first symptom onset to hospital admission was normally distributed with mean 62 days the time from hospital admission to death was lognormally distributed with mean 11 days and median 5 days as suggested by the jarquebera normality test p  56 on the logtransformed data therefore the logtransformed time from hospital admission to death was regressed in the model based on the adjusted r
2 the time from symptom onset to hospital admission cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities and age were selected as the independent variables table 2 with the exception of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities all other variables are significant at 5 level the signs of the coefficients are reasonable as the time from hospitalisation to death was inversely related to age and the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation the statistical significance of time from symptom onset to hospital suggests the need of timely hospitalisation in fact the coefficient of time from symptom onset to hospital admission means that for any two identical patients who will eventually expire with hospital admission 1 day apart the expected time from hospital admission to death of the patient with later hospital admission is 85 shorter than that of the other patient all else being equalalthough a patient was admitted to the hospital for palpitation on 26 november 2019 it is important to note that palpitation was not a common symptom of covid19 infection common first symptoms included fever 659 cough 614 and dyspnoea 273 hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities accounting for 405 and 262 of 42 cases respectively despite the prevalence of pneumonia in patients infected with covid19 only 163 n  43 95 ci 68307 and 233 n  43 95 ci 118386 of all deceased patients had pulmonary and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities respectively chronic bronchitis 156 and coronary heart disease 133 were the most common some clinical findings were also reported in some cases with groundglass opacity commonly found on ct 100 for cases reporting ct results respiratory failure and bradycardia were observed in almost all cases immediately before deathsince sarscov2 can cause lethal infections an analysis of fatal cases is a public health priority the present study clarifies fatal cases with details available in public records during the covid19 epidemic in china as of 2 february 2020 a total of 46 fatal cases in six different provinces were identifiedit is not surprising that old age is associated with mortality as 84 of all deceased patients were of age 60 or above while men accounted for 674 of all cases gender was unlikely to be associated with mortality due to the previous observation that most of the infected patients were male13
not surprisingly fever 659 95 ci 501795 and cough 614 95 ci 455756 remained the most common symptoms and were unlikely to be associated with death however the proportion of deceased patients with fever was lower than the previously reported 9014 for all infected patients there is however not sufficient evidence to show that fatality was associated with fever although a small proportion 273 of all deceased patients were reported to have dyspnoea it is possible that the proportion of surviving patients having dyspnoea is even lower it has recently been suggested that dyspnoea was more commonly observed in patients requiring intensive care icu15
twentynine of the 46 deceased patients had comorbidities 630 95 ci 475768 with hypertension 405 95 ci 256567 and diabetes 262 95 ci 139420 being the most common while there is no data available from a control group a chronic disease prevalence study in the hubei population may shed light on understanding the relationship between comorbidities and covid19 mortality the most recent prevalence study16 in hypertension and diabetes in hubei province indicated that 308 95 ci 282335 of the population aged 30 or above accounted for hypertension whereas diabetes accounted for 56 95 ci 4370 therefore the significant difference in the proportion of diabetes between the deceased patients 262 and hubei population 56 suggested that diabetes might be associated with mortality in contrast there is not yet sufficient evidence to suggest that hypertension was associated with increased risk of mortalityalthough cardiovascular cerebrovascular and pulmonary disease only accounted for small proportion of deceased patients the results of the regression model suggested that cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease were inversely correlated to the time from hospitalisation to death suggested the possible role in mortalitythe significantly higher mortality rate in hubei might be due to the delay of hospitalisation as implied by the average time of 62 days from first symptom onset to hospital admission most of the cases included in the study dated between december 2019 and midjanuary 2020 prior to the chinese governments announcement of the public health concern about wuhan pneumonia as well as possible humantohuman transmission coupled with the widely known influenza season in wuhan around the lunar new year pneumonia was mistaken for flu and therefore patients were not aware of the need of hospitalisationthe present study has some limitations first the sample size is relatively small as of 2 february 2020 361 deaths have been reported in china meaning that the fatal cases included in the study accounted for only 13 as a result findings of statistical tests and confidence intervals should be interpreted carefully for instance pulmonary and cardiovascular comorbidities were likely risk factors for mortality albeit not statistically significant second a control group should be included for study to verify the mortality risk factors identified in the study the hospital mortality rate reported in the present study only considered hospitalised cases it has been reported by the media that some patients were not hospitalised due to the lack of resources consequently the actual case fatality rate might be much higher than the hospital fatality rate finally the data studied were obtained from the official pages of the chinese health authorities it is possible that other cases were made public in other waysthe author declares no conflicts of interestin december 2019 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 broke out in wuhan china and has spread widely all over the world reaching the pandemic level1 according to the latest who report 693224 cases of covid-19 were confirmed globally as of march 30 2020 with more than 33000 deaths2 because covid-19 is highly contagious and harmful it is crucial to determine the predictors of severe infection and death for risk stratification and guiding clinical treatment and interventionrespiratory symptoms are the most prevalent manifestations of covid-19 however studies have shown that acute cardiac injury is a common complication in covid-19 patients34 indeed a study in the early stage of the disease outbreak showed that 12 of 41 patients diagnosed with covid-19 had acute myocardial injury which was characterized by a significant increase in the level of hypersensitive troponin i hs-ctni5 the heart autopsy results of three covid-19 cases revealed pathological changes of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy partial cardiomyocyte degeneration and necrosis mild interstitial congestion and edema accompanied by a small number of lymphocytes monocytes and neutrophil infiltration6 additionally a meta-analysis showed that hs-ctni was significantly increased in patients with severe covid-19 compared with mild forms7 therefore myocardial injury is likely to be an important prognostic factor for covid-19 here we summarize the current literature to explore the correlation between myocardial injury and mortality in patients with covid-19pubmed the web of science medrxiv and covid-19 academic research communication platforms articles in chinese httpmedjournalscn2019ncpindexdo were used to search articles published until march 30 2020 without language restriction application the following keywords were used coronavirus disease 2019 or covid-19 or novel coronavirus pneumonia or 2019-ncov or sars-cov-2 and heart injury or cardiac injury or myocardial injury and death or mortality or non-survivor or deceased alone and in combination the title abstract and full text of all documents identified using the search criteria were assessed and those reporting the mortality rate in covid-19 patients with and without myocardial injury were included in this meta-analysis the reference lists of all studies were also analyzed to identify additional eligible studiesa meta-analysis was performed on retrievable data including estimation of the odds ratio or and its 95 confidence interval ci of mortality in patients with or without myocardial injury all statistical analyses were conducted with revman 53 software chichester the uk centre the cochrane collaboration the mantel-haenszel statistical method and fixed effect analysis model models were employed to assess outcomes forest plots were utilized to visually illustrate effect estimates of the included studies funnel plots were used to examine publication bias we used the newcastle-ottawa scale nos to further evaluate the quality of the observational studies with nos score  7 considered good quality8overall 134 studies were originally detected based on our electronic and reference search after screening by title abstract and full text 125 studies were excluded as not specifically related to covid-19 n  52 review articles n  18 did not provide relevant data n  20 editorials n  21 and compared patients by severity but not by mortality n  14 ultimately 9 studies involving a total of 1470 patients were enrolled917the characteristics of the included studies are described in table 1 and the treatment and clinical outcome of the patients are described in table 2 all articles included in the meta-analysis had high quality according to the nos the mortality rate with or without myocardial injury in patients with covid-19 are depicted in figure 1a in our study the overall mortality rate was 235 the mortality rate of patients without myocardial injury was considerably lower than that of patients with myocardial injury 112 vs 671 p  0001 and myocardial injury was significantly associated with increased mortality in patients with covid-19 or  1368 95 ci 9811908 p  0001 heterogeneity among the studies was borderline significant i2  52 p  003 a funnel plot showed symmetry indicating a low risk of publication bias figure 1bsars-cov-2 causes myocardial injury through direct and indirect pathogenic pathways single-cell data analysis identified that human myocardial cells express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and that higher expression is present in patients with heart failure18 sars-cov-2 may invade cells by binding to ace2 causing direct damage to cardiomyocytes however the autopsy results of covid-19 cases failed to detect sars-cov-2 virus components in myocardial tissue by electron microscope observation immunohistochemical staining or pcr6 sars-cov-2 infection may also cause myocardial injury through overactivetion of the immune system with the release of a large number of cytokines and cytokine storms1920 in addition pulmonary infection-induced hypoxemia respiratory failure and shock might lead to insufficient myocardial oxygen supply after infection the burden of the heart increases and the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand leads to myocardial injury21 overall more studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism of sars-cov-2-induced myocardial injurythe overall mortality rate was 235 in our meta-analysis which is much higher than the value of 23 of 44672 confirmed cases reported in the study of the chinese centers for disease control and prevention22 a possible reason is that these involved studies included a high proportion of critically ill patients this large sample size report also showed that the case fatality rate was associated with disease severity as all death cases were among critical patients our meta-analysis showed that covid-19 patients with myocardial injury have a higher mortality rate a previous meta-analysis also reported a significant increase in ctni in patients with severe sars-cov-2 infection indicating that myocardial injury might be related to covid-19 severity7 therefore the existence of myocardial injury should be regarded as an important index in the risk stratification of disease severity and death for covid-19 continuous monitoring of myocardial injury markers and cardiac function during hospitalization should be strengthened for patients with myocardial injury we believe that doctors should conduct comprehensive treatment including correcting hypoxemia and improving myocardial oxygen supplementation applying immunoglobulins to inhibit the excessive immune response improving myocardial energy metabolism and maintaining water-electrolyte balance to improve the prognosis of covid-19 patientsin december 2019 a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were later confirmed to be infected with a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in wuhan hubei province china 12 the clinical spectrum of sars-cov-2 infection appeared to be wide ranging from asymptomatic infection mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe or even fatal in some cases to accommodate the wide spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes of infections caused by sars-cov-2 35 the who later introduced a rather unspecific name covid-19 coronavirus disease 19 to denote this diseasethe rapid emergence of covid-19 in wuhan city hubei province china has resulted in thousands of deaths 6 recently the covid-19 spread rapidly around the world and caused the death of hundreds of thousands of patients 7 at present there are no effective therapies or vaccines for covid-19 it was reported that the death was mainly in severe patients and many infected patients presented mild flu-like symptoms and quickly recover 5 however the differences in clinical characteristics between severe and non-severe cases were little reported 89 in particular the comparison of clinical characteristics between survivors and non-survivors of severe patients and risk factors for survival have not been reportedin this study we aimed to identify risk factors for mortality of severe patients and establish a risk model to predict mortality so that clinicians can effectively consider medical resources of patients with different risksthis retrospective cohort study included three institutions zhongnan hospital of wuhan university no 7 hospital of wuhan and leishenshan hospital wuhan china zhongnan hospital is responsible for the treatments for covid-19 assigned by the government no 7 hospital of wuhan is one of the designated hospitals for the hospitalization of patients with covid-19 and has been entrusted by zhongnan hospital of wuhan university since january 2020 leishenshan hospital was a hospital specially built to treat patients with covid-19 and was taken over by the zhongnna hospital of wuhan university all consecutive patients with confirmed covid-19 according to who interim guidance from january 1 to march 27 2020 were enrolled in present study 10 patients absent of or with negative sars-cov-2 test results were excluded from this study all patients involved in this study were living in wuhan during the outbreak period of covid-19 the clinical outcomes such as discharges or mortality were monitored up to march 31 2020 the final date of follow-up and all patients with covid-19 have

variables was defined based on the receiver operating characteristic roc curve with optimal sensitivity and specificity in training cohort there are few missing values for each variable and the proportion of missing values does not exceed 10 so multiple imputation methods were applied to supplement missing values to obtain complete data using mice package with r version 363 software then the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso regression was performed to identify variables with non-zero coefficients using package of glmnet the coefficients and multivariable analyses were used to generate a prediction model to quantify discrimination performance of the model roc curve was measured with rms package in r software by comparing observed actual data with the predicted

was supported by the key project for anti-2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia from the ministry of science and technology china grant number 2020yfc0845500in total 2529 patients were hospitalized in zhongnan hospital no 7 hospital of wuhan and leishenshan hospital with covid-19 a total of 1830 cases with complete data and defined outcomes were included among of which 452 cases 267 were severe the severe patients have relatively high mortality rates in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university 391 and no 7 hospital of wuhan 463 while the mortality rate in leishenshan hospital 88 is lower therefore 113 severe patients from zhongnan hospital and no 7 hospital of wuhan were included as training cohort to compare the characteristics of survivors and non-survivors while 339 from leishenshan hospital were assigned to independent validation cohort the demographic and clinical characteristics were shown in tables 1

 respiratory failure 416 was the most frequently observed complication followed by ami 389 ali 257 and aki 230 table 3 the secondary infection occurred in 168 patients sepsis and acidosis all occurred in non-survivors the frequency of complications was higher in non-survivors than survivors all p005 table 3median time from illness onset to admission was similar in survivors and non-survivors p0958 with a median duration of 70 days 10410 for survivors and 80 days 0300 for non-survivors table 3 the median time from illness onset to discharge was 300 days range 110670 interquartile ranges 230380 for survivors whereas the median time to death was 210 days range 20540 interquartile ranges 150315 for non-survivors p001 the median time from illness onset to complication had no statistical differences between survivors and non-survivors all p005 table 3 median time from illness onset to progression of respiratory failure was 110 days followed by secondary infection 130 days ami 145 days ali 160 days aki 165 days acidosis 190 days coagulopathy 190 days and sepsis 220 days table 3 fig 1
a among non-survivors the median time from illness onset to admission from admission to progression of complication from complication occurred to death was shown in fig 1b the median time from coagulopathy or acidosis to death was the shortest 3 days followed by aki ali ami sepsis respiratory failure and secondary infectionof cases from zhongnan hospital 56 non-severe serums and 15 severe serums were tested for anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies from patients with covid-19 the igg and igm levels of severe and non-severe patients were shown in fig 1c and d the maximum time for antibody monitoring was up to 54 days from illness onset antibody levels between severe and non-severe patients had no statistical differences p0179 for igg p0926 for igm igg levels reached the highest during 2030 days both in severe and non-severe covid-19 patients in severe patients the level of igg gradually declined after 30 days while in non-severe patients it remained stable the igm levels stabilized at low levels in non-severe patients whereas it gradually increased after 30 days from the onset of symptoms in severe patients and then declined after 50 daysin total 52 characteristics were analyzed by lasso binary logistic regression in training cohort and 8 candidate variables that were reliably associated with survival were selected fig 2
 the weight for each factor associated with infection were obtained by calculating coefficients when log2475 and 00841 from lasso binary logistic regression model fig 2a and b the coefficients for each parameter were as follows 04565 for age 00997 for diabetes 02487 for chd 01760 for percentage of lymphocytes lym8 1371 for pct015 ngml 02150 for blood urea nitrogen bun76 mmoll 00815 for c reactive protein crp 55 mgl and 05865 for d-dimer dd 05 ugml then by multivariable analysis age chd lym pct and dd remained independent risk factors for mortality and hazard ratios hrs of the five variables were shown in fig 2caccording to multivariable analysis and coefficients of lasso binary logistic regression a scoring system of covid-19 css was generated as shown in fig 2d the score distributions were as follows age between 60 and 75 points was 1 point and those older than 75 was 2 points chd condition was 1 point lym 8 was 1 point pct015 ngml was 2 points and dd05 ugml was 1 point we then defined a total of 0 to 2 points as low risk and total points more than 2 as high risk the cut-off value between these groups was selected based on the best sensitivityspecificity ratiothe model showed great prognostic accuracy in both training cohort and independent validation cohort by using roc analysis fig 3
a and d performance of this model was validated by calibration plots for the probability of death which demonstrated good agreement between prediction and actual observation in training cohort fig 3b the hosmerlemeshow test yielded a nonsignificant statistic p0264 indicating that there was no departure from perfect fit for illustration the cumulative risk events were performed in training and independent validation cohorts which showed significantly increased deaths in high-risk group compared with the low-risk group fig 3c and fin low-risk group the number of patients was 60 with 6 non-survivors and in high-risk group the number of patients was 53 with 43 non-survivors the mortality rates were 100 in low-risk group and 811 in high-risk group p001 there were also statistical differences in complications in low-risk and high-risk groups except for sepsis in low-risk group the median time from illness to death was 345 days whereas it was 210 days in high-risk group p0039 fig 4
b indicating that low-risk patients had a longer survival time for survivors the median time from illness to discharge was 200 days for low-risk group and 225 for high-risk group p0125 fig 4b in low-risk group 30 survivors received systemic corticosteroids treatment and 24 survivors did not whose mean hospital durations were 230 days and 185 days respectively p0036 fig 4a and the median time from illness onset to discharge was 345 days and 270 days p0012 fig 4b in high-risk group 34 non-survivors received systemic corticosteroids treatment and 9 non-survivors did not and their median survival time were 210 days and 150 days respectively p0475 fig 4b in conclusion in low-risk group the absence of systemic corticosteroids could shorten duration of disease by 75 days and hospital duration by 45 days meanwhile whether to use of systemic corticosteroids in high-risk group had no effect on survivaldata from 20 patients with complete clinical course including 10 severe survivors 10 severe non-survivors were analyzed to track scores from admission to discharge or death fig 5
a among survivors scores gradually decreased during hospitalization until discharge whereas scores gradually increased until death in non-survivors meanwhile the last laboratory findings with lym dd pct were recorded to obtain discharge or death scores finally 36 non-survivors and 36 survivors were included to compare scores between admission and discharge or death fig 5b for non-survivors scores at death was higher than that at admission p00001 for survivors scores at discharge seemed lower than that at admission but the difference was not statistically significant p0080in this retrospective cohort study the median time from illness onset to death was 210 days for severe covid-19 non-survivors a total of 602 patients had complications and the proportion in non-survivors was higher than that of survivors p005 it was reported that organ damage during hospitalization in patients with covid-19 was associated with in-hospital mortality 16 17 18 respiratory failure 416 was the most common complication followed by ami 389 ali 257 and aki 230 for non-survivors respiratory failure and secondary infection occurred firstly followed by ami aki ali ami occurred earlier than aki and ali and that heart becomes the first organ involved might be explained by the fact that the cardiac highly expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which was a human cell receptor with a strong binding affinity to the spike protein of sars-cov-2 leading to directly attacked by the virus 171920 covid-19-induced kidney and liver injury might be related to drug hepatotoxicity or subsequent immune-mediated inflammation such as cytokine storm pneumonia-associated hypoxia and shock 161821 it was worth noting that time from aki to death was shorter than that of ami or ali cui and co-workers indicated that cytopathic effects of sars-cov-2 on podocytes and proximal straight tubule cells may cause aki in patients with covid-19 22 the early monitoring of renal function should be paid more attentionthe study identified several factors associated with mortality in severe patients with covid-19 the aged chd condition decreased lym elevated levels of pct and dd on admission were associated with high odds of in-hospital death all non-survivors scored no less than 3 points before death and dynamic profile of points showed that a high score indicated progression of disease and a higher risk of death fig 5 css was established to divide mortality risk of severe cases into high-risk and low-risk groups the risk of death in high-risk group increased significantly p001 and there were also statistical differences in complications between low-risk and high-risk group the css demonstrated good predictive performance with roc curve auc0919 in training cohort and 0938 in independent validation cohort and calibration curve p0264 in training cohort analysis in validation cohort css seemed to underestimate mortality of low-risk patients but overestimate mortality of high-risk patients in the calibration curve fig 3d it could be explained by the low mortality rate in wuhan leishenshan hospital since some critically ill patients were transferred to other hospitals to reduce mortality which lead to the predicted death inconsistent with the actual observed death the data from wuhan leishenshan hospital might not reflect the actual mortality rate of severe covid-19 in wuhan or chinathe elderly was considered an important independent predictor of mortality in sars and mers and also has been confirmed to be associated with mortality in patients with covid-19 823 24 25 which was also confirmed in current study the mortality rate was the highest in patients with severe covid-19 older than 75 years 792 followed by patients aged 6075 years old 431 and younger than 60 years 161 it was worth noting that the number of patients aged 6075 years was the largest table 1 the elderly patients with covid-19 deserved special attentionmyocardial injury was reported to be a common complication and significantly associated with fatal outcome of covid-19 172627 lu et al demonstrated that patients with underlying cardiovascular disease including chd was more prone to experience myocardial injury during the course of covid-19 and higher risk of death 27 chd has also been found to be associated with acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in influenza and other respiratory viral infections 2829 in present study chd was one of independent risk factors to patients with covid-19 the mechanism might be that the release of inflammatory cytokines after infection probably caused reduction in coronary blood flow decreased in oxygen supply destabilization of coronary plaque and microthrombogenesis leading to myocardial injury and heart failure 171920the majority of patients died of multiple organ failure overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines released by activated immune cells and infected cells was involved in the development of organ dysfunction in sars patients and the covid-19 mortality 30 in this analysis pct one of the inflammatory indicators had a strong correlation with mortality of severe covid-19 patients and d-dimer greater than 05 gml was also associated with fatal outcome elevated d-dimer levels indicating the coagulation activation was considered to be related to sustained inflammatory response consequently covid-19 mortality might be due to virus-activated cytokine storm it was valuable to incorporate inflammation indicators into the scoring system to predict the risk of mortalitylymphopenia was believed to be related to increased disease severity and decease in covid-19 patients 31 lymphocytopenia was also common in the critically ill patients with mers infection which was considered the result of lymphocytes apoptosis 3233 therefore it could be postulated that necrosis or apoptosis of lymphocytes also induced lymphocytopenia in severe patients with sars-cov-2 infection 31 the severity of lymphocytopenia reflected the severity of covid-19 and possessed the ability to predict mortality as a powerful predictor 4 besides the decreased lym partly reflected an increase in the proportion of neutrophils which may be related to cytokine storm induced by virus invasionthis analysis also tracked antibodies response in serum of patients with covid-19 which was considered the longest tracking to our best knowledge it can be seen from fig 1 that igg reached its peak at about 2030 days both in severe and non-severe covid-19 patients in severe patients the level of igg declined after 30 days which might be due to lymphocyte depletion 32 that igm levels were still high after 30 days from illness onset in severe patients might be explained that viruses existed in severe patients for a relatively long time 34 it was reported that the serum antibody in covid-19 had potential diagnostic value and a higher titer of antibody was independently associated with a worse clinical classification 3536 but there was no statistically significant difference in antibody levels between severe and non-severe patients in this analysis the number of severe cases was small in present study which might result in less accurate results more cases and time period tests are needed to verifyno antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective given the high levels of cytokines induced by sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infections systemic corticosteroids were often used to treat severe patients for possible benefit by reducing inflammatory-induced lung injury 37 38 39 40 however it was controversial to use corticosteroids for treating influenza-associated pneumonia or ards 41 several studies demonstrated the association of corticosteroid use with mortality bacterial and fungal infection and the emergence of antiviral resistance 2442 some evidence show that receiving corticosteroids in patients with sars and mers did not have an effect on mortality but rather delayed viral clearance 43 44 45 46 further evidence was urgently needed to assess whether systematic corticosteroid treatment was beneficial or harmful for patients with covid-193 in present cohort 168 of severe covid-19 patients had complications of secondary infection but it was not associated with the use of corticosteroids and the difference was not statistically significant p0203 the secondary infection may be due to the immune deficiency caused by virus 47 in addition whether to use corticosteroids had no effect on mortality but the use of corticosteroids in low-risk group prolonged hospital stay by 45 days and durations by 75 days the css provided some guidance for the rational application of corticosteroids and the applicable populationsour study had several limitations firstly only 113 severe patients with covid-19 were included in the training cohort and in independent validation group the number of deaths was small larger cohort studies are needed to validate the scoring system we have established secondly as a retrospective study some possible risk factors reported by other studies such as lactate dehydrogenase and interleukin 6 were not presented in the study because not all laboratory tests were done in all patients resulting in the incomplete data 48 their role might be underestimated in predicting in-hospital death it was reasonable to assume that other possible risk factors not included to analyses might be independently associated with in-hospital death but the current model based on the five variables has shown good performance to predict clinical outcomes thirdly since the vast majority of chest imaging findings were bilateral lung lesions 3 we only used the presence of lung lesions on admission as a positive indicator of chest imaging without considering the severity of lungs which may underestimate the role of lung lesions a predictive model of combined lung lesions also needs to be evaluated finally the data for score development and validation are entirely from wuhan china due to differences in medical resources the data in this study may not be fully representative of the population in china or even the world which could potentially limit the generalizability of the risk score in other areas of the world additional validation studies from areas outside china should be completed however in the absence of a severe covid-19 death risk scoring system this scoring system can help clinicians worldwide to judge in-hospital deathsin conclusion complications were associated with mortality of covid-19 the time from aki to death was the shorter than that of ali and ami early monitoring of renal function should be paid more attention the dynamic changes of antibodies were worth tracking since a higher titer of antibody was considered to be independently associated with a worse clinical classification we found that the aged chd condition decreased percentage of lymphocyte elevated d-dimer and pct at admission were related to mortality of severe patients with covid-19 the css well classified severe patients into low-risk and high-risk groups which was helpful for predicting in-hospital mortality and complications css could help clinicians to identify high-risk patients and be alert to the occurrence of complicationsall authors declare no competing intereststhe first case of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 was reported in wuhan hubei province china on december 31 2019 until march coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 caused by this virus has spread around the world sarscov2 is human coronavirus which does not belong to the group of benign coronaviruses that cause common cold but to the smaller group of coronaviruses that cause acute respiratory distress syndrome severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirussars and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirusmers

 investigations on the outcome of these patients are scarce and data are very limited nevertheless hypertension is considered as one of the most important risk factors for covid19 the relationship between hypertension and adverse outcome is still questionablethe aim of this review paper was to summarize current knowledge about the relationship between hypertension and covid19 and the role of hypertension in outcome of these patients a comprehensive search was performed on pubmed scopus web of science and google scholar to find review papers on this topic published until may 1 2020sarscov2 infection is triggered when the sprotein of the virus binds to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 which is highly expressed in the heart lungs kidney and gastrointestinal tract and plays an important role in several cardiovascular and immune pathways
20
 sarscov2 binds to ace2 with much higher affinity compared to sarscov
21
 additionally sarscov2 shows its pathogenic activity by attacking type ii alveolar epithelial cells that are expressing ace2 previous studies of coronavirus that causes sars demonstrated that this virus binds to ace2 in pulmonary alveoli through their superficial spike proteins which causes lung damage and even lung function failure
21

the loss of ace2 caused by binding sarscov2 may shift the system to an overall higher angiotensin ii and lower angiotensin17 tone the role of angiotensin ii in covid19 hypertensive patients seems to be crucial due to its role in functioning of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas that promotes vasoconstriction sodium retention oxidative stress inflammation and fibrosis and increases the bioactive peptide angiotensin17
22

epidemiological data coming from china indicate that arterial hypertension cardiovascular diseases diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most prevalent concomitant diseases in patients with covid19

 it has still been debated whether hypertension was a predictor of mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors age obesity diabetes and comorbidities coronary artery disease heart failure atrial fibrillation cerebrovascular disease renal impairmentthe prevalence of hypertension among patients with covid19 between different studies ranged from 1520

 which might be the most important reason for different prevalence of hypertensive patients among studies advanced age was associated with higher prevalence of other comorbidities such as diabetes renal impairment arterial hypertension and obesity which altogether increased proportion of hypertensive patients

the prevalence of overweight and obesity was not reported in available studies about covid19 this circulus vitiosus between hypertension obesity and diabetes is difficult to break and therefore conclusion cannot be made without detailed data of all links of chain the impact of smoking should not be forgotten in the relation between copd hypertension and higher propensity to covid19

 however results are conflicting but majority of authors did not find higher prevalence of smoking in patients with adverse outcome

9
 the level of renal damage cannot be excluded as one of contribute factor for higher percentage of hypertension and advance stage of covid19 in hypertensive patients most of studies reported the large prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in covid19 patients but they also did not classified them and therefore it is difficult to estimate the individual effect of coronary artery disease heart failure and atrial fibrillation on occurrence and severity of covid19li et al summarized the findings from 6 studies and showed that the prevalence of hypertension cardio and cerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with covid19 was 171 164 and 97 respectively
17
 the incidences of hypertension cardiocerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were two to threefolds higher in patients with severe type of covid19 than in their nonsevere counterparts yang et al included 46248 covid19 patients from 8 studies and reported that the most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension diabetes cardiovascular diseases and respiratory system disease
18
 the most frequent comorbidities in severe patients were hypertension respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease the large metaanalysis that included 76993 patients with covid19 found that the pooled prevalence of hypertension cardiovascular disease smoking history and diabetes was 1637 1211 763 and 787 respectively 
19
 table 1 the authors of metaanalyses agreed about the large heterogeneity between studies which obviously limited the quality of their study this can be partly explained by different designs and large variation in sample size among studies
18
 
19

some essential data are still missing and it would be dangerous to ascribe the large portion of risk for sarscov2 infection or severity of covid19 to any risk factor including hypertension it would be reasonable to hypothesize that uncontrolled comorbidities as well as combination of concomitant diseases may increase the risk of infection and severity of covid19 but this has to be examinedthere are many controversies about the effect of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors acei and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arb in covid19 patients
24
 some authors expressed their concern that the use of reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas inhibitors and variation in ace2 expression may be partly responsible for sarscov2 virulence
25
 
26
 populationbased studies estimated that only small proportion of hypertensive patients in china 30 to 40 is treated with antihypertensive therapy and raas inhibitors are used in only 25 to 30 of treated patients
27
 
28
 therefore it can be anticipated that only small percentage of covid19 patients in china were actually treated with acei or arbon the other hand the prevalence of cardiac damage in covid19 patients is not negligible and it is associated with adverse outcome in these subjects
5
 
6
 data regarding the frequency of heart failure in covid19 patients are scarce and the same is valid for chronic kidney disease from therapeutic point of view acei and arb have important roles in treatment of these conditionscardiac injury heart failure and renal impairment particularly with albuminuria therefore withdrawing raas inhibitors or switching medications would have uncertain benefits but very certain disadvantagesit would be expected that problem with raas inhibitors would escalate in western countries europe and usa where patients are taking antihypertensive medications and particularly raas inhibitors in significantly higher percentage than in china however studies from italy and usa did not show any association between raas inhibitors and susceptibility to coronavirus complications or mortality from covid19
29
 
30
 
31
 even new investigation from china confirmed these findings
32
 the switching from the raas inhibitors to another antihypertensive therapy would lead to insufficient blood pressure control which could induce more complications in covid19 patients than infection of sarscov2 itself novel data showed that raas inhibitors could even improve the outcome of hypertensive patients with covid19
33
 the authors hypothesized that raas inhibitors have an indirect antiviral role by regulating immune function and inhibiting inflammatory responses
31
 based on the available data despite some theoretical possibilities multiple specialty societies recommended that covid19 patients should continue therapy with raas inhibitors
34
 
35
 
36

limited number of studies provided outcome data after a short followup therefore one should be careful in interpretation of these findings guan et al demonstrated that patients with severe covid19 and those with primary end point admission in intensive care unit the use of mechanical ventilation or death had significantly higher percentage of hypertension diabetes coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease copd chronic renal disease and cancer
3
 the authors did not investigate the relationship between different demographic and clinical parameters with severity of disease or the outcomeshi et al reported that hypertension diabetes coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease copd and cancer were more prevalent in the patients with myocardial injury diagnosed by elevation of highsensitivity troponin i and creatinine kinasemyocardial band ckmb
5
 cardiac injury was associated with significantly higher mortality 521 vs 45 the authors did not investigate which comorbidities were associated with cardiac injury and mortality it must be noted that patients with cardiac injury were significantly older guo et al demonstrated similar results when compared covid19 patients with and without elevation of troponin and found that 278 of patients with covid19 had cardiac injury
6
 in this study chronic renal dysfunction and usage of raas were also more prevalent in patients with cardiac injury however patients with cardiac injury were almost 20 years older and more frequently men than those without injury which also have to be taken into account it was also reported that underlying cardiovascular disease was worsening outcome only in patients with myocardial injury
6
 defining myocardial injury only by elevation of troponin i in these circumstances could be questionable because this biomarker may be increased in many conditions such as inflammation andor sepsissystemic inflammatory response syndrome and kidney injury the authors did not clearly stated which disorders were included under the term cardiovascular disease and it is not clear whether hypertension was included in this term furthermore it is difficult to understand which cardiomyopathies were included and whether patients with heart failure were includedchen et al reported that hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes were more prevalent among covid19 patients who died in comparison with survivors
7
 however there was a large difference in age and sex distribution between groups and authors did not investigate the effect of comorbidities on outcome in this population
7
 table 2 zhou et al reported that hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease chronic renal disease and copd were more frequent among nonsurvivors than in survivors
9
 the authors found that hypertension diabetes and coronary heart disease were predictors of mortality in covid19 patients nevertheless none of these comorbidities remained significant predictor of mortality after adjustment for age sex and smoking status these findings confirmed the importance of comprehensive risk assessment by including all relevant risk factors and comorbiditiesin the large original study that included 1590 patients guan et al showed that after adjusting for age and smoking status patients with copd diabetes hypertension and malignancy were more likely to reach the composite end points admission to intensive care unit or invasive ventilation or death than those without
12
 malignancy copd hypertension and diabetes increased the risk of adverse outcome for 35 27 157 and 158fold respectively
12
 patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly higher risk of the composite end point than patients with a single comorbidity stratification of patients according to their age 65 years vs 65 years did not show significant difference in the strength of associations between the number of comorbidities and mortality of covid19
12
 however it cannot be excluded that other confounding factors besides aging and smoking might also be responsible for the association between comorbidities and outcome it would be also helpful to divide primary outcome into two separate outcomes a admission to intensive care unit andor invasive ventilation and b death this would provide separated information about independent predictors of severity and mortality of covid19 this was performed in the small study and authors found that hypertension and diabetes were predictors of acute respiratory distress syndrome but not mortality in covid19 patients
16
 unfortunately multivariable analysis with adjustment for relevant confounding factors was not performed in this investigationthere are a number of limitations in the mentioned investigations the selfreporting of comorbidities on hospital admission represents one of them underreporting of comorbidities due to the lack of awareness andor the lack of diagnostic testing could interfere the associations between comorbidities and clinical outcome more importantly the duration of followup was short and some patients remained in the hospital at the time of publishing these studies which means that real outcome was unknown obesity was not reported in available studies and its influence could not be investigated furthermore only one study reported basal values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure which would help to estimate the percentage of uncontrolled hypertension the same refers to prevalence of patients with uncontrolled diabetes the most of studies included small number of patients which is additional obstacle one should not forget the fact that majority of studies come from china and we should be cautious when extrapolating these findings to other countries with outbreak of covid19 studies should consider all potential sources of bias and confounding which is why additional investigations with improved design are warrantedrecent findings reported that arterial hypertension represented one of the most common comorbidities in patients with covid19 this prevalence ranged between 10 and 34 the impact of hypertension on outcome and particularly on mortality in covid19 patients is not clear due to lack of data studies did not provide evidence that raas inhibitors should be avoided or switched in these patients large studies that will consider all potential sources of bias and confounding factors as well as longer followup are necessary the public pressure to find all answers is very high but physicians duty is to stay rational and has scientific approach to available and upcoming datacoronaviruses cause a spectrum of illness from asymptomatic disease to respiratory failure early reports of coronavirus infections suggested that most infections were mild until the 2003 sars epidemic that was associated with significant morbidity and mortality 1 in september 2012 a novel coronavirus was identified in a 60-year old man in saudi arabia 2 a second case was identified in a qatari patient hospitalized in the united kingdom 3 the two coronaviruses were genetically identical and similar to isolates obtained from bats 4 in july 2013 the coronavirus study group named this new virus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov 5as of december 21 2015 there have been 1625 cases worldwide with 586 deaths 6 the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of this disease have described a spectrum of illness from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure and death the overall mortality rate remains at

clinical variables among patients who survived and those who died were compared using the fisher exact test a multivariate logistic regression was done on treatments administered and severity of illness to determine which treatments were associated with survival mycophenolate mofetil was not included in this logistic regression analysis because 100  of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil survived the association between severity of illness and treatments administered was assessed by performing a linear regression of treatments administered onto the modified apache 2 scorethere were a

patients given mycophenolate mofetil survived therefore mycophenolate mofetil could not be evaluated in this modelwhile the results of the univariable analysis demonstrated improved survival in patients treated with beta-interferon and mycophenolate mofetil the multivariable analysis which included a marker of severity of illness demonstrated a strong association between severity of illness and reduced survival and no association between treatment with beta interferon and survival mycophenolate mofetil was not evaluable in this model table 2 in analyzing the relationship between severity of illness and treatments administered beta interferon and mycophenolate mofetil were given to less severely ill patients table 3mers-cov is an emerging disease for which the initial epidemiology has been described but in-depth clinical studies and the role of therapy in incompletely understood while the clinical features for mers-cov have been described in several large case series 614 there is a paucity of literature on therapy our results from a relatively large number of patients demonstrate similar clinical features and mortality to previous studies 614 in our cohort treatment with beta interferon and mycophenolate mofetil may be predictive of survival but the greatest predictor of survival is the severity of illness on presentationimproved diagnostics have demonstrated an expanded spectrum of disease that includes less severe cases than previously reported we now understand that mers-cov causes an acute respiratory disease syndrome and one third of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms 14 fever has been seen in 6287  of patients cough in 5587  and gastrointestinal symptoms in 2635  seventy-six to 96  percent of patients have had comorbid illnesses most commonly chronic renal failure diabetes and heart disease 715 this may be partially related to the epidemiology of increased disease transmission in healthcare settings rather than a true host risk factor laboratory findings have been non-specific and consistent with other viral infections thrombocytopenia 75  and lymphopenia 58  have been commonly described in these patients 7 913 15 forty three percent had acute kidney injury 7 1113 17 and 76100  had cxr abnormalities with bibasilar infiltrates as the most common finding 813 15 18 the outcomes in these more severely ill patients remain poor between 5090  required icu care 10 11 13 15 and 67100  in the icu setting required invasive ventilation for a median of 716 days 8 10 12 in addition to mechanical ventilation several patients have received extracorpeal membrane oxygenation ecmo to support ventilation from non-randomized data from the world health organization five out of six patients receiving ecmo died 9 fifty-eight to 75  required renal replacement therapy 11 12 17 and 3060  of hospitalized patients died 715 the severity of illness can be partially explained by the widespread lung disease caused by mers-cov and it appears that mortality in those patients requiring intensive care is extremely high although no autopsy data is available in explanted lung infection with mers-cov causes widespread infection and alveolar disease 19 20the clinical features in our cohort similarly also show a high proportion of patients with fever 96  and cough 804  shortness of breath 90  and almost one third of patients 294  with gastrointestinal symptoms our cohort consisted of ill patients with hypotension 157  tachypnea 769  and hypoxia 33  thirty seven percent required icu care and 10 patients received ecmo similar to previous results all of the patients who received ecmo died 9there is no known effective treatment for mers cov many compounds have been screened in vitro for possible activity against this coronavirus 2124 however the in vivo efficacy has not been subjected to clinical investigationin vitro data suggests that mers-cov inhibits host interferon production through various molecular pathways 2530 mycophenic acid the active agent of prodrug mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine strongly inhibit mers coronavirus in human and monkey cell lines even more so than they inhibit sars coronavirus 24 3133 interferon alpha and interferon beta reduce mers coronavirus replication in explanted lung tissue 19 in vivo comparing host response in two patients with mers coronavirus and differing outcomes the patient who was able to clear mers cov infection was able to mount an interferon response and the patient who died had low levels of interferon alpha suggesting a therapeutic role for interferon 34 the combination of interferon alpha and ribavirin has been used successfully in rhesus monkeys infected with mers coronavirus 35 and in a few small case series 3638 beta-interferon seems to be an even more potent inhibitor of mers coronavirus in vitro 19 24 3133 one small study with exceptionally high mortality rates using interferon beta for treatment found no difference in mortality between interferon beta use and interferon alpha use 39 our data albeit from a retrospective cohort support the findings that interferon beta is associated with a decrease in mortalitythere are limited data on the efficacy of treatment regiments for this virulent disease we present data from a retrospective cohort of ill patients with mers-cov and the results of the evaluation of the clinical efficacy of beta interferon beta alpha interferon ribavirin and mycophenolate mofetil in addition to routine supportive care forty five percent of patents 23 patients received interferon beta and in this cohort sixteen percent of patients received interferon alpha 8 patients and 37  of patients 9 patients received ribavirin either in conjunction with interferon alpha or interferon beta and 8 patient received mycophenolate mofetil patients receiving beta interferon and mofetil had improved survival however this was confounded by the severity of illness on presentation for beta interferon all of the patients who received mycophenolate mofetil survived however because of the small number we could not analyze the independent efficacy of mycophenolate mofetilwhile this is a relatively large series of mers-cov cases the primary limitation of our study is that it is a retrospective review of cases and not a randomized trial and thus subject to confounding as seen in our cohort we used a modified apache 2 score without all of the clinical variables which may have underestimated the association of severity of illness with reduced survival importantly the mortality in patients receiving additional therapies that modulate the immune response was low all of the eight patients who received mycophenolate mofetil in our study survived hence it may be reasonable to further study this agent in controlled trialsthis study was reviewed and approved by johns hopkins university institutional review board and the directorate of health affairsdata supporting the findings are in the manuscript additional data available upon requestinfections are 1 of the main complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation hsct and respiratory viral infections rvi are being increasingly recognized as important complications after hsct with variable degrees of morbidity and mortality 1 2 3 4 in recent years the growing number of hsct utilizing alternative donors and cord progenitor stem cells along with the common use of serotherapy has contributed to a significant increase in viral infections after hsct 5 6 some well-known viruses such herpes simplex virus hsv and cytomegalovirus cmv were major causes of morbidity and mortality in hsct 7 8 however since prophylactic or preemptive anti-hsvcmv therapy became standard practice morbidity and mortality from hsv or cmv disease are rare 9 10 nonetheless respiratory viruses such as influenza parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus rsv continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients after hsct and there is increased awareness for the diagnosis of these infections however no prophylactic approach for such viruses exists in hsct recipients hence this studys aim was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of rvi in children after hsct and describe the short- and long-term outcomes of these patientsthe following definitions were used in the study an upper respiratory tract infection urti was defined as detection of an rvi from upper respiratory secretions together with symptoms from the upper respiratory tract nose and throat a lower respiratory tract infection lrti was defined as either hypoxia or pulmonary infiltrates together with identification of an rvi in upper respiratory secretion bal pleural tap or lung biopsy the day of engraftment was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days in which the peripheral absolute neutrophil count was  5  109l trm was defined as being either due to an rvi or other transplantation toxicities death due to rvi was defined as death from respiratory failure with no other cause of the pneumonia long-term pulmonary complication was defined as any limitation of pulmonary status including pulmonary function tests relapse was defined by the finding of hematologic or cytogenetic recurrence or by the initiation of therapy for recurrence progressive disease was defined as tumor growth of more than 20 or spreading since undergoing transplantation 11all patients were nursed in protective isolation in single rooms with high-efficiency particulate air filters all patients had indwelling central venous catheters and the majority received nutritional support with nasogastric feeding or total parenteral nutrition infection prophylaxis included fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis ganciclovir for cmv prophylaxis 2000 to 2005 and preemptive strategy from 2005 onwards growth factors were given as indicated and laminar air flow rooms were used from day 0 until engraftment intravenous immunoglobulin at a dose of 5 gkg was supplemented if the igg level was less than 400 mgdl the igg level was routinely monitored every week in all patients pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis was given before hsct and after hsct for at least 6 months pneumococcal prophylaxis with penicillin continued for at least 1 year or until the administration of pneumococcal vaccine blood products were transfused to maintain hemoglobin concentration  70 mgl and platelet counts of 20000mm3 fever during the neutropenic phase was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and amphotericin or caspofungin as necessary and modified subsequently according to the results of blood or tissue culturespatients received their preparatory regimen underwent transplantation and recovered in the hospital where they were examined by the medical team twice each day until they achieved engraftment all patients with respiratory symptoms were investigated for the presence of respiratory viruses chest radiographs and computed tomography scans were obtained if clinically indicated npas throat swaps or nasal swabs were used for obtaining upper respiratory specimens bal or pleural tap andor lung biopsy were used for obtaining lower respiratory specimensthe primary endpoint of the study was to review all rvi-positive patients after hsct and describe their outcome in terms of trm and long-term pulmonary complicationsunivariate logistic regression models were constructed to analyze the impact of risk factors on trm within the first 100 days including transplantation type allogeneic versus autologous graft type bone marrow versus peripheral blood stem cells versus cord blood utilization of serotherapy antithymocyte globulin alemtuzumab mabcampath genzyme canada inc mississauga ontario and no serotherapy and underlying disorder malignant versus benign all reported p values were 2-sided and a significance level of 05 was used all statistical analyses were carried out using spss version 125during the study period and among the 844 hsct recipients 96 patients with rvi were documented screening for causes of death in the 96 patients we found that rvi was never the cause of death after day 100 after hsct in the first 100 days after hsct there were 54 patients with rvi as these 54 patients were the focus of the study their diagnosis and conditioning regimen including use of serotherapy are described in table 1
 only 1 patient with diagnosis of severe combined immune deficiency scidomenns syndrome received conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide the remaining 5 scid patients did not receive any conditioning regimen when analyzing utilization of serotherapy we found 11 patients who received antithymocyte globulin and 1 who received alemtuzumabthe overall frequency of documented rvi in the first 100 days after hsct was 64 the frequency was slightly higher in allogeneic 65 than in autologous 62 transplantations p  867 twenty-three patients had lrti 17 occurring in allogeneic patients and 6 in autologous hsct patients the frequency of a lrti was 35 in allogeneic and 17 in autologous hsct patients nineteen patients had parainfluenza infections 11 allogeneic 8 autologous six patients had lrti and 13 patients had urti the median time to diagnosis of parainfluenza infection was 25 days range 1 to 81 days after hsct one patient with lrti was treated was with ribavirin fifteen patients had rsv infection 9 allogeneic 6 autologous eight had lrti and 7 had urti the median time to diagnosis of rsv infection was 14 days range 1 to 52 days after hsct six patients with lrti were treated with ribavirin immediately after rsv was identified health canada approved palivizumab rsv ig in 2012 and only 1 patient received it twelve patients had influenza infection 7 allogeneic 5 autologous eight patients had influenza a and 4 had influenza b four patients had lrti and 8 patients had urti the median time to diagnosis of influenza infection was 31 days range 1 to 100 days after hsct all 12 patients received oseltamivir four patients had adenovirus infections 3 allogeneic 1 autologous proven by adenovirus pcr positive from bal or pleural fluid andor lung biopsy all of them had lrti and subsequently developed respiratory distress the median time to diagnosis of adenovirus infection was 35 days range 8 to 100 days after hsct all patients with adenovirus received cidofovir therapy the remaining 4 patients 2 allogeneic 2 autologous were documented to have hmpv 2 patients coronavirus 1 patient and rhinovirus infections 1 patient of the 32 patients who received allogeneic hsct 12 were receiving therapy for acute gvhd grade ii to iv the number of patients who contracted rvi and the type of viruses are summarized in table 1 the seasonal pattern of rvi is shown in figure 1
 with the number of patients who contracted rvi in each month displayed thirty-five of the 54 total rvi were contracted between october and march which is the high flu season in canada with march being the worst month comparing positive rvi patients versus negative patients there was a statistically significant difference for contracting rvi in the high season versus the low season 35 of 427 versus 19 of 417 p  03eleven patients required mechanical ventilation parainfluenza 4 influenza 3 rsv 2 adenovirus 2 four allogeneic and 1 autologous hsct recipients died within 100 days after transplantation because of the rvi and all of them were mechanically ventilated thus the overall mortality was 100 133 allogeneic and 48 autologous p  304 none of the 4 allogeneic transplant recipients who died had acute gvhd two of the 19 patients with parainfluenza infections died 1 patient was treated with ribavirin two additional patients with parainfluenza infection died 1 from liver veno-occlusive disease and another from pulmonary hypertension thus the mortality caused by parainfluenza was 105 and the total mortality with a diagnosis of parainfluenza was 21 for those with adenovirus respiratory infection n  4 2 patients died of adenovirus infections the mortality caused by adenovirus infection was 50 one of 15 patients died of rsv infection the mortality caused by rsv infection was 67 and that patient was treated with ribavirin none of 12 patients with influenza hmpv coronavirus and rhinovirus infections died from respiratory complications after day 100 after hsct 3 more patients died from trm but death was not related to respiratory problems the remaining 43 patients were followed for a median of 43 years range 14 to 118 no chronic pulmonary complication or allo-immune lung syndrome was observedtwo patients died from parainfluenza lrti a 1-year-old patient with wiskott-aldrich syndrome who underwent unrelated cord blood transplantation developed respiratory distress on day 24 after transplantation npa was positive for parainfluenza type 3 antigen ribavirin nitric oxide and high-frequency oscillator support were given the second patient was a 2-year-old boy with diagnosis of relapse acute myeloid leukemia who underwent matched sibling bone marrow transplantation parainfluenza type 1 antigen was positive from npa on day 19 after hsct this patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ards with radiographic findings consistent with pneumonitisa 2-month-old patient with diagnosis of scid with omenns syndrome underwent matched sibling bone marrow transplantation this patient developed ards from rsv pneumonitis on day 11 after hscttwo patients died from adenovirus pneumonitis and ards an 18-month-old patient with diagnosis of neuroblastoma stage 4 underwent autologous hsct after high-dose chemotherapy this patient had delayed engraftment and developed ards which was positive for adenovirus from bal and pleural fluid another patient was an 11-year-old boy who underwent unrelated cord blood transplantation for severe aplastic anemia this patient had primary graft failure subsequently developed respiratory distress and required high-frequency oscillation adenovirus was positive from bal and lung biopsytype of transplantation graft type utilization of serotherapy and underlying malignant disorder were analyzed using univariate analysis none of these factors were significantly correlated with trm type of transplantation p  347 graft type p  213 serotherapy p  405 and underlying malignant disorder p  156in this large pediatric study we found that 65 of patients receiving allogeneic or autologous hsct had a positive rvi that led to 10 overall mortality in the first 100 days after hsct mortality was higher for allogeneic recipients 133 compared with 48 for autologous recipients furthermore for a median follow-up of 43 years range 14 to 118 patients who tested positive for respiratory virus but did not die had no long-term pulmonary complications and patients who contracted the virus after 100 days after hsct did not have an adverse eventthe total incidence of rvi in this study was consistent within the range of 5 to 11 by previous published data of pediatric hsct recipients 12 13 however our study particularly reported the incidence of rvi within the first 100 days after transplantation as it is a very distinct pattern in our population and different from aforementioned studies our data showed that rvi episodes were clustering within the first 100 days after transplantation only 1 patient developed influenza a urti at 5 months after hsct but no serious respiratory complication was observed similar to patients who were diagnosed with urti and lrti after 6 months after hsct none had prolonged admission or died from respiratory illnesseswe supplemented our routine viral respiratory diagnostics with pcr testing adenovirus pcr pandemic influenza pcr multiplex respiratory pcr if requested by the treating physician pcr has been proven to be a more specific sensitive and rapid method for detecting respiratory viruses compared with antigen testing and viral culture and was likely responsible for increasing our rates of detection though changes in methodology over the study time frame mean that testing algorithms were applied differently as testing methodologies changed 14 15 16even with a lower incidence of adenovirus compared with parainfluenza and rsv infections in this study the respiratory-related mortality was higher for adenovirus ie 50 all 4 patients were confirmed to have a positive adenovirus pcr from either bal or pleural fluid and lung biopsy after diagnosis of lrti moreover 2 patients who died from severe pneumonitis and ards with a positive adenovirus pcr test did not have another apparent cause of respiratory illness it was described that disseminated adenovirus infection can cause pulmonary consolidation such as bacterial pneumonia 17 18 because of similar clinical and radiographic findings adenovirus infection may be under-recognized as a cause of fatal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients with severe lymphopenia or lymphocyte dysfunction likewise our 2 patients with adenovirus infection both had delayed engraftmentadenovirus infection is associated with high mortality up to 100 in the pediatric hsct 19 20 21 routine monitoring for adenoviremia is recommended after hsct because of asymptomatic reactivation in most cases 22 cidofovir is widely used for both preemptive and therapeutic treatment of adenovirus infection despite well-recognized toxicities 23 24 identification of patients at risk of adenovirus infection is very crucial as immune reconstitution is a key factor for reactivation rapid withdrawal of immunosuppressive medications should also be considered whenever possible 25respiratory-related mortality from parainfluenza virus in this study is lower 105 than in other studies which showed approximately 30 to 70 this could be explained by very early years when transplantations were completed and the mainly adult study population in previous reports 26 27 28 29 a large retrospective cohort study from fred hutchinson cancer research center described unrelated transplantation as the major risk factor for parainfluenza virus acquisition as well the use of high-dose corticosteroids 29 for our 2 patients who died from parainfluenza virus pneumonia 1 with diagnosis of wiskott-aldrich syndrome received methylprednisolone as gvhd prophylaxis for an unrelated cord blood transplantation however another patient with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia did not develop gvhd or receive any corticosteroids treatment aerosolized ribavirin was given to the first patient but it was given later during the course of pneumonia the benefit of using aerosolized ribavirin in the treatment of parainfluenza pneumonia among hsct recipients is controversial 26 28 the early diagnosis of parainfluenza infection could expedite ribavirin treatment initiation and improve the outcome 25the incidence of rsv infection in this study was 28 and lrti composed more than one half of all rsv infections interestingly the mortality is only 67 which is lower than 20 to 40 in other studies in hsct recipients 1 treatment with aerosolized ribavirin in 6 of 7 patients with rsv lrti may potentially be the reason for lowered mortality although 1 fatal case was observed after the patient received ribavirin hsct recipients have high potential for progression from urti to severe lrti without well-defined and specific risk factors for death 4 30 31 a pooled analysis by shah and chemaly suggested that ribavirin treatment withwithout rsv-specific immunoglobulin or palivizumab had lower rates of mortality by almost one-third in a review of 21 separate studies 32 another small retrospective analysis of palivizumab given for rsv urti did not show protective effect of progression to lrti 33 34 35no death associated with influenza hmpv rhinovirus and coronavirus infections was observed in this study high mortality between 15 and 70 has been reported in hsct recipients with influenza infection but recent data showed an improvement with the availability of neuraminidase inhibitors 36 37 an inactivated vaccine is the only prophylactic approach for influenza infection but it appears to be less effective in hsct recipients particularly in the first few months after transplantation as well as in patients who required immunosuppressive agents for gvhd treatment 38 39 40 41 however the influenza vaccine is considered to be safe as no major local or general adverse effects were reported after use in transplant recipients 42 hmpv infection has been reported with an incidence of 3 to 9 in adult hsct recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies hmpv may be associated with severe pneumonia and fatal lower -respiratory tract disease in hsct recipients 43 even though hmpv infections are documented in asymptomatic cases 44 further analysis of a larger number of patients is necessary to identify its real impact in after transplantation population for human rhinovirus and coronavirus despite the high incidence of infections among hsct recipients morbidity and mortality are both relatively low asymptomatic detections are common accounting for 13 and 41 of patients with rhinovirus and coronavirus respectively 45mortality is higher in allogeneic hsct and recipients of cord blood transplants however no significant difference was observed by univariate analysis previous studies revealed gvhd and use of immunosuppressive agents as major risk factors associated with lrti and mortality 46 47 48 because of the small number of patients who developed gvhd in our study logistic regression analysis could not be performed likewise various conditioning regimens were used in our 5 patients who died from rvi we are unable to establish the correlation between transplantation type and respiratory virusassociated deaththe strength of our study is in the large number of patients examined from a single center with a uniform isolation practice contact precautions and supportive care the limitation is in the retrospective nature of the study design nonetheless with an incidence of 65 among hsct recipients prospective studies could be a challenge and when using multiple centers another challenge arises in terms of isolation practices infection precautions and supportive care heterogeneity among hsct centersfinally given the high mortality that is associated with viral infections in the first 100 days after hsct in our study it may be intuitive to avoid admission of patients in the high season for respiratory viruses especially in a country such as canada where there is a significant difference between summer and winter temperatures in canada the high season for respiratory viral infections span between october and march and in our study 35 patients 65 contracted rvi during the high season compared with 19 patients 35 in the remaining months this may not be feasible for children who need their hsct urgently for example those with aggressive leukemia but may be appropriate for those with elective nonmalignant hsct to minimize their risk of acquiring these infections early after hsctin december 2019 an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection causing pneumonia began in wuhan china and is rapidly spreading worldwide1 by april 11 2020 1610909 cases of covid-19 had been diagnosed and 99690 cases of covid-19 patients had died the chinese center for disease control and prevention reported 81 mild 14 severe and 5 critical cases2 the case fatality rate is estimated to be between 43 and 110 lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome but higher than that of influenza3there are several established clinical scoring systems for detecting patients at high risk for a suspected infection the systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs score was developed during a 1991 consensus conference to improve early detection of sepsis in patients4 sirs consists of four variables body temperature heart rate respiration rate and white-blood-cell count with differentials however it has limited value for predicting mortality among infected adults in5 and outside6 an intensive care unit icu settingthe quick sequential organ failure assessment qsofa criteria consisting of the respiratory rate glasgow coma scale and systolic blood pressure were proposed in 2016 qsofa is better at predicting in-hospital mortality than sirs outside an icu setting6 but it has lower prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality than does an increase in qsofa score of 2 or more in an icu setting5the national early warning score news consists of seven parameters to improve the early detection of and response to clinical deterioration7 news has equivalent or superior accuracy to that of sirs and qsofa for predicting clinical deterioration in infected patients outside the icu89to date there is no effective antiviral treatment for covid-19 thus early recognition of patients at high risk is important as is close monitoring to provide the necessary interventions at the right time this study compared the predictive values of preexisting clinical scoring systems in patients with covid-19we performed a retrospective observational study of 110

complications of covid-19 such as ards septic shock and icu care the news  7 group had shorter survival times compared to the news  7 group to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate the effectiveness of news for the prediction of mortality critical outcomes and complications in covid-19 populationssirs was widely used until the third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock sepsis-3 were issued in 201615 the previous definition of sepsis was infection with more than two of the four sirs criteria focused on inflammatory excess and sirs criteria did not reflect dysregulated host responses or the presence of organ dysfunction from infection if two of the four sirs criteria were used to define sepsis one in eight people with infection organ failure and significant mortality rates were excluded16 in addition almost 50 of patients hospitalised in general wards developed sirs at least once during hospitalisation suggesting that sirs criteria have poor discriminant validity and are ineffective for detecting sepsis17definitions of sepsis and septic shock were revised in 2016 by sepsis-315 an increase in the sofa score of more than two had better prognostic accuracy for predicting mortality compared to sirs in patients with infection51819 however a sofa score includes six parameters and requires laboratory tests pao2 platelets bilirubin and creatinine using simpler and more useful criteria the qsofa was introduced which showed great prediction validity for in-hospital mortality auroc  081 95 ci 080082 and was statistically better than sofa or a change in sofa score in non-icu patients11 the news showed a great ability to discriminate infected patients at high risk for clinical deterioration at the time of admission13 in the emergency department20 and outside the icu9our data focussed on covid-19 patients at the time of admission in our study sirs qsofa and news all had significantly high scores in the critical patient group in most cases there were significant differences in scores related to breathing and oxygenation sun et al21 reported that oxygen supplementation is an independent risk factor for novel coronavirus pneumonia progressing to a critical condition and blood oxygen saturation spo2  93 when breathing room air needs critical-care management the chinese center for disease control and prevention divided the clinical manifestations of the disease into three degrees of severity and dyspnea respiratory frequency  30min or an spo2  93 were classified as severe disease2 based on our results and other findings difficulty in breathing hypoxia and any oxygen requirements in the early stage of hospitalisation are considered important indicators for predicting progress to a serious conditionin our study news at admission showed equivalent or superior accuracy to that of sirs and qsofa for predicting clinical deterioration such as ards septic shock icu care 28-day mortality and critical outcomes in covid-19 patients as shown in table 3 sirs and qsofa indicated a higher frequency of poor clinical outcomes in groups with lower risk the low accuracy of sirs and qsofa prediction in covid-19 clinical outcomes is that there are many silent hypoxemia patients in severe covid-19 patients with silent hypoxemia seem to breathe comfortably but in fact oxygen saturation if often low when measured through pulse oximetry for this reason sirs and qsofa has limitations in predicting the outcomes of covid-19 the high accuracy of news predictions in covid-19 clinical outcomes is interpreted to be related to the aforementioned factors breathing hypoxia and oxygen requirements which are three of the variables in newsearly detection is important in covid-19 as pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus is often fatal due to rapid progression in addition no drug has been proven effective for covid-19 early interventions can be implemented for patients with more than five news points who are expected to develop disease progression first since covid-19 is a highly contagious infectious disease requiring medical staff to wear personal protective equipment resulting in less contact with patients compared to other patients due to these limitations the discovery of worsening patients may be delayed news allows intensive monitoring by selecting patients who are likely to progress with a critical illness second the use of a high-flow nasal cannula hfnc or noninvasive ventilation niv can be considered in patients with ards with alveolar collapse or hypercapnia by early identification of high-risk patients these non-invasive measures can give patients a chance to recover third due to the nature of the pandemic medical personnel facilities and equipment are often depleted news can help to detect high-risk patients quickly and early and thus save patients by emergency evacuation to locations where medical personnel facilities and equipment are availablethis study had several limitations first because it was a retrospective study conducted at a single centre with a relatively small number of covid-19 patients the results cannot be generalised external validation is needed with studies on future large cohorts of covid-19 patients to confirm the efficacy of news for predicting poor clinical outcomes second the efficacy of the former sofa was not assessed because contact with covid-19 patients is challenging obtaining arterial blood gas analyses for measuring pao2fio2 ratios was not feasible for some patients third selection bias cannot be avoided we did not use data from a large population and the severity of covid-19 may differ among hospitals and between countries however a strength of our study is that it was the first to evaluate the efficacy of preexisting scoring systems for the prediction of clinical deterioration in covid-19 patientsin conclusion calculation of the news at the time of hospital admission can predict critical clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19 and its predictive value is superior to that of sirs and qsofa by early detection of the high-risk group using news early interventions for high-risk patients can improve clinical outcomes in covid-19 patientsduring the last two decades coronaviruses have been recognized as one of the most critical human pathogenic viruses that affect global health and cause concern in the world health system
1
 coronavirus is classified into four genera alpha beta delta and gamma major human pathogenic viruses belong to the beta genus including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and the 2019 novel coronavirus covid19
2

although coronaviruses are recognized as causes of the common cold sars was the first coronavirus to cause a lifethreatening respiratory infection in humans it was endemic in guangzhou china in 20022003 and quickly spread to other countries in asia the americas europe and south africa a total of 8098 sars infected cases and 774 deaths about 10 mortality were reported
3

about a decade later mers caused respiratory infection in the middle east most of these patients had a history of travel to the arabian peninsula or they were in contact with infected people of which some were camel shepherds after the middle east the second outbreak of mers occurred in 20142017 in south korea indicating the circulation of the virus and a more significant concern for the world health community at that time mers was responsible for infecting 2458 people and 848 deaths about 35 mortality
4

in december 2019 a cluster of covid19 patients with symptoms of pneumonia complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards was observed in wuhan china
5
 
6
 in comparison to sars and mers covid19 has a higher rate of spread and became a pandemic in about 4 months the high power of this largescale dissemination led to the quarantine of several cities in different countries
7
 based on the world health organization who 57th report on 17 march 2020 worldwide there have been 179 112 confirmed cases with 7426 deaths about 4 mortality
8
 there is no vaccine or targeted treatment currently available for covid19 infection treatment is mostly supportive although multiple experimental antiviral medications are being evaluated
9
 
10
 thus prevention and rapid diagnosis of infected patients are crucial the trigger for rapid screening and treatment of covid19 patients is based on clinical symptoms laboratory and radiographic findings that are similar to sars and mers infectionsin this study we attempted to distinguish the clinical symptoms laboratory findings radiographic signs and outcomes of confirmed covid19 sars and mers patients all findings are compared to determine unique features among each of them these data could be helpful in the early diagnosis and prevention of infection as well as providing more reliable epidemiological data on a largescale for health care policies and future studiesthis study was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metaanalyses statement prisma guidelines and it has been registered in the prospero database id 176106

prior to 2002 coronaviruses were associated with mild respiratory illness but with the emergence of sars in 2002 mers in 2012 and now in late 2019 covid19 it is established that coronaviruses infections can be associated with severe respiratory disease the virus is transmitted via respiratory droplets or infected inanimate objects and with its rapid spread worldwide in just a few months the who has officially declared the covid 19 outbreak a pandemic

our results show that fever and cough were the most common clinical symptoms in covid19 sars and mers among 52 251 patients with covid19 infection while fatigue sputum production and myalgia muscle soreness were the next most frequent clinical symptoms diarrhea rhinorrhea nausea and vomiting were less common within the 10 037 confirmed sars patients the next most frequent clinical manifestations were chills myalgia headache and dyspnea moreover 8139 mers patients commonly exhibited shortness of breath chills and dyspneashortness of breath was less common in covid19 patients 17 in comparison to sars 32 and mers 51 likewise chills were less common in covid19 patients 17 in comparison to sars 575 and mers 41 therefore these clinical symptoms should help distinguish the various coronavirus infections from each otherour analysis indicated recent travel to wuhan contact with people from wuhan or residency in wuhan exposure to persons with respiratory symptoms and seafood market exposures were common risks among those contracting covid19 furthermore chronic respiratory disease and recent travel to sars endemic areas were most common among those contracting sars in addition 28 of sars patients and 21 of mers confirmed patients were health care workers which is higher than covid19 cases 3 this data indicate that in coronavirus outbreaks isolating infected individuals is one of the most important ways of controlling transmissionwe find that most of the patients with covid19 sars and mers had abnormal chest radiological findings with groundglass opacity and consolidation in covid19 patients being more frequent than in sars and mers patients other studies reported that significant similarity exists when comparing radiological findings of covid19 patients with those suffering from complicated viral pneumonia such as sars and mers
22
 
32
 therefore there appear to be no distinguishing radiological findings when comparing human coronavirusesthe mortality rate was 56 13 and 35 among covid19 sars and mersinfected patients respectively while the mortality rate among covid19 patients is lower than sars and mers covid19 is proving to have a higher contagious potency resulting in a higher number of deaths it should be recognized that these numbers are biased due to the data set including publications related to screening practices eg only those with symptoms being screened increased the percentage value the actual mortality rate from covid19 is almost certainly much lower than that found in this study as more data emerges from screening asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals in china and around the world the exact mortality rate will be better understoodamong covid19 sars and mers patients leukocytosis was found in 133 28 and 30 respectively and leukopenia in 26 32 and 41 respectivelymost of the patients with coronavirus had abnormal chest radiological findings on the other hand runny nose and rhinorrhea are less common symptoms in coronavirusinfected patients
127
 which indicates the virus preferentially affects the lower respiratory tract a study by zhao et al showed that ace2 is a covid19 virus receptor and that it is typically expressed on pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells
128
 another study reported that following covid19 infection deregulated cytokinechemokine response and higher virus titer causes an inflammatory cytokine storm with lung immunopathological injury
129
 inflammation related to the cytokine storm in the lungs may then spread throughout the body via the circulation system covid19 patients have been reported to have increased plasma concentration of inflammationrelated cytokines including interleukin il26710 tumor necrosis factor tnf and monocyte chemoattractant protein i mcpi especially in moribund patients
130
 our data collected here show that ards occurred in 106 of reported patients with covid19 infection a previous study showed that ace2 main receptor of covid19 expression is higher in people with pulmonary ards and acute respiratory injury
131

several limitations of this study exist publication bias and study heterogeneity are unavoidable in this type of study therefore it should be considered when interpreting the outcomes of the reports and our final data set furthermore this study likely overestimates disease severity due to a lack of screening for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals and subsequent publication bias related to these factors likely many infected persons have not been detected thus falsely elevating the rates of hospitalization critical condition and mortality the lower quality analysis and reporting in some of the included publications is another limitation of the study to prevent language bias we included reports in languages other than english additionally we searched for a variety of sites and databases to prevent internet platform bias using eggers regression test we did not find significant publication bias journal bias is an issue facing those who carry out a metaanalysis yet it does not usually affect the general conclusions
132
 however we cannot reject the occurrence of other biases in this study such as choice bias since several journals are not indexed in embase scopus pubmed web of science and the cochrane library and unpublished data from some regions of the worldfever and cough are the most common symptoms of covid19 sars and mersinfected patients the mortality rate in covid19 confirmed cases was lower than sars and mersinfected patients clinical outcomes and findings may be biased by reporting only confirmed cases and it should be considered when interpreting the datathe authors have declared that no

wuhan china since december 2019 has created the public health concern and resulted in the identification of the viral cause the initial reports of this viral infection were traced to the huanan seafood market wuhan china and the etiological agent was identified as coronavirus 1 the world health organization who has named the virus as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov on january 12 2020 and has declared as public health emergency globally on january 30 2020 2 the disease caused by the virus was named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 on february 11 2020 3 the international committee on taxonomy of viruses designated the etiological coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 4 the number of cases has been multiplying at an alarming rate globally resulting in mortality and who has declared covid-19 as pandemic on march 11 2020 5 on may 2 2020 there were 34 million confirmed cases of covid-19 infection cases globally and the number of reported deaths were 244213 6after sars and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers covid-19 is the third known zoonotic cov infection and all belong to the beta-cov cluster 1 there was no determination on the animal species carrying the ncov the preliminary studies showed that the ncov is closely related to the coronavirus isolated from bats postulating the theory of possible transmission from bats to humans 1 the genome homology sequence of sars-ncov and sars-cov was 795 and sars-ncov had high homology with bat cov 7 all the studies suggest the evidence strongly that the sars-ncov might have originated from the bats the intermediate host in transmission to humans yet to be ascertained ji et al have found that snakes are the wildlife repositories for the sars-ncov 8various studies have reported the epidemiological data on sars-ncov most of the studies have shown that elderly patients are affected higher male preponderance and mortality is higher in the elderly with severe comorbid conditions 9 the case fatality rate was estimated at 14-15 depending on the case series described 9 10 the median incubation period is 14 days and the median time from the first symptom to death is less in the elderly 1 mode of transmission is through close contact with people who has an infection through respiratory droplets when the infected person coughs or sneezes another possible mechanism is through infected surfaces and objectsafter the sars-cov2 spike s protein attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors the s protein is cleaved and activated by transmembrane serine proteases family tmprss which allows the virus to release fusion peptide that aids in the membrane fusion 16prior studies have shown that positive sars-cov ribonucleic acid rna polymerase gene fragments were detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in kidney specimens of autopsy patients died from sars 17 mers-cov infections also have been shown to cause kidney epithelial cell damage by apoptosis mediated through receptors 18 these studies suggest that the injury from coronavirus is a direct cytotoxic effect on kidney epithelial cells diao et al analyzed the kidney tissue in six patients on autopsy immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid np protein in the kidney tubule possibly related to potential direct tubular injury from the virus 19 the sars-cov-2 rna was detected in the urine of the patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction qrt-pcr 20the normal human lung has type 1 and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells which express ace2 and is expressed in 83 of type 2 cells men have a higher expression rate of ace2 levels compared to women and similarly asians express higher ace2 levels compared to white and african american populations 1 the analysis by xu et al found that ace2 receptor expression in the kidney is no less than the lung on comparative analysis 16 podocytes and proximal convoluted tubule cells significantly co-express ace2 and tmprss genes that are potential targets for sars-cov-2 the kidney tissue expresses the ace2 gene higher than that of lung tissue the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 to ace2 receptors is 10 - 20 times higher than sars-cov as described by wrapp and colleagues 21the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were elevated in covid-19 infection and probable activation of t-cell response 9 the possible occurrence of cytokine storm in severe cases is evidenced by the significantly higher cytokine levels in the cytokine storm the immune system damages healthy tissues rather than sars-cov-2 16 on the autopsies of six kidney tissues the light microscopy revealed cluster of differentiation 68 cd68 macrophage infiltration of the tubulointerstitium and severe atn the tubules showed complement 5b-9 deposition in all six cases but deposition in glomeruli and capillaries were seldom seen some cd8 t lymphocyte cells and cd56 natural killer cells were seen in kidney tissue 19cheng and colleagues analyzed a large cohort of 710 patients for kidney disease with confirmed covid-19 admitted to tongji hospital from january 28 2020 to february 11 2020 22 all the patients were above 18 years of age patients who have a history of renal transplant and on maintenance dialysis were excluded from the study the baseline serum creatinine was elevated in 110 patients on admissionthe patients in the elevated serum creatinine group were elderly had a higher percentage of males and the days from onset of illness to hospital admission were shorter these patients also had severe disease and co-morbidities compared to those with normal baseline serum creatinine these patients had more pronounced aki and higher rates of mechanical ventilation and the hospital mortality rate was higherpatients with elevated serum creatinine also had leukocytosis lymphopenia thrombocytopenia prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and higher d-dimer levels the patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine had a higher percentage of increased procalcitonin aspartate aminotransferase and lactic dehydrogenase levelsmost of the aki occurred within 7 days but was much quicker and severe in elevated baseline serum creatinine group patients with normal baseline creatinine had later onset of aki and recovered quickly there was elevated blood urea nitrogen bun creatinine high-grade proteinuria and hematuria in elevated baseline serum creatinine patients along with significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr there was a significant gap between peak and baseline creatinine in the elevated serum creatinine group patients with elevated serum creatinine from baseline had worse outcomes compared to patients with normal baseline serum creatininethe study by li et al 14 analyzed 59 cases of inpatients from multiple hospitals around wuhan from january 21 2020 to february 7 2020 with covid-19 disease and 28 patients were diagnosed with severe cases according to the chinese nation health guidance three of the patients died in the severe cases 14 proteinuria was present in 63 of the patients and many of them had detected protein on the first day of admission suggesting the presence of prior renal impairment bun was elevated in 27 of the patients and an also higher level of bun was present in two patients who died serum creatinine was elevated in 19 of the patients and the patients who died had extremely high levels the density was reduced on the computed tomography ct images of the kidney suggestive of edema and inflammationin a study by wang et al 26 the patients needing icu admission had higher bun and creatinine levels at hospital admission compared to non-icu admission patients and overall patients in general the bun and creatinine levels continued to get worse in non-survivors until the death 26we summarized the finding from multiple studies including patient characteristics co-morbidities incidence of aki in general as well as icuseverely ill patients number of patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy crrt extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo and mortality in table 2 9-11 13 19 22-24 26-32all the health care personnel should follow the centers for disease control and prevention cdc-recommended personal protective equipment ppe and safety guidelines during their interactions with the patients all the health care personnel should work as a team to limit the exposure to the infection indications for rrt are similar to other patients with aki and providers with significant expertise should place dialysis cathetersthe patients should be cohorted in dedicated icus if possible the preferred dialysis modality is crrt or slow low-efficiency dialysis sled if available intermittent hemodialysis ihd can also be performed if crrt and sled are not available crrt is preferred over ihd in the setting of isolation as ihd needs one-on-one nursing support the patients needing crrt exceeds the machines available prolonged intermittent treatments eg 10 h instead of continuous with higher flow rates eg 40 - 50 mlkgh and after terminal cleaning can be used for another patientthe patients should be cohorted on the dedicated floor if possible patients with active or suspected covid-19 needing dialysis treatment should not be transported to a central acute dialysis unit ihd should be provided with one-on-one nursing care if the patient is in negative pressure room if all the covid-19 patients are isolated on one floor one dialysis nurse may be able to monitor two or three patients during ihd if video electronic monitoring is available the nurse enters the room if the patient needs anything or to troubleshoot the machine the peritoneal dialysis can be continued as automated peritoneal dialysis apd to limit the exposure of medical staffthe dialysis equipment should be cleaned with the disinfectant before removing it from the room hospital infection control and policy directs the proper disposable of rrt machine equipment as per the hospital protocol crrt filters need to be changed every 72 h or longercontinuous venovenous hemofiltration also known as cvvh or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration cvvhdf are the preferred techniques in the usa continuous venovenous hemodialysis cvvhd is the most common modality used volume overloaded patients can be treated using slow continuous ultra-filtration scuf to keep fluid balance net negative 35temporary dialysis catheters are recommended for the vascular access and the providers with significant expertise should place dialysis catheters it is recommended to use double-layered protection for the personnel performing the procedure filters with high ultrafiltration coefficient and high molecular weight cut-off membrane with 8 - 10 nm membrane pore size are suggested 36 this would help in clearing high molecular weight inflammatory mediators however albumin would need to be replaced as it can be removed concurrently it is essential to assess the patients bleeding risk before choosing anti-coagulation patients with severe covid-19 infection having high bleeding risk it is recommended to avoid anticoagulation in normal or hypercoagulable states one can use heparin or citrate-based anticoagulation depending on hospital protocols when using crrt in combination with ecmo anticoagulation is not needed as ecmo utilizes systemic heparinization 35it is essential to pay a very close attention to hemodynamics and volume status of patients with covid-19 infection by using arterial and central venous pressure cvp monitors patients should have frequent renal panels checks every 4 - 6 h and monitor strict input and output to maintain a net negative fluid balance in ards patients in patients without ards the volume status should be assessed to maintain in euvolemic statethe patients should be monitored for recovery of kidney function on daily basis and the rrt should be discontinued once the patient is non-oliguric euvolemic and improved ventilation requirements this should also be supported by improved laboratory findings without alarming electrolyte or acid-base imbalanceaki was associated with increased in-hospital mortality so the patient should be meticulously managed by providing hemodynamic support avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids nephrotoxins and contrast early institution of crrt will improve the outcomes proteinuria and hematuria were also associated with in-hospital mortality so close attention should be paid to urine analysis both in-patient and out-patient settingsthe experience from various published studies on patients infected with covid-19 infection showed that aki is associated with mortality shi et al analyzed 101 patients who died from covid-19 infection showed that 23 had aki and 11 of patient had underlying ckd bun and myoglogin levels were higher in patients who died within 3 days and median time from hospitalization to death is 4 days 37 cheng in his analysis showed that elevated baseline serum creatinine elevated bun peak serum creatinine  15 proteinuria hematuria aki stages 2 and 3 are all associated with mortality after adjusting for confounding factors 22the impact of covid-19 infection on ckd has not been reported the incidence of known ckd patients varied from 07-476 depending upon the series described 27 29 there was increased mortality in patients described in one study 29 the incidence of aki was higher in patients with established ckd 22the studies analyzed the kidney function in patients admitted with confirmed covid-19 infection revealed the incidence of proteinuria and hematuria 14 22 a significant number of patients had proteinuria on the day of admission which could be related to the cytotropic effects of the virus on the podocytes proteinuria may result from direct podocyte injury from an expression of ace2 16the patients who recovered from the covid-19 infection with proteinuria and hematuria need to be followed closely for the resolution the patients who have sustained aki during the infection need to be monitored for ckdthe ongoing outbreak of covid-19 has amassed great concern worldwide but its influence on transplant recipients is unknown previously experienced coronavirus outbreaks have taught us that transplant recipients can be easily affected by these infections 38 39 with this being said very little is known about the risk of the donor to receive transmission of the disease several factors concerning donor exposure like infectivity incubation period etc can play an important role although there are no strict guidelines about donor restrictions it would be advisable for potential donors to hold off on organ donation if suffering from a respiratory illness the american red cross and european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc recommend 28-day and 21-day period delay respectively for potential organ donors with a history of recent travel to high-risk areas or contact with a person with suspected or proven coivd-19 40 41 the ecdc recommends a 28-day delay after recovery from a confirmed infection michaels and colleagues recently well described possible risks associated with transplants in covid-19-positive recipients 42 andrea et al from italy described in their experience that in their institution they have been limiting liver transplantation to the most urgent cases for the residents in the epidemic area 43a more liberal allocation policy is used for patients outside epidemic areas however all recipients are screened to avoid transplantation in sars-cov-2-positive subjects the internal board consistently reviews and updates the transplant list every 2 weeks according to the new insights on covid-19 they continuously train their healthcare providers and screen them with nasopharyngeal swabs at frequent intervals providing timely information to patients and their caregivers to raise awareness and at the same time to avoid panic and confusion is important 43as per the review of the literature to the best of our knowledge only one case of covid-19 infection has been described in kidney transplant recipients of 12 years 44 the patient was successfully managed initially with the cessation of all immunosuppression he was given intravenous stress dose steroids to prevent adrenal insufficiency once the patient improved clinically immunosuppression was resumed gradually the overall clinical characteristics including the symptoms radiological findings on lung imaging and laboratory findings were similar to those of other non-transplanted adult patients with covid-19 pneumonia this being the only case reported so far it is difficult to say that it is not possible to see atypical findings or more severe presentations of covid-19 disease in transplant recipientshealthcare providers should be aware of that the experimental drugs like remdesivir and lopinavirritonavir could cause drug-drug interactions with calcineurin inhibitors 42 it is therefore recommended to use these drugs with extreme caution regarding the treatment of kidney transplant recipients with covid-19 infection there is not much information available to help guide therapy and immunosuppression regimens for now it would be recommended to use due diligence and tailor management and treatment options based on the patients clinical status duration of transplant and severity of illness as the pandemic progresses we now expect that we will have more information available for guidanceno vaccine has been developed against the sars-cov-2 virus to date the critical aspect of management is supportive care multiple treatments such as empiric antibiotics antiviral therapy and systemic corticosteroids have been used worldwide several investigative drugs have been studied drugs approved for other indications have been used and several clinical trials are underway all across the globeone of the most promising of these therapies is remdesivir it inhibits viral replication by premature termination of rna transcription and has shown activity against beta coronaviruses and in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 45 it has received emergency use authorization by the food and drug administration fda in the usa for use in patients hospitalized with covid-19 it is recommended for 5 days in patients who are not on mechanical ventilation or ecmo and recommended for 10 days in patients who are on mechanical ventilation or ecmo 46 it is not recommended in patients with lower gfr gfr  30 mlmin 47others drug that has gained more attention was chloroquine hydroxychloroquine either alone or in combination with azithromycin chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine both have in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 45 they are both used in several countries for treating covid-19 infection based on anecdotal data and in-vitro studies there was a news report from china where chloroquine increased viral clearance decreased disease progression and improved radiological findings 47 48 there was another clinical trial reported from france which is a non-randomized open-label trial of 36 patients compared to hydroxychloroquine or a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin versus standard of care in the control group the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in six patients resulted in superior viral clearance compared with hydroxychloroquine monotherapy 49 there was a recent study among 368 veterans which found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine but associated with more risks due to its side effect profile 50 these medications should be used with caution in patients with renal and hepatic impairment and they can cause qt prolongation in the electrocardiogramhydroxychloroquine use for pre and post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment for sars-cov-2 infection is currently under investigation several clinical trials are planned in the usa to test the usage of hydroxychloroquine for treatment and prophylaxis for covid-19 clinicians are using different doses of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis and treatmenta recent clinical trial in china did not show the efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir for the treatment of pneumonia for covid-19 patients but this trial was underpowered 30 who launched a global mega trial called solidarity of four most promising coronavirus treatments remdesivir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine ritonavirlopinavir ritonavirlopinavir and interferon beta 51when antiretroviral medications for coronavirus treatment are used like lopinavir and ritonavir dose adjustments to medications during crrt are not needed as they are 90 protein bound particular attention should be paid to the dosing of the drugsother drugs are interferon beta interferon alpha mefloquine favipiravir darunavir ribavirin umifenovir tocilizumab and type ii transmembrane serine protease tmspss2 inhibitors support to therapies using vitamin a b c d e thymosin alpha 1 thymopentin selenium zinc and pyrithione combination have been used for treatment against sars-cov-2 infection 47 52covid-19 infection is spreading rapidly and causing mortality daily worldwide unfortunately knowledge about the novel virus is limited and it causes a significant clinical threat to the general population and healthcare workers several countries have imposed strict regulations on the public to limit the spread of the virus many government agencies like cdc fda and hospitals public health systems are working every day in the usa to contain the spread of infectionstudies have shown that there is the involvement of kidneys with covid-19 infection and can be associated with high mortality health care providers should recognize this aspect early and appropriate management should be instituted as soon as possible the patients with underlying kidney problems and renal transplant patients are vulnerable to developing covid-19 infectionthere is limited understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease virulence of the virus at this moment so prevention is the critical aspect in the management several vaccines and promising treatments are undergoing clinical trials with the hope of finding a cure for this global crisis sooncoronaviruses are rna viruses which usually cause mild upper respiratory illnesses the emergence of sars severe acute respiratory syndrome mers middle east respiratory syndrome has focussed global attention on the clinical significance of cornavirusesthe current middle east respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus mers-cov was first isolated in june 2012 from the respiratory tract of a businessman in the bisha area of saudi arabia who subsequently died of pneumonia and renal failure1 as of 28 july 2013 mers-cov has caused 91 laboratory confirmed cases and 46 deaths representing a high case fatality rate of 502 the high case fatality rate is likely related to the pattern of the disease as we probably are seeing only the tip of the iceberg of critically ill and admitted patients the high fatality rate is likely to decline as milder clinical cases emerge similar to sars common symptoms in patients with mers-cov include fever cough shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms most patients have had pneumonia and the majority was reported to have multiple co-morbid conditions3 4
the rapid deployment of effective therapeutics is a high priority as there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine for mers-cov the clinical experience from sars suggests that a number of interventions including ribavirin with and without corticosteroids interferon alfa with corticosteroids ribavirin with lopinavir and ritonavir and convalescent plasma may improve the outcome in patients but the data are not conclusive5
the purpose of this review is first to summarize the effectiveness of these treatments in an attempt to identify a therapeutic approach that could help select the most appropriate therapeutic options for patients with mers-cov infectionswe systematically searched the literature databases pubmed science direct and the cochrane database for published studies we used the key words sars coronavirus in combination with treatment human studies randomized controlled trials rct prospective or retrospective cohort designs case-control designs or case series agents included were ribavirin interferon lopinavir and ritonavir lpvr and convalescent plasma we exclude corticosteroid studies as this was beyond the scope of this review and the management of severe pneumonia has been well covered in the who guideline6
data extracted from these publications include authors name publication year type of study level of evidence sample size interventions dose duration indication route and time of administration number of patients and efficacy and safety outcome of these interventions the outcomes of interest included mortality rate measures of morbidity and adverse effects the outcomes reported in the selected studies included death mechanical ventilation improvement of symptoms admission to the intensive care unit infectious complications successful discharge and adverse effectsthe clinical studies were all critically appraised aspects that were assessed included study design the possibility of bias in the selection of the control group and treatment allocation and whether the treatment regimen and reporting of outcomes were consistent the studies were tabulated and summarized in a narrative way and were grouped by the treatment strategy we categorized each article depending on which drug was used we tabulated results as type of study dose duration time of administration and indication of medication number of patients included in that study plus the final outcomesthe studies were scored using the us preventive services task force scoring system7 where level of evidenceloe i evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled triallevel ii-1 evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomizationlevel ii-2 evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies preferably from more than one center or research grouplevel ii-3 evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidencelevel iii opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience descriptive studies or reports of expert committees
we identified 54 studies about sars or coronavirus and we included 19 studies only we excluded 35 studies since 14 of them were in vitro studies 15 corticosteroid studies and 6 were non-therapeutic studies overall we analyzed 19 studies nine used ribavirin alone or with interferon table 1
8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 two used lopinavir and ritonavir table 2
17 18 six used convalescent plasma table 3
19 20 21 22 there was one study of interferon alpha table 4
23 and one study comparing interferon alpha versus ribavirin13 summaries of the different studies are presented in table 1 table 2 table 3 table 4there has been a lot of concern worldwide about the emergence of the mers-cov although infection control molecular diagnostics and international public health have improved considerably since the 2003 sars epidemic there are still no proven or licensed therapies for any coronavirus infection the high mortality associated with mers-cov led us to conduct this systematic review to summarize the available options for treatment for novel coronavirus infection based on previous reports of therapy of sars a related coronavirusthe most commonly used agent was the broad spectrum antiviral ribavirin there were seven reports of the use of ribavirin in sars patients although only four reported control groups the mortality benefit was inconsistent with mortality rates of between 5 and 4288 9 10 11 12 13 14 two studies showed improvements of symptoms in 714-80 of patients and icu admission rates of 13-208 9 the major problem with ribavirin was the significant incidence of adverse events especially hemolysis which was reported in 68510
the timing of the start of antiviral agents is important in most virus infections one study compared oseltamivir versus ribavirin and showed no obvious response to ribavirin however the treatment were started after 10-14 days of symptoms which might have led to the poorer outcomes11
there was only one randomized controlled trial this compared ribavirin versus interferon-1 and showed no advantage of ribavirin over interferon in patients with sars13 in addition there were observational studies comparing interferon-1 with untreated controls23 interferon led to improvements in clinical and laboratory parameters compared with control patients23 however there was no standard regime used and adverse events were not well documentedthe addition of lopinavirritonavir to ribavirin regimen was associated with improved clinical outcome and reduces the death rate comparing to ribavirin regimen alone in observational studies17 18 these studies are detailed in table 2few studies addressed the effect of convalescent plasma19 20 21 22 these studies were mainly case reports which limit the generalizability of their findings in three studies of sars patients patients in the plasma group had a shorter hospital stay 583 -734 versus 156- 19 p  000121 22 and lower mortality than the comparator group 0- 125 versus 17 23819 21 22
intriguingly an in vitro study showed that convalescent plasma from sars patients might contain cross-reactive antibodies against other beta-coronavirus including mers-cov24 of 28 sera 7 25 had antibodies anti-mers-cov neutralizing antibodies at low titers24 convalescent sera was recommended in a recent study by the international severe acute respiratory and emerging infection consortium isaric25 cross- reactive antibodies may be present in convalescent plasma from sars patients against other beta-coronavirus and may be associated with a better outcome reduced mortality and shorter hospital stay19 20 21 22 there are considerable technical hurdles to overcome before convalescent sera can be widely recommended as a therapeutic agent in the modern era currently there is a need to establish a serology test to diagnose patients with mild disease and thus identify those patients as possible donors of convalescent serawe conclude that the use of ribavirin may improve the outcome and reduce mortality as shown in a number of studies one of the reasons for the failure of ribavirin in some reports may have been the timing for the use of ribavirin after 6-14 days of symptom11 14 16 compared to studies which showed benefits when ribavirin was started within 48 hours of hospitalization or after diagnosis of sars was established8 9 12 13the major limitation of ribavarin is its significant toxicity at the doses used to treat patients with sars although the addition of lopinavirritonavir to ribavirin appeared to have a better outcome in patients with sars17 18 there are reports that lopinavirritonavir is not active in vitro against the mers-cov25 other in vitro studies have failed to yield potent therapeutic agents despite a search including dpp4 inhibitors26
among the limitations of this review are the heterogeneity of the reviewed studies in terms of the wide range of treatment dosages frequency and route of administration duration and timing of administration the reported treatment effects should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of randomized controlled trialsalso while we have drawn on the sars literature and sars is a closely related virus there are clearly differences between sars and the mers-cov and the data might not be able to be directly extrapolated to mers-cov infected patients the use of the discussed agents would require monitoring hematological and biochemical parameters during treatment to detect and prevent adverse effects associated with therapy possible dosages of discussed agents especially with unavailability of intravenous ribavarin are listed in table 5
 the table also includes the possible dosage of pegelated interferon- pegifn that is commonly used in the treatment of hepatitis c virus infection pegifn- was 50-100 times more effective in vitro for mers-cov than sars-cov25 the long half-life of pegifn- and the associated adverse effects calls for extra attention for the use of shorter-acting interferon25 the use of interferon therapy with ribavirin is not recommended in patients with hepatitis c virus infection and renal dysfunction clcr 50 mlminutewith the emergence of mers-cov and the lack of high quality clinical evidence to support recommendations for the use of available therapeutic options there is a clear need for developing protocols to be used in randomized-controlled trials in order to determine the most effective therapies for this novel emerging pathogenin wuhan city the capital of hubei in december 2019 in china an outbreak representing in pneumonia of unidentified origin had occurred in 7 january 2020 scientists of china could isolate a new strain of coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 from the affected patients1 that causes the disease coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as stated by who in february 20202although the outbreak mostly have started from a zoonotic transmission in a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals it soon became obvious that efficient person-to-person transmission was also possible3 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 disease appears to be wide ranging from asymptomatic infection mild upper respiratory tract illness severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure or death the evaluation of risk factors for the severity of the disease and possibility of death is a very important issue for prediction of the possible outcomea study conducted by zhou et al5 confirmed that increased age of patients with covid-19 was associated with death the decrease in t-cell and b-cell functions depending on age and the additional production of type 2 cytokines could lead to a lack in control of viral replication and load and more exacerbation in proinflammatory responses that may lead to increase the severity of the disease and poor outcome6 petrilli et al7 described characteristics of 4103 patients in new york city with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 disease 1999 of them needed hospital admission while 650 of them needed icu respiratory support were discharged to hospital andor died they found that older age was one of the most important predictors of hospitalization and a vital predictor of severe outcomesnasiri et al8 showed that sex affected the mortality rate where the mortality of females with covid-19 was significantly lower than males odds ratio 34 95 ci 1291 p value  001 on the other hand there was not any significant difference between male and female regarding icu admissions earlier coronavirus epidemics of sars and mers resulted in a similar form of higher mortality in males than females karlberg et al9 also showed that the difference in mortality rates according to sex distribution of the affected cases was higher in younger males 044 years old rr2 compared to those of age group 4574years old rr-145 also another study conducted by alghamdi et al10 showed that regarding mers the number of diseases in males was double that of females 52 vs 23patients with coronary heart disease have also been found to have severe acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in respiratory viral infections including influenza11 a study conducted by zhou et al showed that increasing level of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin ictni during hospitalization was presented in more than half of cases who died with covid-195li et al12 reported the clinical characteristics of 25 cases died with covid-19 the clinical profile of these patients showed that the most important risk factors for death in these patients represented in age and underlying diseases regarding the underlying diseases associated with death the most recorded one was chronic hypertension then diabetes mellitus chronic cardiac diseases cerebral infarction kidney disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease malignant tumors and acute pancreatitis li et al12 demonstrated that respiratory failure was the leading cause of death in all the patients which confirmed that lungs of the patients are the most important target organ of sars-cov-2 multiple organ failure could be observed in those patients the heart came after the lung as the most common damaged organ then the kidney and the liver the results of that study verified that the death of the patients with covid-19 may be to a large extent related to impaired cardiopulmonary function all the patients albumin levels 80 and 68 of patients rbc and hb levels were decreased which indicates that malnutrition is one of the causes of severe covid-19measures of inflammation process were found to be much more important than co-morbidities and demographic characteristics in the hospitalized patients with covid-197 exaggerated inflammatory response were well defined as severe sepsis13 even though the extent of inflammation caused by covid-19 is similar to or different than that caused by sepsis is unknown some case reports recommend that patients with critical covid-19 disease are showing complications from hypercoagulability5 as pulmonary emboli14 and microscopic thrombi15 so it is notable that obesity was the chronic condition that had the strongest association with critical illness with odds ratio higher than any other cardiovascular or pulmonary disease because obesity is recognized to be a pro-inflammatory condition1617guan et al18 observed that among patients with covid-19 the circulatory and endocrine co-morbidities were common patients with one or more co-morbidities were associated with worse clinical outcomes of the 1590 cases 399 251 had at least one co-morbidity the prevalence of specific co-morbidities was hypertension 269 169 other cardiovascular diseases 537 diabetes 130 82 cerebrovascular diseases 30 19 hepatitis b infections 28 18 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 24 15 chronic kidney diseases 21 13 malignancy 18 11 and immunodeficiency 3 02 at least single co-morbidity was commonly seen in severe cases than in non-severe cases 328 vs 103in hospitalized covid-19 patients the prevalence of kidney impairment abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction was high after adjustment for confounders kidney impairment was related to higher risk of in-hospital mortality so clinicians should increase their attention to kidney impairment in hospitalized covid-19 patients early discovery and effective intervention of kidney impairment can help to reduce mortality of covid-19 patients in clinical practice19 petrilliet al7 reported particularly strong association of chronic kidney disease with the risk of hospitalization also they declared the importance of hypoxia even with supplemental oxygen in distinguishing among patients who will develop critical illness and those who will notblood picture of patients with covid-19 characterized by normal or low count of wbcs and decreased level of lymphocytes20 increased levels of wbcs and neutrophils were found in 68 and 72 of patients similarly elevation of procalcitonin pct levels were observed in 905 of patients12d-dimers are fragments produced when plasmin cleaves fibrin to break down clots they are routinely used to exclude the diagnosis of thrombosis however plasma d-dimer increases by any pathologic or non-pathologic process that increases fibrin production or breakdown21 a study conducted by zhou et al5 found d-dimer more than 1 gml is associated with mortality of covid-19 high levels of d-dimer have been associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis or infection identified in the emergency department22 petrilli et al7 reported striking findings regarding the predictive value of inflammatory markers to distinguish future critical from non-critical illness early elevation in d-dimer level had the strongest association with prolonged hospitalization and the need for mechanical ventilation or death7 many studies have reported that d-dimer levels are associated with severity and clinical outcome of community-acquired pneumonia23 the other mechanisms include the pro-inflammatory cytokine responses that considered one of the mediators of atherosclerosis disease that contribute to plaque rupture by the local inflammation induce procoagulant factors and haemodynamic changes which trigger to thrombosis formation and ischemic diseases24also angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace 2 that considered the receptor for sars-cov-2 is expressed on vascular endothelial cells and myocytes25 therefore there is at least theoretical possibility of direct affection of the heart by the virusc-reactive protein is a useful marker and gauge of inflammation it plays an important role in host defense against invading pathogens as well as in inflammation26 early rise in the c-reactive protein also had the strongest association with mechanical ventilation or mortality7serum amyloid a saa is a plasma protein that transports lipids during inflammation27 li et al12 showed that the increased levels of saa and crp before death in 85 and 100 of patients suggestive of that there is a serious inflammatory cascade in patients having covid-19 in intend to monitor biochemical indicators which are important in monitoring the severity of the disease and its progress li et al12 consulted the results of laboratory test for all the dead patients among which 16patients had repeated measurements the saa maintained a high level in all the patients this result indicated that raised saa levels are closely related to the poor prognosis of patients the first test level of neutrophils was 938 crp 846 pct 100 ctni 889 d-dimer 916 and lactate dehydrogenase ldh 100 were increased than the last test but the levels of lymphocytes were decreased 875 suggesting that the increasing of neutrophils crp d-dimer pct ctni and ldh levels can be used as markers of disease severity and progress similarly the decline of lymphocytes countsnasiri et al8 identified common laboratory findings associated with a poor outcome including lymphopenia 501 raised c-reactive protein 72 and increased levels of ldh 41 also thrombocytopenia was found in 111 of the cases the studies performed by huang et al4 and lippi et al28 have suggested that thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia in patients with covid-19 are associated with prolonged hospitalization and worse outcomes patients with sars were indicated to have a higher percentage of lymphopenia 6890 and thrombocytopenia 2045 than those of covid-1929 thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia have been previously associated with a greater risk of mortality in sars and influenza3031liver changes were one of the most common finding in the covid-19 infected subjects 133 however a significant ast rising was found in number of subjects 197 also level of alt 146 in some previous viral infections including sars changes and impaired liver function have been noticed as collateral damage perhaps caused by direct damaging of the hepatic tissue by the pathogen32 although this could be the same situation with covid19 an iatrogenic trauma because of medications as the used lopinavir in covid-19 therapy can play a rolethe method and level of the virus replication and its duration of life are important factors in evaluating the root of transmission and guiding protocols for patients protection and isolation as coronavirus rna detection is more sensitive than the isolation of the virus itself most studies gave care to use qualitative or quantitative viral rna tests as a possible marker for infectious coronavirus about sars-cov the viral rna was obtained from the respiratory specimens from about third of patients affected by the virus for at least 4 weeks from the onset of the disease33 the same regarding mers-cov rna where the duration of viral detection in the lower respiratory specimens continued as long as 3 weeks34a study conducted by zhou et al5 found that duration of sars-cov-2 rna in survivors could reach for a median of 20 days even though it could still till death in non-survivors this result has an important role in the decision of patients isolation and guidelines regarding the length of treatment protocols usually in serious influenza virus infection continued viral replication was associated with worse outcome that may be fatal also the delay in starting with suitable antiviral treatment had an important effect on viral replication and detection35in patients with covid-19 the serum level of ferritin was significantly elevated in non-survivors compared with survivors during the clinical stages of the disease and raised with case deterioration5 shoenfeldreported that the h-chain of the ferritin had a role in activating macrophages to raise the secretion of inflammatory cytokines so understanding of the pathogenesis of the hyperferritinemic syndrome including the infection with covid-19 became obvious36many studies noted chest x-ray and ct abnormalities in their study populations including unilateral pneumonia38 bilateral pneumonia453739 bilateral infiltrates40 and ground glass opacities537394142 cao et al found a mortality rate of 17102 patients they found that ground-glass opacity was associated with mortality present in 412 of cases who died versus 129 of those who lived43 summary of the risk factors of critical illness and mortality predictors in covid-19 were presented in figure 1covid-19 is an emerging disease all over the world and spreading at an unpredicted rate resulting in significant influences on global economies and public health the present review assessed the risk factors related to the outcomes of sars-cov-2 infections which were included old age male gender and obesity associated co-morbidities in the form of cardiovascular diseases diabetes mellitus chronic kidney disease liver disease cerebrovascular diseases and copd laboratory parameters associated with critical covid-19 disease were lymphopenia thrombocytopenia leucocytosis increased neutrophils increased c reactive protein and ferritin increased d dimer raised alt andor ast decreased albumin increased cardiac troponin and elevated ldh finally ground-glass opacities when present in the ct chest were considered as the most important imaging indicator for covid-19 severitysevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 is the virus responsible for the novel coronavirus disease covid19 and has led to a global pandemic with 29 million confirmed cases including over 964000 confirmed cases and 54840 deaths in the united states

 we obtained the countylevel data on covid19 confirmed cases and deaths from the johns hopkins 2019 novel coronavirus data repository httpsgithubcomcssegisanddatacovid-19 which imports the gadph daily status report file for each county allowing for investigators to examine timeseries ie daybyday cumulative cases of cases and deaths we linked the countylevel covid19 data with the countylevel data on sociodemographic access to healthcare and hospital critical care infrastructure factors derived from the 2014 county health rankings 2014 american community survey 2010 census and 20172019 centers for medicare  medicaid services hospital reports this study was considered exempt by institutional review board review because we used publicly available deidentified secondary datawe calculated 3 measures of disease morbidity at the county level 1 the biweekly confirmed case incidence rate per 100000 population 2 overall prevalence of confirmed cases per 100000 population and 3 mortality rate per 100000 population among confirmed cases we compared the countylevel characteristics of the population such as demographic factors by mortality rate quintiles using kruskalwallis tests in secondary analysis we examined countylevel differences in incidence and mortality rates comparing 1 counties with 50 nonhispanic black residents versus those with 50 nhblack residents and 2 counties with 50 male residents versus those with 50 male residents these results are presented within figures s1 and s2 we performed all statistical analysis using sas version 94 and executed all mapping using arcgis

analysis is limited by several factors first as with all early surveillance studies of covid19 our analysis suffers from underreporting of all morbidity values as asymptomatic or slightly symptomatic cases may not be tested and subsequently diagnosed therefore our analysis is based on confirmed covid19 cases only measures of confirmed prevalence incidence and mortality rates may be an underestimate of the true burden of disease as most covid19 patients will recover before being tested and thus may not be included in numerator if disease is not severe enough to warrant testing a statewide surveillance study which includes mandatory and available testing for all georgia residents is the most precise method to estimate the true incidence of cases nevertheless all novel respiratory virus infections including covid19 are diseases that need to be immediately notifiable to the georgia department of public health by law in addition to geography mortality is likely to be a function of many factors arising from the accumulation of specific highrisk populations in various locations for example places with large elderly populations or a high prevalence of preexisting respiratory cardiovascular or immunocompromised conditions would have even higher casefatality rates our observed increases of countylevel incidence rates are both a function of true incidence and more widespread testing we reported on the hospital critical care infrastructure by county using the number of icu beds and primary care physicians as proxies we were unable to account for the number of available ventilator supplies additionally hospital critical care infrastructure is not static and hospitals may have the capacity to increase staffing and icu bed space during the covid19 pandemic however urban centers may be more equipped to increase their critical care capacity than rural centers a further limitation is that we lacked data on transfers of critically ill patients from rural areas to facilities in large urban areasto date and to our knowledge this is one of the first studies to describe the epidemiology of covid19 in the state of georgia with geographic trends and elucidating possible countylevel differences that are correlated with higher mortality rates as expected we observed that metropolitan atlanta had the overall highest number of confirmed cases in georgia however incidence growth rates show that the southwestern rural portion of georgia surrounding the city of albany had the highest biweekly increases in incidence rates further the counties of randolph dougherty terrell early and lee all experienced prs for covid19 well above 1000 per 100000 population among counties with 10 cases mortality rates were highest in the rural counties of randolph 2332 per 100000 terrell 1825 per 100000 early 1363 per 100000 and dougherty 1142 per 100000 all of which are associated with having very limited health care resources including relatively few intensive care unit beds and active primary care physicians when compared with counties with lower proportions 50 of nhblack residents and male residents those counties with a higher proportion of nonhispanic black residents and male residents were associated with higher incidence and mortality of covid19 through april 24 2020while georgia has an estimated 8196 hospital beds available for critically ill patients we observed that mortality rates were higher in counties with low to no icu beds available a shortage of icu beds is important because prior reports have shown that the vast majority of covid19 patients admitted to the icu are critical and only 20 of those who were critical has survived mostly due to icu care
5
 it is likely that mortality rates are higher in rural georgia communities due to delays in treatment and care because of the need to transport rural patients to other centers with available icu beds andor ventilators further the southwest georgia counties identified as hot spots for covid19 mortality and prevalence have been previously identified as hot spots for mortality of other diseases including sepsis and stroke indicating that these communities may be experiencing prolonged disparities in health outcomes attributed to reduced healthcare services preventive care and social inequities

 our findings showing higher rates of incidence and mortality among counties with higher percentage of nhblack residents and males indicate that racial and gender disparities may play a role in covid19 and recent evidence among the first 393 covid19 patients in new york city are consistent with this finding

 in order to mitigate the burden and excess deaths due to covid19 varying stakeholders including policymakers politicians medical professionals and community leaders will need to strategize and appropriately allocate resources to these underresourced areasin georgia the peak of the covid19 pandemic was estimated to arrive in late april 2020 the state and local governments should strongly support rural counties and the southwestern georgia area by supplying increased icu beds ventilators and emergency medical staff while urban centers in georgia account for the bulk of covid19 cases the high mortality rates and low critical care capacity in rural georgia is becoming a highly detrimental factor in fighting this pandemic this is especially concerning given hospital critical care

give final approval of this work take public responsibility for the content and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the workthe novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 first emerged in december 2019 in wuhan china and rapidly grew into a large-scale global pandemic1 tracking the severity and impact of covid-19 is at the time of writing a critical need hampered by testing issues and reporting lags for key epidemiological indicatorsmany countries including the us were caught off-guard by the speed with which covid-19 spread from china without adequate capacity to test for the sars-cov-2 virus causing covid-19 for much of february and march 2020 available laboratory-confirmed cases captured only an estimated 1015 of all infections2 although most countries have adopted the strategy to preferentially test severe cases estimating the number of severe infections and deaths caused by covid-19 will be a challenge typically a large proportion of deaths caused by infectious diseases are not attributed to a specific pathogen with the limited availability of testing for the novel coronavirus and imperfect sensitivity of the tests3 4 there have undoubtedly been a number of deaths caused by the virus that are not counted in official tallies even in situations of ample testing deaths from viral pathogens including sars-cov-2 can occur indirectly via secondary bacterial infections or exacerbation of chronic conditions further in the midst of a large outbreak there is an unavoidable delay in compilation of death certificates and ascertainment of cause of deaths which contributes to uncertainty about severity and burden finally in the us there has been a high degree of variability in public health resources laboratory testing and recognition of the outbreak at the state level which could lead to significant under-estimation of the true impact of the outbreak in certain geographiesto estimate the burden of death due to novel respiratory pathogens previous studies have compared the observed incidence of influenza-related deaths ascribed to pneumonia and influenza pi with the baseline incidence of pi that would be expected at that time of year5 6 these excess deaths provide an estimate of pathogen-specific burden this approach was used in the early months of the 2009 influenza ah1n1-pdm pandemic it was estimated that just 1 in 7 pandemic-related deaths was captured by laboratory testing in 2009 in the us7 8in this study we estimated the increase in pi deaths across the united states in each week in excess of a seasonal baseline to capture the direct and indirect mortality burden of covid-19 we compare these estimates of excess deaths to the reported numbers of deaths due to covid-19 in different states and evaluate the trajectories of these increases in relation to the volume of testing and to indicators of covid-19 morbidity these analyses provide insights into the burden of covid-19 in the early months of the outbreak in the united states and serve as a surveillance platform that can be updated as new data accruedata on deaths due to pneumonia and influenza pi icd-10 codes j09-j18 and all-causes by state and week were obtained from the national center for health statistics nchs mortality surveillance system9 here we analyze spikes in pi mortality rather than straight pneumonia to be more comprehensive as influenza-coded deaths do not necessarily require laboratory confirmation of influenza infection there is overlap of symptoms between influenza and covid-19 and pi mortality has been used in us to monitor the severity of influenza and other respiratory pathogens since the 1918 pandemic in addition analysis of spikes in all-cause mortality provides a full picture of the direct and indirect burden of covid-19the nchs mortality data are available with a 2-week lag and are partially complete for the most recent weeks the pi mortality data provide the provisional number of deaths due to pneumonia or influenza ie deaths with a code of pneumonia or influenza anywhere in the death certificate and should be adjusted by the total number of deaths reported in real time each week connecticut north carolina and west virginia were missing mortality data for recent months and were therefore excluded from the analysesthe pi grouping will include individuals who had a listed cause of death as covid-19 along with a pi code as well as people who did not have covid-19 listed as a cause of death it does not capture people who had covid-19 listed as a cause of death but did not have pi recorded among the causeswe also compiled data on covid-19-related morbidity to gauge the timing and intensity of the pandemic in different locations influenza-like illness ili is a longstanding indicator of morbidity from acute respiratory pathogens including sars-cov-2 weekly state-level ili data were obtained from the cdcs ilinet system10 which aggregates data from a network of outpatient providers to adjust for activity of non sars-cov-2 respiratory pathogens we used state-level data on laboratory-confirmed influenza activity from the cdcs national respiratory and enteric virus surveillance system nrevss11 this dataset captures the number of tests performed for influenza and the number that were positive by week and state the ili data provide the percent of visits to participating outpatient providers that were for ili ilinet and nrevss data are available with a 1-week lagthe ili nrevss and mortality datasets were accessed through the cdcs fluview portal using the cdcfluview package in r data from nchs ilinet and nrevss were obtained for the weeks ending january 5 2013 through march 28 2020to compare our burden estimates with official covid-19 tallies we compiled weekly reports of laboratory-confirmed deaths due to covid-19 in each state from several sources including the covid tracking project12 and nchs13 state-specific testing information was obtained was the covid tracking project12the 9 largest states by population and washington state were analyzed individually the remaining states for which we had data were grouped into the corresponding health regions defined by the us department of health and human services hhs regions we fit poisson regression models to the weekly state-level counts of reported deaths due to pi from january 5 2015 to february 8 2020 see supplement for details the baseline was then projected forward until march 28 2020 we adjusted for seasonality using harmonic variables and included year-to-year baseline variation influenza activity was controlled for by adjusting for the percent of tests that were positive for influenza in the previous week the 1-week lag between the testing data and the mortality data accounts for the delay influenza testing and death the number of all-cause deaths was used as a denominator poisson 95 prediction intervals were estimated by sampling from the uncertainty distributions for the estimated model parameters14to calculate the number of covid-19 related excess deaths we subtracted the expected number of deaths in each week from the observed number of deaths for the period february 9 2020 to march 28 2020 because reporting of deaths for recent weeks is incomplete nchs calculates a completeness score between 0 and 1 based on the number of death reports that have been received from a state and the number expected from that state based on previous years the excess deaths were divided by the completeness score for each week to get an estimate for excess cases adjusted for reporting delaysto evaluate the sensitivity of the estimates of excess mortality to the adjustment for influenza activity we refit the regression excluding the influenza covariate we also fit a model with the same structure to all-cause mortality without a denominator to get a measurement of outpatient visits related to covid-19 the same model was fit to data on influenza-like illnessthe analyses were run using r v 361 all analysis scripts and archives of the data are available from httpsgithubcomweinbergerlabexcesspicovidmany states experienced a notable increase in the proportion of total deaths due to pi starting in mid-march through march 28 compared to what would be expected based on the time of year and influenza activity figure 1 figure 2 expressed as the relative increase above the baseline these increases were particularly notable in new jersey washington new york illinois and georgia the increase in new york was largely driven by spikes in new york city figure s1in some states such as florida and georgia the increase in deaths due to pi preceded the widespread adoption of testing for the novel coronavirus by several weeks figure 3 as a result the increase in pi preceded the first reported covid-19 deaths and the excess pi was greater than the number of reported covid-19 deaths each week in contrast in washington state there was concordance between reported covid-19 deaths excess pi deaths and the increase in testingthe timing of the epidemic varied across states some states and regions that have not yet seen large increases in deaths are earlier in the epidemic though there is some indication of sharp increases in outpatient visits for ili eg ohio texas figure 4 the increase in pi mortality typically lags behind the increase in ili visits so increases in excess pi deaths might be expected in coming weeksthe degree of under-reporting in some states can be seen when comparing the estimated excess deaths due to pi with the number of reported covid-19 cases through march 28 table 1 figure s4 for instance california had 101 reported deaths due to covid-19 and 399 286 512 excess pi deaths likewise texas had 176 86 266 excess pi deaths and 27 reported deaths through march 28 table 1 in contrast for new york and washington there was agreement between the reported covid-19 deaths and the excess pi deaths figure 3 figure s1 in michigan the number of excess pi deaths was notably lower than the number of reported covid-19 deaths potentially reflecting reporting delays in the pi data overall in the states we evaluated for the period from february 9 to march 28 2020 there were 3101 2769 3433 excess pi deaths compared with 1958 reported deaths due to covid-19 from the covid tracking project there were 2537 deaths due to covid-19 provisionally reported by nchs for the entire us during this perioddeaths due to pi represent just a fraction of all deaths caused by covid-19 to highlight this we compared increases in deaths due to any cause in new york and new jersey with increases in deaths due to pi and reported deaths due to covid-19 figure s2 there were 23 times as many excess all-cause deaths as reported covid-19 deaths or excess pi deaths in new york city this discrepancy was even more stark with 34 times as many excess all-cause deaths as pi deaths figure s3 the observation that excess pi deaths underestimate the burden of covid-19 is born out in the nchs data where fewer than half of the deaths recorded as being due to covid-19 had pneumonia listed as a cause of death13 the proportion of covid-19-coded deaths with a pneumonia diagnosis itself varies considerably by state table s2in sensitivity analyses we refit the seasonal baseline but did not adjust for influenza activity table s3 and we calculated excess pi mortality without using a correction factor for incomplete reporting table s4 these changes influence the specific estimates for some of the states with smaller increases but do not affect the overall patternmortality data are released weekly and regularly-updated analyses are available at httpsweinbergerlabgithubioexcesspicovidexcess pi mortality has been used as a method for tracking influenza mortality for more than a century here we used a similar strategy to capture covid-19 deaths that had not been attributed specifically to the pandemic coronavirus monitoring trends in broad mortality outcomes like pi or all-causes provides a window into the magnitude of the mortality burden missed in official tallies of covid-19 deaths given the lack of adequate testing and geographical variability in testing intensity this type of monitoring provides key information on the severity of the epidemic in different geographic regions it also provides some indication of the degree to which viral testing is missing deaths associated with covid-19 directly or indirectly our findings suggest that the degree to which deaths due to covid-19 are being correctly attributed to sars-cov-2 varies by state some states such as florida and pennsylvania might have missed deaths early on and might be undercounting deaths by a substantial degree currently other states like washington have an accurate estimate of the mortality burden of the pandemic virus due to intense testing and in states that have been hit hard by the pandemic virus such as new jersey or new york the total excess mortality burden is 23 times that ascribed to covid-19 in official statistics together these findings demonstrate that estimates of the death toll of covid-19 based on excess pi and all-cause mortality will be more reliable than those relying only on reported deaths particularly in places that lack widespread testinglocal epidemics of covid-19 started at different times across the us states with early epidemics like new york and new jersey are now reporting large increases in both pi and all-cause mortality other states that had later epidemic onsets are just now entering the period of rapid growth of deaths because some states instituted social distancing measures at an earlier phase of the epidemic they might benefit more from reducing the intensity of the peak in deathssyndromic endpoints such as deaths due to pi outpatient visits for ili and emergency department visits for fever can provide a crude but informative measure of the progression of the outbreak15 these measures themselves can be biased by changes in health seeking behavior and how conditions are recorded however in the absence of widespread and systematic testing for covid-19 they provide a useful measure of epidemic progression and the effect of interventionsto get a complete picture of the burden of the burden of deaths due to covid-19 it will be necessary to evaluate spikes in all-cause mortality as we have done for new york and new jersey here however it is difficult to do such analyses reliably in real time with provisional death statistics because the data are incomplete for recent weeks and the delays in reporting can only be determined retrospectively our analyses here suggest that excess pi deaths represent a fraction of all of the deaths related to covid-19 2550 based on preliminary data so the pi excess mortality estimates we present here represent a lower bound of the burdenthere is often a lag in the reporting of death statistics nchs reports data from 2 weeks prior but these provisional data are typically still incomplete in our main analysis we addressed this by adjusting deaths due to pi with all-cause deaths with the assumption that reporting delays for pi are similar to reporting delays for other causes of death when calculating excess deaths we attempted to adjust for reporting delays by using the nchs estimate of data completeness as a multiplier however this estimate of data completeness is itself based on numbers of deaths during previous years and might not be reliable during the pandemic period if anything we would expect that longer reporting lags would tend to underestimate the excess mortality burden of covid-19 in real-time analyses it is estimated that the covid-19 epidemic in europe predates that in the us by a few weeks several european countries have experienced a high death toll particularly italy and spain consolidated excess mortality estimates are not yet available in these countries although real-time all-cause mortality data from the euromomo project httpswwweuromomoeu offers a glimpse of the total burden of the epidemic many european countries have experienced sharp increases in all-cause deaths in recent weeks primarily in individuals 65 yrs and over and also in 1564 yrsin conclusion monitoring syndromic causes of death can provide crucial additional information on the severity and progression of the covid-19 pandemic estimates of excess deaths due to pi and all-causes will be less biased by variations in viral testing but reporting lags have to be properly accounted for together with information on official tallies of covid-19 deaths monitoring excess mortality provides a key tool in evaluating the effects of an ongoing pandemica questionnaire on how to prevent and control covid-19 was distributed to relevant experts and their advice was collected for high frequency word analysis and content analysisthe frequency of words in a particular field usually reflects its hotspots and main opinions with regard to the feedback from the professionals and experts high frequency word analysis was conducted using the software from the website of tuyue httpwwwpicdatacnpicdataboth experts feedbacks and relevant information about chinas countermeasures collected from official websites were analyzed and summarized in addition the study also sorted out the experience and lessons accumulated in china during the fighting with the novel coronavirusall data about the new and cumulative cases of china and the global were crawled from toutiao of china httpwwwtoutiaocom it is an open database of covid-19 collected from national and provincial health and family planning commission the data were performed by spss 24 via descriptive-analytical statisticsrestricted traffic and cities on january 14 2020 the local government of wuhan implemented the control of personnel departure and set up temperature detection points and investigation points at airports railway stations coach stations and passenger terminals 4 on january 22 hubei province launched a secondary public health emergency alert wuhan closed the city on january 23 5 and from january 23 to january 29 31 provinces in china successively initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies 6 many regions practiced closed-off management then from march 4 21 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities nationwide lowered their emergency response levels 7closed zone management closed management was implemented in urban communities or rural villages non-community or non-village residents or vehicles were not allowed to enter the communities or villages even the local residents needed to have their temperature measured when they were allowed in and out of the area in the community or village areas the epidemic prevention and control groups were established these could be divided into many subgroups with different functions such as propaganda group environment group key personnel prevention and control group personal in and out control group material support group others in order to complete the epidemic prevention and control work in an all-encompassing manner 8personal management from february 16 citizens in wuhan were required to scan and enter identifying information when they assessed any open public places 9 on march 5 2020 the reference architecture and technical guide of epidemic prevention access code was issued according to this regulation chinese citizens had to report their health status online and had their general health status captured by two-dimensional codes the code could also work as an electronic voucher for citizens to go in and out of the local places the health assessment based on two-dimensional codes was universal in the whole city even the whole country 10staff support on january 23 shanghai and guangdong sent the first medical teams to wuhan 11 on january 28 6097 people across 52 medical teams nationwide went to support hubei 12 as of march 8 a total of 346 medical teams and 42 600 medical staff arrived in hubei fighting the virus alongside with local medical staff 13funding support on january 26 national development and reform commission urgently issued 300 million yuan rmb to support hubei from the central budget and 1121 billion yuan was issued from national finances at all levels in subsidies for disease prevention and control 14 as of march 4 11048 billion yuan had been arranged from the governments finances at all levels for prevention and control 15facility construction wuhan was the city with the worst epidemic situation and it has become the key area for the epidemic prevention and control in order to fight covid-19 wuhan set up vulcan mountain and thor mountain hospitals which only took about 10 days to finish to treat severe patients 16 in addition 11 cabin hospitals were built for mild patients and a dozen of hotels and schools were recruited to isolate mild patients and close contacts 17 the policy for the patients as well as the close contacts was changed from self-isolation at home at the beginning to all-isolation at hospital or hotel at the endrecognition of novel coronavirus the understanding of novel coronavirus was a gradually developing process on december 8 2019 wuhan municipal health commission notified the first confirmed case that showed symptoms on that same day on january 2 2020 the whole genome sequence of novel coronavirus was obtained by the wuhan institute of virology chinese academy of sciences 18 at a press conference of the national health commission of the peoples republic of china on january 20 professor zhong nanshan confirmed that the novel coronavirus was transmitted from person to person 19detection reagents and treatment plan in terms of detection reagents on january 4 chinas centre for disease control developed a specific pcr detection reagent on january 11 chinas centre for disease control provided pcr detection reagents to wuhan hospitals on january 26 the national medical products administration approved 4 novel coronavirus detection products from 4 chinese companies 20 regarding the diagnosis and treatment plan on january 15 the national health commission of china issued the first trail edition of diagnosis and treatment plan for covid-19 by february 19 the versions were constantly updated the seventh versions of the diagnosis and treatment plan had been issued 21 the diagnostic criteria changed from the diagnosis based on the results of the novel coronavirus pcr test to the diagnosis based on clinical ct resultsdrug research and development on january 28 the research and development of novel coronavirus mrna vaccine was officially initiated 22 on february 5 the clinical trials of remdesivir began 23 on february 21 the ministry of science and technology stated that the vaccine should be submitted for clinical trials as soon as late april 24 on march 6 chloroquine phosphate became a clinical treatment medication 25 in addition some chinese traditional medicines have been demonstrated to be effective 26facing the severe situation brought by covid-19 chinas government has adopted a series of strict prevention and control countermeasures which have effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic in china and have gained time for the prevention and control of covid-19 for the other countries according to the daily outbreak data released by the national health commission of china from the national point of view the mortality rate of patients has been declining and the proportion of patients with severe illness has been decreasing the trend of cumulative cases in china is shown in figure 1 and the trend of new cases in china is shown in figure 2figure 1 and figure 2 shows the changes in relevant national data since the outbreak of covid-19 the numbers of newly diagnosed patients suspected patients as well as newly added deaths have risen for a period of time and are currently in a declining phase current data demonstrates that chinas countermeasures are effectively slowing down the spread of covid-19 it may give a piece of evidence or experience for global covid-19 prevention and control in the near futureas of march 29 china has accumulated 82 419 confirmed diagnoses 3506 existing confirmed diagnoses 3306 deaths and 75 600 cured patients 27 based on the current data chinas cure rate is 9173 and the mortality rate is 401 it is worth noting that there were 693 cases that were imported from overseas table 1 shows the wuhan hubei national and global cumulative number and mortality rate the data demonstrates that the mortality rate could obviously drop down with sufficient medical resource for example the mortality rate in the rest of china excluding hubei is much lower that other places it is quite clear that the overall case-fatality rate is based on the denominator that includes those who were positively tested and not all those infected with symptomsaccording to investigations more than 3000 medical staffs in wuhan have been infected since the outbreak 28 it is a warning to the world that the infection rate of the novel coronavirus is very high more attention must be paid to the infection of medical staff and nosocomial infectionwhen china adopted the home quarantine policy at beginning there was a large number of household cluster infections and even tragedies where there would be deaths of entire families 29 this proved again the high infection rate of the novel coronavirus and that home quarantine policy may be not a good choice once infected by covid-19 patients are better isolated and separated from their familiesalthough it is generally believed that the elderly and patients with underlying diseases have higher mortality rates 30 it has been proven that healthy young people also can develop severe illness the severity of the disease may be related to cytokine storm31 in addition there were still a few cases of infant or children infectionat beginning the clinical diagnosis was based on detecting method of molecular biology  pcr polymerase chain reaction when throat swabs or nose swabs were taken as sampling there were some patients whose test results showed negative one of the patients was false negative 5 times 32 meanwhile there were also asymptomatic carriers with positive molecular diagnosis results but no symptoms 33 because of false positive and false-negative results molecular diagnosis being the unique diagnostic criteria is challenged later combining pcr with clinical ct results was recommended as the basis for the diagnosis of covid-19during treatment there were some clinical cases in which convalescent patients had significantly improved symptoms however the patiens condition would suddenly deteriorate and they would pass away within only a few hours the mechanism of death cause remains unknownon the one hand covid-19 outbreaks can cause serious medical supplies shortage on the other hand the publics panic can make it much worse the shortage of medical materials staff and supplies should all be expected this phenomenon deserves attention in other regions of the world the storage of medical materials is particularly important especially in the early stage of the outbreakdue to the large amount of medical resources invested in the treatment of the novel coronavirus disease other clinic treatments such as surgery emergency medical treatment tumor radiotherapy and chemotherapy were not available 34 this lead to increased mortality in patients with other diseases in the hospitalthe clinical treatment for covid-19 is mainly oxygen inhalation and symptomatic treatment there is no specific and effective drugs for saving life of severe patients at present 35since covid-19 first occurred in wuhan both the central government and the local government in china had paid great attention to it besides more than 40 000 medical staff from other provinces were sent to wuhan other participants from transportation traffic and military industries actively took part in preparing medical material and food supplies it took a national-level unified action to effectively control the covid-19strict closure of cities and quarantine measures have demonstrated that chinese isolation counter-measures have achieved good results the achievement is that wuhan will be released from closure in april 8 isolation measures can effectively reduce the covid-19 incidence rate and save many peoples lives therefore the isolation counter-measure is worth being recommended to other countries policy makerskeywords are used to generalize the literatures content keyword frequency may reflect the main content of a group of the documents table 2 shows the top 30 keywords with their frequency and weight value integrating them with the high frequency terms we found that experts advice for preventing and controlling covid-19 included these specific keywords material prevention and control pathogeny propaganda education hygiene technology medical care overall planning policy and panic these keywords reflect some main concerns that chinese experts had about covid-19content analysis was used to summarize experts advice for preventing and controlling covid-19 the main advices were sorted and analyzed from four aspects publicity and education various subjects medical materials and law construction chinese experts advice is listed in table 3first of all in addition to making full use of the two important communication tools television and the internet various forms of publicity should be used to make the public fully aware of the severity of covid-19 the public should be well informed of the novel coronavirus in this special times it is emphasized to not attend large gatherings wash hands frequently cover mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing wear a mask if necessary and strengthen awareness of prevention second it is important to report the epidemic information in a timely and accurate manner this can effectively avoid panic and mistakes due to misinformationcovid-19 is highly infectious except for patients with obvious symptoms mild or atypical patients and even asymptomatic infections are all possible sources of transmission therefore controlling the source of infection and cutting off transmission routes are fundamental measures for prevention and control of the epidemic the wuhan closure work stoppage school suspension and community closed management as well as the first-level response to major public health events launched nationwide are measures that effectively controlled the movement of people and the spread of the epidemic isolation as an effective approach is worth promoting around the world on the other hand home isolation may lead to household cluster infection which is noteworthy therefore if possible as to all covid-19 patients they should be treated in covid-19 designated hospitals with a centralized treatment plan to reduce nosocomial infection as to all susceptible persons or close contacts they should be asked to stay in hotels idle factories large sports grounds or standby isolation places for centralized isolation all infected patients and close contacts can be found by self-conscious online reporting currently isolation may be the unique effective way to cut off the route of transmission and decrease the incidence of covid-19 in addition in order to prevent the spread of infection caused by secondary pollution more attention should be paid to a reasonable disposal of covid-19 medical wasteaccording to a survey from hubei 40 of covid-19 infections are in hospitals and 60 in communities this is a warning for global epidemic prevention the susceptible groups of covid-19 include front-line medical staff elderly population and the gregarious groups including nursing homes residential schools barracks prisons etc therefore the protection provided for them must be given priority in the global work of prevention and controlin the response to the outbreak combination of online and offline medical consulting in china have been effective to solve the problem of shortage of clinical doctors in the global work of prevention and control relevant countries and regions should allocate medical staff reasonably triage patients properly before or during admission improve the efficiency of treatment and prevent cross-infection adequate medical supplies and orderly distribution are important to effective epidemic prevention and control sufficient human and material support are helpful to ensure the success of treatment of non-covid-19 patientsno country around the world can deal with global epidemic on its own health is a global issue and global health is local thus the fight against covid-19 relies on local efforts in every country around the world it is important for all countries to timely share the indicators and information with the who the global cooperation should include three aspects first the world should join hands together to share information of the epidemic situation openly and transparently second scientists in the world should cooperate to study the origin of the virus formulate diagnostic criteria search for specific clinical drugs develop vaccines and jointly fight against covid-19 third all countries should have unified action under the leading of who under the global unified action plan the duration for fighting the covid-19 will be shorterin the era of globalization all nations share weal and woe in the face of the covid-19 epidemic no country can stand alone and only maintain its own safety people from all over the world should put aside their differences in ideology religious belief politics economy and culture all countries should work together to fight against the virus instead of shifting blame and suspecting each other it must be condemned for any government or individual to take advantage of the new pneumonia to stigmatize some other countries mankind is a community of destiny only by closer cooperation and mutual help with all countries can we successfully overcome the pandemic in the global war against covid-19severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and coronavirus disease 2019coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense ribonucleic acid rna viruses belonging to the family coronaviridae which are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals and cause respiratory enteric hepatic and neurologic disease 1 six coronavirus species were previously known to cause human disease 1 four viruses-229e oc43 nl63 and hku1-typically cause mild respiratory illness in immunocompetent individuals whereas the other two betacoronaviruses-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov-have been linked to fatal illnesses in the past two decades 12 sars-cov was the causal agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2002 and 2003 in guangdong province china mers-cov was the pathogen responsible for severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012 in the middle east and has been responsible for more than 10000 cumulative cases in the past two decades mortality rates of 10 for sars-cov and 37 for mers-cov have been reported 1-3in december 2019 the first pneumonia cases of unknown origin were identified in wuhan the capital city of hubei province china these cases were epidemiologically linked to a local huanan wholesale seafood market 12 a previously unknown betacoronavirus was discovered through unbiased sequencing in samples from patients with pneumonia human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate a novel enveloped rna betacoronavirus named 2019-ncov and later renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 formed a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus orthocoronavirinae subfamily 1 phylogenetic analysis showed that sars-cov-2 has 89 genome sequence identity to a bat sars-like coronavirus 80 identity to sars and 50 identity to mers coronavirus thus making sars-cov-2 the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans as well as the third coronavirus with bat origins 4since its initial identification the disease caused by sars-cov-2 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has spread to more than 187 countries worldwide over the past few months 5 given the rapid spread of this virus with consequences on an international scale covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization on march 11 2020 6 as of may 10 2020 more than four million covid-19 cases were reported globally including more than 13 million cases in the united states which are associated with more than 281000 deaths to date 5 although sars-cov-2 appears to have a lower fatality rate than either sars-cov or mers-cov covid-19 has resulted in many more deaths than both of these prior outbreaks combined partly because of its greater infectivity estimated reproductive number r0 of between 2 and 3 and higher attack rate thus leading to more infected patients 6 evidence of person to person transmission has been observed primarily through close contact and respiratory droplets the virus can be detected one to two days before symptom onset in upper respiratory samples and the median incubation period has been estimated to be 51 days 95 confidence interval ci 45-58 days 7 although most symptomatic patients with covid-19 present with fever dry cough and shortness of breath and show pneumonia on imaging findings approximately of ten percent of patients have a worsening of the disease thus requiring intensive care and possible complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards viremia acute cardiac injury disseminated intravascular coagulation dic multi-organ failure and subsequent death in critically ill patients 8definition of acute myocardial injurymyocardial injury is defined as an elevation in cardiac biomarkers cardiac troponin i tni or troponin t tnt above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit and is considered acute if there is a rise andor fall in cardiac troponin concentrations exceeding the biological andor analytical variation myocardial injury may be secondary to ischemic or nonischemic processes 910 traditionally elevated troponin concentrations have been considered equivalent to myocardial infarction however with improvements in troponin assays elevated levels without overt symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia are now more common hence the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction considers myocardial injury to be a separate unique entity 11 based on current evidence a myocardial injury without overt ischemia represents approximately 60 of cases of abnormal troponin elevation 9 the differential diagnosis is broad in such cases it can be recognized in the variety of cardiac such as acute heart failure pulmonary embolism myocarditis cardiac surgery or procedures cardiac arrhythmias hypertension stress-induced cardiomyopathy or several non-cardiac conditions such as acute renal failure sepsis anemia hypoxia critical illness drug-induced rhabdomyolysis among others 910 association of viral infections with myocardial injury has been well recognized and the most common associations involve adenoviruses and enteroviruses such as coxsackie viruses 12 according to data from previous influenza virus and coronavirus epidemics these viral infections have also been shown to cause myocardial injury because cases of myocarditis have been described to be caused by both influenza and coronaviruses 1314although sars-cov-2 infection predominantly causes pulmonary complications such as pneumonia and ards the disease has also been associated with a variety of cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury myocarditis arrhythmia heart failure and venous thromboembolism 6 moreover studies have shown that patients with covid-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease cvd have an increased risk of acquiring the illness and subsequently having severe disease and death 67 in a clinical bulletin issued by the american college of cardiology acc the overall case-fatality rate was 23 but the mortality reached 105 in patients with underlying cvd 15 among various cardiac complications acute cardiac injury with elevated cardiac biomarkers has been described in early studies from china on hospitalized patients with covid-19 we discuss the prevalence mechanism clinical characteristics management and prognostic implications of sars-cov-2-induced myocardial injury according to current published researchcardiovascular complications with sars-cov and merssars-cov and mers may also result in cardiovascular complications although most of the data are anecdotal in the absence of systematic studies although sars-cov infection is associated with some cardiovascular manifestations there are no clear reported cases of myocarditis 16-19 however in the 2012 saudi arabia outbreak mers-cov was reported to cause acute myocarditis and heart failure table 1 14prevalence of myocardial injury in covid-19acute cardiac injury has been reported to be highly prevalent in hospitalized patients with covid-19 table 2the earliest single-center retrospective study conducted in china involving 41 hospitalized patients with covid-19 detected acute cardiac injury in five 12 patients in the study a diagnosis of acute cardiac injury was made if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers troponin i were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit or new abnormalities were detected in electrocardiography ecg and echocardiography 1 since then numerous retrospective studies reported an increased prevalence of myocardial injury in hospitalized patients with covid-19 with a frequency between 5 and 28 120-25 the prevalence of cardiac injury increased with the severity of the disease table 3 26-31however data regarding troponin elevation in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized patients are not availablemechanism of cardiac injury in covid-19the mechanism of cardiac injury among patients with covid-19 remains uncertain the following potential mechanisms have been suggested1 sars-cov-2 induced direct myocardial injuryone potential mechanism is direct myocardial involvement mediated via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 832 the betacoronaviruses can infect human hosts through ace2 a membrane-bound protein expressed in many human cells including vascular endothelia renal tissue cardiovascular tissue and small intestinal epithelia ace2 negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin system by inactivating angiotensin ii and it is likely to protect against acute lung failure a murine model has demonstrated that pulmonary infection with sars-cov also precipitates ace2dependent myocardial infarction among humans during the toronto sars outbreak sars-cov viral rna was detected in 35 of autopsied hearts thus raising the possibility of direct damage of cardiomyocytes by the virus 32 phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that sars-cov-2 has a very similar receptor binding domainmotif to that of the sars coronavirus thus suggesting that sars-cov-2 may use ace2 as a receptor to enter human cells and causes direct damage to the lung epithelia thereby leading to pneumonia and ards because ace2 is also highly expressed in the heart covid-19 induced cardiac injury might potentially be mediated by ace2 although whether sars-cov-2 binding alters ace2 expression or causes dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas pathway remains unclear 673233 hence one potential explanation for the higher likelihood of acquiring infection and the increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in patients with covid-19 with pre-existing cvd maybe the elevated secretion of ace2 in these patients thus making them more susceptible to direct viral damage to cardiac myocytes 33 but this has not yet been demonstrated in pathology studies in a case report describing autopsy results for a 50-year-old man who died of covid-19 associated with ards histologic examination of biopsied cardiac tissue showed rare interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates without substantial myocardial damage however the troponin level was not reported in the study 34 2 sars-cov-2 induced overwhelming inflammatory response and cytokine stormanother suggested mechanism of covid-19 related cardiac involvement is an overwhelming immune-inflammatory response and cytokine storm 6733 the hallmark of cytokine storm syndrome is an uncontrolled and dysfunctional immune response involving the continuous activation and proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophages 24 huang et al have found that patients with covid-19 admitted to the intensive care unit have higher plasma levels of cytokines including interleukins il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and igg-induced protein 10 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha and tumor necrosis factor  1 from a previous study of sars-cov infection and cardiovascular complications subclinical diastolic left ventricular impairment appears to be common during acute sars infection and to be reversible after recovery thus suggesting that left ventricular dysfunction in the acute phase might be associated with cytokine storm syndrome 18 several studies have shown that patients with covid-19 with myocardial injury show evidence of severe systemic inflammation including elevated leukocyte and neutrophil counts interleukin levels c-reactive protein procalcitonin globulin and biomarkers of myocardial injury and stress such as creatine kinase and myoglobin and n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide nt-probnp thus linking myocardial injury to the severity of inflammation and subsequent ventricular dysfunction 242535 similarly in a case report of sars-cov 2 induced fulminant myocarditis the described patient had markedly elevated interleukin 6 thus suggesting that the presence of cytokine storms might have caused increased vascular wall permeability and myocardial edema thus resulting in the observed thickening of the interventricular septum because the myocarditis was transient and recovery was enhanced with the use of continuous renal replacement therapy crrt myocardial injury can be considered to be associated with an excessive immune response mediated by viral infection 363 sars-cov-2 induced severe hypoxia and systemic disturbancessevere hypoxia due to acute lung injury and several systemic complications caused by the virus can result in oxidative stress and hence secondary myocardial injury due to increased myocardial oxygen demand 733 for example in one study there was a characteristic pattern of rise in cardiac troponin i over time the troponin level was normal during admission but subsequently increased in 375 of patients especially in those who died in those patients the troponin level significantly increased in the week preceding the death coinciding with severe systemic disorders including multiple organ failure severe electrolyte disturbances management of ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo severe metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction all of which can potentially lead to secondary myocardial injury due to increased oxidative stress on the heart 37preexisting cardiovascular disease and acute myocardial injury in sars-cov-2studies have demonstrated that patients with underlying cvd and other comorbid conditions are predisposed to myocardial injury during covid-19 the prevalence of hypertension among patients with cardiac injury has been reported to be as high as 45-65 and that of coronary artery disease cad has been reported to be approximately 20-30 table 4 222425in addition to the above mechanisms in patients with underlying cvd the acute systemic inflammatory responses seen in covid-19 can exacerbate inflammatory activity within coronary atherosclerotic plaques thus making the plaques prone to rupture inflammation also causes endothelial dysfunction and increases the procoagulant activity of the blood thereby contributing to the formation of occlusive thrombi over ruptured coronary plaques and predisposing patients to ischemic myocardial injury 38covid-19 and myocarditisthere are several clinically diagnosed myocarditis cases in patients with covid-19 with supporting imaging table 5 3639-41 in the study among 84 patients with covid 19 four 48 were clinically diagnosed with sars-cov-2 myocarditis based on the most updated diagnostic criteria for viral myocarditis 42 however in a single-center retrospective study in 112 admitted patients with confirmed covid-19 the authors explored whether sars-cov-2 caused the myocarditis by performing at least one echocardiographic evaluation in all patients during hospitalization a total of 14 patients 125 presented with abnormalities suggestive of possible myocarditis with an elevation of troponin the myocarditis diagnosis was based on findings of triple elevation in cardiac troponin i 012 ngml plus abnormalities in echocardiography andor ecg the abnormalities in echocardiography were defined as a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction lvef 50 or segmental wall motion abnormality or left ventricular wall thickening 10 mm andor presence of pericardial effusion 5 mm the abnormalities in ecg were defined as st-segment elevationst-t changes the echocardiography did not show typical signs of myocarditis as stated above except for the presence of small pericardial effusion in some patients and nonspecific ecg manifestations most commonly tachycardia which was not typical for myocardial injury but was more suggestive of systemic causes hence the authors suggested that myocardial injury may be more likely to be a result of systemic consequences rather than direct damage by sars-cov-2 37 uncertainties exist whether sars-cov-2 can directly cause cardiomyocyte infection as no biopsy- or autopsy-demonstrated sars-cov-2 localization within cardiomyocytes has been reported to date in a study of covid-19 through post-mortem needle core biopsy of the lung liver and heart in four patients who died of covid-19 pneumonia cardiac biopsy performed in two patients in whom cardiac troponin was elevated during hospital course showed only mild focal fibrosis and mild myocardial hypertrophy which were probably associated with the underlying conditions such as hypertension-associated myocardial hypertrophy and past ischemic injury however there was no evidence of inflammatory cellular infiltration to indicate myocarditis 43tavazzi et al have described the first case in which a biopsy demonstrated myocardial localization of viral particles suggestive of sars-cov-2 in a patient presenting with cardiogenic shock 41 the clinical presentation was suggestive of fulminant myocarditis however the pathologic study demonstrated low-grade myocardial inflammation without evidence of myocardial necrosis given that the viral particles were observed in interstitial cytopathic macrophages and their surroundings but not in cardiac myocytes the authors could not infer viral cardiotropism and suggested that either a viremic phase or migration of infected macrophages from the lung is likely to occur in patients with covid19 with nonischemic acute myocardial injury 41 further investigations along with the histological demonstration of myocarditis inflammatory lymphomonocytic infiltrates plus myocyte necrosis not typical of ischemia 44 and identification of the viral genome in cardiac tissue will be required in the future to clarify the direct association of covid-19 with myocarditispatterns of myocardial injury in covid-19myocardial injury has been shown to present in three different patterns1 the most common pattern is mild troponin elevation typically  99th percentile of the upper reference limit with a modest rise or fall on subsequent days as frequently observed in patients without cardiac symptoms and those who survive after hospitalization 21372 the second pattern is progressive in which some patients have normal troponin levels or moderate troponin elevation during admission however the level progressively increases as the patients experience clinical deterioration with respiratory failure along with an increase in other biomarkers eg interleukin-6 ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase and usually occurs during the second week of hospitalization this pattern is observed among non-survivors and death occurs around a median of 185 days after symptom onset one study has demonstrated that at four days after symptom onset the median high sensitivity cardiac tni hs-ctni levels were 88 pgml in non-survivors vs 25 pgml in survivors during follow-up the median hs-ctni among survivors did not change significantly 25-44 pgml whereas it rose to 247 pgml on day 7 to 557 pgml on day 13 to 1345 pgml on day 19 and to 2906 pgml on day 22 in non-survivors 2132373 the third pattern is early moderate troponin elevation which may approach or exceed the 99th percentile upper reference limit and subsequently fall over the course of illness this pattern is usually seen in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis presenting predominantly with cardiac symptoms 363940clinical features of patients with covid-19 and myocardial injurystudies have shown that patients with cardiac injury are more likely to be older median age 65-74 years than those without cardiac injury 222425 and most patients present with typical symptoms of covid-19 like fever cough fatigue and dyspnea in a study of 291 covid-19 patients 15 of whom had evidence of cardiac injury no patients complained of chest pain or palpitations the common symptoms at illness onset in both groups of patients with or without cardiac injury were similar and included fever cough headache fatigue and dyspnea 22 however a minority of patients with cardiac injury might present with cardiac symptoms with or without respiratory symptoms in another study 11 of 82 134 patients with myocardial injury presented with chest pain compared with 3 of 334 09 patients without cardiac injury p0001 24 in a case report of myocarditis the initial presenting symptom was chest pain and respiratory involvement but an atypical presentation without respiratory symptoms was also described 3637 in terms of radiologic findings bilateral and multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity are more prevalent in patients with than without cardiac injury 25 limited studies in which patients with cardiac injury underwent ecg have revealed ecg abnormalities such as t-wave depression and inversion st-segment depression and q waves 24 patients with clinically suspected myocarditis have been found to have st-segment elevations 3940complicationspatients with cardiac injury and elevated troponin are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit and to develop complications including ards malignant arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardiaventricular fibrillation acute coagulopathy electrolyte disturbances and acute kidney injury and to receive mechanical ventilation crrt extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and vasopressor therapy thus further suggesting that cardiac injury might be associated with the clinical outcomes of covid-19 the use of antibiotic treatment glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment is also significantly higher in patients with cardiac injury than without cardiac injury 2425myocardial injury and mortality in patients with covid-19studies have shown that cardiac injury is associated with higher mortality in patients with covid 19 tables 23 in a case series study in 416 patients with covid-19 the cox regression model after adjustment for age preexisting cardiovascular diseases and other comorbid conditions and complications including ards revealed a significantly higher risk of death in patients with than without cardiac injury either during the time from symptom onset hazard ratio hr 426 95 ci 192-949 or time from admission to study endpoint hr 341 95 ci 162-716 24 similarly in another case series even though patients with covid-19 with cardiac injury and underlying cvd had the highest mortality 6944 patients with underlying cvd but normal tnt levels during the disease course had more favorable prognoses than patients with elevated tnt levels but no underlying cvd mortality 133 vs 375 thus indicating relatively favorable prognosis in patients with underlying cvd but without myocardial injury 25 these studies demonstrate that cardiac injury might be independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with covid-19moreover the mortality rate directly increases with the magnitude of the reference value of cardiac troponin in a single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 patients with covid-19 in wuhan china conducted to explore whether heart injury occurred during covid-19 on admission and later increased mortality approximately 112 of patients had high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i hs-tni exceeding the clinical upper normal limit on admission patients with high levels of hs-tni on admission had significantly higher mortality 500 than patients with moderate or low levels of hs-tni 100 or 91 besides hs-tni level on admission was significantly negatively correlated with the number of survival days r-042 p0005 35 a study by guo et al showed that tnt and nt-probnp levels increased significantly during hospitalization in patients who ultimately died whereas these dynamic changes in tnt or nt-probnp levels were not evident in survivors 25 based on a few studies initial measurement of cardiac biomarkers immediately after hospitalization for sars-cov-2 infection and longitudinal monitoring during the hospital stay may aid in identifying a subset of patients who might progress to a poorer clinical condition however further evidence from more studies is requiredmanagement considerations for acute myocardial injury in patients with covid-19a myocardial injury should be suspected in patients with covid-19 with troponin elevation or new abnormalities in ecg and could be related to type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction myocarditis stress-induced cardiomyopathy or cytokine induced-myocardial injury 4546 the approach to evaluating myocardial injury in patients with known or suspected covid-19 should be based on balancing the benefits of further evaluation in changing the management strategy versus the potential risk of nosocomial spread of covid-19 infection 4546as such elevated troponin levels should not be considered as evidence of acute myocardial infarction which is diagnosed based on symptoms and signs of ischemia and ecg changes 9 in a multicenter case series study form six hospitals in new york inpatients with confirmed covid-19 who had st-segment elevation on ecg with the elevation of cardiac enzymes 10 out of 18 patients were classified as having noncoronary myocardial injury with no evidence of obstructive disease on coronary angiography and normal wall motion on echocardiography eight patients received a clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction the median peak troponin level was higher in patients with myocardial infarction than in those with a clinical diagnosis of noncoronary myocardial injury 47 if the clinical presentation is suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome acs timely evaluation is required to determine the need for urgent intervention in patients with covid-19 who have mild to moderate troponin elevation without symptoms and signs of acute heart failure clinical monitoring may be performed without routine cardiac imaging until the recovery from the acute viral syndrome 46 for patients with clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure echocardiography may be performed if the management strategy and prognosis would be likely to change with the diagnosis the possible diagnosis in the patients with ventricular wall motion abnormalities elevated troponin and no acs include clinically suspected myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy 45 as there is no established therapy for clinically suspected myocarditis routine evaluation with cardiovascular magnetic resonance or endomyocardial biopsy in those cases is not recommended 45 as such regardless of fulminant or non-fulminant presentation american college of cardiology recommends against routine endomyocardial biopsy in patients with active covid-19 with abnormal cardiac enzymes as biopsy is unlikely to change immediate clinical management whether the etiology is due to myocarditis cytokine-induced myocardial injury or type- 2 myocardial infarction 4546unfortunately beyond guidelines for treating patients with ischemic myocardial injury no consensus exists regarding the routine management of patients with covid-19 and myocardial injury the management of myocardial injury focuses on identifying and treating the underlying cause and supportive care including management of heart failure therapy of arrhythmias and avoidance of cardiotoxins 4546 if the patient clinically deteriorates or develop hemodynamic instability or has severely elevated or rapidly rising troponin detailed evaluation cardiology consultation and enrollment in clinical trials or experimental therapies like antiviral agents anti-cytokines il-6 inhibitors such as tocilizumab the convalescent plasma may be considered on the case-by-case basis 46 although the use of steroids has not been recommended in the general treatment of covid-19 some reports have described patients recovering from fulminant myocarditis with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids however more studies will be needed to determine which patient would benefit from such therapies 8 for patients with refractory shock or ventricular arrhythmias secondary to fulminant myocarditis early institution of mechanical support with ecmo can be considered as case reports with the successful rescue of such patients have been described 46 in general as the presence of cvd and myocardial injury in covid-19 patients has been associated with more severe outcomes and increased mortality triaging patients with covid-19 according to the presence of underlying cvd and evidence of myocardial injury for prioritized treatment strategies may be reasonable 25finally several therapies with potential cardiovascular side effects are currently being studied and caution must be used when administering these therapies to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease for example preliminary clinical research has suggested the potential efficacy of hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin for treatment of covid-19 but this is associated with qtc prolongation and risk of fatal arrhythmias thus warranting regular monitoring of qtc 48 controversy remains concerning the use of aceiarb for covid-19 some preclinical studies have suggested that raas inhibitors may increase ace2 functional receptor for sars-cov-2 expression raising concerns regarding safety in patients with covid-19 however the data remain anecdotal and no clinical studies have evaluated the effects of raas inhibitors in covid-19 as such several leading professional societies recommend continuation of raas inhibitors for patients who are at risk for being evaluated for or currently have covid-19 and are taking these medications to treat other conditions for which these agents are known to be beneficial such as heart failure or ischemic heart disease 49future directionsmost studies have been conducted on chinese cohorts and thus the generalizability of the results to other countries including the united states remains to be determined most studies have been single-centered retrospective studies with the enrollment of small numbers of patients larger cohorts multicenter and prospective studies should be planned they should include assessment of detailed heart function related data particularly ecg echocardiography and possibly cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to determine myocardial function and the etiology and mechanism of cardiac injury most studies have not discussed why troponin was measured in the first place and no data are available to support a different management strategy for patients with elevated troponin studies must be planned to define whether adjunctive cardioprotective therapies such as corticosteroids immunosuppressants antivirals agents interferons andor immunomodulatory therapy immunoglobulins may be advisable for patients with significant elevation of cardiac injury biomarkers pathological examination of myocardial tissue of patients with covid-19 with definite myocardial injury will be needed to provide pathological evidence of the etiology of myocardial injury and establish covid-19 as a new etiological agent for myocarditisin conclusion covid-19 has been associated with an increased prevalence of acute cardiac injury even more so in patients with severe disease the presence of preexisting cardiovascular disease increases the risk of cardiac injury in patients with covid-19 although the exact mechanism underlying the association of cardiac injury in patients with covid-19 remains unclear direct virus-induced cardiomyocyte injury leading to viral myocarditis systemic cytokine-mediated myocardial injury and hypoxia-induced myocardial oxidative stress have been suggested the presence of myocardial injury is independently associated with mortality and may be a predictor of progression to severe disease and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19 further studies are needed to elucidate the predominant etiology of myocardial injury in patients with covid-19 and to promote targeted treatment programs to improve patient prognosisporcine epidemic diarrhoea ped is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by a coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv it causes acute and watery diarrhoea in pigs of all ages although the most severe signs are reported in piglets less than two weeks old in which diarrhoea leads to severe dehydration and is associated with mortalities which can reach up to 100  in affected littersthe first clinical description of ped occurred in the uk and belgium in the early seventies however it was not until 1978 when the etiological agent of these diarrhoeal outbreaks a new coronavirus was identified 1 2 soon afterwards studies by the research group led by professor pensaert in ghent belgium demonstrated that there were no specific antibodies against pedv in sera collected from sows prior to 1971 confirming that pedv was a new virus in the european swine population up to now there is no information available on the potential origin of this virusafter its first description in uk and belgium pedv spread throughout european countries causing diarrhoeal outbreaks in a relevant number of pig herds 35 pedv or specific antibodies against pedv were reported in several european countries belgium the uk the netherlands germany hungary bulgaria france switzerland and spain in the seventies and the eighties 35 mortality in piglets less than two weeks old varied from 0 to 100  but it was usually lower than that described in outbreaks of diarrhoea caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev which is another porcine coronavirus classically recognized as a cause of diarrhoea disease in swine however for unknown reasons ped outbreaks markedly decreased in the nineties and in subsequent years in europe isolated outbreaks associated with low mortality in piglets were reported in some countries ie spain 6 hungary 7 the uk 8 or the czech republic 9 10 the only well-documented ped epidemic over the last 10 years in europe occurred during the winter of 20052006 in northern italy on average pre-weaning mortality raised from 83 to 119  peaking at 345  in one particular farm 11 recent ped outbreaks have been reported in germany 1214 italy 15 16 the netherlands 17 belgium 18 france 19 the ukraine 20 and other european countries unpublished datain contrast to the situation in europe pedv has remained as a major cause of diarrhoea outbreaks on swine farms in asia for over 30 years viral-like diarrhoea outbreaks were reported on pig farms in shanghai china in 1973 and despite the fact that tgev and other known enteropathogenic agents were ruled out the aetiology could not be determined pedv was firstly demonstrated in the area in 1983 in china 21 and japan 22 in the nineties the virus spread to neighbouring countries such as korea 23 the philippines and thailand 24 later on it was reported in taiwan in 2007 25 and vietnam in 2009 26 due to its relevance in this area attenuated or killed vaccines which confer partial protection against pedv have been used in several asian countries these vaccines have been used in china since 1995 and also introduced in japan in 1997 south korea in 2004 and the philippines in 2011 27 it is relevant to point out that in october 2010 a large-scale and severe ped outbreak was reported in several provinces in southern china and spread to other provinces within this country as well as to other neighbouring countries 28 29 the outbreak caused high mortality among suckling piglets between 50 and 90  and given the fact that china was clearly not a nave country regarding pedv infection it was proposed that probably a new variant of pedv with a higher virulence was circulatingrecently in april 2013 pedv was identified for the first time in the usa on pig farms located in ohio 30 the virus spread quickly within the country and 1 year after the first description the number of ped affected farms exceeded 5000 spreading to over 25 states in addition the virus spread to other countries in north central and south america and ped outbreaks were reported for the first time on pig farms in mexico july 2013 peru october 2013 the dominican republic november 2013 canada january 2014 colombia march 2014 and ecuador july 2014 31based on genomic analysis the coronaviridae family has been recently divided into four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus 32 pedv is a member of the genus alphacoronavirus together with other coronaviruses which infect pigs tgev and its respiratory variant porcine respiratory coronavirus or prcv dogs canine coronavirus cats feline infectious peritonitis virus humans human coronavirus 229e or human coronavirus nl-63 or bats there are also other swine coronaviruses table 1 porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev is a betacoronavirus which causes an infection associated with chronic emaciation and death in young pigs vomiting and wasting disease while porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov a member of the genus deltacoronavirus has recently been identified as the etiological agent of an enteric disease similar to ped or tge 33
coronaviruses are enveloped viruses which possess a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome they are morphologically characterized by the presence of projections or peplomers on their surface like other members of the alphacoronavirus genus pedv possesses four structural proteins three membrane proteins identified as s protein or spike protein m protein or membrane protein and e protein previously sm or small membrane protein and a nucleocapsid protein or n protein which encapsidates viral rna s protein is particularly relevant among the structural proteins it is a glycoprotein which induces neutralizing antibodies and interacts with cell receptor in the host there are also three non-structural proteins two of them are encoded in open reading frames orf 1a and 1b and are involved in genome replication and transcription while the third encoded in orf3 has been reported to be an ion-channel protein 35antigenic relationships in pedv and other coronavirus have been researched into 34 although some cross-reactivity between pedv and tgev associated with one epitope on the n-terminal region of n protein was recently reported pig tgev antisera do not neutralized pedv and vice versa no cross-reactivity has been reported between pedv and any other coronavirus of the beta gamma or delta generadirect and indirect pedv transmission occurs mainly by faecal-oral route viral shedding in faeces starts on post-infection day one or two and continues for a period of 7 to 10 days 35 36 although it can extend up to 36 weeks in some animals 37 38 the transmission of the infection is facilitated by the high viral load in faeces from infected animals 39 40 as well as by the minimum infectious dose required to infect nave pigs 31 moreover the resistance of the virus in the environment facilitates the faecal-oral transmission pedv is stable under low temperatures while it is adversely affected by high temperatures it survives between ph 5090 at 4 c while only between ph 6575 at 37 c it can survive for at least 28 days in slurry at 4 c 7 days in contaminated dry feed at 25 c or 14 days in contaminated wet feed at 25 c 31 this fact favours the indirect transmission by different faeces-contaminated fomites such as transport vehicles 41 feed 42 clothing or footweargenetic and phylogenetic analyses of american pedv isolates revealed a close relationship with chinese isolates and their likely chinese origin 43 however how the virus might have travelled from china to the usa is a matter of speculationthe rapid spread of pedv on swine farms in the usa raised questions regarding the possibility of airborne transmission of this infection although undoubtedly the faecal-oral route is the main source of pedv transmission it has been suggested 44 that pedv may travel through the air for short distances on faecal dust particles at least under certain conditions however airborne transmission of pedv has only been shown under experimental conditions and up to now infectious pedv has not been demonstrated in field air samples containing pedv genetic material 44 45 the role that vectors play in the transmission of pedv has also been investigated so far there has been no evidence of pedv replication in non-porcine hosts including rodents and starlings 4648 however the potential role of vectors in the mechanic transmission of the virus from one farm to another cannot be ruled out as has been described for tgev 4using highly sensitive molecular assays the presence of viral rna has been reported in milk samples from infected lactating sows 28 29 as well as in semen samples 29 31 however infectious pedv in these samples has not been demonstrated and their contamination with faecal material in the sampling cannot be excluded moreover viral rna has been detected in the serum fraction of whole blood samples from infected pigs 40 49the role of spray-dried porcine plasma sdpp normally used as feed additive as a potential vehicle of transmission of pedv has been researched into a number of experimental studies have demonstrated that spray-drying process as well as storage conditions are sufficient to inactivate infectious pedv in sdpp 50 51 the infectivity of commercial sdpp positive for pedv-rna has also been investigated a research group from canada managed to reproduce pedv infection in sdpp-inoculated piglets although they failed to reproduce the infection in animals receiving feed supplemented with the same pedv-positive sdpp 52 similarly neither clinical signs nor pedv rna in faeces or pedv specific antibodies were detected in pigs which were fed a diet containing 5  sdpp confirmed positive for pedv in a bioassay experiment conducted by opriessnig et al 53 according to this there is no experimental evidence of pedv transmission through pcr positive sdpp supplemented feed this experimental data is corroborated by the fact that despite the use of large amounts of pedv positive sdpp from the usa to feed pigs in brazil or western canada these areas remained free of pedv infection 54pedv replicates in the cytoplasm of villous enterocytes of the small intestine and causes villous shortening and reduced enzymatic and absorptive capacity in the small intestine causing profuse watery diarrhoea which lasts about a week 37 55 56 other clinical signs which are frequently associated to pedv infection include vomiting anorexia and fever although pigs of all ages are affected the severity of ped is higher in suckling piglets of less than one week old which may die due to severe dehydration the slower turnover of enterocytes in neonatal piglets 57 days compared to three weeks-old piglets 23 days could explain at least partially the higher susceptibility of these young piglets to pedv 4pedv has also been detected in epithelial cells of the colon in both experimentally and naturally infected pigs although villous atrophy has not been demonstrated in the large intestine 40replication of pedv was classically circumscribed to the intestinal tract 3 until a recent research showed pedv replication in alveolar macrophages of 3 day-old- colostrum-free piglets which were experimentally inoculated with a korean wild-type pedv isolate 57 further studies are needed to confirm whether extra-intestinal replication also occurs with other pedv isolates as well as to determine their clinical and epidemiological relevancetwo epidemiologic presentations of ped have been described on the farms a epidemic ped outbreaks occur when pedv is introduced into a nave farm where most of the animals are pedv seronegative the disease spreads rapidly affecting pigs of all ages with morbidity approaching 100  moreover pedv can persist and become b endemic on the farm affecting post-weaning piglets that have lost their lactogenic immunity as well as newly introduced seronegative giltsmortality associated with ped outbreaks is highly dependent on the age of the infected animals mortality can reach up to 80100  in suckling piglets of less than one week old while in weaned pigs mortality rates are typically only 1 to 3  11 30 no mortality associated with ped is usually observed among adult pigsas has already been mentioned differences in the severity of ped outbreaks have been reported particularly severe ped outbreaks have been described in asia since 2010 and also in the usa differences in the virulence of pedv isolates have been proposed to explain this variability 28 58 59 from our point of view this is one of the most relevant questions to face regarding ped nowadays the reason or reasons which could explain variations in the clinical outcome of an outbreak although some reports have suggested that they could be associated with differences in the virulence of pedv isolates exhaustive challenge studies using pig adapted virus not cell culture adapted isolates in suckling piglets are needed to elucidate the role of the strainsome insights have been obtained related to the virulence of different strains in the usa at least two main variants of pedv have been recently identified using molecular methods the first one seems to be a highly virulent virus and similar to viruses described in several asian countries after 2010 while the second the s indel variant has been associated to mild clinical outbreaks 59 this s indel variant includes some particular insertions and deletions in the s gene and is also similar to some asian isolates part of which were recovered before 2010 the classical european reference strain of pedv cv777 is also an s indel isolate although it is located in a different cluster and well differentiated from american indel isolates fig 1a and b pedv isolates recovered in european countries germany italy belgium the netherlands and france in 2014 and 2015 have been characterized and all of them were found to be indel isolates similar to the variant described in the usa 1319 most of these recent ped outbreaks in europe occurred in fattening farms and as expected no mortality was observed however pedv isolates recently recovered in severe outbreaks of pedv in ukraine have shown a genome nucleotide similarity reaching 998  with non-indel isolates from the united states and mexico 20 so far this has been the only report of pedv non-indel isolates in europe apart from differences in the virulence of the pedv strains many other parameters including management immune status of the population and herd sanitary status could also explain variations in the clinical outcome of ped outbreaks 31 thus the contribution of co-infections with other viruses particularly with other enteric viruses such as porcine delta coronavirus pdcov or the recently described mammalian orthoreovirus 3 mrv3 has also been pointed out both viruses have been detected in faecal samples collected from pedv positive farms in the usa pdcov has been associated with mild to moderate diarrhoea in experimentally inoculated nave suckling piglets 33 while mrv3 caused severe diarrhoea with 100  mortality in 3-day-old piglets 60
although the rapid spread of a disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhoea affecting pigs of all ages allows the clinician to suspect that a viral agent is involved in the infection differential diagnosis to identify pedv at the laboratory would be neededdirect detection of pedv in faecal samples by conventional or real-time pcr are the most frequent assays used at present 27 pcr-assays are generally based on the amplification of fragments within the m n or s protein genes and are associated with a high sensitivity and specificity there are also some elisas which are usually based on the use of monoclonal antibodies against pedv although their analytical sensitivity is generally lower than pcr assays 61 they are useful under field conditions as the amount of virus in faecal samples from diseased animals in epidemic outbreaks of ped is very highimmunohistochemistry ihc is also a very useful tool based on the detection of pedv antigens within infected cells in formalin-fixed sections of small intestine it is less sensitive than molecular diagnostic methods but in contrast it allows for the evaluation of tissue lesions 62 in order to increase the sensitivity of ihc assays several sections of the small intestine of affected pigs sacrificed in the acute phase of the infection should be investigatedindirect methods are focused on the detection of antibodies the detection of pedv specific antibodies is very useful not for the investigation of diarrhoea outbreaks but to determine whether an animal or a herd has previously been infected by this virus taking this approach into account serology is a good tool for surveillance as it provides useful information regarding viral spread in a region or a country however the number of tests for the detection of pedv specific antibodies is limited to elisas indirect immunofluorescence assays ifa immunoperoxidase monolayer assays ipma and seroneutralization most of these tests are in-house assays and information regarding their sensitivity and specificity is usually scarce in general the elisa tests have proven to be capable of detecting pedv specific antibodies a little earlier and for longer periods of time than ifa tests 35there is no specific treatment for pedv other than supportive care and symptomatic treatment mortality occurs in suckling piglets as a result of dehydration which should be corrected using oral electrolyte solutions in adult pigs dry feed should be withdrawn for a period of 1224 h and then carefully reintroduced while water should be kept freely available 3 4 in order to increase passive immunity to piglets and minimize losses sows due to farrow in at least 2 weeks can be deliberately exposed to virulent virus by the oral route a recent study revealed that morbidity was reduced from 100 to 43  in litters exposed to virulent pedv when their sows were previously exposed to a mild virulent strain s indel variant of pedv 63 oral administration of chicken egg-yolk or cow colostrum containing pedv immunoglobulins could offer an immunoprophilactic defence 64 65 the increase in lactogenic immunity is also the aim of pedv vaccines which are used in pregnant sows attenuated or killed vaccines against pedv have been used in several asian countries for years 66 however it has been suggested that live vaccines can revert to virulence and their use and usefulness under field conditions have been questioned 5 27 67 recently a pedv subunit vaccine based on the s protein gene of pedv as well as a vaccine with killed virus have been licensed in the usa 68 although there are still no studies which prove their efficacy however pedv vaccines have never been used in europe as the disease was not of sufficient economic importance in this area in general pedv vaccines have been reported to be useful to booster antibody response in animals that have already been infected by pedvas there are no specific treatments for the control and potential eradication of the disease from the herd preventive measures which preclude the introduction of the virus or new pedv strains in the area country or farm are of paramount importance supported by the detection methods mentioned in the diagnosis surveillance should be used to certify that trading of swine or related derivatives do not cause the spread of new strains of the virus lorries used in transport have been highlighted as a relevant source of transmission 41 and special attention should be paid in the effectiveness of the cleaning and disinfecting protocols to inactivate and remove the virus at herd level basic external biosecurity rules such as quarantine of reposition ban the entrance of unwashed vehicles strict visitor policies time interval between visiting two farms provide footwear and appropriate clothing showers and so on should be carried out without exception and internal biosecurity such as controlling the slurry level carcasses disposal and carcass bin cleaning movement of the caretakers on the farm and so on could prevent the establishment of an endemic form of the disease finally many virucidal disinfectants have been shown to be effective in inactivating pedv phenol quaternary ammonium compounds glutaraldehyde and bleach are examples of such disinfectants water temperature is a crucial factor and temperatures over 60 c help to inactivate the virus proper cleaning and disinfecting of facilities and equipment is crucial to control pedvthe emergence and spread of pedv on us pig farms has aroused growing interest in this coronavirus the main areas of recent research on this disease have been focused on the molecular characterization of the isolates as well as the sources of infection and means of transmission despite the fact that relevant knowledge has increased there are still a number of questions to be answered on one hand any difference in virulence among the pedv variants described needs to be clarified on the other hand the rapid spread of this virus in the usa has raised concerns about its transmission mechanisms pedv is mainly spreads by the faecal-oral route either by direct or indirect contact feed or fomites such as vehicles other routes or sources for its transmission such as air-transmission vectors or sdpp have been investigated although their implication has not been clearly demonstratedthe recent ped outbreak in the american continent also shows that more research is needed for the control of the disease based on the development of useful vaccines and surveillance of the virus standardising its detection in laboratories with the final goal being the limiting of its spreadrelative to the assortment of viruses that cause human upper respiratory tract infection the group of viruses that cause lower respiratory tract infection is smaller but includes influenza and parainfluenza respiratory syncytial virus cytomegalovirus and hantavirus these infections are mostly limited to tracheobronchitis in healthy individuals but can cause severe viral pneumonias in immunocompromised patients while influenza is one of the best-known causes of pneumonia in the intensive care unit icu this presentation is frequently related to bacterial superinfection such as with staphylococcus aureus4 some of the rarity of viral pneumonia can be attributed to the types of cells that viruses can infect termed tropism thus while the more common influenza strains like h1n1 target cells in the trachea and bronchi influenza pneumonia is particularly linked to avian strains like h5n1 that skip the upper respiratory epithelium and infect alveolar epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract5sars-cov-2 is a beta-coronavirus a family that includes the original severe acute respiratory syndrome sars virus as well as middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mers and endemic human pathogens that are common causes of the cold including oc43 and hku1 while beta-coronaviruses have been around for more than 5000 yr outbreaks of lethal strains of sars-cov in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus in 2012 have added to their notoriety6 sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and sars-cov-2 all likely originated in bats with sars-cov using civets as intermediary hosts and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus passing though camels pangolins also known as scaly anteaters are implicated in the passage of sars-cov-2 to humans on the basis of sequence similarity with pangolin coronaviruses7the variable clinical manifestations caused by distinct coronavirus strains can be attributed to structural differences in virus proteins affecting tropism and replication the corona description references the crown-like halo of viral spike s proteins observed by electron microscopy fig 1 variations in this s-protein determine which proteins coronavirions use to enter cells early investigations into sars-cov-2 suggest that it uses tissue angiotensin converting enzyme-2 as its receptor a trait shared with sars but not middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus or more common endemic human coronaviruses such as oc43 and hku189 angiotensin converting enzyme-2 is expressed in the lower respiratory tract but not bronchi as well as enterocytes in the small intestine10 thus angiotensin converting enzyme-2 dependence may explain the clinical presentations of lower respiratory tract infection and enteritis in covid-19 angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression in vascular endothelium and cardiac myocytes has also been implicated in acute cardiac injury resulting from covid-1911 in animal models angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers increase angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression and activity respectively leading to speculation that these medications could possibly potentiate sars-cov-2 infection12 major cardiology societies do not recommend changing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonist treatments based on covid-19 risk at this time13 other sites express angiotensin converting enzyme-2 such as the tongue and parts of the genitourinary tract but the clinical significance of this finding in covid-19 is unclear14 binding of s-protein to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 likely contributes directly to pathogenesis resulting in downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 increased production of angiotensin ii and resulting increased pulmonary vascular permeability15 while sars-cov-2susceptible angiotensin converting enzyme-2 appears universally expressed in humans there may be genetic variations regulating angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression that could lead to differential susceptibilities across populations and genotypes16after viral binding to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 the virus may be endocytosed or directly fuse with the cell membrane fig 2 a positive-sense viral rna transcript is then translated by the host cell yielding two polypeptides these polypeptides are subsequently divided by viral proteases yielding the viral replication machinery coronaviruses employ multiple mechanisms to shield viral rna from host detection and subsequent induction of antiviral interferon responses including direct antagonism of interferon signaling proteins and replication of viral rna in double membrane vesicles15 nonetheless covid-19 strongly induces cytokines and chemokines including interleukin-2 interleukin-4 interleukin-7 interleukin-8 interleukin-10 interferon- tumor necrosis factor- and macrophage inflammatory protein-1- suggesting a broad type 1 and type 2 helper t-cell response17 it remains uncertain to what extent direct viral cytotoxicity versus the host cytokine storm and other immune responses contributes to morbidity in covid-19after initial coronavirus infection immune responses appear effective in controlling viral infection suggesting that vaccines should be feasible there were important caveats from animal vaccine models antibody responses waned quickly indicating that immune responses might not be long-lasting18 also in one mouse coronavirus model of sars natural killer cell antibody and interferon responses were beneficial but t-cell responses paradoxically worsened outcomes19 accordingly vaccines will need to demonstrate safety and effectiveness before widespread adoptionthe incubation period for sars-cov-2 appears to be from 4 to 7 days initial reports demonstrated rapid person-to-person viral transmission with the number of infected individuals doubling every 74 days20 viral evolution patterns inferred from viral gene sequence variations suggest that much of the viral transmission that has occurred in the united states has been undiagnosed where two cases reported 6 weeks apart could potentially represent a cluster of hundreds of infections21 two distinct groups of sars-cov-2 sequences have been identified the l-type represented 96 of the cases in wuhan while the more ancestral s-type was found in 38 of cases outside wuhan it has been postulated that the s-type could be less severe and thus capable of more rapid spread because of less negative selective pressure7the majority of patients with covid-19 infection present with fever as the first symptom other common symptoms at onset of illness include cough or fatigue less commonly reported symptoms include palpitations headache and diarrhea a subset of patients develop dyspnea at days 5 to 8 after hospitalization the most commonly reported hematologic laboratory abnormalities with covid-19 are leukopenia and lymphopenia172224212223 the cause of this leukopenia is not well understood but could relate to bone marrow suppression lymphocyte sequestration or apoptosis25 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 cases has ranged from asymptomatic to critically ill23 while the majority of patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis up to 15 of patients will develop pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome ards cardiac injury renal injury or multiorgan failure from days 7 to 10 after hospitalization a subset of patients with covid-19 will require admission to the icu and respiratory support with noninvasive or invasive ventilation or potentially extracorporeal membrane oxygenation172224212223 a summary of covid-19 symptoms complications and treatment in the initial wave of case series publications is presented in table 1of concern to anesthesiologists in the perioperative setting some patients present with minimal respiratory symptoms in one of the initial case series a patient with abdominal symptoms was admitted to a surgical service and infected at least 10 healthcare providers24 abdominal symptoms of covid-19 may reflect angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression in the small intestine and are potentially underappreciated since patients with gastrointestinal symptoms may not be tested for sars-cov-2 indeed sars-cov-2 may be transmitted via the fecaloral route via contaminated surfaces26pneumonia or abnormalities in chest computed tomography images were detected in almost all hospitalized patients with covid-19 the characteristic radiographic findings are ground glass opacities which are typically bilateral and peripheral coexisting with consolidations or cord-like opacities1727282627 as covid-19 progresses reverse halo or crazy-paving radiologic patterns may become apparent notably some radiologic features are rare with covid-19 such as lymphadenopathy nodules pleural effusions or cavitation and would potentially suggest other pathologies28for diagnosis of sars-cov-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing is the standard assay throat swab and nasal swab samples are commonly used for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction while reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is a useful test to confirm the diagnosis of covid-19 with limitations of sample collection and kit performance the total positive rate of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for throat swab samples has been reported to be about 30 to 60 at initial presentation29 serial reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing and inclusion of lower airway sampling can improve the sensitivity of testing commercially available molecular tests for endemic coronaviruses such as the filmarray respiratory panel biofire diagnostics usa do not detect sars-cov-229 currently it is expected that sars-cov-2 will be added soon30 chest computed tomography may have higher sensitivity for covid-19 infection with a sensitivity as high as 97 in one study29 based on challenges with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing computed tomography imaging has been proposed as a primary tool for covid-19 detection in hospitalized patients in epidemic areas however within the first 2 days after symptom onset the majority of patients may have normal computed tomography imaging28 thus early in the disease course there may be no diagnostic sufficiently sensitive to exclude covid-19pathology findings of covid-19 have been reported in some cases3132 while many of the pathologic findings are similar to those seen with coronavirus-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus such as inflammatory infiltrates and hyaline membrane formation the findings of inspissated spherical secretions or fibromyxoid exudates are more prominent in covid-19 infection accumulation of these thick secretions likely causes decreased alveolar gas exchange predisposing to respiratory failure suggesting a potential role for airway clearance and bronchial hygiene in the treatment of covid-19the full ramifications of sars-cov-2 infection are yet to be understood early work points to a wide variety of psychiatric complications affecting patients their families and providers and larger communities relating to anxiety isolation frustration stigma and guilt33 this disease also poses increased risk to specific subpopulations such as transplant candidates and recipients34 and patients with cancer35as highlighted in published case series there is wide variation in clinical presentations of covid-19 ranging from no symptoms to intractable ards and shock the determinants of these varied outcomes remain unknown but experience with other viruses suggests that variation in the dose of viral inoculum route of inoculation and underlying immune status of the patient can lead to widely variable host responses36 higher viral loads on random sampling identified individuals with greater symptom burden in influenza37 and greater mortality in adenoviral pneumonia38 at the same time moderate sars-cov-2 viral loads can be detected in nasal swabs up to 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms and in asymptomatic individuals39 the attributable risk from higher viral inocula is difficult to quantify in real-world settings but higher viral loads in critically ill patients pose at least a theoretical risk to healthcare providers40the major risk factors for mortality among early reported cases of covid-19 are old age and underlying respiratory disease24 again the reasons for these age associations are unknown but there are multiple theories that can be extrapolated from hostpathogen biology for example immunosenescence could contribute to the increased risk among the aged as individuals age the frequency of naive b and t cells diminishes implying less capacity to recognize and adapt to novel antigens at the same time aged immune cells have less proliferative and functional capacity even when responding to known antigens such age-related changes in cellular immunity manifest in decreased vaccine effectiveness worse outcomes in the setting of influenza respiratory syncytial virus and herpes zoster infections41 and have been demonstrated in mouse models of coronavirus infection18 as the lung ages the airway epithelium restorative capacity is also diminished telomere dysfunction is one biologic mechanism of aging which primarily manifests as pulmonary fibrosis but can also restrict leukocyte proliferation it is conceivable that poor outcomes from covid-19 could be linked to short telomeres as has been reported with pulmonary fibrosis ards and sepsis4243 it is also possible that younger individuals may have differential susceptibility to sars-cov-2 interestingly in the rat lung angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression decreases with age44 children also could benefit from immunity developed from other coronavirus infections indeed modest cross-reactivity was observed between endemic coronaviruses such as oc43 and sars-cov45 this potentially protective cross-reactive immunity would be limited by age and immunosenescence if fecaloral transmission resulted in a milder gastroenteritis presentation of sars-cov-2 it is also conceivable that children could be subsequently protected from the covid-19 respiratory syndrome while we currently can only speculate as to the causes of variation in covid-19 presentations these mechanisms likely hold important clues that will inform management and therapeuticswhile most patients with covid-19 appear to have a relatively mild disease course a subset will develop hypoxemic respiratory failure with imaging patterns consistent with diffuse viral pneumonitis organizing pneumonia or diffuse alveolar damage2846 the true incidence of severe pulmonary disease associated with sars-cov-2 is not yet clear but several studies from hubei province have reported a 5 to 25 icu admission rate among hospitalized patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 and an ards diagnosis in 60 to 70 of patients admitted to the icu table 12447 among patients who do develop dyspnea and hypoxemia the median time from onset of symptoms to the development of dyspnea appears to be between 5 and 8 days with ards developing in a smaller subset of those patients at 7 to 10 days244748the management of severe hypoxemia in covid-19 is drawn from the management of ards and also informed by experience during the 2003 sars-cov and 2012 middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus outbreaks the world health organization has published a practice guideline on the clinical management of covid-19 severe respiratory infection49 and several other groups have also published practice recommendations for the care of patients with covid-19associated ards5053 the treatment of patients with covid-19associated ards is made more complex due to necessary infection control interventions such as the use of isolation rooms and the need for care providers to wear appropriate personal protective equipment transmission of sars-cov-2 from patients to healthcare workers has been reported and infection control is of primary importance to protect healthcare workers and prevent further spread of sars-cov-22454 the world health organization guideline recommends in addition to routine standard precautions that providers use droplet and contact precautions when caring for any patients with confirmed or suspected sars-cov-2 infection with the addition of airborne precautions when any aerosol-generating procedure such as intubation bronchoscopy suctioning or cardiopulmonary resuscitation is performed49 additional guidelines and frontline reports from groups in hubei province suggest many providers are utilizing airborne precautions at all times while caring for covid-19 patients as an additional safety measure5051in select patients with covid-19associated respiratory failure presenting with hypoxemia that is not adequately treated with low flow nasal cannula oxygen or conventional facemask a trial of either noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or heated and humidified high flow nasal cannula oxygen may be reasonable before endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation49 world health organization covid-19 management guidelines among others suggest this trial should be of limited duration 1 h to avoid unrecognized severe respiratory decompensation that requires emergent intervention the use of high flow nasal cannula or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is contraindicated in patients with hemodynamic instability multiorgan failure or altered mental status4950high flow nasal cannula can provide 100 oxygen to patients at a high flow rate adds a low 2 to 3 cm h20 positive end-expiratory pressure peep effect and reduces the work of breathing in patients with acute respiratory failure5556 high flow nasal cannula has been used to treat ards with a good safety profile but given its more recent clinical introduction there are little data from other outbreaks to guide its use in covid-19 associated respiratory failure4957 in one study of 310 patients with ards randomized to receive initial high flow nasal cannula noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or conventional oxygen therapy the use of high flow nasal cannula did not significantly reduce intubation rates overall but patients randomized to the high flow nasal cannula arm had a lower 90-day mortality rate58 patients with moderate or severe ards were less likely to require conversion to mechanical ventilation when randomized to the high flow nasal cannula arm of this trial58 a systematic review of the use of high flow nasal cannula in ards did not find a difference in mortality or intubation rates as compared with usual care and found that high flow nasal cannula is well tolerated by patients57 the use of novel indices such as the ratio of oxygen saturationfraction of inspired oxygen to respiratory rate may be helpful to predict clinical deterioration and the need for intubation when high flow nasal cannula is used59given the existing literature base the use of high flow nasal cannula as an initial strategy for the treatment of covid-19associated respiratory failure appears reasonable when patients are closely monitored for worsening respiratory distress world health organization covid-19 guidelines and others recommend avoiding high flow nasal cannula use in patients with severe or worsening hypercapnia hemodynamic instability multiorgan failure or altered mental status4950although guidelines recommend the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in the management of acute respiratory failure due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd exacerbation leading to respiratory acidosis no recommendations have been made regarding the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in ards60 the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in patients with ards has been evaluated in several large trials a recent study reported a high greater than 40 rate of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation failure leading to invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with moderate to severe ards61 in this study noninvasive positive pressure ventilation failure was associated with increased mortality as was the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in patients with more severe ards pao2fio2 less than 150 mmhg61 several authors have suggested that the increased mortality observed when noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is used in patients with more severe ards and in those who ultimately require invasive mechanical ventilation may be explained by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation delaying time to a needed intubation and from lung injury caused by uncontrolled high tidal volumes with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation586062 there are limited data to suggest that when noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is delivered via helmet to patients with ards failure rates and mortality may be lower than when a conventional noninvasive positive pressure ventilation facemask is used while a helmet mask may be additionally beneficial from an infection control perspective this intervention is not widely available63experience from the 2009 h1n1 influenza epidemic and the middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus epidemic also informs the recommendations for use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in covid-19 a large observational study of h1n1 patients reported a greater than 50 noninvasive positive pressure ventilation failure rate and increased mortality in those patients who failed initial noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and required invasive mechanical ventilation64 an observational study of the treatment of patients with middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus reported a greater than 90 failure rate with the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation65based on the best available data the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation as an initial strategy for the treatment of covid-19associated ards is likely reasonable in the subset of patients with mild ards those in whom copd exacerbation or heart failure may also be contributing to respiratory distress and when the patient is closely monitored for improvement or worsening respiratory distress4950there is substantial concern that using noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or high flow nasal cannula in patients with viral respiratory illness results in increased production of aerosolized virus particles creating a risk for healthcare workers or contaminating the clinical environment while multiple studies from the 2003 sars epidemic have identified participation in tracheal intubation as a risk factor for viral spread to healthcare workers noninvasive ventilation was only identified as a risk factor in two small studies not considered robust enough to establish the risk of transmission in a 2012 meta-analysis6668 experimental studies of exhaled air dispersion by mannequins in isolation rooms using conventional low flow nasal cannula high flow nasal cannula and continuous positive airway pressure with nasal pillows or full facemask demonstrated greater exhaled air dispersion with conventional low flow nasal cannula at 5 lmin up to 1 m from the patients face as compared with either high flow nasal cannula or continuous positive airway pressure6970 the authors postulated that lower exhaled air dispersion from high flow nasal cannula or continuous positive airway pressure masks could be related to tighter fit to the face with these modalities and also that the humidified air generated by these modalities could result in exhalation of larger droplets with a shorter trajectory due to gravity70 the use of a full noninvasive positive pressure ventilation facemask might also prevent spread of aerosolized droplets in a patient who is sneezing or coughing53 thus there is a risk that any method of oxygen delivery to a patient with covid-19associated respiratory distress can result in spread of virus-containing exhaled air especially if the mask is poorly fitted or leaking but the concern that use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or high flow nasal cannula specifically leads to worse environmental contamination is not substantiated by the current available evidence patients receiving any supplemental oxygen therapy should be cared for in airborne isolation rooms whenever possible with staff using full contact droplet and airborne isolation precautions5171 providers should be aware that coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days and all surfaces and equipment used for sars-2-covinfected patients should be carefully disinfected with 70 or greater ethanol for small surfaces or 01 or greater sodium hypochlorite for larger surfaces72regardless of the choice of initial oxygen therapy for patients with covid-19associated respiratory failure these patients should be closely monitored for deterioration and intubated promptly to avoid the need for an emergent intervention5173 experience from the 2003 sars epidemic suggests that intubation is a time when healthcare workers are at high risk for viral transmission from infected patients odds ratio 6666 it should be noted however that several of the healthcare providers who contracted sars while intubating patients were wearing only standard surgical facemasks at the time of intubation and there is no strong evidence to link intubation with risk of transmission of virus to healthcare workers when proper airborne precautions are taken74 of note while several post hoc reports from the 2003 sars epidemic and emerging reports from this current epidemic recommend the use of higher level personal protective equipment such as a powered air-purifying respirators double gloves coveralls foot covers or hoods when performing aerosol generating procedures such as intubation there does not appear to be evidence to support the superiority of these measures over standard droplet contact and aerosol precautions667375 some have even suggested that the use of increasing layers of barrier precautions without strong evidence to support their application makes patient care more challenging and could increase the risk of contamination during lengthy and complex personal protective equipment removal procedures7475 application of full barrier precautions has been reported to take at least 5 min and ideally should not be performed emergently74when endotracheal intubation is indicated the world health organization covid-19 clinical guidelines suggest that it be performed by an experienced provider using airborne precautions49 the guidelines also recommend the use of any modality non-rebreather mask bag valve mask high flow nasal cannula or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for preoxygenation with 100 oxygen for 5 min and the use of a rapid sequence induction when possible to avoid coughing or need for positive pressure breaths49 additional guidelines and experiential reports from hubei province largely echo these recommendations5051 of note data from a recent meta-analysis did not note any benefit from the use of high flow nasal cannula for peri-intubation preoxygenation as compared with usual oxygen therapy in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure76 however high flow nasal cannula may be of benefit to prevent severe hypoxemia during intubations with prolonged apneic times or in patients who have very severe hypoxemia76 see table 2 for additional clinical recommendations regarding airway managementafter intubation management of covid-19associated respiratory failure is the same as in ards from other causes us european union and recently released united kingdom ards guidelines strongly recommend the use of low tidal volume ventilation 4 to 8 mlkg predicted body weight in the useuropean union guidelines or less than 6 mlkg in the united kingdom guidelines to maintain plateau pressures less than 30 cm h20 with permissive hypercapnia7778 the us european union and united kingdom guidelines also strongly recommend the use of prone positioning for greater than 12 h per day in patients with severe moderate-severe in united kingdom guidelines ards and this recommendation is echoed in the world health organization sars-cov-2 guideline7778 however as prone ventilation is a resource-intensive intervention where the endotracheal tube and other lines may become displaced it is only recommended when there are sufficient human resources and expertise within the medical center for this intervention to be performed safely49the world health organization guidelines for the management of covid-19 echo the united kingdom ards guidelines in recommending a conservative fluid management strategy for patients without evidence of tissue hypoperfusion4978 while both the useuropean union and united kingdom ards guidelines weakly recommend the use of higher peep in moderate to severe ards and the united kingdom guidelines weakly recommend the use of neuromuscular blockade by continuous infusion early in moderate to severe ards recent clinical trials challenge these recommendations and thus various components of best clinical practice for ards remain unclear at this time7980 a large multicenter trial of patients randomized to receive either a conventional low peep ventilation strategy or a titrated peep strategy resulting in high peep combined with lung recruitment maneuvers found increased mortality in the higher peep and lung recruitment maneuver arm81 regarding the use of neuromuscular blockade a recent multicenter randomized trial found no mortality benefit with its use in early moderate to severe ards and more adverse cardiovascular events in the paralysis arm of the study82 with these trials in mind the world health organization guidelines suggest cautious use of higher peep in moderate or severe ards but not routine use of neuromuscular blockade49in patients with refractory hypoxemia despite lung protective ventilation with best practices there are limited data to guide effectiveness of the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation the united kingdom ards guidelines weakly recommend consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ards and refractory hypoxemia although this recommendation was published before the results of a randomized controlled trial of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for ards which was stopped early due to lack of a statistically significant mortality benefit between the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group and the medical management group7879837882 however a re-analysis of the data from this trial as well as a meta-analysis incorporating these new trial data suggest that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may provide a mortality benefit in patients with severe ards84 in a small case-control series during the middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus outbreak use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory hypoxemia was associated with lower in-hospital mortality85 considering these data it may be reasonable to refer covid-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia despite lung protective ventilation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in centers with the expertise and resources to properly manage such complex patients4950if patients with covid-19associated respiratory failure develop superimposed septic shock adherence to standard sepsis treatment protocols is advised49 additional nonevidence-based recommendations for the management of covid-19associated respiratory failure have been promulgated by a variety of guidelines and published sources largely focusing on minimizing viral spread to healthcare workers or the environment these recommendations include minimizing ventilator disconnections the use of in-line catheters for airway suction49 using a high efficiency hydrophobic filter between the patient and the breathing circuit5173 and avoiding the use of nebulized medications in favor of metered dose inhalers if bronchodilators are indicated51 a collected list of practical recommendations to guide anesthetic and critical care management of covid-19 patients is found in table 2 table 3 provides a list of organizations offering updated guidelines and resources for providers caring for patients with covid-19in the face of this rapidly emerging global threat there are several reasons for optimism about future control as described above a number of antiviral drugs have shown promise in vitro even a partially effective antiviral could allow sufficient reduction in viral load so that the immune system can recover and respond to prevent lethal disease there is even potential that antivirals could be used in chemoprophylaxis to prevent transmission in recently exposed individuals while resistance to antivirals developed quickly in patients with hiv studies in coronaviruses suggest this might be less of a problem100 similarly while hiv readily evades cellular and humoral immunity sharply limiting vaccination approaches101 sars-cov infection appeared to induce broad and long-lasting immunity with less evidence of immune escape102 thus it is likely that as covid-19 evolves physicians will have a variety of therapeutic and vaccination options to minimize morbidity and mortality until these arrive anesthesiologists will be called upon to provide supportive care while minimizing the risk of viral transmission to

interestsin late december 2019 china reported an outbreak of viral pneumonia in wuhan hubei province china which spread rapidly to other areas 1 2 it was revealed that the causative agent of the cluster of acute respiratory illness was an rna enveloped beta coronavirus from the sarbecovirus subgenus of coronaviridaes family which was termed the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 36 covid- 19 counts as the third outbreak of betacoronaviruses in the twenty-first century causing a public health crisis of global concern 7 8 previous outbreaks of this viral family have been described in 2002 and 2012 the former was a respiratory disease identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov involving 37 countries and the latter known as the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov affected 27 countries the overall mortality rate of these two epidemics of sars-cov and mers-cov was 10 and 37 respectively 4 912covid-19 is a global concern and has become a significant health problem since the number of infected cases and affected countries has escalated rapidly 13 on march 11 2020 the world health organization who confirmed covid-19 a pandemic as of march 31 2020 over 800000 cases of covid have been reported with a death toll of over 39000 patients and only around 141000 recovered cases in 199 countries and territories worldwide among the top-ranking countries iran was placed in seventh position with over 35000 confirmed cases and over 2500 deaths and only around 11600 recovered cases 14 15 however the actual number of cases may be much higher because of challenges in confirming the cases due to the limited pcr diagnostic test kits and available staff in the hospitalsbased on the literature the incubation period of the disease could be up to 14 days 16 most cases have mild symptoms of fever cough sore throat and myalgia however some cases can present with severe conditions such as multiple organ failure acute respiratory distress syndrome pulmonary edema and pneumonia 1719 based on radiological findings in previous studies the most frequent ct findings included bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities occasionally with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution 20 21 in respect to laboratory data a decrease in the absolute value of lymphocytes in most patients can be found 22 indicating that the virus may mainly act on lymphocytes especially t-cells damage to t lymphocytes can be a primary factor resulting in exacerbations of patients 23 in clinical practice a low absolute value of lymphocytes could assist as a reference index in diagnosing new cases of coronavirus infections due to the severity of the disease with over 20 critical patients and mortality rate of about 3 covid-19 is a global health emergency 24 therefore early detection and appropriate treatment of critical cases are of essential importanceat present there is a lack of information regarding the epidemiology and clinical features of covid-19 patients in the middle east especially iran a country which is considered as one of the most important focal points of the disease throughout the world therefore this study has been conducted to evaluate the clinical features of covid-19 patients in fars province southern iranthe center for control and prevention of 2019 novel coronavirus disease covid-19 was established on february 20 2020 to monitor the spread of the covid-19 in fars province irans fourth most populated province the center has been assigned to provide services to five hospitals affiliated by the shiraz university of medical sciences the approach to the disease was based on iran national health guidelines adapted from the who guidelines and the latest studies on covid-19 25 the incubation period of covid-19 has been defined as the time of exposure to the onset of illness which based on reports from china and all over the world was assumed to be between 3 to 14 days a patient with symptoms of fever rhinorrhea cough sore throat and possibly respiratory distress is defined as suspected of having covid-19 especially if there was a positive history of close contact with a highly suspected or confirmed covid-19 patient or having a travel history to a covid-19 affected country or city 26 confirmed covid-19 cases were admitted and quarantined in centers allocated for covid-19 diagnosis and under the management of shiraz university of medical sciencesthe severity of disease was based on the american thoracic society guidelines

particular variables the percentage of patients in each group was calculated unpaired students t-test chi-square test or fishers exact test was used to compare the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients as appropriate a p value of less than 005 was considered as indicating statistical significance all the statistical analyses were performed by the statistical package for social sciences spss inc chicago illinois usa version 260the study population consisted of 113 confirmed covid-19 cases with a mean age of 5375 years sd  1658 range 2099 the patients consisted of 71 628 males and 42 372 females among the patients in our study 11 97 were admitted to intensive care units due to the severity of their disease the average time between the initiation of symptoms until hospital admission was 563 days and the average duration of hospitalization was 620 days the average number of days from the start of symptoms until the development of dyspnea and progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards was 563 05 and 2 days respectively among the patients in our study 44 389 had one or more coexisting medical conditions alongside covid-19 the most frequent were hypertension 22 195 diabetes 16 142 and cardiovascular diseases 16 142 table 1
among the hospitalized patients the most common symptoms at onset of disease were fatigue 664 cough 646 and fever 593 while the less common were hemoptysis 62 and conjunctival congestion 15 table 1based on the patients vital signs on admission 77 681 of our patients had no fever also 12 106 had elevated heart rates  100min 2 18 had elevated respiratory rate  24min and 7 63 had elevated blood pressure on admission these values did not differ between severe and non-severe patients and were all lower among the deceased patients although not significant the oxygen saturation of the patients was also measured on admission which showed 39 345 of the patients had an o2 saturation of less than 90 also the mean saturation of o2 was significantly lower among the icu admitted patients p  0001 and was also significantly lower among the deceased patients p  005 table 2
in terms of the lung examinations only seven patients 259 had significant rales which were significantly correlated with the severity of the disease among the other signs of infection the most common were throat congestion 17 15 and swelling of the tonsils 871 table 1numerous variations in laboratory findings were seen among the severe and non-severe as well as the deceased and living patients table 3 icu admitted patients who had significantly higher lymphocyte count than non-icu patients although this correlation was not significant with the mortality rate of the patients in our study the severe group and the deceased group had higher levels of white blood cells and neutrophil count although lower levels of hemoglobin hematocrit and platelet count were detected compared to the non-severe and living groups these differences were not statistically significant based on coagulation tests there were significantly higher international normalized ratio inr levels and prolonged partial thromboplastin time ptt among the severe and non-severe group p  0001 however the significance of this finding among the deceased group was only valid for inr p  0001

the main treatments initiated for the patients consisted of antiviral therapy 113 100 antibiotic therapy 112 991 and corticosteroid 5 44 also based on oxygen support administered for the patients the majority of non-severe patients used nasal cannula 968 in addition for severe cases other modalities such as invasive mechanical ventilation non-invasive ventilation or high flow masks were used according to the condition of patients in our study patients using invasive mechanical ventilation had significantly higher mortality in our study p  001 table 1based on the prognosis of the disease an overall 8 mortality rate was documented among the patients in our study in which the majority were among the icu admitted patients 5 556 also 68 602 of our patients achieved total recovery and 7 62 were discharged with follow-up and home isolationbased on the results of this study up to march 30 2020 a total number of 113 patients were admitted to shiraz hospitals the capital of fars province iran with a diagnosis of covid-19 the mean age of hospitalized patients was 53 years old with a male to female ratio of 161 of these patients 29 257 are still hospitalized 68 602 were discharged 7 62 were discharged with outpatient treatment and 9 8 died 11 97 cases were admitted to the icu due to the severity of the diseasevirological findings indicated that some asian populations may potentially be more susceptible to covid-19 than other races 3133 chan et al confirmed the person-to-person transmission of the virus 16 our results showed that covid-19 infects men more than women these findings are consistent with the findings of the previous studies 1 3436 in early reports from china the susceptibility of men contracting the disease was believed to have a relationship with their link to the seafood market as most workers there were men 34 nevertheless as the disease spread to other countries throughout the world this theory was weakened as men were also more susceptible to the disease in other countries several theories have been proposed in this respect li et al reported that the male to female ratio can be attributed to the role of sex hormones and protection of the x chromosome which plays an essential role in adaptive and innate immunity 36 however it may be assumed that due to iranian culture men tend to have more person to person contact as they work outside the house more than women who usually stay at home and do household chorestaking the patients age into consideration most patients with severe conditions were aged over 50 years they had comorbid diseases such as hypertension and diabetes which is aligned with the data that has been previously reported 19 34 fang et al described a theory stating that since the coronavirus binds to its target through an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace-2 expressed by epithelial cells in kidney lung and blood vessels the infection can facilitate an increased risk of developing severe covid-19 in individuals who take ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii type-i receptor blockers arbs and also among diabetic patients as they tend to have an increase in ace-2 expression 3739putting aside the typical symptoms such as fever cough and myalgia 6 40 41 our data revealed that many patients presented with atypical symptoms such as abdominal pain diarrhea nausea vomiting and vertigo in a study carried out by lechien et al 42 in europe headache loss of smell rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction were among the most common symptoms of patients following typical symptoms moreover spinato et al stated that out of 202 confirmed covid-19 patients 130 644 reported to have an altered sense of smell or taste 43 however due to the design of our study and incomplete hospital records these data were not collected in our study these data suggest that aside from the focus on typical symptoms atypical presentations of the disease must be kept in mind as most of our patients developed gastrointestinal symptoms observed in earlier diagnosis and facilitated prevention of the spread of the disease moreover these differences in the presentation of the virus might be due to alterations in the virus genotype or the level of expression of the virus receptors including ace2 in which necessitates further studies and evaluationbased on our data those who had lower o2 saturation on admission and presented with rales on physical examination were significantly associated with being severely ill and achieving poorer prognosis furthermore those who were severely ill had lower heart rates and blood pressure these findings can be explained by the theory that coronavirus affects not only the respiratory system but also the cardiovascular system based on published studies covid-19 patients have had high levels of myocardial injury biomarkers in their blood samples 4 34 furthermore zheng et al stated that this myocardial injury might be related to ace2 which is widely expressed in the cardiovascular system as well as the respiratory system 44in terms of laboratory data abnormalities included leukocytosis in 108 lymphopenia in 126 thrombocytopenia in 156 pt and ptt in 779 and 458 were seen in the patients patients with severe conditions had higher increases in c - reactive protein and esr levels and those who died had higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase furthermore severe cases of covid-19 had more laboratory abnormalities than those who were admitted in general wards the same results have been reported in previous studies except for the fact that the number of cases with lymphopenia in our study was lower than other studies 1 28 34 45 46it is worth mentioning that in our study the nlr ratio was significantly higher in those who were admitted to the icu and those who died but the average level of nlr in most patients was higher than 313 therefore we assume that a higher cut off in approach to covid-19 patients based on the nlr ratio might be beneficial as lie et al reported the appropriate cutoff of 313 47 the overall results of laboratory data suggest that the novel coronavirus infection is associated with the activation of immune system responses with an impact on lymphocytes and the activation of the coagulation cascade thus further studies in this area can be beneficial in the treatment of covid-19based on our data 4 49 of our patients who were under 50 years old and not severely ill had normal chest ct scans hu et al also reported that 292 of the younger asymptomatic patients in his study had normal radiologic findings 48 most abnormal radiologic findings consisted of ground-glass opacities consolidation and crazy paving presented mostly in both lungs and peripheral areas these data which is consistent with other publications suggest that ct scan can play a crucial role in the diagnosis and evaluation of the severity of the disease 28 34 40the fatality rate of patients included in the current study was 8 which is quite near to the national mortality rate in iran which was reported to be 7 based on documented covid-19 patients but was significantly higher compared to most studies from china 34 49 50 although some of which reported higher or equal mortality rate in hospitalized patients 36 41 given that china had a history of sars outbreak in 2003 they were able to successfully control the disease with the help of their previous experience and appropriate leadership inadequate awareness towards the disease in the early stages lack of medical protection high infectivity of the virus and lack of treatment measures in iran led to a rapid increase in the number of patients and mortality rate 51 moreover since those who developed mild symptoms did not seek medical treatment the actual mortality rate in the society might be even lowercontrolling the source of infection taking preventive measures early diagnosis isolation of suspicious cases and supportive care have been taken into consideration to cease the spread of the virus although many randomized controlled trials have been initiated around the world no specific treatment or vaccine has of yet been proposed for covid-19 antiviral and antibiotic therapies have been used to treat covid-19 however none of them were found to be properly beneficial 34 46 in the present study all of the patients received antiviral therapy all except one received antibiotic treatment and 5 cases 44 received corticosteroidsas with any hospital-based study this study has its own limitations firstly we encountered some missing data as there were variations in patients documents in two hospitals due to the limited time and shortage of trained medical staff secondly some patients were still being admitted to the hospital during the time of writing the manuscript which could have affected the outcome results thirdly due to the limited number of patients and given the fact that most patients with mild symptoms were not hospitalized and were not included in the study further community-based studies are justified to explore and clarify the different aspects of this disease in iran as one of the most important focal points of the diseasein this multicenter case series of 113 hospitalized patients an 8 mortality rate for the covid-19 patients in south of iran was reported some patients developed atypical symptoms at the time of admission which makes the diagnosis difficult finding the source of infection and studying the behavior of covid-19 is crucial for understanding the pandemic furthermore early diagnosis improving detection methods timely isolation and proper treatment are the key factors in fighting this infectioncoronaviruses are rna viruses and may infect the respiratory gastrointestinal hepatic and central nervous systems of humans livestock species avian species many mammals and wild animals1 in humans infection by four coronaviruses namely hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 usually lead to mild self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections2 however other coronaviruses such as those associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers may cause severe respiratory disease and have caused a total of more than 10000 laboratory-confirmed cases globally in the past two decades with a 10 and 344 case-fatality rate respectively34 in december 2019 a novel coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov emerged in wuhan hubei china with clinical manifestations in humans resembling that of viral pneumonia5 by february 25 2020 about 77780 confirmed cases have been identified in china with 2666 deaths worryingly 2459 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 have now been identified outside of china6symptoms of infection are non-specific and include fever cough and myalgia7 with diarrhea with or without the subsequent development of dyspnea8 severe cases with respiratory distress sepsis and septic shock have been reported9during the sars epidemic of 2003 therapeutic systemic glucocorticoids were widely administered in patients who were infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and who subsequently developed severe respiratory disease one cohort study of patients during the sars outbreak showed that the use of pulsed high-dose methylprednisolone was associated with clinical improvement in patients with sars10 in another study of 20 patients with sars certain cytokine levels interleukin-8 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and th1 chemokine interferon--inducible protein-10 were found to be reduced after 5 to 8 days of glucocorticoid therapy11 however a previous retrospective study indicated that pulsed doses of methylprednisolone was a risk factor associated with increased 30-day mortality adjusted odds ratio 260 95 confidence interval 441548 p  000112 in addition a further retrospective observational study found that glucocorticoid therapy in patients with mers was associated with delayed middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov rna clearance13 the clinical therapeutic and other effects of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in patients with covid-19 is not currently clear and the case for and against the use of systemic glucocorticoids in severe cases of covid-19 warrants further investigationour study proposes to investigate the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with severe covid-19 our major objective is to observe whether there is a clinical necessity or therapeutic justification for the use of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with severe covid-19the study was approved by the ethics committee of the chongqing public health medical center no 2020-003-01-ky we will publish the results of our study in medical journals at the

according to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 version 6 patients randomized to the intervention group will receive methylprednisolone intravenous injection 12 mgkgday for 3 days whereas those in the control group will not receive glucocorticoid therapy discontinuation of the regimen may occur for those participants who have no substantial improvement after a full course of treatment or for those subjects whose clinical condition deteriorate during the course of treatmentthe primary endpoint is the change in sequential organ failure assessment sofa at 3 days after randomization17 the secondary endpoints are proportion of mechanical ventilation use at 2 and 4 weeks mortality at 2 and 4 weeks and duration of hospitalizationthis trial is a randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups without masking and with a 11 allocation ratio up to now no randomized controlled trials have evaluated changes in sofa scores in patients with 2019-ncov infection with or without glucocorticoid therapy the sample-size calculation is based on the primary hypothesis of detecting a reduction of 40 in sofa scores between the treatment and non-treatment groups after 3 days of glucocorticoid therapy pass software version 15 ncss llc kaysville ut usa will be used with a power of 80 and a level of 95 confidence considering a dropout rate of 5 the sample size is estimated to be 24 cases in each group a randomized controlled trial in 2003 aimed to compare the plasma sars-cov rna concentrations in patients in an early hydrocortisone-treated group with patients in a placebo group18 this study only enrolled a total of 17 subjects because it was conducted at the end of the sars outbreak and fewer appropriate patients were available to be recruited taking into account the uncertainty of the duration of the outbreak the final sample size may be adjusted unlike wuhan chongqing currently has a relatively small number of confirmed cases of covid-19 and an even smaller number of severe cases of covid-19 it is hoped that we do eventually recruit a cohort of 48 patients for our study but we may have to settle for an even smaller cohort should suitable subjects not be availablethe primary outcome analysis will be presented for the intervention group and control group using descriptive statistics the normality of the data distribution will be evaluated by the

its potential for propagating large-scale human infection and economic disruption systemic glucocorticoid therapy could be considered for critically ill patients with covid-19 but their impact on clinical outcomes is uncertain16 available data on systemic glucocorticoid therapy among coronavirus-infected patients mainly comes from studies of patients with sars and mers but whether glucocorticoid therapy is definitively beneficial in the clinical management of these two coronavirus infections is still being debated132021glucocorticoid therapy was used in the treatment of severe sars because early anecdotal experience supported it and radiologic findings and histologic features of critically ill patients with sars were similar to those of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards22-25 as early as march 2003 china first summarized its experience in the management of sars and suggested that high-dose glucocorticoids should be used if patients had fever persisting for more than 3 days or radiologic findings were suggestive of persistent lung involvement or progressive deterioration26 there were three different regimens used by physicians in hong kong china including methylprednisolone 12 mgkg qid or 24 mgkg tid iv followed by oral prednisolone for varying periods and of disparate dosages as per clinical evaluation hydrocortisone 2 mgkg qid or 4 mgkg tid iv followed by oral prednisolone for varying periods and doses as per clinical evaluation and pulsed methylprednisolone 500 mg iv daily for 5 days followed by maintenance oral prednisolone 50 mg bid reduced to 2030 mg daily on day 21 and as per clinical evaluation27some suggested glucocorticoid therapeutic doses during the sars outbreak were very high approximating the treatment doses for acute severe asthma and some prescribed doses were similar to those prescribed for organ rejection in transplant patients or for ards23 one study compared pulsed glucocorticoid therapy methylprednisolone 500 mgday with non-pulsed glucocorticoid methylprednisolone 500 mgday therapy finding that pulsed glucocorticoid therapy appeared to be a more efficacious with patients using pulsed glucocorticoid therapy having lower oxygen requirements better radiographic outcomes and decreased likelihood of requiring rescue unfortunately the stated study was not a randomized controlled trial and is thus open to the possibility of bias having an impact on outcomes23 however there were also staunch advocates for not using systemic glucocorticoids in these patients one systematic review of studies on patients with sars-cov including 29 studies documenting glucocorticoid use found 25 studies that were inconclusive regarding the role of the adjunctive use of glucocorticoids and four studies demonstrated that the use of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with sars may cause possible harm28 a prospective randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial compared early hydrocortisone treatment before day 7 of the illness with placebo finding that early hydrocortisone therapy was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load18 meanwhile many possible complications of glucocorticoid use such as profound immunosuppression with the possible emergence of severe commensal and other viral and bacterial infections invasive fungal infections osteonecrosis and psychosis may occur with prolonged and high-dose glucocorticoid therapy29-34glucocorticoid therapy was also commonly used for critically ill patients with mers in one study hypoxemic patients with mers-cov pneumonia who had moderate levels of positive end-expiratory pressure were initiated on glucocorticoid therapy13 in these patients there was no difference in 90-day mortality and these patients were associated with delayed mers-cov rna clearance many patients with severe mers were treated with systemic high-dose glucocorticoids intending to reverse the progression of respiratory distress and to prevent lung fibrosis however this approach has not been proven to be successful35 one study including a total of 314 patients with symptomatic mers-cov found that glucocorticoid use was associated with increased mortality in these patients36 a retrospective cohort study compared 151 patients in the glucocorticoid group with 158 patients in the non-glucocorticoid group finding that mortality in the glucocorticoid group was similar to that of the non-glucocorticoid group but that glucocorticoid therapy was associated with delayed mers-cov rna clearance after adjustment for baseline and time-varying confounding factors13after infection with 2019-ncov occurs some patients develop mild symptoms but a significant fraction of patients progress to severe ards and require intensive care737 the use of glucocorticoids in patients with ards is still controversial because of divergent results in the existing literature38 high-dose glucocorticoid is one of the most frequently used adjuncts in ards 179 in 50 countries even though their effectiveness in the management of acute lung injury is not yet clear39 one systematic review conducted an analysis of individual patient data from randomized trials and demonstrated that compared with the placebo group prolonged glucocorticoid treatment did improve clinical outcomes40 another randomized controlled trial showed that glucocorticoid therapy could down-regulate ards-related inflammation and was associated with significant improvements in lung and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction as well as reduce mechanical ventilation duration and intensive care unit hospital admission duration41 studies by meduri et al4243 found that prolonged methylprednisolone treatment may complement positive modulation of systemic inflammation by inducing recovery from induced glucocorticoid resistance and co-existing decreased production of endogenous glucocorticoids4243 animal experiments in recent years have provided evidence for the use of glucocorticoids to reduce inflammation the attenuation of acute lung injury and reduction in mortality during the acute phase of severe disease4445 however other studies have suggested that glucocorticoid therapy in ards is not necessary and may even aggravate the clinical picture the use of hydrocortisone improves lung function in sepsis-associated ards but no significant survival benefit has been observed in these patients46 a higher mortality rate has been observed in patients with ards who took high-dose glucocorticoids within 7 days after hospital admission compared with those who were treated without high-dose glucocorticoid47existing studies on ards have not assessed the effects of glucocorticoids in identical types of patients or identical processes of the disease48 therefore the results for these studies cannot be considered to be congruent adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy in specific diseases causing ards such as pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia has been shown to reduce mortality in adult patients49additionally the dosage of the glucocorticoid used needs to be factored in high-dose glucocorticoid therapy may increase ventilator dependence and may possibly induce a worse outcome50 the development of osteonecrosis was discovered in patients receiving high-dose glucocorticoids during the sars epidemic in 2003 and the number of osteonecrotic lesions was directly related to the dosage of the glucocorticoid prescribed5152 additionally high-dose glucocorticoid use is one of the causes for neuropsychiatric outcomes in patients with sars53 it has been noted that if lung injury has been effectively controlled appropriate doses of glucocorticoids based on disease severity may be beneficial for better outcomes of sars1021 in our study we will investigate whether the use of mid-dose and short-course adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy to treat severe covid-19 is advantageous safe and effectivethis work was supported by the chongqing special research project for prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia no cstc2020jscx-fyzx0074nonesevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 is a novel coronavirus first detected in wuhan china that causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-191 since initial virus detection more than 1350000 cases of covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide with the first reported cases in the lombardy region northern italy occurring on end of february 20202 the number of cases in our region continues to rise as of april 2 2020 there had been 46071 confirmed sars-cov-2 infections and 7600 deaths3
at least seven relatively large-scale case studies from china have reported the clinical features of patients with covid-194 5 6 7 8 9 10 these data indicate that 211 of patients with covid-19 had pre-existing liver diseases recently grasselli et al reported that among the first 1591 patients admitted to intensive care units icu in lombardy due to sars-cov-2 infection 3 had a history of chronic liver disease11 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis might be more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection because of their systemic immunocompromised status moreover in these patients the severity of covid-19 and the rate of complications potentially leading to increased liver-related mortality might be more pronounced than in general population this hypothesis derives from studies on bacterial infections a common cause of decompensation in patients with cirrhosis conversely data on the impact of viral infections have been less studied in this population12 it has been reported that viral influenza may increase the risk of decompensation in cirrhotic patients and recently a high risk of hepatic function deterioration during the pandemic of 2009 h1n1 influenza virus even in patients with stable liver disease has been reported13 in the study by premkumar et al 82 of patients with cirrhosis and ah1n109 died of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome despite timely antiviral treatment with the severity of both respiratory distress and kidney impairment being independent predictors of mortality13
since data on covid-19 in patients with cirrhosis are lacking we performed a multicenter retrospective study to describe the demographic clinical and biochemical characteristics of cirrhotic patients with sars-cov-2 infection in the lombardy region and their outcomeswe included cirrhotic patients with laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection who were managed in nine hospitals in lombardy northern italy between march 1st and march 31th 2020 therefore all information registered by 3 april 2020 data-lock were entered into the databasea confirmed case of sars-cov-2 was defined by a positive result on a reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction rt-pcr assay of a specimen collected on a nasopharyngeal swab as previously described5 demographic and clinical data including clinical symptoms or signs at presentation laboratory and radiologic results during covid-19 management as well as administered antiviral therapies and anti-thrombotic prophylaxis were collected all laboratory tests and radiologic assessments were performed at treating physician discretion data of the last outpatient clinic visit before covid-19 were also collected for comparison when sars-cov-2 infection occurred during hospitalization data of covid-19 diagnosis were compared to those collected at hospital admissionthe steering committee for the covid-19 studies at foundation irccs ca granda ospedale maggiore policlinico approved the study which was notified to the ethical committee of milan area 2 the protocol complies with the ethical guidelines of the 1975 declaration of helsinkiliver function was evaluated by means of both biochemical ie bilirubin international normalized ratio inr albumin creatinine and clinical variables ie occurrence of ascites encephalopathy bleeding disorders for each patient child-pugh-turcotte cpt and the model for end-stage liver disease meld clif-of clif-c scores were assessed liver injury was defined as alanine aminotransferase alt level  30 ul for males and 19 ul for females in those patients with normal alt levels at last outpatient visit14 hepatic flare was defined as alt level 5 x upper limit of normality acute on chronic liver failure aclf at diagnosis of covid-19 was retrospectively defined and graded according to the easl-clif definition15

outcome of cirrhotic patients either with compensated or decompensated liver disease who develop covid-19 the main causes of death were respiratory complications but also the sudden worsening of liver function leading to end-stage liver disease to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the clinical impact of sars-cov-2 infection in patients with cirrhosiswe retrospectively collected data on 50 patients with known cirrhosis and covid-19 managed in nine hospitals in lombardy interestingly a health-care related sars-cov-2 infection was registered in 40 of our patients this fact could be the consequence of their general increased need of hospitalization and assistance due to cirrhosis complications as well as their increased susceptibility to infections according to the italian iss report the nosocomial sars-cov-2 infection rate was 99 in italy which is lower than what we observed in our cohort moreover the clinical presentation of sars-cov-2 infection in our cohort of cirrhotics slightly differed from what reported in the general population indeed fever was less frequent16 whilst an expected increase in cirrhosis complications rate was observed particularly hepatic encephalopathy in our study the 30-days mortality rate was higher in those patients with moderatesevere respiratory failure and in those who had a more deteriorated liver function as indicated by the increased meld and clif-of scores at covid-19 diagnosis while the association between severity of lung failure and early mortality was expected this study is the first to define the predictive role of clif and meld scores in the setting of acute failure of chronic liver disease due to covid-19the corresponding 30-day mortality rate in non-cirrhotic patients hospitalized following covid-19 diagnosis was significantly lower with higher median age of deceased patients unfortunately no data are available on the role of factors ie co-morbidities lung failure severity etc potentially influencing mortality rates in this control group as the icd-9 system has been used for data collection in the same period 7600 16 of 46071 patients with sars-cov-2 infection died in lombardy with a median age of 79 years 73-87 these data significantly differ from what reported in our cirrhotic cohort characterized by a higher mortality rate and lower age at deathmoreover our study highlighted that infection with sars-cov-2 led to rapid clinical deterioration in otherwise stable cirrhotic patients 25 cpt a patients with low meld score experienced a rapid deterioration in their liver function so that cpt score increased to bc after covid-19 diagnosis in more than a third of them this was even worst for those patients with a decompensated disease before sars-cov-2 infection since we reported that high meld scores at last visit independently predicted the risk of meld15 at covid-19 diagnosis the short interval between the last outpatient visit or hospital admission before sars-cov-2 diagnosis supports the role of this acute infection in worsening liver function which is common in cirrhotic patients of any aetiology the comparative analysis with cirrhotic patients hospitalized for decompensation due to bacterial infections confirmed that mortality rate due to infections is high independently of the etiological agent however the 30-day mortality for covid-19 cirrhotics was higher than that reported among cirrhotics hospitalized following bacterial infections although meld score was lower in the former group multivariate analysis confirmed that covid-19 together with high clif-of was independently associated with 30-day mortality this is probably due to several factors which include the unavailability of effective treatments against sars-cov-2 as well as the impact of lung failure on early mortality even in patients who died because of esld in fact also in cirrhotic patients who died for esld respiratory function had been severely compromised by sars-cov-2 since all of them needed respiratory supportseveral papers reported the impact of sars-cov-2 infection on transaminases levels in the general population although they were not specifically focused on the clinical significance of these alterations in terms of both morbidity and mortality especially in cirrhotic patients18 in the setting of chronic liver diseases persistent andor severe alteration of transaminases may negatively impact cirrhosis course also in those patients who had remained stable and free from liver-complications for long time recently dong et al reported a 50 alt increase in 202 consecutive patients with confirmed covid-19 which included 38 with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease nafld interestingly the authors reported that nafld patients had higher likelihood of abnormal liver function tests from admission to discharge 70 5376 vs 111 14126 p0000118 our study is the first reporting the impact of sars-cov-2 infection on alt levels in patients with cirrhosis showing that acute liver injury was observed in nearly a half of patients with previously normal transaminases values moreover a hepatitis flare was not uncommon at sars-cov-2 diagnosis however more data are needed to clarify the impact of alt increase in the natural history of cirrhotic patients with sars-cov-2 and to better explain the pathogenic mechanism of coronavirus in causing liver damage at the level of liver cells a potential direct cytopathic effect has been suggested since the abundant ace2 receptors in the liver might favour sars-cov-2 entry into the hepatocytes19 otherwise the liver might be indirectly involved in the severe inflammatory response following sars-cov-2 infection as it contains a large number of macrophages kupffer cells and is a potent cytokine producer20
specific treatment against sars-cov-2 was not standardized in our cohort but rather based upon regional guidelines issued by scientific societies and expert opinions single physicians decision on every patient was the balance between rapidly available repurposed drugs and acceptable tolerability and safety most of the patients received hydroxychloroquine while only one third received lopinavirritonavir with all the caveats of a small sample size only one major adverse event was reported qt prolongation leading to drug discontinuation generally lopinavirritonavir has been used cautiously in patients with more advanced cirrhosis due to its known hepatic metabolism and its possible detrimental effect on residual hepatic function at the time of data collection a phase ii trial with tocilizumab was available only in few referral centers thus excluding the chance to enrol patients with cirrhosis in the period before data-lock access to remdesivir was reserved to mechanically ventilated patients on the basis of a treating physician-initiated request in a compassionate use program the two intubated patients of our cohort did not receive remdesivir the reason for not applying for compassionate use in these two cases are unknown but could be due to the difficult access in programs of experimental drugs in the dramatic hospital emergency we faced in march 2020 in lombardyinterestingly most patients 80 in our cohort received thromboprophylaxis mainly with lmwh without any evidence of major haemorrhagic complications the high prevalence of thromboprophylaxis in our cohort might be explained by the established awareness of the increased thrombotic risk in this population as well as by the ascertained skill in anti-thrombotic management in most centers dealing with cirrhotic patientswe are aware that our study suffers from some limitations mainly due to the retrospective design of the study they include the limited number of patients the short follow-up following the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection and the low number of patients admitted in icus however we believe that this last point might be not only a consequence of the retrospective collection of data but also of the effective limited access to icus of patients with severe comorbidities such as cirrhotics in fact during the study period we faced with a dramatic scarcity of bed in icus trying to cope with the awesome outbreak of sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 in italy another limitation is the imbalance of baseline characteristics age and meld between patients with viral and bacterial infection although multivariate analysis confirmed sars-cov-2 infection as an independent predictor of 30-day mortality on the other hand strengths of our study are the involvement of most tertiary referral centers for both infectious and liver diseases in lombardy thus limiting the risk of underestimating the number of hospitalized cirrhotics within our regionas well as the availability of historical information for almost all patients the inclusion of control groups of well characterized hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and acute decompensation following bacterial infection and without cirrhosis but with covid-19 further strengthens the present studyin conclusion as the current pandemic of sars-cov-2 is spreading physicians and hepatologists should be aware of the potential detrimental effects of this infection on the short-term outcome of such a fragile patient population as cirrhotics

towards the end of 2019 a novel respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first reported from wuhan the capital of hubei province in the peoples republic of china this illness has already been assigned the name coronavirus disease-19 covid-19 by the world health organization who1 sars-cov-2 belongs to a family of viruses that cause a variety of symptoms that range in severity from mild cold symptoms to more severe infections which disproportionately account for a high mortality rate among the elderly and individuals that are immunocompromised the pandemic has now reached almost every country on the globe at least 199 countries at the time of writing the epidemiological variability and lethality of covid-19 in general and specific populations have been reported23 the world is currently witnessing substantial disruption of daily lives socially psychologically and economically as a result of the progression of the covid-19 pandemicas the pandemic rumbles through nations leaving behind considerable death and damaged economies no effective treatment seems to be in sight as of now4 preventive measures enveloped in public health advocacy both at the individual and societal levels and reinforced by national regulations seem to be our best bet of shortening the life span of the pandemic various countries have instituted diverse policies and laws to protect their citizens as the natural history of the disease progresses however just as we witness differences in the degree of public health preparedness across nations we are also subdued by the lack of simple epidemiological tools that could capture in broad terms the comparative effectiveness of measures put in place by different countries to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on human lives in this paper we present a simple epidemiological tool that could be utilized globally to test the relative efficiency of measures put in place to avert death resulting from covid-19 infection for simplicity we refer to this assessment tool as the pandemic efficiency index or pei the pei could be used to potentially rank countries and assist in distilling best practices from those countries with optimal outcomes in a pandemic the higher the pei the greater the efficiency of the country in protecting its citizens from death resulting from the covid-19 pandemic using pei nations can learn and adapt best practices in pandemic control from each other nations can systematically reverse-engineer the practices that countries with higher pei used to achieve lower covid-19-related mortalitywe collected information on current details of covid-19 cases across the globe from worldometer5 worldometer is an independent company that operates a reference website acknowledged by the american library association as one of the best free online reference sources in the world the website has been providing live updates on covid-19 related total cases new cases deaths recoveries and critical cases by country territory or conveyance worldometer gathers and compiles the information from various sources including newspapers government websites and social media such as twitter etc the countries with more than 5000 cases of coronavirus as of march 29 2020 were included in this study and were classified as high impact countrieswe calculated the mortality rate by dividing the total deaths by total number of cases associated with the disease for each high impact territory as the disease originated in china we used chinas mortality rate as the reference the formula for covid-19 pandemic efficiency index pei for a country x was derived as  for example china had a total of 81439 cases and 3300 deaths yielding a mortality rate of 00405 or 405 italy had 97689 cases and 10779 deaths corresponding to a mortality rate of 01103 or 1103 therefore  pei is a comparative tool which uses the mortality rate of the pandemics country of origin as the reference case lastly we ranked the countries based on their peisas of march 29 2020 there were a total of 704401 covid-19 cases globally 33226 of which resulted in death yielding a worldwide mortality rate of 472 a total of 16 countries reported more than 5000 cases of covid-19 infections the united states of america usa had the highest number of reported cases of 133039 followed by italy which reported more than 97000 cases so far however italy had the highest number of reported deaths 10779 with a pei of 037 other countries with a pei lower than that of china included the islamic republic of iran 059 the united kingdom 064 spain 048 and netherlands 057the global ranking of high-impact countries based on covid -19 pei is illustrated in figure 1 germany a country with the fifth largest number of cases 60659 has so far experienced 482 deaths resulting from covid-19 infection and had the highest pei 509 among the high impact countries austria with 5672 cases had the second highest pei of 409 followed by canada 379 and turkey 285 the usa was 6th on the list with a pei of 228 italy and france were the countries with the lowest pei of 04 and 03 respectivelycovid-19 is the latest global health threat confronting nations research and medical communities with national and global efforts applauded and criticized6 almost 3 months after the first confirmed case of the virus was identified in china who declared the disease as a pandemic making it the first such declaration since the 2009 h1n1 swine flu outbreak the who had estimated covid-19 mortality rate to be 34 about three weeks ago7 however due to the rapid progression of the disease and differential efficiency in disease and mortality prevention across affected countries the mortality rate had risen to 472 as of march 29 2020 covid-19 has been more deadly than the 2009 h1n1 swine flu pandemic which registered a case fatality rate of 02 for the first time since the outbreak wuhan in china reported no new cases on march 19th 2020 while the usa acquired the status of the country reporting the largest number of new covid-19 infections worldwide according to various analyses by the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc older adults and those with underlying comorbidities like heart disease lung disease or diabetes are more vulnerable to the severe forms of covid-19 and to die from the disease8 from our results we observed that citizens of countries that performed worse on our pei scale ie had low pei such as italy spain uk etc had a higher median age than their counterparts from other parts of the world what was most surprising was the low mortality rate 079 and the highest pei 509 of germany in spite of the fact that it ranks 4th in the world for the highest median age9 austria and portugal were the other two countries with a high pei and median age above 44 yearspei is an innovative tool to compare countries in terms of the impact of their disaster preparedness and management protocols although covid-19 is a global affliction different countries have adopted different approaches to confronting the pandemic pei represents a simple and intuitive epidemiologic tool to compare the efficiency of policies and strategies that various countries have been adopting to curtail the impact of the covid-19 pandemic lessons learned from these natural experiments would allow us to identify effective measures against mortality from countries with high pei due to pandemic dynamics with numbers constantly changing it is possible that the final pei will only be available by the end of the current pandemicthe novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is generating a large amount of scientific literature and controversies since its detection on december 2019 in wuhan china the infection rapidly spread worldwide becoming pandemic in a few weeks probably through the large amount of international air travel many mass public gatherings and the lack of appropriate precautions there is no doubt that this is one of the greatest and worst pandemics in human history it should be an alert for the promotion of changes in lifestyles information from initial hospitalized patients in china suggested that older age and having comorbidities were associated with more severe disease and mortality in addition in men covid-19 is a more severe disease with a higher mortality rate than in women 1 2 3xie et al 3 reported 168 chinese patients who died during the acute phase of the disease of these 126 were men with a median age of 70 interquartile range 64-78 161 958 were older than 50 years and 744 had one or more co-morbidities guan et al 1 also reported data from 1099 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients from 552 hospitals of 30 chinese provinces through january 2020 a total of 419 were women and those with severe disease were older by a median of 7 years than those without severe disease the presence of any coexisting illness was also more common among those with severe disease as opposed to those with non-severe disease 387 vs 210a systematic review by rozenberg et al 4 suggested a higher mortality risk in men than in women the authors also reviewed different factors associated with covid-19-related fatalities the zhu et al 5 meta-analysis summarizes the most relevant aspects of the new disease among chinese people and reported that males accounted for 533 of all deaths during the past months there have been several reports highlighting the fact that mortality is higher in men than in women in england wales and germany 6 hence the objective of the present study was to examine if the mortality risk by gender in europe is different from or similar to that in chinaa pubmed search strategy was performed using the following terms covid-19 or sars and europe and mortality and gender that yielded 7 publications however there was no information regarding the specific topic in terms of comparing fatalities by gender in different european countries in addition the pre-print medrxiv 7 and biorxiv 8 repository servers of scientific research were searched on may 2 2020 a search was also performed on google on may 20 2020 using the same strategy rendering a list of 7020000 items and sites with relevant information the first 15 items reported the most consulted information on the matter and were more targeted on the issue of mortality gender differences in patients with covid-19 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 this procedure has been previously validated to obtain relevant medical information through google 24 the remaining web links up to the initial 200 top google references did not report different specific information regarding covid-19 mortality by gender in european countriesthe only source of information about mortality related to covid-19 by gender in european countries was the global health 5050 repository 9 we extracted public information accumulated up to may 23 2020 from this data repository related to mortality by country and gender global health 5050 is a nonprofit organization that highlights gender health inequalities and is currently studying along with the cable news network 25 the influence of gender on the evolution of covid-19 for the present analysis we extracted information reported online by country 9 and up to may 23 2020 from the corresponding national authoritiesresults were eligible if information on mortality and number of cases was separately reported by gender in european countries two researchers independently evaluated study eligibility and discrepancies during the study selection process were discussed and resolved through author consensusthe primary outcome was mortality due to covid-19 affecting men and women separately reported by gender other outcomes were not available definitions for case inclusion were based on national standards at the time of each country report extracted data included country the total number of covid-19 cases and the total number of related deaths both indicators by gender and as reported by the corresponding national authorities if some of these variables were not available for extraction the country was excluded meta-analyzed countries are presented in fig 1

2 was still  65there are several limitations related to the available data on mortality associated with the covid-19 pandemic at the present time there is no scientific reports that compare the mortality rate by gender in european countries results are reported in a heterogeneous manner in different european countries and the analyzed data from global health 5050 include this limitation the current total number of covid-19-related deaths is likely to be higher than the number of confirmed deaths we suggest different reasons for this i under-recording is most likely a result of limited testing capacity and problems in the attribution of the cause of death ii recorded covid-19-related in death registries may differ between countries eg some may only count hospital deaths whilst other have started to include deaths at home or deaths in residential settings for the elderly iii some countries delay reporting covid-19--related deaths hence data are not always up to date and iv the available information by gender does not include age which may be a confounding factor in the current meta-analysis despite the aforementioned limitations to the best of our knowledge the global health 5050 is the only current source of european information reporting by genderdespite the mentioned limitations our analysis has strengths indeed it was based on a potential covid-19-related outcome that requires reporting death in relation to the number of cases stratified by gender in european countries that supposedly have the obligation to report health outcomes to supranational organisationsthe current analysis allows the conclusion to be drawn that men living in europe have a significantly higher risk of covid-19-related death however more detailed information is urgently needed to examine the factors involved in covid-19 mortality including age basal health status co-morbidity and lifestyle in this sense unfortunately the european centre for disease prevention and control 31 which is the agency in charge of information at supranational level does not report the aforementioned covid-19-related information there is an urgent need for this situation to be improvedin conclusion during the last months the mortality rate related to the covid-19 pandemic was significantly higher in european males than in european females but the causes or mechanisms and circumstances of this difference were not identifiable with the available evidence supranational health authorities should design appropriate strategies to overcome the lack of accurate informationfaustino r prez-lpez conceived designed supervised and drafted the article extracted data from the global health 5050 repository and calculated outcomes of interestmauricio tajada contributed to the searches on pubmed google and preprint repositoriesricardo savirn-cornudella contributed to the searches on pubmed google and preprint repositoriesmanuel snchez-prieto contributed to the searches on pubmed google and preprint repositoriespeter chedraui extracted data from the global health 5050 repository and calculated outcomes of interestenrique tern extracted data from the global health 5050 repository and calculated outcomes of interestall authors contributed to interpreting the results and approved the final manuscriptthe authors declare that they have no conflict of interestthis research was partially supported by the sistema de investigacin y desarrollo and the vice-rectorado de investigacin  postgrado of the universidad catlica de santiago de guayaquil guayaquil ecuador through grant no siu-318853-2014 the omega ii womens health project 2014 provided to peter chedrauithis article was not commissioned and was externally peer reviewed
