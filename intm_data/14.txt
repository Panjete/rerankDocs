clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of spreaders of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus during the 2015 outbreak in korea chang kang kyung kyoung-ho song pyoeng choe gyun wan park beom ji bang hwan eu kim suk sang park won hong kim bin nam kim joong sung-il cho jong-koo lee myoung-don oh   middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is a novel beta-coronavirus first identified in saudi arabia in 2012 1 it causes severe acute respiratory infection with a mortality rate of 36 2 most mers-cov infections occur in the middle east although travel-associated mers cases have been reported in 17 countries outside the middle east as of november 3 2016 27 countries reported 1813 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with mers-cov including 645 deaths to the world health organization who 2 in the korean outbreak of mers-cov in 2015 the first known patient was a businessman returning from the middle east the outbreak was amplified by super-spreading events at hospitals and movement of patients between hospitals spreading events occurred until late june 2015 more than a month after the index patient was identified resulting in a total of 186 patients with mers-cov infection and 38 fatalities which is the largest outbreak outside the arabian peninsula 34 during the outbreak almost 17000 individuals at epidemiologic risk were quarantined and all laboratory-confirmed cases were admitted to hospitals for isolation of mers-cov cases 44100 of individual outbreaks were linked to hospitals 56 and a nosocomial outbreak of mers-cov may result in a large cluster of cases the so called super-spreading events 67 however it is not known whether the spreading events are attributable to host factors such as clinical manifestations or epidemiologic factors such as duration of the nonisolated period 8 to understand the transmission risk of mers-cov in healthcare settings we assessed the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of non-spreaders spreaders and super-spreaders during the korean outbreak all laboratory-confirmed cases were admitted to government-designated hospitals regardless of the severity of their illness they were discharged after the resolution of all clinical symptoms and when 2 consecutive daily sputum samples were negative for mers-cov by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr laboratory diagnoses were made according to the who guideline 9 we reviewed the publically available epidemiologic database compiled by the korea centers for disease control and prevention 3 and clinical database compiled by the korean society of infectious diseases ksid 10 infectious disease specialists who had cared for mers patients completed case record form which ksid developed the clinical data included demographics clinical features and the results of the laboratory tests government daily reports and local korean news reports on the mers outbreak were also reviewed 11 a spreader was defined as an index patient who was suspected of causing a secondary infection of mers-cov super-spreaders and usual-spreaders were defined as those who transmitted mers-cov to 6 or more and those who transmitted to fewer than 6 individuals respectively nonisolated in-hospital days were defined as the sum of calendar days of the patients hospital stay before being effectively isolated chest radiographs at presentation were analyzed and the number of abnormal lung zones which were arbitrarily divided into 6 areas was counted for subgroup analyses we censored cases with symptom onset after june 7 after which stricter infection control measures were implemented by the government such as public disclosure of the names of affected hospitals organizing rapid response teams and applying stronger surveillance and isolation policies 12 healthcare workers were also censored in another subgroup analyses because many wore personal protective equipment which could also confound the transmission risk multivariate analyses in a forward stepwise manner were performed with p  0050 as the threshold for entering and removing variables for all analyses a 2-tailed p value of 005 was considered significant statistical analyses were performed with pasw for windows version 18 software package spss inc chicago il usa the institutional review board at the seoul national university hospital approved the study the board waived the requirement for written consent irb registration number 1607-062-775 characteristics of 186 patients with laboratory-confirmed mers-cov infection are shown in table 1 of them 15 patients 81 transmitted mers-cov the spreader group to others and 171 patients 919 did not the non-spreader group age sex and underlying diseases were not different between the 2 groups among the spreaders 5 patients 333 were super-spreaders while 10 667 were usual-spreaders baseline characteristics of these 2 groups were not significantly different at presentation patients in the spreader group were more likely than those in the non-spreader group to have a fever of  385c 400 vs 130 p  0009 and a tachypnea of  24 breaths per minute 333 vs 124 p  0034 they were

parameters were not different between super-spreaders and usual-spreaders the course of disease spread could not be determined in 10 patients including 5 with an unidentified source of infection and 5 with more than one possible scenario excluding the first imported case the courses of disease spread could be determined in 175 patients of them 173 were infected at healthcare facilities 12 hospitals 3 clinics and 2 ambulances the disease was transmitted to 2 remaining patients in household settings the date of symptom onset could not be determined in 5 patients including 2 patients who were asymptomatic and 3 with an ambiguous onset of mers-cov symptoms during another illness of the 15 spreaders 5 and 8 cases were in the second- and third-chain of transmission respectively table 2

1281935 p  0021 and a more nonisolated in-hospital days aor 563 per 1 day 95 ci 1102875 p  0038 were associated with the spreader groups supplementary tables 4 and 5 hospital outbreaks were the defining characteristic of the korean mers-cov outbreak in 2015 in this study spreaders more frequently had high fever more extensive infiltrates on chest radiographs and a longer time to negative conversion of mers-cov rrt-pcr than non-spreaders all suggesting more severe pneumonia the spreader group had a significantly longer duration of nonisolated in-hospital days than the non-spreader groups clinical parameters did not differ between super-spreaders and usual-spreaders whereas nonisolated in-hospital days were substantially different between these 2 groups these data suggest that large hospital outbreaks or super-spreading events may not be attributable to clinical manifestations but to delay in isolation spreaders transmitted mers-cov between days 1 and 11 of their illness of note even a 1- or 2-day delay in isolating patients led secondary infections with a peak of cumulative number on the seventh day of illness these findings imply that mers-cov could be transmitted frequently during the early course of the disease a recent virus shedding study showed that mers-cov titers in sputum samples were around 108 copies per milliliter as early as 3 days after symptom onset while the viral shedding kinetics of the sars-cov infection was an inverted v shape with its sharp peak around day 10 13 these findings suggest that control of a mers-cov outbreak would be more difficult than that of a sars-cov outbreak considering that the shortest incubation period of mers-cov infection is 2 days and that patients may transmit the disease with a high viral load even in the early course of their illness early detection and isolation of patients is imperative to control an outbreak of mers-cov a standard approach to control an outbreak begins with identifying all exposed individuals and assessing them for close contact followed by quarantine however this approach is labor-intensive and time-consuming especially when many individuals are exposed moreover identification of all exposed individuals is difficult because many such as visitors and family members may not be registered with hospitals indeed 432 of the patients in korea during the 2015 outbreak had not been identified as exposed individuals and were not monitored 14 our experience suggests that quarantining all exposed individuals first followed by an assessment of and monitoring of their close contacts may shorten the delay in isolating mers patients especially in healthcare settings days of nonisolated in-hospital stay and symptom onset to diagnosis were significantly longer in patients who developed symptoms before june 7 than in patients who did after that date the last super-spreader developed symptoms on june 5 and no additional super-spreading events occurred after june 7 all advocate the necessity of early adoption of an aggressive isolation policy since this was an analysis of a single outbreak it should be interpreted with caution additionally although we analyzed the severity of symptom or chest infiltrations and time to negative conversion of mers-cov rrt-pcr lack of each patients serial viral load titers limited a direct evaluation of the degree of viral shedding which could be another limitation in conclusion high fever more extensive chest infiltrates and delay in isolation were associated with the transmission of mers-cov nonisolated in-hospital days were the only parameter that tended to be associated with super-spreaders compared with usual-spreaders early active quarantine might help control a future outbreak of mers  the impact of super-spreaders in covid-19 mapping genome variation worldwide alberto gmez-carballa xabier bello jacobo pardo-seco federico martinn-torres antonio salas  the human pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is responsible for the major pandemic of the 21 st century we analyzed 4700 sars-cov-2 genomes and associated meta-data retrieved from public repositories sars-cov-2 sequences have a high sequence identity 999 which drops to 96 when compared to bat coronavirus we built a mutationannotated reference sars-cov-2 phylogeny with two main macrohaplogroups a and b both of asian origin and 160 sub-branches representing virus strains of variable geographical origins worldwide revealing a uniform mutation occurrence along branches that could complicate the design of future vaccines the root of sars-cov-2 genomes locates at the chinese haplogroup b1 with a tmrca dating to 12 november 2019 -thus matching epidemiological records sub-haplogroup a2a originates in china and represents the major non-asian outbreak multiple founder effect episodes most likely associated with super-spreader hosts explain covid-19 pandemic to a large extent  the human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first detected in late 2019 in patients from the city of wuhan hubei province china suffering from respiratory illnesses and leading to a disease that has been popularized as coronavirus disease or covid-19 the disease was declared an international public health emergency on 30 january 2020 and a few weeks later on 11 march 2020 it was declared a pandemic by the world health organization who 2020 even though it has not been possible to trace an index case there is a large amount of epidemiological information that has been very useful for tracking the pandemic spread of sars-cov-2 the first report of covid-19 took place on 1 december 2019 in a patient from wuhan most likely linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market of the city in the present study we built a solid phylogenetic skeleton of sars-cov-2 genomes that allows to investigate sequence variation in a large number of genomes 4700 supplementary material deposited in gisaid explore site-specific mutational instability investigate phylogeographic patterns of variation worldwide and clarify the role of super-spreader hosts in the pandemic identity of sars-cov-2 to other closely related species human sars-cov-2 genomes have a within sequence identity of 9998   an inter-specific maximum likelihood ml tree was built using pangolin sars and bat coronavirus genomes as outgroups to investigate their phylogenetic relationships with sars-cov-2 supplementary material the tree depicts the sars coronavirus genome occupying the most external branch next all the pangolin genomes cluster separately from bat and human coronavirus which also group separately in line with its very low identity with sars-cov-2 bat-412976 behaves as an outlier in the tree overall the clustering pattern in the tree is in very good agreement with sequence identity values  table 1  we next focused our attention on the root for all existing sars-cov-2 genomes assuming the bat coronavirus as its closest coronavirus relative we figure s4  see also skeleton in figure 4a  shows that the two very stable transitions c8782t and t28144c 3 and 1 total occurrences in the phylogeny respectively separate sars-cov-2 variation into two main clades a and b both originating in china sub-haplogroups emerging from these main clades are mainly supported by single mutations most of them being very solid along the phylogeny table s1  and therefore granting the robustness of the different clades it is notable that the structure of the branches in the parsimonious tree fully agrees with the skeleton shown in the ml tree phylogeographic information allows reconstructing dynamics of subhaplogroups worldwide figure 2  the main clades emerged in asia mainly in china while some minor ones appeared outside asia next section supplementary material  it is remarkable that a few haplotypes are disproportionally represented in continental regions or in particular countries supplementary material figure   s10  appearing abruptly in a few days period this pattern is compatible with super-spreaders arriving to certain geographic locations and giving rise to severe founder effects  figure 3a  haplotypes h1 h2 h3 and h4 ids as in figure s9  h14 appears 9 times in spain 922 4091 common haplotypes are frequently shared between neighboring countries an observation mirroring the easy spread of the virus over short geographic distances for instance h33 n  9 of which 7 are in portugal and 2 in spain or h45 n  7 of which 4 are in portugal and 1 in spain table   s1 follow the same pattern networks of super-spreader candidates figure 3 show a star-like shape that is characteristic of super-spreader transmission and that clearly differentiates from patterns in the general tree that are more characteristic of homogeneous or chain of transmissions the most outstanding super-spreader event occurred in the washington state figure 3  this network involved about 328 genomes and its shape clearly suggests that a single super-spreader the peak is reached on 30 th january 2020 matching the asian lockdown consequently n e drops remarkably for the next couple of weeks but starts to grow progressively again from 12 th february 2020 coinciding with the beginning of the non-asian outbreak by overlapping covid-19 incidence officially reported cases per day worldwide httpsourworldindataorg with the ebps plot we observed comparable shape distributions but with a remarkable 14-15 days delay in reported cases per day worldwide with respect to the ebps distribution  figure   4b  we have undertaken a large-scale study on sars-cov-2 genomes considering a sample that is more than an order of magnitude higher than those of previous studies by focusing on high-quality hq genomes we devoted great effort to elucidate the most parsimonious phylogeny of sars-cov-2 this effort has allowed us to present novel phylogeographic inferences on the origin and dynamics of sars-cov-2 strains in particular we discovered a few dozen genomes representing  13 of the total database that played a fundamental role as super-spreaders of covid-19 disease these sars-cov-2 strains only two-three weeks after the initial cases reported and probably favored by super-spreaders eg genomes like the reference sequence played a special role in the beginning of the asiatic epidemic subsequently it followed an exponential growth that marked the beginning of the asian outbreak on the 20 th january 2020 and lasted until the end of this month next n e experienced a notable drop coinciding with human intervention and quarantine implemented in asia on 30 th january 2020 finally the beginning of a second wave of expansion outside asia starting around 12 th -27 th february 2020 is also wellrecorded on the sars-cov-2 genomes  figure 4c  the two-week delay between the dates suggested by the ebsp distribution and the official documented incidence of covid-19 in asia could be due to the mean incubation time of the disease but also to the number of cases officially declared being well below the real incidence with the data available in gisaid we were not able to detect association between main haplogroups and age and sex of carriers further research is needed to investigate the possible differential effect of strains haplogroups with the disease outcome none of the hq genomes investigated in our report carry this deletion in contrast to the weak or null action of positive selection on covid-19 spread there is strong evidence pointing to the role of genetic drift occurring in many continental regions and restricted locations especially outside china phylogeographic analysis allowed us to investigate pandemic dynamics worldwide the high incidence of a few lineages outside asia was more probably due to drift and not selective advantages the main non-asian subclade a2a was probably among the first ones to leave asia before this region established a severe population lockdown in good agreement with epidemiological data we observed multiple worldwide introductions of sars-cov-2 coming from asia super-spreaders were probably the main responsible for genetic drift episodes we detected 48 haplotypes in our dataset that most  we downloaded 4721 complete genomes from the gisaid database httpswwwepicovorgepi3frontend on 6 april 2020 3481 out of these 4721 sequences were noted as high quality hq  29kb high cover only based on the information provided by gisaid on 8 april 2020 unless otherwise indicated our analyses were carried out using the hq sars-cov-2 genomes see results although sars-cov-2 is an rna virus the data deposited in gisaid are in dna format metadata for these genomes was downloaded from the nextrain repository httpsgithubcomnextstrainncovtreemasterdata on 7 april 2020 this contains information on geographic location of the sample city country and continental region date of submission age gender etc this data allowed the marking of each genome by date when the virus was isolated location date and geographic origin among others we also downloaded coronavirus genomes from nine pangolins and bat genomes analyzed in the guangdong province gisaid ids omitting prefix epi-isl- 410544 410721 412860 410539 410539 410538 410543 410542 410541 410540 three bats 402131 412977 and 412976 and the reference sars genome genbank acc n nc0047183 in addition we downloaded genomes analyzed from a tiger gisaid 420293 and a dog gisaid 414518 presumably infected with sars-cov-2 by humans the sars-cov-2 genomes were aligned against the reference sequence used by eg nextstrain and many authors with genbank acc n mn9089473 submitted on 5 january 2020 gisaid id 402125 this was the first sars-cov-2 genome released on genbank alignment of sars-cov-2 genomes against the reference sequence was carried out using muscle v3831 program edgar 2004 apart from the discarded low-quality lq sequences and in order to ensure comparability between genomes we trimmed the 5 and 3 untranslated regions retaining a consensus sequence of 29607 bp that runs from position 169 to position 29776 we built a maximum likelihood ml tree in order to investigate interspecific phylogenetic relations between sars-cov-2 genomes and nine pangolins three bats and the reference sars genome genbank acc n nc0047183 interspecific alignment was carried out using mafft program katoh et al here we used different strategies to build the phylogeny of sars-cov-2 first a phylogeny based on ml was carried out to find the phylogenetic root of all sars-cov-2 using the most similar pangolin and bat coronavirus to the sars-cov-2 genome as ancestral relatives gisaid ids omitting prefix epi-isl- 410721 402131 respectively in the particular case of sars-cov-2 and taking into account epidemiological evidence we know for sure that its root is among the first genomes sequenced in china most likely in its hubei province therefore we used only genomes available until the end of february to build the ml tree in order to reduce the noise generated by an unnecessarily large number of genomes that were sequenced later and spread outside china second the most parsimonious strategy allows to determine main and secondary sub-clades of the sars-cov-2 tree identifying the characteristic mutations of clades this phylogenetic procedure also allows to count the occurrences of mutations along branches which serves as a good proxy for mutation-specific stability weissensteiner et al 2016 et al 2005  thus we took the following steps with regards to data filtering 1 we used only genomes labeled as high-coverage only and complete in gisaid 2 we collapsed the sequences to the common sequence segment ngs procedures generate artifacts at the 5 and 3 ends of the genome sequences which generally consist of deletions before eliminating the extremes of the sequences we checked in the complete genomes available if there were any variant that could be phylogenetically informative 3 a solid phylogeny should be based on stable mutational variants thus only branches supported by at least five genomes were considered 4 since many sub-haplogroups are supported by single mutations we only considered those having mutational stability we observed an excess of reversions at the tips of a few phylogenetic branches eg c14805t reversion in a few a1a sequences this phylogenetic noise could be due to the high mutational rate of the mutations involved recombination which is not unusual between coronaviruses rehman et al 2020 or sequencing errors for this reason we decided to not resolve these branches further while we await new evidence based on higher sequence quality genomes by simple counting of the mutational hits along the branches and at the tips of the phylogeny it is possible to infer the relative mutation stability of diagnostic sites the mutations at the tips of the phylogeny were counted only once within each terminal branch table s1 reports the number of occurrences in both the tree branches and in the tips of the phylogeny finally in order to guarantee the robustness of the phylogeny we checked that inferences on the root and phylogeny estimated from the ml tree 1 8 were in good agreement with the pattern of mutations observed in the most parsimonious tree according to colijn and gardi 2014 in particular we are interested in computing phylogenetic features of sars-cov-2 transmissions for our best candidates those haplotypes that have experienced a high frequency locally and in a short time period and compare them to those obtained using the remaining haplotypes from the same specific region we first built phylogenetic trees from sequence alignments using  sacking index it is the mean path length form tip to root slightly higher in super-spreader outbreaks and lower in chain out-breaks  staircase-ness defined as the portion of imbalance nodes norstrm et al 2012  it shows much lower values for chain out-breaks these values were computed for the main super-spreader candidates in specific geographic regions and also for the tree that includes the remaining haplotypes from the same region the comparison between values in both trees allows to compare different transmission patterns from the same culturalsocial context in addition we also carried out network analyses for a reported event of a super-spreader occurred in the diamond princess shipboard for which we could access to 25 sars-cov-2 genomes according to sekizuka et al 2020 the super-spreading event occurring in the shipboard may have originated from a single covid-19 patient who had disembarked in hong kong on 25 january 2020 to visualize the super-spreader phylogeny we built phylogenetic median joining networks using popart software leigh and bryant 2015  the average number of nucleotide differences per site between dna sequences or nucleotide diversity  nei and li 1979  sequencehaplotype diversity hd and tajima were collapsed into nearest points to represent local areas whenever possible in order to reach the minimum sampling required from the sequence alignments and annotated files we summarized information on mutational patterns in the sars-cov-2 genomes    mers sars and ebola the role of super-spreaders in infectious disease gary wong wenjun liu yingxia liu boping zhou yuhai bi george f gao   a number of recent virus outbreaks have resulted in rapid virus spread placing demands on the affected health infrastructures and sparking global concern in september 2012 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov emerged as a novel virus that can result in severe respiratory disease with renal failure with a case fatality rate of up to 38 primary infections typically occur in countries located in the middle east where dromedary camels have been identified as one of the species harboring the virus however travel has contributed to several cases in other countries notably between may and july 2015 an outbreak of mers-cov centered in south korea killed 36 people out of 186 confirmed cases promedmailorg 2015 with thousands quarantined as health authorities attempted to control virus spread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov a close relative of mers-cov was the etiological agent responsible for an outbreak centered around guangdong province in the southeast of china the sars-cov outbreak killed 774 and infected 8096 people between november 2002 and july 2003 for a case fatality rate of 96 in which the virus was first traced to palm civets and then bats over 80 of the total cases and deaths were from mainland china and hong kong more recently a devastating ebola virus ebov outbreak has swept through western africa ebov is a filovirus that causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with up to a 90 case fatality rate if untreated outbreaks of ebov are sporadic unpredictable and localized to sub-saharan africa prior to the 201415 outbreak a total of 1093 deaths out of 1393 infections were documented dating back to 1976 when ebov first emerged the natural reservoir of ebov is currently unknown but fruit bats are suspected to be the animal species harboring the virus in addition to their significant impact these outbreaks were all perpetuated by super-spreaders who disproportionately infect a high number of contacts and likely contribute to the speed and degree of the outbreak as discussed in detail below these outbreaks can be traced to one or more individuals who largely contributed to subsequent infections the 2015 mers-cov outbreak in south korea began from an imported case a 68-year-old male with a recent travel history to several middle eastern countries including bahrain the united arab emirates saudi arabia and qatar the latter three countries also had reported human cases of mers-cov during the same period of time after the patient started exhibiting disease symptoms he sought medical assistance at several clinics before being admitted to a hospital where he was confirmed to be infected with mers-cov who 2015a twenty-nine secondary infections have since been directly traced to this index patient additionally two of these secondary cases were shown to be responsible for 106 subsequent infections out of 166 known cases at the time cowling et al 2015 transmission was mostly within nosocomial settings and fourth generation infections have been documented for the first time since the virus was identified in 2012 thus the mers-cov outbreak in south korea was driven primarily by three infected individuals and approximately 75 of cases can be traced back to three super-spreaders who have each infected a disproportionately high number of contacts figure 1
a this mers-cov outbreak is the second largest on record and the largest outside of the middle east the mers-cov outbreak currently appears to be under control with no additional infections reported in south korea since july 4 2015 retrospectively several super-spreading events were also documented during the sars-cov outbreak in 2003 the index patient of the hong kong epidemic was treated at prince of wales hospital and was associated with at least 125 secondary cases riley et al 2003 subsequent super-spreader events occurred at the hotel metropole 13 cases and the amoy gardens housing complex over 180 cases in hong kong and aboard an air china flight traveling from hong kong to beijing 22 cases braden et al 2013 notably cases from hotel metropole were responsible for the spread of sars-cov to canada vietnam and singapore through travel figure 1b and the imported case to canada resulted in 128 sars-cov cases at a toronto hospital braden et al 2013 to a lesser extent similar events were observed with the 2014-15 ebov outbreak centered in the western african countries of guinea sierra leone and liberia epidemiological work has linked five infections with a 2-year-old toddler in the remote village of meliandou guinea one of the contacts a midwife infected at least three others including a hospital worker at guckdou hospital this worker then infected several family members in the guckdou farako district as well as 15 others at macenta hospital baize et al 2014 one of the subsequent cases a doctor was known to have infected several others who traveled to kissidougou and nzrkor further propagating virus transmission baize et al 2014 the outbreak eventually spilled over to neighboring liberia and sierra leone in sierra leone the funeral of a traditional healer that died from ebov was shown to have directly infected 13 others gire et al 2014 and was eventually linked to more than 300 cases who 2015b the ebov outbreak has killed 11284 people with 27741 infected as of july 19 2015 en route to becoming the largest filovirus outbreak ever documented in addition to ebov super-spreading has also been documented in outbreaks with other pathogens including measles paunio et al 1998 and mycobacterium tuberculosis kline et al 1995 the initial stages of the outbreaks mentioned above involved at least one super-spreading event the ability of the pathogen to infect subsequent super-spreaders who may export the disease through travel is likely the difference between an infection cluster and an outbreak or epidemic figure 1c differences in the initial response to mers-cov is why south korea reported clusters of infections before bringing the virus under control and why china thailand and the philippines have not reported any additional cases despite imported mers-cov infections it was why sars-cov was so devastating in mainland china and hong kong from 2002 to 2003 it was also why the 201415 ebov outbreak spiraled out of control in western africa with hundreds of new cases reported weekly before a coordinated international effort including contact tracing isolation diagnosis and treatment of infected patients as well as community education brought the number down to a more manageable 2030 weekly infections with most of the cases diagnosed in guinea and sierra leone early discovery diagnosis intervention and quarantine of confirmed cases is crucial for preventing further disease transmission in humans especially via super-spreaders as evidenced by the decreased numbers of new cases in the mers-cov and ebov outbreaks current responses are effective provided that the measures are implemented properly and followed strictly vigilance and patience will be necessary until the ongoing mers-cov and ebov outbreaks are officially at an end currently super-spreaders are only retrospectively categorized after epidemiological tracing given their high propensity to spread infection super-spreaders should be able to shed higher levels of pathogen andor for a longer period of time after infection this would increase the probability that the pathogen contacts and subsequently infects a naive host to address whether there are factors or parameters that promote or indicate enhanced virus shedding in a laboratory setting an animal species that closely recapitulates symptoms of the human disease is required such that any findings can be translated to humans animals could be experimentally infected with different virus strainsvariants at varying doses via different challenge routes in which virus shedding from the oral nasal and rectal cavities should be correlated with different parameters including viremia or virus titers in the organs however these studies are currently challenging for sars-cov as there is currently not an appropriate animal model that replicates the severe disease seen in humans infected nonhuman primates exhibit variable but at most mild to moderate respiratory disease mcauliffe et al 2004 lawler et al 2006 nonetheless these types of studies are feasible for mers-cov a model of this infection was developed in the common marmoset that results in severe respiratory disease and partial lethality in which live virus can be detected in nasal and throat swabs of infected animals falzarano et al 2014 thus the studies proposed above can be investigated with mers-cov in this animal model for ebov the cynomolgus and rhesus macaque animal models are well characterized and have been used over the past 20 years ebov shedding is known to occur from the oral nasal andor rectal cavities of nonhuman primates during the advanced stages of disease but factors that influence virus shedding from these animals have not yet been investigated interestingly using a guinea pig model it was shown that animals infected intranasally in with guinea pig-adapted ebov were more contagious to naive contact animals than those that were infected intraperitoneally ip with the same dose wong et al 2015 in infected animals shed virus from their nasal cavity earlier than their ip counterparts and ip challenged animals died earlier and thus were removed from contact with naive animals compared to in inoculated guinea pigs it was therefore concluded that the route of infection in addition to the duration of contact time with an infectious host may be factors that influence the efficiency of virus transmission it will take time to elucidate all possible host and viral factors that contribute to virus shedding which remains an understudied topic to date therefore it is not currently possible to predict with any level of confidence or statistical significance whether a person will become a super-spreader of a certain disease large-scale genome-wide association studies gwas of super-spreaders might provide some clues about the genetic backgrounds of super-spreaders but the feasibility and robustness of these analyses will depend on the number of super-spreaders in a given outbreak the large amount of patient data and samples available from the recent mers-cov and ebov outbreaks provide possible opportunities to investigate factors that may correlate with an increased risk for becoming a super-spreader using the mers-cov outbreak as an example detailed records were kept for the majority of patients who were confirmed to be infected with mers-cov since the identities of the three super-spreaders are known as patients 1 14 and 16 studies can be performed to investigate whether these three patients have common traits ie age gender pre-existing medical conditions or underlying co-morbidities levels of virus shedding etc any common characteristics can then be compared with non-super-spreader patients to provide insight into possible risk factors behind enhanced spreading of infectious diseases another approach would be to isolate mers-cov from the three known super-spreaders perform sequence analysis of the viral genomes and determine whether there are any shared mutations between these isolates any mutations that are identified and are absent from the viral genomes of other patients could be indicators of enhanced virus shedding allowing for super-spreading to occur a complex combination of factors likely plays a role in the number of subsequent infections initiating from a single super-spreader in addition to host and virus factors other important factors impacting the spread of infectious diseases are the environment and behavior of individuals environmental factors include the close proximity of other susceptible hosts and the airflow dynamics within an enclosed area a high population density represents a greater number of susceptible hosts for directindirect contact with an infected person whereas air re-circulation would especially facilitate the transmission of airborne viruses such as mers-cov and sars-cov hospitals enclosed housing complexes and mass transportation such as airplanes are documented sites of super-spreader events especially during the mers-cov and sars-cov outbreaks table 1
 individual behaviors may also enhance disease spread these include doctor shoppinggoing to multiple hospitals to treat the same ailments or traveling to other countries after the appearance of disease symptoms which was observed with the mers-cov outbreak su et al 2015 traditional customs such as unsafe funeralsburials in africa which involve direct contact with infectious bodily fluids of patients that passed away from ebov disease is another major reason why the outbreak persisted in guinea and sierra leone table 1 a thorough study of host virus and environmental dynamics will be important to delineate the relative contribution of each factor to the phenomenon of super-spreading findings from these studies combined with changes in behavior conducive to the spread of disease will be important for the effective management of and preparation for future outbreaks  risk factors for transmission of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection during the 2015 outbreak

infection were confirmed using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assays regardless of their clinical manifestations the epidemiological reports were analyzed by epidemic intelligence service officers who participated in the mers-cov outbreak investigation when a case was exposed to multiple confirmed cases the transmission was attributed to the case with the highest likelihood of transmission and any conflicts were resolved through the consensus of the epidemic intelligence service officers spreaders were defined as confirmed cases of mers-cov infection that were epidemiologically suspected of transmitting mers-cov to 1 or more persons super-spreading events were arbitrarily defined as transmission of mers-cov infection to 5 or more cases the patient who triggered the outbreak was defined as patient zero cases that were infected by patient zero were defined as first-generation cases cases that were infected by first-generation cases were defined as second-generation cases and cases that were infected by second-generation cases were defined as third-generation cases 14 isolation was defined as separating symptomatic patients from others to prevent spreading and quarantine was defined as separating or restricting the movement of healthy individuals who may have been exposed to the infection within the maximum incubation period the transmission date was defined as the date of contact between the spreader and suspected secondary case during the spreaders infectious period in cases with an exposure duration of longer than 1 day the transmission date was defined as the day with the highest likelihood of transmission or as the median day during the exposure period in cases with consistent contact throughout the exposure the date of sampling was the day on which the first positive respiratory specimen was collected close contacts were defined using the guidelines on middle east respiratory syndrome 15 which include persons who stayed in a room or ward with a confirmed case who directly contacted respiratory secretions from confirmed cases or who stayed within 2 m from the confirmed cases without wearing appropriate personal protective equipment pre-isolation pneumonia diagnoses were based on radiographic evidence doctor shopping was defined as visiting multiple healthcare facilities without an official interhospital transfer after developing mers-cov symptoms 16 epidemiological reports from the outbreak were evaluated to collect data regarding basic demographic characteristics medical history mers-cov exposure symptoms and their onset dates sampling dates contact history and post-exposure infection control the reports were drafted during the outbreak based on direct interviews with the confirmed cases and follow-up epidemiological investigations that were performed to identify the exposure route and close contacts hospital information systems were reviewed to identify patients who stayed in the hospital during the exposure period and healthcare providers who contacted the patients persons who contacted confirmed cases outside healthcare facilities were also traced data from closed circuit television credit card transactions and health insurance services were also reviewed 5 the numbers of close contacts were calculated based on the number of quarantines during the outbreak all data were collected as part of the public health response and in accordance with the infectious disease control and prevention act 17 clinical specimens were collected in sterile containers and immediately transferred to qualified facilities sputum samples were mixed with 01 phosphate-buffered saline and vortexed vigorously to reduce their viscosity viral rna was extracted from the clinical specimens using a qiagen viral rna mini kit qiagen hilden germany all laboratory diagnoses of mers-cov were confirmed using the world health organization guidelines 18 and results from real-time rt-pcr assays that target upstream of the mers-cov envelope protein gene upe and the open reading frame 1a gene orf1a 19 cycle threshold ct values for the upe and orf1a genes were obtained during testing we analyzed the ct value from the first positive mers-cov specimen or the specimen obtained immediately after a positive screening test categorical variables were compared using the 2 test and fisher exact test and the mannwhitney test was used for continuous variables the variables associations with mers-cov transmission were evaluated using multiple logistic regression analyses and covariates were selected based on a p value of  1 in the univariate analyses a p value of  05 was considered statistically significant all analyses were performed using r software version 322 r foundation vienna austria we identified 186 cases of confirmed mers-cov infection patient zero infected 28 first-generation cases among the 28 cases 8 were responsible for

patient four patients exhibited unclear sources of transmission cases 43 178 184 and 185 each confirmed case transmitted the infection to 083 secondary cases figure 1 there were 164 nonspreaders and 22 spreaders 1 or more transmission of the spreaders 5 cases transmitted the infection to 5 or more cases super-spreading event after excluding the 5 cases with unclear infection sources we identified 180 transmissions generated by 22 spreaders a total of 150 transmission events 833 were epidemiologically linked to the 5 super-spreading events twenty-five transmission events 139 occurred within 3 days after symptom onset 136 transmissions 756 occurred 47 days after symptom onset and 19 transmissions 106 occurred 7 days after symptom onset a total of 170 transmission events 944 occurred on the

significantly more frequent underlying respiratory disease 273 vs 11 p  044 the spreaders also had significantly lower ct values upe median interquartile range 227 195291 vs 272 235304 p  004 and

days p  008 and to sampling 8 593 days vs 4 26 days p  001 furthermore the interval from symptom onset to isolation was longer among spreaders 7 459 days vs 3 16 days p  002 spreaders exhibited a significantly higher proportion of pre-isolation pneumonia diagnoses 682 vs 171 p  001 and a longer interval from the pneumonia diagnosis to isolation 4 37 days vs 1 03 days p  008 the overall number of contacts was significantly larger among spreaders compared to nonspreaders 149 2236405 vs 175 2925 p  004 compared to nonspreaders spreaders exhibited a significantly higher proportion for pre-isolation hospitalization 682 vs 165 p  001 visiting outpatient clinics 591 vs 335 p  019 and visiting emergency rooms ers 50 vs 73 p  001 we used logistic regression analyses to evaluate the risk factors for transmission table 2 in the univariate analyses transmission was associated with underlying respiratory disease ct value interval from symptom onset to diagnosis number of contacts and pre-isolation hospitalization or er visits in the multivariate analyses transmission was independently associated with a low ct value for upe odds ratio or 084 95 confidence interval ci 075096 and pre-isolation hospitalization or er visits or 682 95 ci 2062284 we compared the epidemiological characteristics of the 5 spreaders with 5 or more transmissions and the 17 spreaders with 4 or fewer transmissions table 3 both groups exhibited similar host factors and contact durations however spreaders with 5 or more transmissions exhibited higher values for pre-isolation contacts 777 4595862 vs 78 852815 p  017 pre-isolation er visits 100 vs 353 p  035 and the number of healthcare facilities that each patient visited for hospitalization or er treatment 2 2025 vs 1 015 p  009 in addition super-spreading events were marginally associated with doctor shopping 100 vs 471 p  054 we evaluated the epidemiological characteristics of patients who transmitted mers-cov during the recent south korean outbreak among the 186 confirmed mers-cov cases only 22 cases transmitted the infection to other individuals these spreaders had higher host infectivity and wider and prolonged contacts compared to nonspreaders the risk factors for super-spreading events included a larger number of contacts and a pre-isolation er visit doctor shopping was marginally associated with a super-spreading event however both spreaders with 5 or more transmissions and spreaders with 4 or fewer transmissions exhibited similar levels of host infectivity it appears that both host infectivity and the number of contacts influenced mers-cov transmission whereas super-spreading events were mostly associated with a greater likelihood of encountering other people under diverse environmental conditions during the 2015 outbreak approximately 75 of the transmissions occurred during days 47 after symptom onset and this may be a period when the risk of transmission is particularly high furthermore this high-risk period was temporally associated with other epidemiological factors first the period overlapped with the confirmed cases visits to healthcare facilities as hospitalization and er visits peaked during days 47 after symptom onset it is well known that mers-cov outbreaks generally occur in the healthcare setting 1 5 13 20 and the high-risk period may be associated with healthcare-seeking behaviors second the high-risk period was several days 14 days after the radiographic diagnoses of pneumonia which generally occurred on days 34 after symptom onset although the significance of pre-isolation pneumonia has not been discussed previously a radiographic diagnosis of pneumonia may influence transmission in 2 ways first it may directly increase the chance of transmission by actively generating lower respiratory tract secretions and a productive cough second it may be an indirect index of disease severity and hospital visiting status in our study cases with pre-isolation pneumonia had lower ct values and more frequent pre-isolation hospital visits the epidemiological significance of the high-risk period could also be observed when we compared the spreaders and nonspreaders the spreaders were typically isolated after the high-risk period median 7 days after symptom onset and 4 days after a diagnosis of pneumonia whereas nonspreaders were typically isolated before this period median 3 days after symptom onset and 1 day after a diagnosis of pneumonia similar results were observed in a study of the sars outbreak which revealed that late admission to healthcare facilities especially 4 days after symptom onset was associated with super-spreading events 21 thus infection prevention measures should target isolation before this critical period ie within 47 days after symptom onset and within 1 day after the detection of pneumonia interestingly the average duration from symptom onset to isolation dropped to 4 days during the first week of june 2015 and reports of new cases have rapidly decreased since that time among the host factors that were associated with transmission only the ct value was statistically significant in the multivariate analyses the ct value is a semiquantitative continuous variable that is inversely proportional to the viral load ct values are associated with the severity of mers-cov infection 22 although its relationship with transmission has rarely been studied in the present study spreaders had significantly lower ct values compared to nonspreaders which suggests that ct values might reliably predict transmission moreover the cases with very low ct values ct 23 tended to transmit the infection in uncommon circumstances in both the present study and previous studies mers-cov transmission usually occurred in the hospital setting 1 11 13 23 in contrast cases with very low ct values transmitted the infection in more diverse settings in the present outbreak eg their household in an ambulance in an outpatient clinic or to healthcare personnel after in-hospital isolation these findings suggest that cases with very low ct values can potentially transmit the infection in unexpected conditions however our data regarding the ct values have several limitations first various amounts of phosphate-buffered saline were added to dilute the respiratory specimens and this may have affected the ct values second the ct value is influenced by the specimen type and the interval between symptom onset and sample collection 22 24 but various different types of specimens were collected at different time points in the present study however we only evaluated 5 nonsputum specimens and there was no linear correlation between the ct values and the interval from onset to sampling our comparison of the spreaders with 5 or more transmissions and spreaders with 4 or fewer transmissions revealed that the spreaders with 5 or more transmissions had an approximately 10-fold higher number of contacts furthermore there were no significant differences in host infectivity these findings may suggest that the underlying likelihood of transmission has the greatest influence on super-spreading events rather than an intrinsic difference in host infectivity a similar finding was observed in a previous study of the sars super-spreading event 4 with those super-spreaders having 1174 contacts compared to 14 contacts for the spreaders with 12 transmissions our study also revealed that a pre-isolation er visit and doctor shopping were associated with super-spreading events in addition super-spreading events were associated with the number of healthcare facilities that each patient visited for hospitalization or er treatment but not with the number of hospitals visited for outpatient treatment in south korea patients who seek hospitalization without prior arrangements tend to visit the er and a history of 2 or more er visits strongly suggests that the patient had been doctor shopping during hospitalization specific environmental conditions have been suggested to increase the likelihood of a super-spreading event 3 and doctor shopping may increase the likelihood of encountering these conditions for example when a confirmed case changes hospital during hospitalization without an official interhospital transfer multiple environments are exposed to the infected case an ambulance an er and a ward thus doctor shopping can greatly increase the likelihood of encountering conditions that are suitable for a super-spreading event in the present outbreak 4 of the 5 super spreaders cases 1 14 16 and 76 transmitted the infection at 2 or more hospitals as they had visited multiple healthcare facilities therefore it is very important to have an early suspicion of mers-cov infection and minimize doctor shopping during the early stage of an outbreak our study has several limitations first some of the confirmed cases had multiple potential sources of infection and we attributed the transmission to the case with the highest epidemiological probability the source of infection was clear in 95 of the transmissions and we excluded 3 cases that had contact with multiple cases and an unclear source of transmission however as the analyses of the epidemiological data are ongoing the list of spreaders may change if new epidemiological evidence is uncovered second we did not have access to genomic sequencing data which might have provided information regarding the relatedness of transmitted strains third transmission may be affected by other epidemiological factors including aerosol-generating procedures differences in environmental conditions and variations in crowdedness 3 13 25 however these factors were not included in the present analysis fourth serological testing was not performed for every close contact and additional asymptomatic cases may have been present however the seropositive rate was 07 in a recent serological study of close contacts 26 thus the absence of serological testing likely did not significantly influence our results we evaluated the epidemiological risk factors for mers-cov transmission during the recent south korean outbreak super-spreading events were not related to intrinsic host characteristics and were attributable to the likelihood of transmission therefore strict er triage and minimizing doctor shopping during an outbreaks early stage may help prevent super-spreading events  agent-based modeling for super-spreading events a case study of mers-cov transmission dynamics in the republic of korea yunhwan kim hohyung ryu sunmi lee   the 2015 outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov posed a serious public health threat in the republic of korea it generated 186 confirmed cases including 38 fatal cases 1 it has drawn a lot of attention not only because it was the largest outbreak of mers-cov outside the middle east regions but also because it has been claimed to be a super-spreading event sse similar to the sars outbreaks in 2003 2 sse is an outbreak where a small number of infected cases generated a large number of secondary infections 3 for example 20 of infectious individuals are responsible for 80 of newly generated infections super-spreading events have been observed in the transmission dynamics of many infectious diseases including sars transmission in hong kong and singapore 4 stein identified the complex interplay among hosts pathogens and environments for super-spreading events in many infectious diseases 5 furthermore shen et al defined sse as a patient transmitting a disease to at least eight contacts based on an analysis of the sars spread data 6 concerning the 2015 mers-cov outbreak in korea previous studies have examined whether it was an sse kucharski and althaus analyzed a large transmission cluster of mers-cov in korea to estimate the level of transmission heterogeneity and identified a substantial potential for super-spreading events 7 also chun identified that mers-cov transmission in korea was an sse using a negative binomial model 8 kim et al characterized the transmission dynamics based on a mathematical model and investigated the time-dependent reproduction number 9 gerardo et al performed the comparative analysis between sars and mers they claimed that mers-cov in korea has shown the most significant heterogeneity in generating secondary cases 2 nishiura et al suggested that multiple visits to health facilities were the main cause of the disproportionate number of secondary cases and this might lead the outbreak to be an sse 10 the high level of heterogeneity in generating secondary cases which is one of the key evidence of an sse can be observed in the time series of cases in 2015 mers-cov outbreak in korea in figure 1 the time series of the 2015 mers-cov cases is displayed and classified using five super-spreaders the five colors represent the different cases according to super-spreader yellow color is unknown due to multiple contacts it is clearly seen that there was significant heterogeneity in the 2015 mers-cov transmission five super-spreaders 3 infected 79 147186 of the total mers-cov cases transmission trees infection tracing only for the total 186 mers-cov cases are displayed in figure 2 the node size is proportional to the number of secondary cases five super-spreaders are identified as in figure 1 having identified the mers-cov outbreak in korea as an sse it is necessary to develop a mathematical model that can capture the heterogeneity of infectivity among patients there have been various approaches to model the sse in infectious disease transmission dynamics firstly the standard compartmental models have been used mkhatshwa and mummert developed a sirp model by adding a new superspreader class to a standard sir model 11 they assumed that superspreaders have a longer infectious period than normal infected individuals while their model was simple and clear a sir-type model is inherently limited in capturing the individual heterogeneity of attributes including contact numbers and infectivity another way of modeling sse is a branching process model in each discrete time step an infected individual produces a random number of secondary infections that follows a certain probability distribution there are a small number of cases whose value is far from the mean and these are used to model super-spreaders lloyd-smith et al employed a negative binomial distribution and defined an sse where any single patient infects more than the nth percentile of the distribution 12 james pitchford and plank suggested three branching process models each of whose random variable follows a different probability distribution 13 garske and rhodes suggested a branching process model implemented in continuous time instead of discrete generation 14 in addition to these methods agent-based modeling abm can be a useful tool in modeling sses due to the dramatic increase in computing power and its strength in modeling individual heterogeneity it has been employed in modeling various aspects of infectious disease transmission dynamics especially in modeling sses with spatio-temporal factors in abm sses are usually modeled by incorporating a small number of agents super-spreaders who can generate a larger number of secondary infections than normal agents there are a few ways to implement these super-spreaders the first way is to make them have an inherently higher level of infectivity 1415 this corresponds to the higher transmission rate in a mathematical model another way is to make the infectious period of super-spreaders longer while the infectivity is same with normal agents 1114 the last way is to make the number of contacts of super-spreader larger than the number of normal agents while the infectivity remains same 1617 each of these ways pays attention to different aspects of the super-spreaders and can be useful for capturing and analyzing sses in particular a group of studies has employed abm in modeling sses from the perspective of the contact network fujie and odagaki developed agent-based models on an irregular lattice network and suggested two kinds of models in their work a strong infectiousness model and a hub model 15 comparing the results of two models with sars transmission data in hong kong they concluded that the hub model provides a closer match with the real-world data small tse and walker suggested a small-world network model where individuals have local links that connect to immediate neighbors and non-local links that connect to far-away nodes 16 they represented the former as contact with the family and the latter as contact made in public spaces bifolchi deardon and feng simulated the epidemic spreads through various contact networks to determine which model best predicts the true probabilities of infection 17 duan et al suggested an elaborate agent-based model that incorporates a variety of features of agent behaviors that might generate sse including heterogeneous levels of infectivity and contacts 18 the present research aims to develop stochastic agent-based models of the 2015 mers-cov transmission dynamics in south korea embracing the power of abm heterogeneities among agents are implemented in the models in particular regular-spreaders and super-spreaders are set to have different transmission rate functions based on different transmission probabilities and a different number of contacts based on these heterogeneities four models are suggested no super-spreader model no-ss the super-spreaders model with higher infectivity ssm1 the super-spreaders model with higher contacts ssm2 and super-spreaders model with both higher infectivity and higher contacts ssm3 monte carlo simulations are carried out under various epidemic scenarios and the results are compared with the real epidemic data of 2015 mers-cov in korea the distributions of the basic reproduction number and epidemic outputs are computed as well as the distribution of secondary cases under different models of super-spreaders furthermore the effectiveness of isolation intervention strategies and their impact on the mers-cov transmission dynamics are investigated we develop a stochastic agent-based model by generating a random network on a square domain ll with a total number of agents n as shown in figure 3 each agent can have one of the following four epidemiological statuses susceptible s exposed e infected i and recovered r a susceptible agent becomes exposed with a probability defined by the transmission probability distribution which will be descried below we assume that a newly infected person becomes infectious asymptomatic and remains in the exposed stage for a incubation time drawn from a gamma probability density function pdf with a mean of 1 days and a standard deviation of  days after this time the individual becomes infectious symptomatic and remains so for a duration of time drawn from a gamma pdf with a mean of 1 days and a standard deviation of  days subsequently an infected agent recovers with immunity for simplicity a gamma pdf is used for both the incubation and infectious period these have been estimated from the 186 mers-cov confirmed cases provided by kcdc 2016 1 each agent is either a regular agent or a super-spreader and the proportion of super-spreaders in the total population n agents is determined by the parameter  agents in the e or i status can infect other s agents within a distance r0 with the transmission probability function of r here the distance between two agents located at x1y1 and x2y2 is calculated as rx2x12y2y12 we define two types of transmission rate functions for regular-spreaders and super-spreaders here super-spreaders are assumed to have either a higher transmission probability or larger number of contacts than regular spreaders three different models for super-spreaders will be described below let us define transmission rate functions for regular-spreaders and super-spreaders the transmission rate function is defined as a function of the distance between exposed or infected and susceptible individualsregular-spreader1r01rr0 0rr00 r0r
here r is a decreasing function of the distance r within an effective contact radius r0 and  is the exponent of the given function of distance r with 1 please note that this model is referred as to the no super-spreader model no-ss when there is no super-spreader agent 0super-spreader model 121r0 0rr00 r0r
our first super-spreader model ssm1 assumes that super-spreaders have a higher transmission probability or higher infectivity than regular spreaders within the effective contact radius r0 please note that 1r is a constant function remaining at a value of 0 for 0rr0super-spreader model 232r01rrn 0rrn0 rnr
the second super-spreader model ssm2 assumes that super-spreaders have more links or a larger number of contacts than regular spreaders and is modeled by a longer effective contact radius with rn6r0super-spreader model 343r0 0rr001r1rnr0 r0rrn
lastly we propose a hybrid model ssm3 for super-spreaders by considering a combined transmission probability of ssm1 and ssm2 since super-spreaders have both a higher transmission probability and a larger number of contacts 1 the impact of different super-spreading models is investigated in terms of various epidemic outputs including incidence peak size peak time and epidemic duration first figure 4 compares incidence profiles using two values of  a super-spreader proportion left with 4 and right with 10 the average incidence of 1000 simulations is displayed as a solid smooth curve along with one particular incidence a dashed stochastic curve clearly the effect of super-spreaders makes the disease transmission faster and more severe see ssm3 in both panels since super-spreaders in ssm3 have a stronger transmission and longer effective radius than the other models in order of ssm3  ssm2  ssm1  no-ss this becomes more profound under a higher proportion of super-spreaders in the right panel 10 next the detailed epidemic distributions are illustrated in figure 5 which shows the peak size peak time and epidemic duration using 10 with the mean represented by the dashed vertical line the peak time is earlier and the peak size is larger in ssm3 again in order of ssm3  ssm2  ssm1  no-ss this confirms that the impact of super-spreaders is significant on the mers-cov transmission dynamics also the detailed epidemic outputs using two values of 4 and 10 are summarized in table 2 table 2 illustrates the mean and standard deviation under four models for three epidemic outputs peak size peak time and epidemic duration higher peak size faster peak time and earlier epidemic durations are the common features of sse which is consistent with the results under ssm3 as shown in the above epidemic outputs this is due to the larger number of contacts and higher transmission rates resulting in the larger epidemic peak in a shorter period of time the basic reproduction number is one of the most important quantities in mathematical epidemiology it defines the average number of secondary infections in a completely susceptible population one can obtain an analytic expression of the basic reproduction number r0 for some compartment models 19 however in general there is no analytic expressions of r0 for agent-based models hence we employ the method for determining r0 described in 20 we compute the basic reproduction number from a randomly chosen infected individual in a completely susceptible population and obtain the distributions of 1000 simulations of secondary cases figure 6 shows the distributions of r0 in the absence of super-spreaders no-ss and the mean is the dashed vertical line sensitivity analyses of r0 are conducted by varying baseline transmission rates and an effective radius in our simulation the effective radius has the most significant impact and higher transmission rates lead to larger r0 next figure 7 illustrates the distributions of r0 under four super-spreader models using four different transmission rate functions it shows the impact of super-spreaders on r0 using two values of  super-spreader proportion on the top with 4 and the bottom with 10 since the basic reproduction number is computed only the first generation by the index case the differences for r0 distributions of four models are smaller when 4 however the impact of super-spreaders in ssm3 becomes more significant when 10 with the maximum mean around 5 of ssm3 the means are in order of ssm3  ssm2  ssm1  no-ss in the bottom panels please note that there exists a larger right tail in ssm3 in order of ssm3  ssm2  ssm1  no-ss obviously this implies that there is a higher probability for a larger number of secondary cases to appear under ssm3 the impact of three epidemic parameters is determined through incidence curves first the effect of the baseline transmission rate 0 on incidence has been investigated in figure 8 in general disease transmission becomes faster and stronger as 0 increases the peak time is earlier and the peak height is larger in all four models next the impact of an effective contact radius r0 has been explored in figure 9 there is a critical value of r0 that determines the outbreak as pointed out in 15 there is no outbreak when r02 and outbreaks occur when r02 when r0 reaches around 25 outbreaks take place in ssm2 and ssm3 and they get stronger in size and larger in speed as r0 gets larger it is straightforward that if patients can infect other individuals at a further distance then disease will be transmitted faster it accelerates the change of proportion of cumulative incidence by the different values of r0 also the proportion of super-spreaders  is varied and the incidence profiles were compared results are not shown as the proportion of super-spreaders gets larger the peak size becomes larger and the peak time earlier in ssm2 and ssm3 while it does not have a remarkable impact in ssm1 this suggests that a longer effective radius makes the disease spread easier lastly we investigated the effect of the exponent term  on the transmission rate for super-spreaders we vary the value of  the exponent term in r for ssm1 ssm2 and ssm3 the transmission rate function decreases rapidly as  increases results are not shown here this leads to the strength and the speed of disease transmission decreasing as  increases more details for these results can be found in 21 as observed in many infectious diseases we explore the distributions of secondary cases under four models again 1000 simulations for each model have been carried out and the mean distributions are obtained figure 10 illustrates the mean distribution of the number of links under each model in the absence of super-spreaders no-ss shows monotone decreases in the number of links the most homogeneous in four model outputs with the shortest tail from zero to six a as the transmission rates become stronger and the number of contacts increases the heterogeneity becomes more severe in order of ssm3  ssm2  ssm1  no-ss as shown in d ssm3 exhibits the highest level of heterogeneity in the secondary cases the highest frequency at zero and also the largest right tail this is consistent with the results of the basic reproduction number as shown in figure 7 we have fitted the distribution with a power function axb where x is the number of secondary cases and compared the slope of each fitted function to the 2015 mers-cov data first the left panel in figure 11 displays the distributions of secondary cases for the 2015 mers-cov blue bar and the fitted power law distributions black circled curve next the distributions of secondary cases are fitted as a power law using the results under four different models with 10 the right panel compares four fitted power law distributions with the mers-cov data obviously ssm3 shows the best fit to the distribution of secondary cases for the mers-cov data compare the slopes of the green squared and black circled lines parameters a and b in axb are estimated for the mers-cov data and the four models by the least-squares method for the least-squares fitting procedure we used the levenbergmarquardt method with line-search implemented in matlab the mathworks inc natick ma usa in the built-in routine lsqcurvefit which is part of the optimization toolbox the resulting parameter estimates are listed in table 3 lastly we investigate the impact of isolation interventions on the mers-cov dynamics two distinct isolation strategies are implemented a random and a targeted intervention first a random intervention isolates individuals 20 randomly chosen both regular and super-spreaders from the s and e classes at t14 day second a targeted intervention isolates individuals super-spreaders only starting from t14 day until the end of epidemic duration from the e and i classes here a targeted isolation intervention means an individual is isolated and either has effective contact with infected individuals exposed or is infected by super-spreaders the results under the three models ssm1 ssm2 and ssm3 are displayed in figure 12 in all three models a random selection reduces the peak size proportionally resulting in a longer epidemic duration red incidence curves in a b c please note that a targeted isolation reduces the peak size significantly at the beginning which can delay the highest peak and result in more preparation time green incidence curves in b c the implementation of targeted isolation while incapable of eliminating a possible outbreak still manages to reduce the magnitude of the epidemic peak by distributing both the infection cases and hospitalization over a broader window of time distributing the mers-cov case burden over long windows in time is highly desirable when resources are limited a targeted intervention is more effective in both ssm2 and ssm3 while a random intervention is more effective in ssm1 it is worth noting that the effectiveness of interventions depends on the infected-network structures these results suggest that the effectiveness of interventions depends on the characteristics of the mers-cov transmission dynamics hence it highlights the roles of super-spreaders in the transmission dynamics of infectious disease and planning future interventions in this study we built a stochastic agent-based model on the 2015 mers-cov outbreak in korea from the perspective of sse the outbreak was an sse almost 80 of 186 confirmed cases were infected by five super-spreaders 147186 surprisingly one super-spreader alone infected 53 of the mers-cov cases via other super-spreaders 79147 to devise effective intervention strategies and countermeasures for future emerging infectious diseases it is necessary to clarify the generating mechanism of sses in this regard agent-based modeling is a useful tool for incorporating individual heterogeneity into the epidemic model the present research developed and analyzed agent-based models with different assumptions concerning the feature of super-spreaders our results indicate that the connectivity of individuals and a higher level of infectivity are the most significant factors for the mers-cov transmission dynamics the effect of super-spreaders was not remarkably significant in ssm1 but it was in ssm2 and ssm3 the higher baseline transmission rate and the longer contact range produced a more rapid and severe disease spread in ssm2 and ssm3 than in ssm1 due to the features of super-spreaders the real-world data demonstrated the best fit with ssm3 compared to ssm1 or ssm2 the impact of the effective radius on the basic reproduction number r0 was the most significant also higher transmission rates led to the larger r0 furthermore the impact of super-spreaders on the distributions of r0 under ssm3 became more significant as a proportion of super-spreaders increased the largest right tails in ssm3 which was consistent with the distributions results of secondary cases ssm3 showed the highest level of heterogeneity in the distributions of r0 and secondary cases while no-ss gave the least heterogeneity all results above suggest that sse can be more properly characterized by a small number of infectious individuals who can infect others by means of a larger amount of contact with others combined with higher infectivity having only one feature either higher infectivity or higher connectivity is not strong enough to generate such a high level of heterogeneity in secondary cases the effectiveness of two isolation strategies was examined a random isolation reduced incidence proportionally while a targeted isolation reduced the peak size and delayed the peak time a targeted isolation was more effective in both ssm2 and ssm3 while a random isolation was more effective in ssm1 these results suggest that the effectiveness of intervention strategies is dependent on the structure of the infection network however super-spreaders can be identified in retrospectively it is very challenging to predict sses or super-spreaders thus a targeted isolation intervention might be idealistic to be implemented nevertheless we can investigate the most critical factors for generating sses and these factors can provide how to devise effective intervention strategies as discussed in 522 for instance various factors include co-infection with another pathogen immune suppression changes in airflow dynamics delayed hospital admission misdiagnosis and inter-hospital transfers these factors are worthy of investigation and should be incorporated into targeted intervention strategies our results showed that even when early detection was unsuccessful it is still effective to find possible candidates for super-spreaders and isolate them to reduce potential risks of severe outbreaks one of the limitations of this research lies in the shape of the space where the simulations were executed although it is well known that infectious disease transmission dynamics depends on the structure of the infection network we based our model on a random network in order to focus on the effect of super-spreaders on disease transmission despite this simplification our results from a simple random network clearly demonstrated the role of super-spreaders on disease transmission and the possible effective intervention scenarios further studies are expected to conduct epidemic models based on other network structures especially more realistic ones for example using the empirical contact network of the 2015 mers-cov transmission in south korea would make the simulated space more realistic also the effectiveness of more various intervention strategies and possible epidemic scenarios can be explored in future research we developed an agent-based model that can provide a general mathematical tool for any disease outbreaks with super-spreading events super-spreading events in the transmission dynamics of 2015 mers-cov showed a high level of heterogeneity heterogeneity in transmission patterns are one of the most critical factors for infectious disease transmission dynamics our agent-based model has employed real mers-cov epidemic features based on the 2015 mers-cov epidemiological data our findings highlight the roles of super-spreaders in a high level of heterogeneity underscoring that the number of contacts combined with a higher level of infectivity are the most critical factors for substantial heterogeneity in generating secondary cases of the 2015 mers-cov transmission having only one feature either higher infectivity or higher connectivity is not strong enough to generate such a high level of heterogeneity in secondary cases  predicting super spreading events during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemics in hong kong and singapore yuguo li ignatius yu t pengcheng xu j lee h tze wong wai peng ooi lim adrian sleigh c    the actual date of exposure infection was unclear for most cases of sars we tried to estimate the daily number of exposed individuals who received a sufficient dose of sars coronavirus to develop the disease defined as infected cases here this was done using the information on daily admission or daily onset of symptoms the distribution of the incubation period and the distribution of the time from the onset of symptoms to hospital admission we used mathematical and statistical models to build on the relations among the various parameters analyzing the daily number of infected cases would allow us to capture the occurrence of sses in an epidemic in an sse the number of infected cases would exceed the expected numbers derived from the number of infectious individuals in the community and the infection rate we estimated the number of infected cases due to the sses by subtracting the expected number of infected cases if no sse occurred from the estimated total number of infected cases we further explored the relations between the daily number of symptomatic cases and the daily number of infected cases and tried to identify the groups of symptomatic individuals who were most likely to be infectious the implications for control of future sars epidemics or other epidemics involving sses are discussed  detailed statistics on daily admissions of sars cases in hong kong were obtained from the clinical trials centre of the university of hong kong 13 and the distribution of the daily onset of sars cases in singapore was obtained from the morbidity and mortality weekly report 6 the data available for hong kong allowed us to do separate estimations for three subgroups residents of amoy gardens health-care workers and the general community excluding the former two groups the daily numbers of individuals who were exposed to the sars coronavirus and who subsequently developed the disease ie the infected cases were predicted from the distribution of the daily number of hospital admissions for the hong kong data and from the distribution of the daily number of symptom onsets for the singapore data  let en be the number of infected cases on day n on be the daily number of individuals with the onset of symptoms who were assumed to become infectious and in be the daily number of individuals who were admitted to a hospital we considered the relation among the daily number of infected cases the daily number with onset of symptoms and the daily number of admissions to a hospital using a simple statistical model 

 

 where n1 was the longest incubation period from infection to symptom onset n1  15 and n2 was the longest infectious period which was assumed to be from symptom onset to admission n2  15 the incubation period distribution pj was the probability of the onset of symptoms on the jth day after exposure if an individual received a sufficient dose of the sars virus to cause the disease the daily admission distribution qj was the probability of admission on the jth day after becoming symptomatic the most reliable data on the reported daily probability of incubation pj and the daily probability of admission qj were probably those from donnelly et al 14 which were based on 57 well-defined cases in hong kong it was expected that errors would be introduced when applying these data to other regions or countries in particular the distribution of waiting time from symptom onset to hospital admission which might be affected significantly by local conditions fortunately both equation 2 and the daily probability of admission were not used for analyzing the singapore data as the daily distribution of individuals with onset of symptoms was available 6 the incubation period was 215 days and the onset probability satisfied a  distribution while the time from onset to admission was about 015 days and the admission probability satisfied another  distribution figure 1  rewriting equation 2 in a matrix form we have  
i  qo   where i  i1 i2  in1 and o  o14 o13  on1 q  ij is an n  n  15 matrix with iij  q15j for 1  i  n 0  j  15 and otherwise ij  0 the daily number of symptom onsets could then be obtained by solving the following nonlinear programming problem min0 fo  i  qoti  qo  where on  0  the trust region method 1517 was used here to solve the nonlinear problem similarly the daily number of infected cases could be estimated from the daily cases of symptom onset using equation 1 equation 1 has also been applied to study other diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids 18 anthrax 19 and bovine spongiform encephalopathy 20 it is known that the deconvolution problem obtained from equations 1 and 2 is ill posed 18 our numerical method was shown to be stable and to satisfy the positivity constraints  we used a simple model to explore the underlying relations among the daily number of infected cases the daily number of infectious cases symptomatic but not hospitalized the infection rate g of general spreaders per day and the number of infected cases due to sses the daily number of infected cases was composed of those who were infected by general spreaders egn and those infected by sses esn the number of infected cases on day n due to general spreaders should be proportional to the total number of individuals on day n with symptoms but not yet admitted to a hospital    was calculated as the sum of the residual individuals with onset of symptoms in each of the previous 15 days longest lag time before admission who were not yet admitted to a hospital the number of residual individuals with symptoms on day n who had an onset of symptoms dated n  j where 0  j  15 was as follows 
  we define  as the residual probability of being symptomatic without hospital admission 
   thus the total number of individuals on day n with symptoms but not yet admitted to hospitals could be calculated as follows 

 thus the daily number of infected cases satisfied the following equation 

 we assume that the infection rate g was constant during the entire infectious period for a general spreader 8  distinguishing the infection between the two types of spreaders was not easy we adopted a simple approach and assumed that the infection rate of the general spreaders was no higher than those obtained by riley et al 8 and lipsitch et al 9 that is the number infected by each general spreader was assumed to be not greater than three as the mean infectious period from symptom onset to admission determined by the  distribution was 318 days the average infection rate per day for an infectious individual was 094 3318 this infection rate value was not applicable after the public health control measures were instituted an average daily infection rate for the entire duration of the epidemics in hong kong and singapore could also be calculated by the reported total number of infected cases 1 excluding those due to reported sses table 1 divided by the total number of cases daily that were symptomatic but not yet admitted to a hospital over the entire period of the epidemic obtained by summing the daily number of symptomatic cases that were not yet admitted to a hospital equation 6 over the entire duration of the epidemics with this method the average infection rate per day of general spreaders for the entire epidemic was found to be 023 and 014 for hong kong and singapore respectively once the infection rate of the general spreaders was known the number of infected cases due to sses on the same day could be calculated as follows 
   relevant information on major reported sses was obtained from morbidity and mortality weekly reports 6 21 in addition lee et al 22 describe the march 2003 outbreak at the prince of wales hospital in hong kong and the hong kong government 3 and the world health organization investigation team 4 report on the epidemiologic and environmental investigations of the amoy gardens outbreak in hong kong the sses captured by the predicted daily number of infected cases and the estimated numbers of infected cases due to sses would be compared against the features dates numbers infected of the reported sses  we explored the relations between the daily number of symptomatic cases who were not hospitalized and the daily number of infected cases by calculating pearsons correlation coefficient the correlation between the daily number of infected cases and the different subgroups of symptomatic cases was also explored to identify the groups of symptomatic individuals who were most likely to be infectious  figures 2 and 3 show the predicted daily number of infected cases and the daily numbers of hospital admissions for sars in hong kong among the total population the health-care workers the amoy gardens residents and the general community each peak or aggregate of cases in time could be interpreted as reflecting an sse in which one or more infectious subjects could be involved the curves for infected cases in figure 2 parts a and b and figure 3 part b were characterized by three obvious high peaks on march 910 march 2021 and march 31april 2 respectively the first peak march 910 corresponded to the outbreak of sars at the prince of wales hospital 5 the second peak march 2021 corresponded to the outbreak of sars in the amoy gardens figure 3 part a the third peak coincided with the peak in hospital admission of cases in hong kong figure 2 part a there appeared to be synchronized occurrences of infection peaks in both the general community and among health-care workers in hong kong visible only in the derived time series of infections and not in the observed series of admissions and there were certain days with no predicted infected cases another 34 smaller aggregates of cases were discerned following the three major peaks for amoy gardens a single peak stood out around march 20 figure 3 part a with another aggregate of infected cases around april 4 our estimated daily number of infected cases in singapore revealed six peaks occurring around march 4 march 11 march 21 march 30 april 8 and april 16 figure 4  the reported super spreaders in hong kong and singapore summarized in table 1 correspond fairly well with the peaks or aggregates of predicted infected cases captured in figures 2 3 and 4 all reported sses in singapore and that of the patient aged 26 years in hong kong occurred in hospitals while the index patients were hospitalized before isolation 6 22 the predicted period of peaks in table 1 agreed well with the dates of hospitalization the suspected infection period as derived from the date of isolation for all super spreaders except the patient aged 53 years who was reported to be isolated on march 20 the index case in the outbreak at amoy gardens patient aged 33 years table 1 was known to have stayed overnight on march 14 and 19 at a flat in amoy gardens our predicted infection peak was march 2021  there was good agreement between the predicted number of infected cases due to sses and the reported number of infected cases traced back to the identified super spreaders table 1 in general each sse in hong kong caused more infections than in singapore on the other hand sses in hong kong accounted for 711 percent 1247 of 1755 cases of all sars infections whereas in singapore they were responsible for 748 percent 178 of 238 cases of all cases our prediction also revealed four unidentified sses in hong kong and one in singapore  no correlation was found between the daily number of newly infected cases and the daily total number of symptomatic cases who were not yet hospitalized potentially infectious cases and pearsons linear correlation coefficient r was less than 01 for both singapore and hong kong there was better correlation between the number of infected cases and the number of symptomatic cases with 4 or more days after the onset of symptoms but not yet admitted to a hospital with r  0128 p  026 two tailed for singapore and 0292 p  003 two tailed for hong kong figure 5 the correlation coefficients between the number of infected cases and the number of symptomatic cases with 10 or more days after the onset of symptoms but not yet admitted to hospitals are 0152 p  018 two tailed for singapore and 0518 p  0001 two tailed for hong kong on the other hand subgroups of potentially infectious cases with different incubation periods did not show any correlation with the daily number of infected cases  by making use of the probability distributions of the incubation period and the time from the onset of symptoms to hospital admission as well as the relations between the daily number of infected cases or between the daily number with symptom onset and the daily number of hospital admissions we were able to estimate the daily numbers of newly infected cases which were usually not known during the epidemics plotting the daily number of newly infected cases allowed us to identify peaks or aggregates of infections that would suggest sses the good agreement between our predicted infection peaks and the reported occurrence of all seven sses in hong kong and singapore suggested some underlying but not yet fully understood mechanisms of disease transmission the possibility of predicting the likely exposure time also helps in environmental studies to identify the environmental conditions at the time of infection we predicted several additional sses that had not been identified and reported it might be worthwhile to document and investigate these unidentified sses retrospectively by reviewing relevant medical records and epidemiologic investigation reports  it is not known whether the larger number of infected cases per sse in hong kong when compared with singapore table 1 was due to differences in the effectiveness of or variations in the choice of disease control measures or due to other factors such as a higher population density in hong kong and other environmental factors interestingly the average infection rate per day of general spreaders for the entire epidemic period in hong kong was also significantly greater than that in singapore 023 compared with 014 according to our estimations sses played a very important role in the sars epidemic being responsible for nearly three fourths of the infections in hong kong and singapore this has important public health implications if our model is valid the control of sars epidemics would be directly governed by the ability to preventcontrol the sses one super spreader or sse could ignite a whole new outbreak if the mechanisms of an sse or effective control strategies are not identified  in singapore and hong kong not all patients with sars were infectious in fact the majority of them had very low if any infectivity this supports the findings of a hospital study in vietnam that most sars patients do not transmit the virus 23 in singapore 81 percent of the first 205 reported probable sars patients had no evidence of transmission to other persons 6 it is not known whether there were differences of many orders of magnitude in the viral shedding rate in time or between infected individuals there was also no evidence to show whether a super spreader could remain infectious during the entire symptomatic period prior to admission however our results seemed to suggest that each super spreader had a relatively short period of strong infectivity with the peaks in predicted numbers of new infections indicating sses being quite narrow  why sses occurred has remained a mystery and the identification of potential super spreaders could be difficult our results strongly suggest that the daily number of new infections did not depend on the total number of symptomatic cases as only a very small proportion of the symptomatic individuals were infectious we do not know exactly what makes a super spreader different from other infected individuals but our results suggested that late admission to a hospital more than 4 days after symptom onset could be partly responsible for the occurrence of sses especially during the early phase of the epidemic since patients admitted late would have developed a high viral load this agrees with the results of a study of sses in beijing where the efficiency of sars transmission increases at a later stage of the illness 24 peiris et al 25 found that the viral load increased after the onset of symptoms and peaked at around day 10 the world health organizations consensus document on the sars epidemiology 23 noted that in the data from singapore few secondary cases occurred when symptomatic cases were isolated within 5 days of illness onset the importance of early detectiondiagnosis and early admissionisolation cannot be overemphasized  the mechanisms for the high-frequency transmission of most super spreaders remain largely unknown the super spreading phenomena of ebola were suspected to be due to a larger number of contacts of the super spreaders or some inherent differences in the virus-host relations such as perhaps a more virulent virus strain or higher levels of viral shedding 11 the great variability in the numbers of infected cases among the seven identified super spreaders in sars epidemics in singapore and hong kong suggested that some epidemiologic and environmental factors could have contributed to the infection for the outbreak at amoy gardens in hong kong it has been suggested that the environmental control systems drainage system and aerosol flows were responsible for amplifying the virus sources and for transmitting the virus to a large number of people 3 in the case of the prince of wales hospital the use of a nebulized bronchodilator was believed to be an important factor that increased the droplet loading surrounding the index patient 5 however new studies suggest the possible roles of airborne virus-laden aerosols and the ventilation system design 26 these two examples suggest the possible roles of the environment in amplifying viral sources in sses and further support our hypothesis that an sse is also determined by environmental factors hence proper environmental and ventilation design would be very important in controlling future sse-based sars coronavirus transmissions  sses need to be properly investigated to identify the common underlying factors for the effective prevention of sars in the future these factors may be associated with the agent the environment andor the host factors related to the agent would include the strain infectivity virulence virus load and source and survival in different media environmental factors such as proximity of contacts temperature humidity aerosolization processes airflows and ventilation can be important host factors would include age sex nutritional status immune defense comorbidity personal habits and drug use  it is obviously important to critically evaluate the assumptions and the numerical procedure in the simple model for example the estimates of infection numbers and dates are sensitive to the incubation period distribution donnelly et al 14 reported that the mean incubation period was 637 95 percent confidence interval 529 775 days the world health organization consensus document 23 also summarized that the mean incubation periods were 472 days we performed a sensitivity study by considering three different incubation probability distributions with a mean of 53 637 and 73 days with both a small and a large variance 8 and 1669 days2 the predicted general intermittent behavior of the infection patterns is very similar but the infection peaks can be advanced or delayed by about 1 day  there are a number of limitations to our mathematical analyses we used data on reported cases from governments which might include only those sars cases with more severe clinical symptoms it is still unclear whether a subclinical form of the disease exists in the community our chosen mathematical model was also a simple one and did not include the spatial relations of disease transmission 8 the assumption of the infectious period from symptom onset to hospital admission did not consider the fact that some patients were still infectious after hospitalization but were not under effective isolation during the early days of the epidemic after the strict isolation measures were implemented in hong kong and singapore the reported date of admission would be equivalent to the date of isolation although some limited hospital-acquired infection might still occur in hong kong the community infection constituted a much higher proportion of the total number of cases than in singapore the impact of the infectivity period assumption on the analyses for hong kong might be smaller than the impact on those for singapore  the simple mathematical model for determining the occurrence of sses can be used to determine the key parameters of sses during any potential future sars epidemics in practice such a simple model needs to be combined with studies on transmission dynamics which provide essential data on the infection rate of the general spreaders the accuracy of the prediction of sse occurrence depends on the accuracy of the input data that is the distribution of the daily number of individuals admitted to hospitals or becoming symptomatic the daily probability of symptom onset after being infected and the daily probability of being admitted to hospitals after developing symptoms this means that various hypotheses derived from our analyses remain to be confirmed by further epidemiologic and clinical studies  this study was supported by hong kong university sars research fund 2003

  modelling the impact of plasma therapy and immunotherapy for recovery of covid-19 infected individuals h shah h suthar n jayswal shukla   since the first case of covid-19 was detected in wuhan china in december 2019 covid-19 has become a pandemic causing a global economic and public health emergency there is no known treatment or vaccine available for covid-19 to date immunotherapy and plasma therapy has been used with satisfactory efficacy over the past two decades in many viral infections like sars systemic acute respiratory syndrome mers middle east respiratory syndrome and h1n1 limited data from china show clinical benefit radiological resolution reduction in viral loads and improved survival our aim is to create a mathematical model for covid-19 transmission and then apply various control parameters to see their effects on recovery from covid-19 disease we have formulated a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations calculated basic reproduction r0 and applied five different controls self-isolation quarantine herd immunity immunotherapy plasma therapy to test the effectiveness of control strategy control optimality was checked by lagrangian functions numerical simulations and bifurcation analyses were carried out the study concludes that the covid-19 outbreak can be controlled up to a significant level three weeks after applying all the control strategies together these strategies lead to a reduction in hospitalization and a rise in recovery from infection immunotherapy is highly effective initially in hospitalized infected individuals however better results were seen in the long term with plasma therapy  the first case of unknown pneumonia was detected in wuhan china in december 2019 and was later identified as covid-19 spread by sars cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 cohen and normile 2020  covid-19 was declared as pandemic on 11th march by who it has spread to 210 countries and as per worldometer worldometer 2020  and as of 25th april 2020 worldwide total cases are around 2915365 and total deaths are 206482 it caused global economic and public health emergencies it spreads by direct or indirect contact 2 with a respiratory droplets from infected individuals holshue et al 2020  several steps like physical distancing quarantine and other sanitizing habits have shown some success in slowing down the pandemic but it is still far from being contained in most countries there is no known treatment or vaccine available the antimalarial drug chloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin have showed some hope against covid-19 but its efficacy has been recently debated syal 2020  other potential therapeutic agents tried so far include remdesivir lopinavir  ritonavir kaletra tocilizumabactemra remdesivir have shown some promise in controlling the covid-19 disease holshue et al 2020 lu 2020 russell et al 2020 wang et al 2020  most people in developing countries cannot afford costly therapeutic interventions like mechanical ventilators and prolonged lockdown pandemic must be curtailed so that health infrastructure can manage it efficiently as there is no known treatment and vaccine available herd immunity can help in decreasing its spread syal 2020 immunotherapy and plasma therapy has been used effectively as a therapeutic option against many viral infections the main methods in immunotherapy include several vaccines and monoclonal antibody candidates convalescent plasma cp therapy has been used for the prevention and treatment of many infectious diseases for more than one century in both sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus and sars-cov-2 viruses entry into the host cells is mediated by the interaction of the receptor-binding domain rbd in s protein on virus outer-membrane and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 on cell so these proteins can be the major potential targets for immunotherapy aminjafari and ghasemi 2020 duan et al 2020b  cp refers to plasma that is collected from individuals following the resolution of infection and development of antibodies over the past two decades cp therapy was successfully used in the treatment of sars mers middle east

infection and severe influenza showed a statistically significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following cp therapy compared with placebo or no therapy odds ratio 025 95 confidence interval 014-045 mair-jenkins et al 2015  since sars mers and covid-19 shares similar virologic and clinical symptomatology lee and hsueh 2020  cp therapy might be a promising treatment option for covid-19 treatment chen et al 2020  studies done by cheng cheng et al 2005 in hong kong reported that in 2003 during sars outbreak patients who received convalescent plasma had a lower mortality rate 125 compared with the overall sars-related mortality for admitted patients n  299 17 convalescent plasma cp has also been used in the covid-19 pandemic limited data from china suggest clinical benefit radiological resolution reduction in viral loads and improved survival bloch et al 2020  while fractionated plasma products eg hyperimmune globulin monoclonal antibodies andor vaccination may offer durable therapeutic options human anti-sars-cov-2 plasma is the only therapeutic option that is immediately available for use to treat covid-19 bloch et al 2020  studies done by shen et al and duan et al duan et al 2020b shen et al 2020 concluded that convalescent plasma therapy is well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcome they collected cp from patients three weeks after they recovered from covid-19 and from the patients who were having normal body temperature for  3 days not having respiratory symptoms and there two consecutive pcr 3 sars cov-2 test 24 hours apart has been negative their study result showed a decline in inflammatory markers improvement in patients antibody titer and pcr sars cov-2 became negative cfr case fatality rate was 0 in the study done by duan et al however there were several limitations of the study including small sample size lack of randomized double-blind controlled study those patients received other medications like antivirals  kaletra steroids at the same time and it is difficult to attribute all improvement to plasma therapy alone their study indicates that convalescent plasma therapy could be the most critical weapon in the fight with covid-19 in severe cases survivors of the covid-19 may play a key role in both herd immunity as well as the availability of plasma therapy syal 2020  since the effective vaccine and specific antiviral medicines are unavailable there is an urgent need to look for an alternative strategy for covid-19 treatment especially among severe patients our aim for the present study is to create a compartmental mathematical model for covid-19 transmission and then apply various control parameters like self-isolation quarantine of infected individual and hospitalization to receive medication immunotherapy and convalescent plasma therapy and see their effects on recovery from covid-19 disease 9 3 in this section a basic model for covid-19 transmission dynamics among humans is constructed infected individuals who regularly come in contact with exposed class for example vegetable vendor grocery store-keeper policeman or security man delivery man etc they all unknowingly spreads infection at high rate hence these population class are considered to be a super active spreader of the infection remaining all infected symptomatically and asymptomatically individuals who are capable to infect others are considered to be an active spreader of covid-19 infection the model contains these two different class of infected classes who are the spreader of the infection and accelerate the intensity of the covid-19 outbreak in some cases strong immunity of infected individual can defeat the infection and can make individual disease free without hospitalisation moreover in some cases recovered individuals again shows symptoms of the disease and hence they need to get hospitalisation again these two situation are also considered in the present model  cc-by-nc-nd 40

substituting all parametric values from table 1 we get the threshold value 0 r 34709 which represent the average number of secondary cases generated by an infected individual in completely susceptible population from this calculation we can say the model or the current outbreak is in highly unstable hence certain control strategies are very essential to impose to come out from pandemic situation in this section we extend the system 1 to include five time dependent control strategies 1  ut  2  ut 3  ut 4  utand 5  ut regarding isolation of infected individuals and medication to improve immunity to fight against the covid-19 outbreak here control variables 1  ut and 2  utmeasures the quarantine or isolation of the individuals who are spreader and super spreader respectively we can provide herd immunity or herd protection to those who are not immune to the covid-19 disease by improving immunity in most of the population also strong immunity of large mass can control further spread of covid-19 infection the control variable 3  utindicates the strategy which increases the herd immunity which helps quarantined individuals to get recovered without medication the control variable 4  ut suggests to provide proper immunotherapy include several types of vaccines monoclonal antibody candidates and etc to hospitalised individuals which helps them to fight against the viral infection in present situation where proper vaccination is not 7 available for the covid-19 a convalescent plasma therapy have sparked a ray of hope the convalescent plasma therapys effects as treatment for

that they decreases with time and become negligible in 5-6 weeks in this duration since individuals in exposed and hospitalised class are still present again growth in infection is observed after 7-8 weeks of the outbreak from this graph we can say that without any control strategies the infection can re-emerge in the society after some time of duration hence proper control strategies are essential to break the periodic chain of this infection figure 4a and 4b displays the effect of super active spreaders on class of exposed and infected individuals respectively figure 4 a shows that

respectively since the super spreader can create more infection notable changes in the recovery rate is observed when a gradual change made in the parameter 3   but it will reduce later our study showed that in the initial week of the outbreak there is a large number of people who are infected and behave as active and super active spreader but in about 5-6 weeks of the time they become negligible many super active spreaders are becoming aware of the mode of disease transmission and stop spreading the infection by self-isolation however there are still exposed and hospitalized individuals who are responsible for resurgence or second wave of infection at around 7-8 weeks of time bifurcation analysis showed that rc critical point is 223 and ro is 35 and by observing the current situation of this pandemic it is very difficult to bring the value of ro below rc in a short period of time all the control measures including self-isolation quarantine herd immunity immunotherapy and plasma therapy should be applied together to fight back covid-19 in around 50 days effectiveness of self-isolation varies between 10-32 quarantine is about 21 herd immunity is about

ningbo was confirmed as a covid-19 patient she contacted with a person from wuhan at a gathering on january 17 and felt a fever on january 19 nevertheless she joined a blessing ceremony in a temple held by a travel agency by a tour bus on january 19 figure s1 in supplementary material the blessing ceremony gathered 348 pilgrims and three tour buses were arranged to pick up the pilgrims coincidently a 57-year-old woman in cixi a city 719 km from ningbo was confirmed as a covid-19 patient also on january 29 she had no history of sojourning in hubei and had not been exposed to confirmed covid-19 cases however she drove to attend the blessing ceremony on january 19 as well and contacted with ms s during the activity all members attended the blessing activity were found and isolated timely between january 29 and february 6 a total of twenty-five included ms s covid-19 cases and one asymptomatic case related to the blessing ceremony were confirmed of note twenty-five of them reported that have contacted with ms s and twenty-two twenty-one covid-19 cases and one asymptomatic cases of them on the same tour bus with ms s fig 1
 all pilgrims attended the blessing ceremony without mask and all pilgrims except for ms s reported no history of epidemiological exposure and had no covid-19 related symptoms in addition daughter and husband of ms s onset of illness on january 22 and were confirmed as covid-19 on january 25 the first non-imported case in ningbo and january 27 respectively besides the infectious rate of her close contact is 3299 much higher than the average rate in ningbo 615 3 given above information we considered ms s as a super-spreader who can infect 10 or more contacts all seventy-seven patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov-2 virus involved in the present study were diagnosed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay 4 according to treatment and diagnosis guidance published by national health commission 5 and the attack rate is 747 26348 among the pilgrims as of february 12 accumulative total of 1257 related close contacts were monitored and isolated and a total of seventy-seven persons sixty-six covid-19 cases and eleven asymptomatic cases were confirmed to have been infected with the sars-cov-2 virus in the present case series we reported a super-spreader who transmitted the sars-cov-2 virus to twenty-eight individuals and caused twenty-seven covid-19 cases and an asymptomatic case furthermore another forty-nine individuals were infected by the twenty-eight individuals thirty-nine covid-19 cases and ten asymptomatic cases fortunately aggressive contact tracing and testing adopted by our government stopped the ses from further spreading 6 this case arouses the concern regarding the reason behind the super-spreading ability and highlights the importance of identifying and quarantining any one in close contact with a confirmed covid-19 patient as soon as possible ms s is a patient in moderate case which is defined as with respiratory symptoms and pulmonary inflammatory lesion to understand the reasons underlying the effective transmission ability we summarized the sars-cov-2 viral load in sputum and throat swab samples from ms s during her thirty-five days from january 27 to march 2 in our hospital fig 2

0 of the covid-19 system model in section 32 we study the local stability of the disease free equilibrium in terms of r
0 the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number r
0 with respect to the parameters of the system model is given in section 4 the usefulness of our model is then illustrated in section 5 of numerical simulations where we use real data from wuhan we end with section 6 of conclusions discussion and future research based on a 2016 model 10 and taking into account the existence of super-spreaders in the family of corona virus 11 we propose a new epidemiological compartment model that takes into account the super-spreading phenomenon of some individuals moreover we consider a fatality compartment related to death due to the virus infection in doing so the constant total population size n is subdivided into eight epidemiological classes susceptible class s exposed class e symptomatic and infectious class i super-spreaders class p infectious but asymptomatic class a hospitalized h recovery class r and fatality class f the model takes the following form1dsdtinslhnspnsdedtinslhnspnsedidt1eaiiiidpdt2eaipppdadt112edhdtaiprhhhdrdtiiprhdfdtiitppthht with  quantifying the human-to-human transmission coefficient per unit time days per person  quantifies a high transmission coefficient due to super-spreaders and l quantifies the relative transmissibility of hospitalized patients here  is the rate at which an individual leaves the exposed class by becoming infectious symptomatic super-spreaders or asymptomatic 
1 is the proportion of progression from exposed class e to symptomatic infectious class i 
2 is a relative very low rate at which exposed individuals become super-spreaders while 112 is the progression from exposed to asymptomatic class a is the average rate at which symptomatic and super-spreaders individuals become hospitalized i is the recovery rate without being hospitalized r is the recovery rate of hospitalized patients and i p and h are the disease induced death rates due to infected super-spreaders and hospitalized individuals respectively at each instant of time2dtiitppthhtdftdt gives the number of death due to the disease the transmissibility from asymptomatic individuals has been modeled in this way since it was not apparent their behavior indeed at present this question is a controversial issue for epidemiologists a flowchart of model 1 is presented in figure 1
 the basic reproduction number as a measure for disease spread in a population plays an important role in the course and control of an ongoing outbreak it can be understood as the average number of cases one infected individual generates over the course of its infectious period in an otherwise uninfected population using the next generation matrix approach outlined in 13 to our model 1 the basic reproduction number can be computed by considering the below generation matrices f and v that is the jacobian matrices associated to the rate of appearance of new infections and the net rate out of the corresponding compartments respectivelyjf0l000000000000andjv0001i0020p00aah where3iaiipaipandhrh
 the basic reproduction number r
0 is obtained as the spectral radius of fv1 precisely4r01alhihalh2ph
 for the parameters used in our simulations see table 1
 one computes this basic reproduction number to obtain r00945 this means that the epidemic outbreak that has occurred in wuhan was well controlled by the chinese authorities noting that the two last equations and the fifth of system 1 are uncoupled to the remaining equations of the system we can easily obtain by direct integration the following analytical results5at1120tesdsrti0tispsdsr0thsdsfti0tisdsp0tpsdsh0thsds
 furthermore since the total population size n is constant one has6stnetitptathtrtft
 therefore the local stability of model 1 can be studied through the remaining coupled system of states variables namely the variables e i p and h in 1 the jacobian matrix associated to these variables of 1 is the following one7jml1i0020p00aah where i p and h are defined in 3 the eigenvalues of the matrix jm are the roots of the following characteristic polynomialz4a13a22a1a4 wherea1hipa212hihiphpipa3al1al21h2h1p2ihihpiphipa4al2ial1p2ih1hphip

 moreover we also compute in terms of r

 from these previous expressions it is clear that if r
0  1 then the conditions of the linardchipard test are satisfied and as a consequence the disease free equilibrium is stable in the case when r

 next we investigate the sensitiveness of the covid-19 model 1 with respect to the variation of each one of its parameters for the endemic threshold 4 as we saw in section 3 the basic reproduction number for the covid-19 model 1 which we propose in section 2 is given by 4 the sensitivity analysis for the endemic threshold 4 tells us how important each parameter is to disease transmission this information is crucial not only for experimental design but also to data assimilation and reduction of complex models 16 sensitivity analysis is commonly used to determine the robustness of model predictions to parameter values since there are usually errors in collected data and presumed parameter values it is used to discover parameters that have a high impact on the threshold r
0 and should be targeted by intervention strategies more accurately sensitivity indices allows us to measure the relative change in a variable when a parameter changes for that purpose we use the normalized forward sensitivity index of a variable with respect to a given parameter which is defined as the ratio of the relative change in the variable to the relative change in the parameter if such variable is differentiable with respect to the parameter then the sensitivity index is defined as followsdefinition 11see 17 18the normalized forward sensitivity index of r
0 which is differentiable with respect to a given parameter  is defined byr0r0r0

 the values of the sensitivity indices for the parameters values of table 1 are presented in table 2
 these values have been determined experimentally in such a way the mathematical model describes well the real data giving rise to figures 2
and 3
 other values for the parameters can be found eg in 19 note that the sensitivity index may depend on several parameters of the system but also can be constant independent of any parameter for example r01 means that increasing decreasing  by a given percentage increases decreases always r
0 by that same percentage the estimation of a sensitive parameter should be carefully done since a small perturbation in such parameter leads to relevant quantitative changes on the other hand the estimation of a parameter with a rather small value for the sensitivity index does not require as much attention to estimate because a small perturbation in that parameter leads to small changes from table 2 we conclude that the most sensitive parameters to the basic reproduction number r
0 of the covid-19 model 1 are  
1 and i in concrete an increase of the value of  will increase the basic reproduction number by 963 and this happens in a similar way for the parameter 
1 in contrast an increase of the value of i will decrease r
0 by 699 we perform numerical simulations to compare the results of our model with the real data obtained from several reports published by who 20 21 and worldometer 5 the starting point of our simulations is 4 january 2020 day 0 when the chinese authorities informed about the new virus 20 with already 6 confirmed cases in one day from this period up to january 19 there is less information about the number of people contracting the disease only on january 20 we have the report 21 with 1460 new reported cases in that day and 26 the dead thus the infection gained much more attention from 21 january 2020 with 1739 confirmed cases and 38 the dead up to 4 march 2020 when the numbers in that day were as low as 11 and 7 respectively infected and dead after a pick of 3892 confirmed cases on 27 january 2020 and a pick of 254 dead on 4 february 2020 here we follow the data of the daily reports published by 5 we show that our covid-19 model describes well the real data of daily confirmed cases during the 2 months outbreak 66 days to be precise from january 4 to march 9 2020 the total population of wuhan is about 11 million during the covid-19 outbreak there was a restriction of movements of individuals due to quarantine in the city as a consequence there was a limitation on the spread of the disease in agreement in our model we consider as the total population under study n11000000250 this denominator has been determined in the first days of the outbreak and later has been proved to be a correct value according to the real data published by the who it is an appropriate value for the restriction of movements of individuals as for the initial conditions the following values have been fixed s0n6

sars-cov-2 on to at least eleven contacts since super-spreading events were associated with the outbreaks of sars and mers 19 20 21 22  it would be not a surprise to discover super-spreading events associated with covid-19 our study has a number of unique features 1 by coincidence this transmission chain started from a hospital ward shared by four female cancer patients and the female health care workers total of 23 outnumbered the male co-workers total of 17 as a result there were 60 female 3152 and 40 2152 male patients in this cohort which were different from other reports 3-5  2 we were able to identify several distinct clusters of cases based on the exposed time and the date of disease onset which helped connecting all the related activities and events 3 there were seven cancer patients in this study and five of them 71 died of severe respiratory failure within 2-20 days of their disease onsets suggesting that cancer patients were highly vulnerable to covid-19 and had rapid disease progression and high mortality rate due to immune suppression and comorbidities 4 approximately 135 752 of patients were asymptomatic individuals in this study table 1 15 of the rt-pcr positive patients were tested negative for the specific igm andor igg at the convalescent phase the discrepancy between the results of the rt-pcr assay and serological testing suggested the existence of possible false negative andor false positive with these assays both scenarios may significantly affect the clinical diagnosis and should be addressed accordingly by additional studies given the fact that strict clinical validation studies were not performed on any of these assays due to the urgent need for screening and diagnosis of covid-19 during the disease outbreak in particular it would be a huge concern if a significant portion of sars-cov-2 infected patients were tested negative for the specific igm and igg at the convalescent phase a large number of health care workers were infected with sars-cov-2 in our cohort which were consistent with a report that 41 of the 138 hospitalized patients at one of the major tertiary hospitals in wuhan were hospital-related transmission

stay-at-home orders start to be lifted across the globe governments are struggling to establish effective and practical guidelines to reopen their economies in dense urban environments with people returning to work and public transportation resuming full capacity enforcing strict social distancing measures will be extremely challenging if not practically impossible governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations that may become the next cluster of disease spreading indeed certain places like some people can be super-spreaders is a bustling train station in a central business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared to teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs here we propose a quantitative and systematic framework to identify spatial super-spreaders and the novel concept of super-susceptibles ie respectively places most likely to contribute to disease spread or to people contracting it our proposed data-analytic framework is based on the daily-aggregated ridership data of public transport in singapore by constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks and integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics we are able to pinpoint super-spreader and super-susceptible locations our results reveal that most super-spreaders are also super-susceptibles and that counterintuitively busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than crowded central train stations our analysis is based on data from singapore but can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center it therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost-effective preventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness arxiv200505063v1 physicssoc-ph 11 may 2020 refer to these public guidelines as compared to social distancing indeed the main idea is to increase the physical distance between individuals regardless of their possible social connections this point stresses the key issue of infectious disease spreading in high-density environments such as most of the chinese cities as well as the citiescountries hit by the first wave of covid-19 the concept of super-spreader has become an important element in network science 12  in particular when applied to contagious processes and not necessarily just associated with viral contagions eg in social network studies 13 14 15 16  the 2080 rule has been observed in many disease spreading studies and reflecting the fact that about 20 of the people are responsible for approximately 80 spread of an infectious disease this population is referred to as super-spreaders 17 18  given this 2080 rule it appears clearly that identifying super-spreaders is of great theoretical significance as well as high practical importance in terms of disease control it has therefore attracted significant attention from the research community and the public sector previous studies focused on social networks 19 20 -with nodes representing individuals and linksedges corresponding to their social interactions-to search for the most influential people according to some particular network metrics-eg degree closeness betweenness centralities k-shell decomposition etc 14 16 21 22 23 24  in recent studies researchers have uncovered that the characteristics of neighboring nodes ie the semi-local information or its local structure strongly influence the nodes spreading capability 25 26 27  in addition some studies have shown that when super-spreaders-as identified through local or semi-local measurements and metrics-belong to the same local community their spreading effectiveness maybe high within that community but can be seriously hindered at the global network level thus some methods have been developed to perform community detection while also identifying the top-k super-spreaders 23 28  in summary previous studies concluded that two particular node characteristics are key to quantifying their influential power and super-spreader potential 1 the nodes local information-ie the immediate interaction with its neighboring nodes and 2 the nodes community and how it is itself connected to the rest of the network those studies integrated both local and semi-local network metrics in order to identify super-spreaders from social networks 15 26  as highlighted previously the concept of super-spreader focuses on person-based social interactions however when considering large-scale human analyses such as those in country-wide or city-wide studies this concept of super-spreader faces some serious practical challenges owing to inherent need of massive amount of data related to person-to-person interactions and co-presence activity to overcome this critical challenge associated with social and co-presence networks researchers have introduced a particular class of spatial networks to conceptualize the interactions between physical places 29  thereby enabling to analyze and gain insight into the influence of particular spaces and locations on disease spreading 30-33  indeed people constantly move from place to place during their daily activity and these movements offer the opportunity for infectious diseases to spreading as viruses or pathogens could be transmitted from individual to individual 34-36  it is worth adding that the urban structure has been used to rank the concentration of human activity and population density 37-39  to incorporate human movement individual interactions and models of disease spreading-eg susceptible exposed infectious recovered or seir model-previous studies applied the metapopulation model to simulate the disease diffusion dynamic process 31 32 40  in summary spatial networks can be useful in uncovering the spatial structures behind disease diffusion networks and provide decision-making supports for country-wide or city-wide prevention measures the vast majority of previous spatial network studies on disease diffusion focused on the space-time development and potential impacts of the disease however to the best of our knowledge no attention has been paid to studying the impact of the most influential geographical spaces among these spatial networks here the adjective influential refers to the particular role in the network sense played by those spaces within the considered spatial networks similar to the concept of super-spreaders in social networks the concept of super-spreader in spatial human movement networks indicates that owing to the inhomogeneous population flow some places ie nodes of the spatial network would experience higher flow intensities than some other places thus influencing the distribution in the capability to spread a contagious disease to a larger extent in a shorter time period while the concept of super-spreader location focuses on the ability to spread the disease the concept of super-susceptible location emphasizes the high likelihood of contracting the viral disease at a particular location compared to less susceptible ones 41 42 43  in other words by identifying super-susceptible locations we aim finding the most susceptible nodes within the spatial human movement network one similar concept in spatial analysis is the low-high outliers that is any location with low density of disease cases which is surrounded by high density locations thereby making it more vulnerable as it has a higher probability to report a higher number of cases in the following time period 44  in the field of network science the concepts of spreaders and receivers first appeared in the hyperlink-induced topic search hits algorithm 45 as hubs and authorities respectively in the hits algorithm hubs describe highly influential nodes while authorities represent highly popular destination nodes to sum-up the spatial super-susceptibles correspond to the susceptible locations in a spatial diffusion network these locations are identified as being more vulnerable within the network as they are the destination of more people hence generating a higher probability of being visited by infected agents the spatial super-susceptibles are vulnerable locations as they are prone to disease infection thereby having the potential to become hotbeds for disease spreading to the rest of a city or region note that if a place is both spatial super-spreader and spatial  the ongoing outbreak of the infectious coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 also known as ncov-2019 and caused by the pathogen sars-cov-2 is progressing worldwide with a reported number of cases surpassing 3 million 1 as of april 29 2020  the pathology of covid-19 and its global spread remain a critical challenge to all worldwide 2 3  as of this writing no approved treatment for covid-19 has been identified and a vaccine is expected to be 12 months to 18 months away from being widely available based on our current medical knowledge covid-19 is more infectious than the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is caused by sars-cov-1 4 5  and with the main transmission pathway being through respiratory droplets with infected patients experiencing an incubation period of maximum 14 days possibly longer in some reported cases before exhibiting a set of flu-like symptoms 6 7  the asymptomatic latent period of covid-19 and its highly contagious nature have made the spread of covid-19 extremely difficult to control and prevent 5  the outbreak of covid-19 started in december 2019 in the city of wuhan hubei province of china following the domestic outbreak in mainland china the disease started spreading worldwide in january 2020 or even as early as december 2020 leading to a declaration of public health emergency of international concern pheic by the world health organization who 8  until this declaration of pheic a total of 7 818 cases were confirmed in which 82 only were cases outside china 8  in february 2020 covid-19 continued spreading internationally primarily in east and southeast asia as well as some european countries having extensive air-travel routes to wuhan and china the first wave of international spreading took place during the critical period of the chinese new year holiday during which china experiences the largest human migration every year 9  countries that were first hit by this outbreak include thailand japan singapore south korea france germany and the united kingdom 10  those imported cases have quickly turned into local transmissions in most of these countries in march 2020 as the outbreak reached an exponential growth in italy spain france and germany the epicenter of covid-19 moved to europe 11  which became the second wave of this outbreak and international pandemic that second wave triggered a near-complete lockdown in most of the largest european countries the purpose of these country-level or city-level lockdowns was to introduce and enforce strict social distancing measures that were hoped to bring a fast reduction in the spread of imported and local community transmissions the central assumption behind these drastic public-health measures was that restricting human movement is key to controlling the spread of covid-19 in communities between cities and countries physical distancing has been coined as a better term to super-susceptible it would require particular attention since it would pose the risk of simultaneously being a hotbed of infection and disease spreader identifying these places would therefore be critical in the fight with infectious diseases such as in this article we report a study aimed at systematically identifying the spatial super-spreaders and spatial super-susceptibles in the spatial human network of the city-state of the republic of singapore the particular choice of singapore stems from it having 1 been hit early in the first wave of infection directly from wuhan and with a systematic tracking and mapping of infected people 46  2 one of the highest population densities in southeast asia 3 a dense and highly interconnected human mobility and transportation networks 38 47  and 4 detailed and reliable data for the construction of spatial networks 48  as mentioned earlier a spatial super-spreader is a locus with a high outflow of people-ie a place where a lot of people are originated from and those people are moving to a high variety of places in the same vein a spatial super-susceptible is a destination for a large number of individuals originating from different places hence this work proposes a systematic data-centric framework enabling the identification of spatial locations which should be targeted by public health agencies in the event of an epidemic such as covid-19 with these critical places identified policy makers would then be able to implement cost-effective targeted responses with prevention and intervention measures directly connected to the level of vulnerability of a given location this section is divided into three parts descriptions of a the study area b the flow data and c the metrics and indexes this study focuses on the public transportation flow network in singapore the city-state primarily occupies an island located in southeast asia with a total surface area of about 7242 km 2  as of 2019 the total population of singapore is about 5703 million people with a population density of about 7 87568 per km 2  in which 706 are residents citizens and permanent residents and 294 are non-residents foreigners with long-term passes according to the general household survey 2015 49  about 627 students and 641 working person relies on bus or rail transport services to travel to schools or work places thereby making public transportation the primary mode of transportation in singapore as a result the density of people using the public transports during the morning and evening peaks are high and the distance between people at the stations and vehicles is short hence a direct consequence of the high population density combined with a high rate of people using public transportation is that physical distancing is extremely challenging if not impossible during regular operations this issue is a serious concern when facing the spreading of a highly contagious disease such as covid-19 to analyze the data we consider the administrative subzone level spatial boundaries from the singapore master plan 2014 50  as the analysis unit the residential population density from the general household survey 2015 49  are shown in fig 1  there are five regions central west north north east and east with 55 planning areas and 323 subzones 50  some of the subzones contain no residential population white areas which include airports and airbases eg changi airport in the east region and industrial parks or ports eg jurong island and bukom at the south of the west region and simpang north and south at the north region although these places lack residential population they are the workplaces destinations of a large number of individuals the darker color areas indicate the home for a large number of people in other words a large number of journeys starting from and ending at these locations we used the origin-destination od ridership data of bus and train to generate the public transport flow networks the od ridership data is systematically collected by the singapore land transport authority lta is a government statutory board under the ministry of transport through api calls 48  in this study we used the ridership from november 2019 to january 2020 in terms of temporal resolution the od ridership data provides hourly passenger flows between each pair of bus stops or train stations including mass rapid transit and light rail transit the raw data are then aggregated into weekdays a total of 21 days in november 2019 22 days in december 2019 and 23 days in january 2020 or weekends 9 days in both november and december 2019 and 8 days in january as the raw data records the flow between od pairs of bus stops or train stations we spatially aggregate the data into flows between subzones according to the bus stop or train station locations a total of 303 subzones out of a total of 323 contained at least one bus stop or one train station these subzones then form the nodes 303 nodes of the weighted direct network with flows between nodes corresponding to the weight of directed edges a total of 30 331 edges were found with a vast majority 30 043 edges or 99 being edges across subzones and less than 1 exactly 288 edges were within-subzone flows ie corresponding to self-loops from the network perspective given that very limited number of such intra-subzone flows they were ignored in this study  to carry out this study we introduce two indexes namely the spreader index spi and the susceptible index sui to search for the spatial super-spreaders ssp and spatial super-susceptibles sss both indexes sui and spi are quantitatively determined and calculated using two key elements 1 the local strength of human in-and outflows and 2 the diversity of their respective neighborhoods 15  the local strength of in-and outflows for a given location is the number of people coming to or leaving from the location ie respectively the weighted in-degree and weighted out-degree of the corresponding node the neighborhood diversity is captured and quantified by two types of concepts 1 the diversity of zones and 2 the diversity of coreness the diversity of zones 38 51 refers to people that are coming from different parts of the city as for the diversity of coreness 52 53  it refers to people either coming from the core or from the periphery of the country more details about what constitutes core and periphery is given in step 3 below we applied this analysis framework to the singapore public transport flow network and identified the ssp and sss using the sui and spi indexes the population flow patterns are expected to be different for weekdays and weekends thus the flow data were separated into weekday and weekend ones the calculation flow of the spatial spreader and spatial susceptible indexes is detailed in fig 2  the first part consists in aggregating the bus and train od flow data to subzones as mentioned earlier that top layer provides the main data for the calculation ie two weighted and directed networks weekday and weekend flow networks these networks are subsequently used to compute three network characteristic measurements including degree centrality step 1 community detection step 2 and k-shell decomposition step 3 which are described in full details in the following subsections the degree centrality is used as a proxy for the intensity of the local out-and inflows whereas the community detection and k-shell decomposition results enable the computation of neighborhood diversity including zone-entropy and coreness-entropy as introduced below finally in the last step step 4 the three network characteristics are used to calculate the sui and spi step 1 degree centrality the degree centrality in this study includes both the non-weighted and weighted in-and out-degrees the non-weighted and weighted versions of the degree centrality represent different concepts in terms of network characteristics the non-weighted in-degree and out-degree are the number of links or edges that are pointed to and from a subzone respectively this non-weighted degree centrality measures the number of relationships that a particular subzone has as for the weighted in-degree and out-degree they correspond to the summation of incomingoutgoing flows for a given subzone respectively this weighted version of degree centrality indicates the total strength of a node in terms of gathering flows or spreading flows without accounting for the actual number of incoming or outgoing edges in this study the weighted degree centrality is used to represent the local intensity of nodes for the calculation of the sui and spi the weighted degree centrality is scaled within the unit interval on the other hand both non-weighted and weighted degree centralities are used in the weighted k-shell decomposition analysis performed as step 3 this study uses a community detection method mapequation algorithm 51  to identify the zones from the flow network instead of using the administrative spatial boundaries ie the boundaries of planning areas and regions as defined by the singapore government in its master plan 2014 50  that were designed and selected for governance and political purposes the communities from this flow network analysis capture both the strength and direction of flows which reflect the spatial activity of people derived from their daily commutingmobility behaviors 38  as the community distribution is identified for weekday and weekend networks similarly the distribution should be differentiated between weekdays and weekends mapequation is used to identify the communities in the flow networks 51  this algorithm considers the direction and weight of edges to identify the strongly connected nodes in a directed and weighted network this particular algorithm is different from modularity-based community detection methods since mapequations calculation concept emphasizes the strength of flows in community ie higher flow intensities within a community than between communities flows cycling within communities mapequation captures the effect of direction while ensuring large amount of flows are kept within the community moreover the communities obtained with mapequation are used as the zones that contain strong human flows cycle which is quantified with the concept of zone-entropy note that to maintain the spatial continuous properties of the community we integrate a distance decay effect 54 in the flow intensity calculation see eq 1 before running mapequation where fo d is the number of people moving from the origin subzone o to the destination subzone d distanceo d is the distance between the two subzones and f o d is the actual flow intensity incorporating the distance decay effect first we run the mapequation algorithm on the two networks weekdays  weekends and identify the zone set of communities z  z 1  z 2   z max  with z j  n  n belongs to community j in which each subzone node belongs to then for each subzone the incomingoutgoing neighbors zones are retrieved from the results together with the weights of incomingoutgoing edges w j i or wi j the neighbors zone information and flow weights are used to calculate the normalized entropy h zone neigh i using eqs 2-4 the entropy is normalized using the total number of zones in the network to enable a comparison between nodes note that the zone-entropy value ranges between 0 and 1 as a consequence of this step 3 coreness-entropy the k-shell decomposition is a method to label the coreness k-shell levels of nodes in a network based on the connectivity structure 14  because the edges of the flow networks were weighted we use the weighted k-shell decomposition 52  which is an extended version that consider both the number of links degree and the weights of links while labeling coreness the coreness of a location indicates the position of the location in the range from periphery low k-shell levels to core high k-shell levels in a population flow network the core locations indicate the common origins or destinations for a large number of passengers in this study we first run the weighed k-shell decomposition using the non-weighted and weighted in-out-degree from step 1 to calculate the inout-k-shell levels for each subzone then the k-shell levels are grouped into core in-out-core or periphery inout-non-core using the median value as a cutoff finally for each node its incomingoutgoing neighbors corenon-core information is integrated with the flow weights to calculate the so-called coreness-entropy h core neigh i as defined in eqs 5-7 the entropy is normalized using the total number of coreness levels binary levels here ie c  core periphery to facilitate the comparison of the results between nodes note that the coreness-entropy value ranges between 0 and 1 after this normalization step 4 spatial spreader  susceptible indexes the spatial spreader index spi and spatial susceptible index sui are base on the general concepts of the framework proposed by fu et al 15  however the exact indices are largely modified to account for the specificities of our study specifically the spi and sui calculations are based on a geometric average of three key network metrics the spi see eq 8 is the geometric average of the local normalized weighted out-degree nwoutdegreei the zone-entropy of outgoing neighbors h zone outneigh i and the out-coreness-entropy of the outgoing neighbors h core outneigh i to understand this particular definition one may for instance consider the case for which a nodes spi is high this node has a high volume of outgoing flows high local intensity half of the flows are directed to the core area and the other half to the non-core area periphery these flows are equally divided into different zones high out-neighbors zone-entropy in other words a high spi subzone has a large number of travelers originating from there and these individuals are on their way to both core and periphery places which are located in various zones therefore with such a high spi index value the disease spreading would be facilitated within a short period of time the flow intensity and diversity measurements are all normalized in the unit interval and consequently the geometric average also varies between zero and one the spatial susceptible index sui see eq 9 is constructed in a completely similar way as the spi with the exception that we are considering all incoming components as opposed to outgoing ones in the spi eg local normalized weighted in-degree nwindegreei the zone-entropy of incoming neighbors h zone inneigh i and the in-coreness-entropy of incoming neighbors h core inneigh i again the concept associated with the sui is better understood when considering a subzone with large incoming flows half of the flows are coming from the core area and the other half from the non-core area and these flows are equally coming from different zones in other words this subzone is a destination for a large number of travelers originating from various zones and their origins of movement contain both core and periphery areas therefore a high sui subzone is 619 expected to be a place where travelers would be more vulnerable and sensitive to being infected like the spi the sui varies in the unit interval the spatial distribution of the non-weightedweighted in-degree and out-degree for weekdays are shown in fig 3 it appears that the patterns for the non-weighted and weighted in-degrees top row are similar to those of their out-degree counterparts bottom row this points to the fact that inflows and outflows are fairly balanced which is expected for daily aggregated data associated with steady human movements for the non-weighted degree measurements left column the high in-and out-degree subzones appear to be mainly concentrated at the east north east and central regions whereas the west and north have a higher number of lower degree subzones these results are correlated with the distribution of human density in singapore namely high to very high in the east north east and central regions and lower in the west and north of the island for weighted degree measurements right column the east region has higher degree subzones the number of high degree subzones drop in the central region north north east and west regions have relatively more higher degree subzones when compared with their non-weighted counterparts d  refers to the out-degree the townships are separated into four groups using the 25 50 and 75 percentile as breaks thereby giving the low mid-low mid-high and high intensities the distribution of the non-weighted measurements for weekends are essentially the same as the results for weekdays figure 4 displays the differences in weighted in-and out-degree between weekdays and weekends most subzones are in the lightest green or purple colors thereby indicating that their degree measurements are only very slightly larger than each other the differences are less than 13 times these subzones have a similar number of people using public transportation during weekdays and weekends only a few subzones are in dark colors indicating larger changes as compared to weekdays these subzones reveal a notably different usage of public transportation at these locations between weekdays and weekends the changes of usage for weekdays are twice larger than weekends dark purple or the other way round dark green figure 4  differences of weighted in-and out-degree between weekdays and weekends subzones in green indicate weekends have higher degree whereas subzones in purple indicate weekdays having higher degrees the color range from light to dark following the scale of higher degree as discussed in the materials and methods section a critical component of our network analysis is based on community detection figure 5 shows the spatial distribution of communities for both weekdays and weekends the mapequation algorithm with the provided data reveals 17 different communities for both weekday flow network and weekend flow network most communities are spatially continuous as the flow data is integrated with the inverse of the distance however some exceptions exist in both weekday and weekend communities eg weekday and weekend community 2 the spatially-continuous patterns are expected given the spatial embedding of our networks and it indicates as expected that interactions between closer subzones are effectively stronger on the other hand the few spatially-split communities appear to be the by-product of a strong flow of human movement between two spatially-distant locations with sparser spaces between them although weekday communities and weekend ones are different-some are split and others have different boundariesoverall they show some notable similarities eg weekday community 11 and weekend community 10 this observation can be attributed to two particular features of singapore 1 given the limited available land singapore has a dense and compact urban landscape with a high level of mixed-use areas be them residential industrial andor commercial 2 a non-negligible fraction of the working population is active on saturdays which creates a high flow of travelers with the same commuting patterns as during weekdays for instance in the western region weekday communities 4 and 16 are extremely similar with weekend communities 3 and 17 these particular communities are fairly large with a heavy mixed-use of residential and industrial areas where people have similar daily activities within a week the north east region ner contains three similar communities during weekdays and weekends community 2 upper part 14 and part of 11 during weekdays and the similar patterns of  2 upper part 13 and 10 during weekends the north region nr is split into multiple communities community  2 lower part 7 8 10 11 15 during weekdays and  2 lower part 7 9 10 15 during weekends the identified communities 1 2 5 6 9 12 during weekdays and communities 1 2 5 11 16 during weekends are similar and fit well with the central region cr which is the central business district of singapore the community detection results show that the boundaries of human activity can be changed between weekdays and weekends community 4 in weekends appears to be an area resulting from the merger of communities 5 17 and part of 8 during weekdays this indicates that the area has stronger human movement interactions during weekends than weekdays probably because the area is mostly residential with few shopping places providing daily needs products and necessities in summary the human movement boundaries are not fixed to a static pattern and it is usually smaller than the shape of the known regionaladministrative boundaries the spatial distribution of the core area is shown in fig 6  as detailed in the materials and methods section the calculation of coreness is separated into two parts for each network one of which uses the weighted or unweighted in-degree and the other the weighted or unweighted out-degree hence two sets of coreness results outgoing core area and incoming core area are obtained for each network some areas are identified as core in both incoming and outgoing directions red subzones in fig 6  some are core for either incoming pink subzones in fig 6  or outgoing purple subzones in fig 6  but not both however the vast majority of areas are core ones from both the incoming and outgoing flows perspective these red areas happen to have a notable overlap with residential areas with a high population density thereby indicating that places where people live would always have high incoming and outgoing flow a core area of human movement and commuting the calculation of spreader and susceptible indexes require access to the local normalized in-degree and out-degree centrality as well as the incoming and outgoing neighborhood zone-entropy eqs 2-4 and coreness-entropy eqs 5- 7 note that these three key indicators local weighted degree zone-entropy and coreness-entropy are in the unit interval ie with variations between zero and one figure 7 shows the local out-and in-degree left column the outgoing and incoming neighborhood zone-entropy central column and coreness-entropy right column of the weekday first two rows and weekend bottom two rows flow networks the spatial distribution shows notable differences between centrality zone-entropy and coreness-entropy figure 6  distribution of corenon-core areas from the weighted k-shell decomposition the coreness in a refers to weekday flow data while in b it is for weekend flow data red-colored areas are for subzones identified as both incoming and outgoing core areas purple-colored areas refer to solely outgoing core subzones and pink-colored subzones highlight solely incoming core subzones in addition high levels of local weighted out-and in-degree are mostly concentrated in the east north east and central regions as for the zone-entropy these high levels are primarily located in the north and central regions while high levels of coreness-entropy are mostly found in subzones in the north region essentially most of the subzones have high levels of one two or even three of these key indicators however only subzones with high levels of all three indicators are ssp or sss the distribution of the spreader index spi and susceptible index sui of each subzone for weekdays and weekends are shown in fig 8  all four distributions suggest a similar poisson-like type of distribution with a mean value between 0255 and 0265 solid vertical lines the fact that these mean values are very close for both indexes on weekdays and weekends is in line with our previous comment related to an expected balance between incoming and outgoing flows of human movement however for our analysis the locations of interest are those that are outliers corresponding to large spi andor sui values using the interquartile range iqr method the outliers are identified as the subzones located above the q 3  1 fig 8 as a reference level dotted vertical lines  the subzones that lay between q 3 and q 3  15  iqr are categorized as secondary-spreaders or secondary-susceptibles this analysis reveals that a non-negligible number of locations exhibit large spi andor sui values thereby contributing to our identification process of spatial super spreaders and spatial super susceptibles  the spatial distributions of super-spreaders ssp and super-susceptible sss is shown in fig 9 for weekdays and in fig 10 for weekends for weekday flow movement see fig 9  9 subzones are identified as ssp red-colored zones in fig 9 a corresponding to spi  q 3  15  iqr 11 subzones are identified as sss red-colored zones in fig 9 b corresponding to sui  q 3  15  iqr it is worth noting that 9 subzones overlap in both figures thereby corresponding to both spatial super-spreaders and super-susceptibles subzones a to i in both figures shown as red-colored subzones with a purple border this indicates that most of the subzones with the highest spi values would also have the highest sui values and vice versa in fig 9a  all identified ssp are also identified as sss in fig 9b  two subzones-j khatib and k tampines east-are identified as sss only with a lower spi q 3  spi  q 3  15  iqr the weekend distributions exhibit slightly different patterns there are 9 subzones identified as ssp on weekends with 8 of them also being identified as ssp on weekdays subzones a to h in fig 10a  none of which are less than q 3 in the previous figure similarly all weekend sss are either super-or secondary-susceptibles on weekdays and vice versa a total of 13 sss are found with the weekend human movement network  fig 10b  9 of them subzones a to i are also weekend ssp 11 of which overlap with those of the weekday sss results the other two subzones-j boulevard and k bukit batok central-are promoted from weekday secondary-susceptibles subzones pink subzones in fig 9b  this result further confirms that the spi and sui are not dramatically different between weekdays and weekends there are eight subzones a to i except h in fig 9  and a to h in fig 10 central and three at the north region sembawang central woodlands regional centre and yishun west are identified as both ssp and sss in red in both weekdays and weekends during weekdays most of the identified ssp or sss areas belong to the regional core that contained a higher density of human activity the eight ssp and sss can be separated into two types the first type consists of five subzones a c e f and i in fig 9  which contain high population density the second type consists of the other three subzones b jurong gateway d maritime square and h woodlands regional centre in fig 9  associated with a lower population density the subzones in the first type are typical residential area where the intensity of human activity are high due to the extensive need to travel out during the day time and travel back in the evening on the other hand the subzones in the second type are regional hubs of public transportation which naturally attract a large population flows public transport facilities along with numerous commercial buildings shopping centers one counter-intuitive observation can be made from fig 9 and fig 10  the cbd contains less ssp and sss as one could expect the cbd of singapore is located at the southern central part of the central region high intensity of human activity exists within the cbd area as shown in fig7  most of the subzones in the cbd have either a low weighted degree or a low neighborhood coreness-entropy the low weighted degree probably finds its origin in the smallness of the area itself which limits the catchment of incoming and outgoing flows as for the low coreness-entropy we trace it to the fact that a majority of the people are circulating within the cbd which are mainly composed by the core area fig 6  this result indicates that the cbd workplaces are less influential in terms of quickly spreading the disease to the rest of the cityisland but a contagious disease would quickly spread inside the cbd area as a consequence of its strong internal flows in summary the key influential areas are clearly identified as being the regional transport hubs which connect the residential areas with the rest of the country the concept of super-spreader was originally introduced in the field of social network analysis to identify the most influential persons or nodes within a given social network these persons could be opinion leaders trend setters public figures within a group of people 14 55  furthermore this concept of super-spreader individual has been borrowed by epidemiologists to identify and study the abnormally high spreading activity of a small group of individuals 13 56 in large populations during an epidemic outbreak while previous studies focused on the identification of super-spreaders within a social network-nodes are individuals and edges represent the existence of interactions between two persons binary edge-this study focused instead on spatial networks of population flow with nodes representing physical locations and weighteddirected edges representing flows of human movement this study sought to extend the concept of super-spreader to spatial interaction networks with the objective of identifying possible spatial super-spreader locations-a set of locations that have the most influential effects in terms of disease spreading the concept and calculation method were also reversed to uncover another group of critical locations the most vulnerable places defined as super-susceptibles our results based on large-scale data analytics show that most of the ssp are also sss this is reasonable and somehow expected given the nature of the daily population flow network specifically since we are considering daily-aggregated data the number of people who are leaving from a place can be expected to be of the same order as the number of people who are going to this place ie we are in the presence of balanced commuting flows and the larger the outgoing flow intensity the larger the incoming flow intensity based on the results the places with intense flows have higher potential to be both ssp and sss and this is captured by the directed nature of the networks and the incorporation of the weighted in-degree or out-degree in our calculations it is worth noting that our results are in good agreement with previous studies based on the k-shell decomposition method the core nodes of a social group tend to be in general the most influential ones 14 22  besides the local incoming and outgoing flow intensities this study also considers two critical neighborhood diversities of these networks the zone-entropy and coreness-entropy the diversity of neighborhood is especially important while identifying multiple super-spreaders from a network 15 28  the zone-entropy is used to measure if the outgoing flows are directed towards more zones within the city-state for instance if the outgoing flows from a given place are converging to one zone only this place can only affect one of the zones among all throughout singapore thus its influential power is clearly weak conversely if human movement originating from one place flows to many zones across the country its influential power is relatively high in addition coreness-entropy captures the diversity of flows to or from core or periphery areas if the flows are all directed towards one of the periphery or core its influential power is somehow limited to this particular type of areas conversely if human movement flows to both core and periphery areas this clearly indicates that whenever an outbreak happens at this place it could quickly affect and spread to both core and periphery areas these two diversity metrics complement one another and are combined in the calculation framework for differentiating places with high density of flows into strong and weak influential places see materials  methods this study enables us to establish a list of subzones which have a strong capability in terms of diseases spreading as well as a list of subzones which are more vulnerable in terms of being a place of high risk of contagion in summary the identified subzones are found to be mainly in the core area of residential and transportation hubs these places have high population density and activity such as transportation hubs or community hubs therefore these places should be targeted by public health agencies with higher resource allocations and disease monitoring aimed at prevention and intervention purposes for example public health agencies could consider these locations while planning to setup body temperature checkpoints or to provide personal hygiene toolkits or also setting up advertisements related to appropriate behaviors to counteract the ongoing epidemics moreover since these locations are more vulnerable and more influential they should get more attention while setting up differentiated policies such as the temporary closure of some businesses or restrictions on large-scale human activities as opposed to a blanket lockdown across the country the proposed network analysis framework rests upon the integration of the local flow intensity with neighborhood diversity measures-zone and coreness-to assess the effective spreading ability of particular locations from the theoretical perspective the proposed framework considers weighted and directed interactions between nodes places to identify super-spreaders and super-susceptibles from the practical perspective this study presents a quantitative and systematic framework to identify the key influential and vulnerable locations based on public transport flow data usually available by most transportation agencies in metropolitan areas it is worth noting that there are several limitations to this study first our analysis is limited to human flow associated with the use of public transportation which is high in places like singapore or other continental european cities but could be much lower in other urban areas with far less developed public transportation networks such as in the united states for instance in addition our data only includes ridership of buses and trains and misses out on other important means of public transportation including taxis private-for-hire automobiles cars motorcycles shuttle buses or vans and active transportation by walking bicycle skateboard scooter personal mobility devices etc some of the subzones currently do not have bus stops or train stations however as mentioned previously public transportation by bus and train in singapore is fairly high-more than 60 of daily commuting-thereby confirming the importance of the obtained results as being representative of key human movement patterns second singapore is an island country with its northern national border connected to malaysia through two land checkpoints unfortunately these cross-border flows are not included in this study many workers and students commute daily between singapore and the state of johor in malaysia there are some dedicated bus services directly connecting stations in johor bahru malaysia and various places across singapore including woodlands at the north region jurong east at the west region and bugis at the central region etc since these data were ignored the inout-flows of these places in singapore are certainly underestimated third inter-mode trip transfers and bus transfers are not captured in the dataset used to carry out our study trip transfers between mass rapid transit mrt lines are captured from the tap-in and tap-out records ie passengers changing lines at some interchanges but the od data for buses only records the direct flow between bus stops ie the records present only the tap-in and tap-out bus information the records of the exchange of bus services are not showncaptured in the data on the other hand the data about changing from bus to train and vice versa is also unfortunately not available therefore we can only capture direct bus services and this naturally limits the movement of travelers to the existing direct bustrain services fourth the short-time scale dynamics throughout a day is ignored indeed we considered daily-aggregated data however a higher temporal resolution could be considered say on an hourly basis which could reveal different patterns of ssp and sss the temporal evolution of the sui and spi indexes would be the topic of a future study in summary we have developed for the first time a framework allowing the identification of spatial super-spreader and super-susceptible locations we believe that our results and analysis could be extended in two key directions first our analysis would benefit from being complemented by working with epidemiologists specialized in simulations of disease spreading through human contact networks this would integrate our results with differential spreading across more or less vulnerable places specifically the dynamic patterns of disease propagation could be observed from the simulation models and thus the effects of the ssp and sss could be quantified in terms of its actual contamination rate in the population second the geography demography and social-economic of the spatial super-spreaders and super-susceptibles could be accounted for and included in our analysis using some statistical models to identify the potential social and physical environmental factors that made these locations super-receivers and super-susceptibles in conclusion it is well known that dealing with the reopening of economies and cities after a blanket lockdown requires a finely calibrated approach from governments although here we used the singapore public transport flow data to build these networks as a case study similar analyses can readily be carried out using the exact same process in order to uncover the ssp and sss in any large urban center our data-driven methodology analysis and results offer an effective way of devising targeted and localized preventive measures when lifting stay-at-home orders such targeted measures for vulnerable locations are also critical in order to optimize government resources in the face of economic decline the datasets-generated from the singapore lta database 48 -used for this study are available from the following spa-tialspreadersusceptibledata repository httpsgithubcomwcchinspatialspreadersusceptible data  accounting for super-spreading gives the basic reproduction number r 0 of covid-19 that is higher than initially estimated marek kochaczyk frederic grabowski tomasz lipniacki  transmission of infectious diseases is characterized by the basic reproduction number r 0  a metric used to assess the threat posed by an outbreak and inform proportionate preventive decision-making based on individual case reports from the initial stage of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic r 0 is often estimated to range between 2 and 4 in this report we show that a seir model that properly accounts for the distribution of the incubation period suggests that r 0 lie in the range 44-117 this estimate is based on the doubling time observed in the near-exponential phases of the epidemic spread in china united states and six european countries to support our empirical estimation we analyze stochastic trajectories of the seir model showing that in the presence of super-spreaders the calculations based on individual cases reported during the initial phase of the outbreak systematically overestimate the doubling time and thus underestimate the actual value of r 0   the basic reproduction number r 0 is a critical parameter characterizing the dynamics of the outbreak of an infectious disease r 0 quantifies the expected number of secondary cases generated by an infectious individual in an entirely susceptible population although it is pertinent to the situation before imposition of protective measures r 0 is influenced by natural conditions such as seasonality as well as socioeconomic factors such as population density or ingrained societal norms and practices delamater et al 2019  importantly r 0 suggests the extent of control measures that have to be implemented to stop the spread of the epidemic a preliminary estimate published by the world health organization who suggested that r 0 of coronavirus disease 2019 lies in between 14 and 25 who 2020a  later this estimate has been revised to 2-25 who 2020b which is in agreement with numerous other studies that based on official data from china implied the range of 2-3 see eg liu et al 2020 or boldog et al 2020 for a summary this range suggests an outbreak of a contagious disease that should be containable by imposition of relatively mild restrictions on social interactions as initially implemented in european countries such as italy or spain of note there were early reports of r 0 higher than 4 by cao et al 2020 and shen et al 2020  in which however relatively long infectious periods were assumed here we estimated r 0 of covid-19 based on the doubling time observed in the nearly exponential phase of the increase of confirmed cases in china united states and six european countries by considering the early phase in which the number of registered cases begins to exceed 100 we aimed at accounting for super-spreading events that are implausible when the number of infected individuals is very low to provide additional motivation for this approach we show that in the presence of superspreaders the median trajectory starting from a single infection grows much slower than the average trajectory which very likely leads to overestimation of the doubling time we used a susceptibleexposed-infected-removed seir model with six subsequent exposed states to reproduce the shape of the reported distribution of the incubation period this allowed us to determine a plausible range of r 0 at 44-117 considerably higher than most initial estimates we used a seir model with six exposed states which is equivalent to the assumption that the incubation period is erlang-distributed with the shape parameter 6 we assumed that the average incubation period 1 ranges between 528 days mean value determined by lauer et al 2020  used by us as a lower bound and 647 days mean value determined by backer et al 2020  used by us as an upper bound the infectious period is either exponentially or erlang-distributed with the shape parameter 2 as in kucharski et al 2020  resulting in model variants with respectively a single or two subsequent infectious states the average infectious period 1 is assumed to be 3 days as in and kucharski et al 2020  see methods for more details on the model we estimated t d within two-and three-week periods starting on the day in which

united states values of t d estimated based on three-week periods are higher than based on the two-week periods which is likely a consequence of protective measures such as social distancing and isolation of positively tested individuals three-week t d values range from 234 united states to 325 china while two-week t d values lie in between 216 spain and 288  united kingdom we estimated the range of r 0 as a function of the doubling time t d using a formula provided in methods the lower bound has been obtained using the model variant with 1  528 days and two infectious states whereas the

arrived at the estimated r 0 range of 44-117 the two-week doubling time for china 239 is remarkably consistent with the value of 24 reported by sanche et al 2020  who estimated that r 0 for china lies in the range 47 to 66 which is contained in our estimated range for china 44-96 the models having one or two exposed states often used to estimate the value of r 0  substantially underestimated r 0

model-based calculations we appropriately accounted for the distribution of the incubation period and 2 we estimated t d based on the nearly exponential growth phases of the outbreak which gives t d shorter than estimates based on initial individual propagation events the discrepancy in t d estimation may be potentially attributed to the fact that not all removed individuals are registered in the case when the ratio of registered to removed individuals is increasing over time the true increase of the removed cases may be overestimated we do not rule out this possibility although we consider it implausible as the expansion of testing capacity in considered countries has been slower than the progression of the outbreak we rather attribute the  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

2020 discrepancy to the fact that in the very early phase in which the doubling time growth rate is estimated based on individual case reports the effect of super-spreading events such as football matches carnival fests demonstrations masses or hospital-acquired infections is negligible due to a low probability of such events when the number of infected individuals is low sanche et al 2020 inferred that the pre-exponential period in wuhan has been dominated by simple transmission chains in turn super-spreading events were very likely the main drivers of the epidemic spread in eg italy and germany where in the early exponential phase spatial heterogeneity of registered cases has been evident cereda et al 2020 mercker et al 2020  we analyzed the impact of super-spreading on estimation of t d based on stochastic simulations of seir model dynamics simulations were performed in the perfectly mixed regime according to the gillespie algorithm we assumed that a predefined fixed proportion of individuals has higher infectiousness and as such is responsible for on average either half of infections super-spreaders or two-third of infections hyper-spreaders to reproduce these fractions in systems with different assigned proportions of super-or hyper-spreaders their infectiousness is assumed to be inversely proportional to their ratio in the simulated population we estimated t d in two ways based on one month of growth of the number of new cases since the first registered case 30 days since the 1 s t case and based on growth of new cases in the two-week period after the number of registered cases exceeds 100 14 days since 100 cases as we are interested in the initial phase characterized by exponential growth we assumed that the susceptible population

cases method or the 30 days since the 1 s t case method one may observe that the histograms calculated using the 30 days since the 1 s t case method are broader than those calculated using the 14 days since 100 cases method and the width of all histograms increases with increasing infectiousness which is set inversely proportional to  when t d is calculated using the 14 days since 100 cases method its median value is slightly larger than t d in the deterministic model equal 2 days however when t d is calculated using the 30 days since the 1 s t case method then for high infectiousness of super-and hyper-spreaders correspondingly for low  its median value becomes much larger than the deterministic t d  in the case of the lowest considered   1 when super-spreaders hyper-spreaders have their infectiousness about 100 times 200 times higher than the infectiousness of normal individuals  one obtains median t d that is overestimated by 28 67 both methods statistically overestimate t d but when using the 30 days since the 1 s t case method overestimation is very significant the effect is caused by low probability of appearance of super-or ultra-spreaders in the first weeks of the outbreak we notice that t d estimation for a given country based on available data is equivalent to the analysis of a single stochastic trajectory based on epidemic data from china united states and six european countries we have estimated that the basic reproduction number r 0 lies in the range 46-116 44-96 for china which is higher than most previous estimates boldog et al 2020 liu et al 2020  there are two sources of the discrepancy in r 0 estimation first in agreement with data on the incubation period distribution we used a model with six exposed states which substantially increases r 0 t d  with respect to the models with one or two exposed states second we estimated t d based on the two-and three-week period exponential growth phase beginning on the day in which the number of registered cases exceeds 100 this approach in contrast to estimation of r 0 based on individual case reports allows to implicitly take into account super-spreading events that substantially shorten t d  spatial heterogeneity of the epidemic spread observed in many european countries including italy spain and germany can be associated with larger or smaller super-spreading events that initiated outbreaks is particular regions of these countries our estimates are consistent with current epidemic data in italy spain and france as of april 25 2020 these countries managed to terminate the exponential growth phase by means of country-wide quarantine current covid-19 community mobility reports google 2020 show about 80 reduction of mobility in retail and recreation transit stations and workplaces in these countries together with increased social distancing this reduction possibly lowered the infection rate  at least fivefold additionally massive testing reduced the infectious period 1 consequently we expect that the reproduction number r   was reduced more than fivefold which brought it to the values somewhat smaller than 1 this suggests that r 0 in these countries could have been larger than 5    log 2 log 2  1 1  log 2  1 in accordance with wallinga  lipsitch 2007 and wearing et al 2005   characterizing super-spreading in microblog an epidemic-based information propagation model yu liu bai wang bin wu suiming shang yunlei zhang chuan shi   weibo1
 launched by sina in august 2009 is a twitter-like microblogging service on this online social network osn users can obtain breaking news and other trending information dig their interests and activities share personal opinions and argue with other users update statues and establish relationships etc during the following years since the foundation of weibo there has been an explosive growth of microblog users and the contents tweets and retweets generated by users on this microblog platform tweets are posted and retweeted by weibo users forming cascades  1 in the way that one microblogger posts a tweet and others repost it information spreads in a considerable extent on online social networks despite a significant amount of work on models explanations and patterns of information propagation on online social media the dynamic underlying super-spreading events on osns remains uncertain towards developing a better understanding of super-spreading on osn in this paper we aim to build a mathematical model to discover how to describe and characterize super-spreading of information propagation on osns according to studies on information propagation on online social networks  2 3 4 firsthand news reports bizarre anecdotes as well as rumors awaiting clearance mostly disseminate like super-spreading epidemic events in the circumstance of followerfollowee relationship between microblog users one user transmits a message to his followers simply by reposting this message and then the information is distributed instantaneously point-to-surface after the awareness of some non-ordinary stories various behaviors of participants on osns lead to many kinds of information diffusion patterns a small group of users remain silent and just being onlookers the majority will pass the news on in the same way that they are influenced by each other and this behavior is mocked recognized as herd behavior  5 meanwhile only a very few individuals will transmit the news and influence a very vast coverage of crowds of users than normal users would do and this minority should be referred to as super-spreaders and this kind of information propagation should be viewed as a super-spreading event in most cases super-spreaders are generally opinion leaders or those who have quantities of followers on microblog platforms though sometimes not vice versa the diffusion of information on osns bears some similarity to an infectious disease spread  6 7 although the probability that one individual user would retweet a piece of message relates to his interests and intention crowds of users would not resist telling others about uncommon stories from a macroscopic perspective this pattern corresponds to an individuals infection caused by a contagion who contacted by an infectious person will get infected even though some are immune to such a contagion the emerging super-spreaders and the consequent super-spreading phenomenon in a social media scheme are also both analogous to the respective connotations in the field of epidemiology in epidemiology the term super-spreader  8 9 refers to a host that infects disproportionally more secondary contacts than others who have also been infected with the same virus or bacteria correspondingly in information propagation a super-spreading story will spread in a notably large range on osns through a minor portion of users cases in disease spreading mostly conform the 2080 rule  9 where approximately 20 of infected individuals are responsible for 80 of disease transmissions comparably situations in information diffusion commonly comply the rule of 1  10 in internet culture in which 1 of users contribute to the distribution mostly while the other 99 spread little online social network especially microblog is a hot research focus model analysis and prediction of information propagation on microblog occupies an important part till now there have been some studies on information propagation based on epidemic models yang et al  11 modeled information diffusion in implicit networks through a simple linear model which can be utilized to quantify and predict the influence of users and inspired us but their model does not fit quantitative analysis of characterizing super-spreading phenomena lerman et al  6 are the first to characterize the spread of news on osns by using epidemic models then abdullah et al  7 formulated a clear epidemic-based model for news spreading on twitter following whom there have been several studies based on epidemic models the simple but operational and adoptable epidemic method of modeling is exploited to track trending topics rumors and generic information on osns these information propagation models are modified based on conventional epidemic models such as the sir model the seir model etc based on the sir model li et al  12 considered various kinds of user behaviors on weibo and divide users into four groups with different transition rates between groups meng et al  13 added a new compartment into the conventional sir model in order to catch the phenomenon of rumor spreading in real life xia et al  14 introduced a new class representing authorities that can diffuse authoritative information to prevent rumors from spreading zhao et al  15 16 modified the sir model to integrate forgetting and remembering mechanisms with variable forgetting rate to catch rumor dissemination characteristics zhou et al  4 studied the characteristics of information bomb by leveraging a modified sir model which include influence breadth and strength of dynamic of information diffusion work by xu et al  17 and zhao et al  18 took into account complex network features to model information dissemination in mobile social networks and rumor spreading in the new media age respectively zhang et al  19 introduced a latent group of users who would be infected by an infectious individual become latent and later then infectious although none of them addressed the super-spreading phenomena that benefits the information diffusion cascades on osns previous work has shed light on the modeling of super-spreading in the field of disease spreading analysis super-spreading events have been of great interest among researchers since the global outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003  20 moreover many infectious diseases were reported as super-spreading events  21 ie observed infections unveiled evident heterogeneities in pathogen transmission with some individuals exhibiting a higher ability to infect others an epidemic compartmental model sipr was proposed to model the super-spreading events during sars  22 by splitting the infected people into two classes with different removal rates a normal class i for normal infectious individuals and a new class p that stands for super-spreaders the sipr model can capture the effect of super-spreaders during the sars outbreaks in hong kong but due to its focus on particular infectious disease spread this epidemic model cannot be easily modified to model information propagation after all we will build a new model based on the conventional sir model to accomplish this task in this study through the empirical statistical results of weibo posts data and a primitive investigation of the ingredients of users participated in diffusions of information on weibo we figure out a special class of active spreaders who are referred to as super-spreaders intuitively this special class thus is added into the well-known deterministic epidemic model the sir model aiming to capture and characterize the effect of super-spreaders and consequential super-spreading events that emerged on weibo the adopted deterministic model is simple enough to be operationally beneficial which can be represented by a sequence of mean-field equations by leveraging this modified model primitive trial experiments on the effectiveness of characterizing super-spreading phenomenon on real-world weibo dataset are conducted the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows in section  2 we introduce the weibo dataset and show the empirical statistics of the data which leads us to the new model we briefly review some conventional epidemic models in section  3 then present the detailed depiction of our proposed sair model based on the popular sir model and make some analyses in section  4 we validate the proposed model through a case study in addition a series of numerical simulations are carried out and the results are discussed in this section we conclude our work in section  5 and provide some directions for future study in order to discover the patterns of super-spreading of information diffusion three main criteria are considered when selecting dataset scale the chosen dataset needs to be large enough to be statistically significantcompleteness all retweeting actions should be observed and recordedeffectiveness every retweet can be tracked through a path originated from source tweet so that each retweeter can be tracked too
 to comply the scale and the completeness criteria we use a 47 million weibo posts 6190 tweets and their retweets dataset through the year of 2012 provided in ref  23 all 6190 tweets were posted by 4999 users including 2111 ordinary users and 2888 verified users the retweeted counts of each tweet range from 100 to nearly 400000 a verified user means that the users status is administratively verified by weibo ie their self-reported identifications are true for every post either tweet or retweet in this dataset information includes unique id posting time posting content poster id poster verified status etc for the effectiveness criterion we will see if we can infer the diffusion network of each tweet from the data it is worth noting that the components and text content of a retweet on weibo differs from that on twitter unlike twitter a retweeter can add some opinions when he reposts the retweet on weibo and he will usually keep any text content that already added by previous retweeters trails implying the message propagation path from previous retweeters will be generated automatically by weibo system whenever a post is retweeted in the form of userc repost  userb contentaddedbyuserb  usera contentaddedbyusera through this structural form we know that a tweet posted by an initial user has been reposted by usera then userb reposts the retweet of usera and finally userc is the last one to retweet in this way we can state that the initial user influenced usera usera influenced userb and finally userb influenced userc thus the networks of information diffusion can be extracted from the dataset via all trails like this in a diffusion network nodes are users who repost except the author of the initial tweet and every directed edge indicates which user reposts whose retweet 
fig 1
a demonstrates an example of the diffusion network of a tweet information propagation this tweet2
leads to 1003 retweets influencing 945 users from this figure it clearly demonstrates that most of the nodes have no child or at most only one child except the initial node the author of the initial tweet however several nodes emit more edges than the others and we call them super-spreaders as for the initial node the author user of the original tweet he influences a vast range of users obviouslyfig 1an example of diffusion network of a tweet information for interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend the reader is referred to the web version of this article 
fig 1b shows the distribution of out-degrees of nodes the initial user excluded in the example diffusion network shown in fig 1a in the diffusion network nodes are users who repost the tweet and these nodes have different out-degrees ie the number of users influenced by each user is varied according to records of this tweet there are 42 nodes users each of which emits greater than or equal to 5 edges totally influenced 253 nodes and 18 nodes every of which emits more than 10 edges influenced 168 nodes in this diffusion network the observed data points of this tweet approximate a power-law distribution as shown in fig 1b for the entire dataset the distribution of user influenced counts is depicted in fig 2
 in which the distribution shows a long-tail shape that is common in real-world social networks this distribution suggests that the majority of users influence relatively small portion of other users and relatively large amounts of users are influenced by a minority of users in more detailed investigations we find that the majority of highly retweeted posts share the same trait as demonstrated in the example the empirical statistical result of all posts in the dataset is shown in table 1
 here we define influence range differently from the corresponding definition in influence maximization problem in the result the influence range means the out-degree of one node in the diffusion network symbols used in the result table are defined as follows cinflthe number of users one user influenced excluding the initial author in a diffusion network cinfl means the out-degree of a node user category cinfln means each of the users has influenced n other userscinflavethe average number of users influenced by a particular category of usersruthe percentage ratio of users in a particular categoryrinflthe percentage ratio of users excluding those influenced by any original author users influenced by a particular category of users in a diffusion of tweet information
 according to this empirical statistical result it is obvious that most users are not so influential and in the meantime a very few individuals influence a vast range of users through diffusions of 6190 tweets with their retweets in the dataset we observe that 9262  623 of users in the dataset are pure receivers ie they have influenced no one the ratio of users who have influenced only one follower nodes with out-degree equals to 1 cinfl1 is respectable ru431 and the ratio of their influenced followers approaches approximately 25 rinfl3614 the users who have induced at least 5 other users to post a retweet is quite a few the ratio of which is under 1 ru041 however these users induce more others to post a retweet and the influenced users counts 4444 the average number of users influenced by them is greater than 73 to look deeper into the entire data we demonstrate the statistical result of user distribution with different cinfls influence range in fig 3
 the scatter plots af approximately imply the ratio of users of each cinfl ie ru depicted by the slope of the thin red line in each sub-figure through a different means that a linear fit is performed on each category yielding a slightly different value from ru meanwhile the corresponding distributions of users in each category are illustrated in sub-figures gl respectivelyfig 3for each cinfl diagrams af shows the scatter plots of number of users who influencedcinflusers versus the number of users involved in each diffusion k is the slope of the thin red line in each sub-figure diagrams gl are distributions of ru ratio of users of corresponding cinfl respectively showing 95 observed data points for interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend the reader is referred to the web version of this article furthermore fig 4
illustrates the influence range of users with distinct cinfl in every sub-figure each point represents a diffusion it is especially evident that users of cinfl0 have always influenced no one as shown in fig 4a other than this case there always exists situations where the information propagation is achieved by only one type of users as denoted by the points with value 1 in y-axis in other sub-figures as cinfl grows from 1 to 4 the influence ranges of corresponding user categories become less conversely the influence ranges are much broader when cinfl exceeds 5 as depicted in fig 4ffig 4for each cinfl diagrams af demonstrate the scatter plots of the influence range of users who have influencedcinflusers versus the fraction of users in each diffusion in studies of diseases super-spreaders have been characterized as infected individuals who excrete a higher than normal number of pathogens during the time they are infectious this causes their contacts to be exposed to higher viralbacterial loads than would be seen in the contacts of non-super-spreaders within the same duration of exposure  24 as a result of aforementioned observations in this weibo dataset it is found that in information diffusion there also exists super-spreading event and super-spreaders users with cinfl5 to discover the role behavior of super-spreaders the traditional epidemic-based models may be modified to address the super-spreading phenomena in this weibo dataset it is observed that if a tweet is posted by a verified user it usually has a high retweet count which is consistent with the conclusion of a detailed analysis on weibo user behavior  25 while if a tweet is posted by a casual user but has been retweeted by some verified users it still has a high retweet count hence we assume super-spreaders in information propagation are these verified users intuitively and modify the traditional sir model correspondingly in the following section the traditional epidemic models are briefly reviewed and the new model is proposed modeling an infectious disease spread is a methodology that has been used to study the propagation mechanisms and dynamics of such a disease also one can use this model to predict the future track of a probable outbreak or to propose and evaluate any feasible strategies to control an epidemic preventing it from developing an outbreak or even a pandemic daniel bernoulli carried out the first trial of mathematical modeling of disease spread in 1766  26 due to the limitation of essential understanding of germ theory it was not until the research of ronald ross into the spread of malaria  27 that modern theoretical epidemiology began based on the work of ross kermack and mckendrick developed a simple deterministic compartmental model the sir model in 1927  28 by which behaviors of outbreaks of many recorded epidemics were successfully characterized the si sis and sir models are three classical deterministic compartmental models  29 28 in these conventional models the whole population is divided into several compartments 
susceptible stands for the crowd who are not infectious but susceptible to an infectious disease
infectious represents the crowd who are infected by a certain disease and are infectious and
recovered or removed means individuals who are recovered or die from a disease an individual in the s compartment may become infectious with a specified probability when contacted by an individual from the i compartment an infectious individual may be cured and then return into the s compartment with a certain probability in the sis model or heshe has a probability of being cured and gaining the immunity to the disease otherwise dies from the disease then transits into the r compartment in the sir model as introduced in section  1 the information propagation dynamic of a tweet message is analogous to a contagious disease spread an initiator posts an original tweet numerous users followers of this initiator andor followers of followers who are interested in this piece of information will be influenced infected to post a retweet these influenced users will be infectious in turn to influence other users to spread this message contagion to others after a period of time they are disinterested in this message and halt being infectious recovered from such a disease thus in line with the characteristics of each compartment social network users involved in an information propagation process can be recognized as either susceptible users spreaders or recovered users in the circumstance of information propagation on online social networks a recent study  30 considered the diffusions on complex networks in which information carriers have varied topological features eg node degree a number of sir-based information propagation models  31 18 that take node degree into account make the spreading process more realistic and apparent according to the transition pattern detailed in section  31 the compartment transition of the sir model is demonstrated in fig 5
 and the sir model of information propagation on complex network can be represented by mean-field equations as follows 1dstdtkstitnt2ditdtkstitntit3drtdtit4ntstitrtk where st it and rt represent the numbers of susceptible users spreaders and recovered users at time t respectively moreover all initial values are nonnegative and the number of total population nt is a constant all parameters are nonnegative and the meanings of them are as follows kdenotes the average out-degree of nodes in the i compartment ie the number of followers or latent susceptible users who read the post of an infectious user and then they will get a chance to post a retweetis the infection rate per-user per time andis the removal recovered rate
 phenomena of super-spreading exist in both epidemic spreads and information diffusions however super-spreaders act similarly but with a little bit variation under the two circumstances a super-spreader  8 9 once a susceptible one but infected by an infectious user will infect more secondary contacts from the susceptible class than other infectious individuals on the contrary the majority of individuals infect relatively fewer secondary contacts during epidemic spreading similarly a super-spreader on osns would influence more users than others causing users to be influential to influence others correspondingly most users are less influential one simple heuristic is to develop a new population class portraying the dissimilar behavior of super-spreaders despite of the similarity the characteristic of super-spreader differs a little in these two different scenarios in a real epidemic a super-spreader will continue being severely infectious before he is quarantined or gets cured as described in the sipr model  22 on osns however a super-spreader may halt being highly influential due to the talking topic being aging ie topic not being a recency or this super-spreader being tired of mentioning such a story and then he turns into a normal infectious user who still have chance to influence others with a common infection rate as previously introduced the sir model is used to model tweet messages diffusion dynamic and depicts the information propagation well which is the basis we progress on furthermore with the effect of super-spreaders it is essential to add a new compartment active spreaders to address the functionality of super-spreaders for the different behaviors between super-spreaders and ordinary users aforementioned facts observed from real-world weibo data in section  2 in addition the establishment of the new compartment diversifies the corresponding transition rates between classes the mechanisms of information propagation in microblog considering super-spreading can be modeled as shown in fig 6
 under the real-world weibo scenario all users involved in an information propagation process the whole population are divided into four classes susceptible users s super-spreaders a normal spreaders i and recovered users r the information propagation rules can be summarized as follows 1an initiator posts the original tweet that starts the process of information propagation if the initiator is a verified user then heshe belongs to the a compartment otherwise the i compartment the initiator is infectious and has the ability to influence other users in the s compartment to retweet the message2the followers of users in either the a compartment or the i compartment belong to the s compartment and they are susceptible to be infected to repost after they have read the original tweet or its retweet3if a susceptible user is a verified user heshe will become a super-spreader with probability  namely super-spreader emerging rate when the user has read the message4if a susceptible user is a normal user heshe will become a normal spreader with probability 1 after the user reads the message posted by a super-spreader or with probability 2 when the user gets the information from a normal spreader 1 and 2 are the infection rates of a super-spreader and a normal spreader respectively5after a specific period of time 1 a super-spreader will become less infectious due to topic not being a recency ie become a member of the i compartment  is the retrograde rate6after a specific period of time 1 a normal spreader will lose interest in the message and get recovered  is the recovery rate
 let n be the total population of users on the diffusion network of a tweet message and we assume that the total population retains unchangeable s represents the number of users that are susceptible to a tweet and will be infected by the tweet initiator or other retweeters ie they are followers of users of compartments a and i a refers to the number of active spreaders namely super-spreaders who are highly infectious and i refers to the number of normal infectious users namely normal spreaders r represents the number of recovered users who are not interested in a certain piece of information any more based on the above depiction of the dynamics the sair model can be described by the following mean-field equations 5dstdtk1atstk2itstnt1k1atstnt2k2itstnt6datdtk1atstk2itstntat7ditdt1k1atstnt2k2itstntatit8drtdtit9ntstatitrtk where st at it and rt represent the number of susceptible users super-spreaders normal spreaders and recovered users at time t respectively similar to the sir model their initial values are essentially nonnegative to model a diffusion event the number of total population nt is a constant k1 and k2 are average out-degrees of nodes of users in the a compartment and the i compartment respectively ie the numbers of followers or latent susceptible users who read the post of a super-spreader and a normal spreader respectively according to the modeling of super-spreaders parameters  1 and  are introduced into the sair model if we set these three parameters to zero the sair model will degenerate into the sir model with the consideration of information diffusion on complex network which is described in eqs 1 2 3 furthermore we leverage complex network features to distinguish only two groups of users to infer their distinct characteristics through k1 and k2 rather than fine-grained classes used in modeling dynamic in complex socio-technical systems  32 it appears that a super-spreader has numerous followers and thus can influence a large quantity of users in most cases followers of a super-spreader or an influential user are more willing to transmit a message posted by this influential user than those of an ordinary user will do as stated above verified users usually act as super-spreaders on sina weibo therefore we consider verified users super-spreaders in the model validations and simulations section since the total population nt is a constant dividing eqs 5 6 7 8 by this constant nt yields 10dsdtk1ask2is1k1as2k2is11dadtk1ask2isa12didt1k1as2k2isai13drdti with statitrt1 where st at it and rt are the fractions of corresponding compartments from now on we use the corresponding fraction of each compartment from eqs 11 12 we see that limt0at0 and limt0it0 since the total population has a fixed number r increases proportionally to i let eqs 10 11 12 13 be 0 solutions of equilibrium will be obtained thus it follows that the equilibria are saire1000 that is a non-diffusible equilibrium disease-free equilibrium in epidemiology we will not put analysis on and sairese00re for any se0 re0 with sere1 after a super-spreading event one equilibrium shows that a certain number of individuals remain susceptible se0 which greatly depends on initial conditions and adjustments of parameters  33 although this scenario does exist in the modeling of a disease spread the number of susceptible individuals in a real event is difficult to be precisely quantified furthermore let us consider a tweet message diffusion on osns the entire population involved in a super-spreading event is a very large quantity of users but relatively very few users remain unaware of that information after a vast extent of diffusion remaining users in the s compartment therefore the fraction of this class can approximately be 0 furthermore analyzing zero solution is sufficient since problems having non-zero solutions can be converted to a modified problem where zero solution is used to analyze the corresponding stability problem  34 herein we assume the equilibrium after a super-spreading event is saire0001 notice that rt in the differential equation 13 is uncoupled from the other three equations with the equilibrium and the first three equations above we can compute the jacobian matrix with equilibrium saire0001 14jsai000k1ak2i1k1abeta2k2ik1s1k1sk2s2k2sk1ak2ik1sk2s1k1a2k2i1k1s2k2s000000000 it follows that the characteristic equation is 150 and the eigenvalues are 10 2 and 3 eigenvalues 2 and 3 are negative real numbers and eigenvalue 1 is 0 which has algebraic multiplicity 1 and corresponding geometric multiplicity 1 thus the criterion for a stable linear system are satisfied  35 and the proposed sair model is neutrally stable when it reach the equilibrium after a super-spreading event occurred ie saire0001 as a case study we select a tweet and all its retweets from the dataset described in section  2 to validate the proposed sair model this tweet3
influenced a huge amount of users and 53220 retweets were produced the empirical cumulative distribution function of involved retweeter numbers is shown in fig 7
a as you can see in the figure the information diffusion progress mainly took place in the first 24 h see fig 7b for the retweeter numbers in the first 24 h which caused 48174 distinct users to participate in and generate 49637 retweets after the extensive propagating period the rest diffusion of 3583 retweets was contributed by another 3500 users in the remaining hours accounting only for less than 7 of the entire distribution of all retweets thus the model validation is based on the data of the first 24 hfig 7the temporal distribution of influenced retweeter number given the posting time of each retweet following this tweet we can obtain the number of retweeters in every 60 min here we set the time interval to 60 min for simplicity in the first 24 h the count of normal users who have retweeted corresponds to the number of normal infectious spreaders in the i compartment of the sair model and the count of verified users corresponds to the number of super-spreaders in the a compartment to establish the connection between the real-world scenario and the mathematic model introduced in section  33 we roughly recognize normal retweeters as elements of the i compartment verified users as components of the a compartment assuming that verified users act as super-spreaders in order to find out the most suitable parameters in the sair model to characterize the real-world information propagation of this tweet and compare the performance of it with the conventional sir model reviewed in section  32 an objective function is proposed as follows 16jxxf2 where f denotes the frobenius norm and x is the fitted result of observed data x for the sair and sir models the respective objective functions are materialized as follows 17jsairt1nitit2t1natat218jsirt1nitit2 where it and at are fitted values of it and at observed values at time t respectively n is the number of observations ie the number of time epochs the best fitted parameters can be obtained by minimizing the objective functions presented in eqs 17 18 in order to determine the best fitted parameters in the sair model and the conventional sir model we perform pattern search a multi-parameter nonlinear optimizingfitting technique to minimize the optimization functions in matlab with the time-divided data and the parameterized models required by the optimization tool the constraints of parameters are given in table 2
 parameters of degrees k1 k2 and k are referenced from a weibo study  36 the ranges of super-spreader emerging rate  and various infection rates 1 2 and  conform to the picking principle in epidemiology however the super-spreader retrograde rate  and the recovery rate  can be greater than 1 since the time interval is much smaller in information diffusions than that in epidemics the metric root-mean-square error rmse4
is used to evaluate the performance of the fitted results by both models since only sair models the a compartment which sir does not rmse is measured between the fitted values and the observed data points of the i compartment that both models can estimate thus the metric rmse is defined as follows 19rmse1nt1nitit2 as indicated by the definition a smaller rmse implies a better fitting result the fitted results of both the proposed sair model and the conventional sir model are demonstrated in fig 8 fig 9
 respectively for the sair model the lowest error rmsesair7446416 can be reached with parameter set k14737 k2499 00029 101817 200109 25609 11311 while for the sir model the lowest error rmsesir7925963 is obtained with parameter set k802 00470 12180 by comparing the fitted results one can easily conclude that the new proposed model that considers the effect of super-spreaders is much better than the conventional one on characterizing information propagation process with super-spreading phenomenon in microblog for the observed data points it is observed in the figure that the peak of the a compartment and the peak of the i compartment come at the same time at time4 however for the fitted result the peaks of the i compartment and the a compartment come at time5 and time4 respectively which implies that super-spreaders in the a compartment lead the trend of information diffusion 
 is the emerging rate of super-spreaders this rate controls the amount and the speed how super-spreaders involves in the information propagation as experimented the percentage of each class in the sair model will not change dramatically during information propagation process if 004 ie the curve of each compartment follows a similar pattern moreover it is evidently true that scenarios under 01 can hardly be seen in the real world for the reason that super-spreaders are always a minority thus we set the range of  from 0001 to 004 with step size 0001 
fig 11
illustrates the sensitivity analysis of the super-spreader emerging rate  ssusceptible users as we can see in fig 11a with a greater super-spreader emerging rate the percentage of compartment s drops much faster than that with a smaller one this result shows that much more super-spreaders appear so that they will induce susceptible users to transit into either super-spreaders or normal infected individualsasuper-spreaders for the a compartment apparently seen from fig 11b a larger super-spreader emerging rate will lead to a sharper rise and a higher peak of the a compartment which is in agreement with reality also a larger  leads to early peaking in compartment ainormal spreaders as for the i compartment if this rate gets bigger the peak of the a compartment will get higher which leads the peak of the i compartment to come much earlier and higher as shown in fig 11c furthermore one should keep in mind that users of the a compartment will transit into the i compartment eventuallyrrecovered users fig 11d shows the simulation result of compartment r with varied  demonstrating that the super-spreader emerging rate does not affect the fading process in information propagation
fig 11sensitivity analysis of  the super-spreader emerging rate  ranges from 0001 to 004 step size 0001 other parameters have the same values as described in fig 10 it is worth noting that for a very small  a large quantity of residual users exist in the s compartment the scenario of small  together with large  and  combinatorially leads to this particular phenomenon unlike the super-spreader emerging rate  controlling the accumulating amount and speed of super-spreaders the super-spreader infection rate dominates the spread of information fig 12
shows the percentage change of each compartment with varied 1 the range of 1 is from 001 to 04 with step size 001fig 12sensitivity analysis of 1 the infection rate by a super-spreader 1 ranges from 001 to 04 step size 001 other parameters have the same values as described in fig 10 on weibo a much larger infection rate of 1 leads to much faster diffusion of tweets among users thus the number of susceptible users of compartment s decreases a bit fasterslower with a largersmaller 1 while users in the i compartment get recovered much fasterslower to compartment r as shown in fig 12a and d respectively it differs from the monotonous trends of compartments s and r that varied 1 causes diverse changes in compartments a and i asuper-spreaders as shown in fig 12b and c the rate of 1 indirectly affects the growing and descending process of the a compartment by the i compartment the fraction of compartment a is much small and this is the evidence in support that the super-spreaders are a minority group but very contagious ie have a higher chance of being succeeded in influencing users than any other ordinary users if the super-spreader infection rate gets larger the peak of the a compartment will get higher and come much earlierinormal spreaders for the i compartment in fig 12c the rate of 1 directly control the growing process of the i compartment if 1 gets larger the peak of compartment i has the same pattern as that of the a compartment which means that the bigger 1 is the stronger the influence of super-spreaders are and the higher chance of being influenced the susceptible users have therefore the wider range the information diffuses
 furthermore we have examined and compared how the two infection rates 1 and 2 affect the fraction of each compartment during a tweet diffusion result shows that 2 the normal spreader infection rate has less impact on the information diffusion than 1 the super-spreader infection rate due to the fact that a super-spreading event is generally governed by the influence caused by super-spreaders although infection rates 1 and 2 control information diffusion in conjunction with k1 and k2 refer to eq 7 that are oftentimes known and fixed for a given network the information propagates on and should be recognized as an event-related constant which is this simulation based on 
 is the super-spreader retrograde rate that weighs the speed or time a super-spreader transits into a normal infectious person fig 13
demonstrates the percentage change of each compartment with varied  the range of  is from 001 to 3 with step size 006fig 13sensitivity analysis of  the super-spreader retrograde rate  ranges from 001 to 3 step size 006 other parameters have the same values as described in fig 10 from the diagrams variations of  show a less notable effect on the densities of compartments s i and r only the curve of the a compartment containing super-spreaders will become more sharp after peaking with the growth of rate  these characteristics are obviously true according to the differential equations of the sair model ie the super-spreader retrograde rate has direct impacts on changes of the number of super-spreaders however the effect of varied  on compartment i is trivial as the proportion of compartment a is extremely too small compared with compartment i for a variable  to induce notable changes on the i compartment other than measuring the speed of state transition this rate also indicates that the statistically mean time for a super-spreader being highly infectious is 1time epoch here the time epoch we set in simulations is 1 h that best fits the weibo data thus the curve style displayed in fig 13b is in accordance with the reality that a smallbig  indicates a slowquick transition speed from compartment a to i meaning that a super-spreader is moreless interested in disseminating such information remarkably if  is so large that super-spreaders become normal spreaders much fast the spread of information will be diluted and the consequence is that a portion of susceptible users remain in the s compartment the consequence alters at the critical value of  at 1 all susceptible users will be influenced if 1 although the recovery rate  is not introduced by the new a compartment ie this rate is inherited from the sir model it always fairly affects the information propagation the pattern of information diffusion with different  is similar to the depictions in study  37 however the conclusion in this study drawn by su has some flaws with the underlying truth we observed fig 14
demonstrates the percentage change of each compartment with varied  the range of  is from 0 to 2 with step size 004fig 14sensitivity analysis of  the infection rate by a super-spreader  ranges from 0 to 2 step size 004 other parameters have the same values as described in fig 10 as demonstrated in fig 14a and b compartments s and a have little change with a varied  it is consistent with the statement made by su et al in ref  37 where they argue that the recovery rate does not cause dramatic changes if it varies and this rate cannot significantly affect the information propagation process however our study draws a different conclusion as shown in fig 14c a tuning  significantly affects the curve pattern of compartment i similarly to that of compartment a caused by varied  cf fig 13b the larger the rate  is the lower the peak of the fraction of compartment i is and the faster it drops after reaching the peak which implies that if users recover at a high rate lose interest of a tweet fast the information diffusion terminates early for the r compartment shown in fig 14d the number of it raises sluggishly if this rate is small but eventually reaches the equilibrated state as long as 0 in this paper the patterns of information propagation on microblog services are depicted briefly the mechanism of super-spreading phenomena in information propagation is discussed and the notion of super-spreader in information propagation is defined with the help of corresponding definition in epidemiology field based on the empirical observation result from real-world weibo dataset of tweets diffusion an a compartment characterizing super-spreaders is introduced into the conventional epidemic model and a parameterized model sair is built to characterize super-spreading phenomena of tweet information propagation a case study of fitting to real world dataset is conducted and parameter settings are obtained for both the sair model and the sir model through comparison between fitted results of both models the sair model is validated to show much more promising to characterize a super-spreading event of information propagation than the conventional one in addition numerical simulations are carried out to discover the sensitivity of parameters for future work we plan to model the super-spreading on osns as a deterministic compartmental model but analyze it using a stochastic method by exploiting the graph topology of online social networks which considers the varied effectiveness of nodes users with different network attributes another potential extension to our work would be considering the temporal variations of parameters not only the recency of burst news is time dependent but the behavior of users is also time concerning it has been observed that users on weibo are more active in the daylight time of china than in the nighttime which would affect the information spreading pattern furthermore large scale real-world data can be fitted with our proposed model in order to fulfill the task of information influence breadth and strength analysis information propagation intervention and control etc  spatial visualization of cluster-specific

covid-19 patients with unique numeric patient identifiers geographical data and infection information if available in an epidemiological dataset they released the region of the affected patient the identifier of the person who infected the patient and the number of contacts with other people the aim of this report is to create spatial visualizations of early covid-19 transmission networks in south korea using these data which may indicate transmission patterns for each network the time series data of covid-19 status in south korea is analyzed to provide updated statistics using a spatial visualization of confirmed patients during an early epidemic phase two major clusters are identified as of march 12 7869 positive cases had been documented in south korea and 70 positive cases have

19 2020 with a total number of 1261 cases with 12 deaths based on the kcdc 6 as of march newly reported cases in south korea show that the numbers of positive cases and deaths seem to be declining and

covid-19 lockdown are unclear but de-escalation of physical distancing measures is likely to be gradual one aspect of shielding the vulnerable is to identify those at risk of developing serious and potentially life-threatening symptoms and distance them from sources of infection more work is needed to identify such groups which include people over the age of 65 and those with underlying health conditions another is to identify and isolate the infected this is complicated by uncertainty as to whether efforts to produce a vaccine will succeed and how long it will take it is possible that post-infection immunity may be short-lived european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc 2020 9 and even if infection confers immunity the ecdc estimates that 67 of the population would need to have had the virus in order to prevent ongoing transmission and that some form of physical distancing interventions will therefore need to be in place for at least several months from now 2020 18 a second wave and potentially further waves of covid-19 is possible xu and li 2020 the ecdc 2020 7 estimates that the reproductive number r0 of covid-19 in eueea countries is 328 that is a person contracting the novel virus will pass it on to an average of around 3 people the r0 is a measure of potential transmissibility that is difficult to establish particularly if the accuracy of the data is questionable as where for example there is under- or mis-reporting underlying the r0 is a considerable variation which early in the outbreak mackenzie 2020 postulated may be down to the role of super-spreaders around 10 of cases could be responsible for up to 80 of transmission if so she argued control of super-spreading would be essential in tackling the outbreak the situation is complicated by the fact that so-called super-spreaders of covid-19 cannot always self-identify and take steps to mitigate the risk to others the virus has been detected 13 days before onset of symptoms and the ecdc sees this as a potential major source of transmission some individuals are asymptomatic throughout though the risk of transmission is probably somewhat lower in such cases there have also been reports of covid-19 positive tests during convalescence following a negative test chen et al 2020 covid-19 may itself have super-spreading tendencies flowing from the occurrence of atypical symptoms wang et al 2020 which may have led to a failure to identify many mild casesa phenomenon that has been exacerbated by limited and variable availability of testing tracing and screening in light of the importance of identifying and controlling infection this article begins by considering the definition of super-spreader and argues that the term is vague and unhelpful it goes on to demonstrate ways in which it has been applied to impute moral condemnation on individuals accused of spreading covid-19 and calls for the development of a clearer and widely held scientific definition of super-spread that accommodates the relevance of individual factors in disease transmission without attributing moral blame the term super-spreader has recently entered our consciousness alongside words such as comorbidity furlough and lockdown a super-spreader usually identified in retrospect has a greater than average propensity to infect a larger number of people super-spreading is not a new phenomenon symptomless typhoid mary was exiled for 26 years for apparently infecting many others in the 1800s marineli et al 2013 and super-spreading was thought to be a driver of mers sars 20022003 and to a lesser extent ebola wong et al 2015 stein 2011 observes that observational and modelling studies support a 2080 rule whereby 20 of individuals are likely to contribute around 80 of the transmission potential in a given infectious disease many variables make up this tendency and this has potential to limit the meaningfulness of the term the label super-spreader is a term of art that has been utilised to describe settings events and individuals super-spreading settings include cruise ships and aeroplanes as well as hospitals care homes and potentially schools particularly where they utilise ventilation systems as for events any large gathering or movement of groups or individuals can constitute super-spreading so too can policy decisions or indeed any occurrence which in hindsight exacerbated infection rates such as the lack of control measures when sars first emerged and single cases were treated as atypical pneumonia and transmitted to others who 2003 as highlighted above covid-19 itself has super-spreading tendencies given its potential for atypical symptoms and pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission the term is particularly problematic when applied to individual super-spreaders as it can mean different things to different groups media interest in super-spreaders focuses on the early stages of the epidemic when efforts are being made to contain trace and delay used in this way a super-spreader will generally have interacted with a larger than average number of people making tracing difficult or impossible at the other end of the spectrum scientific interest can focus on the heterogeneity of populations in the transmission of infectious disease used in this sense super-spreading is connected to the scientific nature of the virus and the way it manifests in some humans there is speculation that some people with covid-19 are especially infectious boseley and belam 2020 super-spreading is therefore a product of biological behavioural and environmental factors it can be used to describe decisions policies events settings and individualsin fact anything that contributes to increased rates of infection can be seen by some groups as super-spreading the wide and varied use of the term super-spreader is problematic for two reasons considered in subsequent sections it can lead to apportionment of moral blame to alleged super-spreaders and it could detract from scientific investigation into heterogeneity of covid-19 if misunderstanding leads to diminished public support and trust alleged super-spreaders of covid-19 have attracted considerable media interest patient 31 a member of the shincheonji church was thought to have turned the tide in south korea kasulis 2020 as the number of deaths increased anger was directed at the church and the founders apology was broadcast around the world in india the state of punjab quarantined 40000 people following around 30 deaths linked to a 70-year-old preacher who died of the disease bbc news 2020 in the uk a brighton businessperson was labelled a culprit early in the course of covid-19 see ball 2020 for criticism each was labelled by parts of the media a super-spreader whether or not the host was aware of the risks they posed to others or the repercussions their infection could have these factors were not always reflected in media reports there is a public interest in the location and number of cases and in the early days of the crisis when cases were few this may have enabled some to piece together the identity of infected individuals the brighton case in england resulted in super-spreader headline claims from newspapers including the daily mail guardian sun and telegraph the individual came forward to reveal the steps he had taken on learning that he had come into contact with a covid-19-positive person allegedly due to fears of scapegoating duggan et al 2020 turn to twitter and superspreaders has been employed as a term to signal moral blame aimed at individuals and groups including political leaders runners cyclists and the police opprobrium may rightly follow if a symptomatic individual knowingly puts others at risk in avoidable circumstances such as the reported cases of people deliberately coughing in the faces of others however to attach moral blame to those labelled after the event as super-spreaders is highly problematic most obviously because carriers of covid-19 can be asymptomatic but also because the label can be stigmatising and potentially deter the symptomatic from coming forward if they have recently been in contact with large or vulnerable numbers spreading can be exacerbated by poor hygiene or certain social practices such as hand shaking but infection of others is not evidence alone that guidelines on behaviour have been ignored sadly as the pandemic and resulting fear have escalated so have examples of the public viewing anyone other as a potential super-spreader coates 2020 another problem with the term super-spreader is that its wide use has potential to detract from its importance in research on heterogeneity of transmission of covid-19 if super-spreader is understood in lay terms to attract varying degrees of moral blame then epidemiological investigation of its incidence may be less likely to gain public support and understanding there is a paucity of scientific evidence of the role or even the existence of especially infectious people with covid-19 on a narrow scientific definition a super-spreader would have particular biological characteristics that would increase the tendency to infect others for example a mouse model study by gopinath et al 2014 demonstrated the super-spreading tendencies of a minority of mice infected with salmonella if any potential biological super-spreading tendencies of covid-19 were better understood then it could aid management and control through for example isolation or targeted vaccination if and when it becomes available research might usefully focus on the tendency of some individuals to shed high levels of the pathogen including investigation of co-morbidity genetics viral load and infectivity at different stages of presentation in covid-19 the relationship between viral load severity and infectivity is complex and poorly understood increased viral load does not necessarily result in more severe symptoms geddes 2020 and infection dose is currently uncertain clearly the propensity for biological factors to lead to infection of others is highly dependent on behavioural and environmental factors thus a broader definition of super-spreading might encompass research on biological and external factors combining focus on the virus the host and the environment pre-covid-19 lloyd-smith et al 2005 argued that control measures for infectious disease that focus on individual-specific measures can outperform population-based measures they proposed a rigorous protocol for defining super-spreading events that would supplement the r0 with information about factors such as distribution and range research bringing greater clarity as to the factors that drive variations in infectivity would contribute to targeted control policies that could reduce reliance on widespread lockdown however such research is likely to be reliant upon the public giving up their confidential data or at least cooperating if such data are mandated technology offers a potential to track predict trace contacts and respond in a more precise manner there are for example several apps in developmentuse some allow users to report symptoms so that more can be learned about how the virus behaves some give people advice on the basis of reported symptoms and some operate in conjunction with testing to alert individuals with whom an infected person has come into contact to isolate these apps offer potential to learn more about heterogeneity and also to implement more targeted control measures in response in many countries efficacy will be reliant on the willingness of individuals to sign up to the apps those individuals will need assurance that their privacy will be respected and that negative implications will not flow from their identification as a perceived super-spreader some governments are making more extensive use of confidential information that does not rely on patient consent in the uk national health service nhs england and improvement and nhsx the unit driving digital transformation of care have announced the development of a digital platform that will bring together health data ai and cloud computing gould et al 2020 they are investing in the help of private companies such as microsoft google and amazon web services to bring this about they have provided assurances that the data will remain under nhs england and nhs improvements control and that the data will be destroyed or returned when the emergency is over gould et al 2020 the dashboard will give metrics about occupancy levels in hospitals and capacity and will enable decision-makers to understand how the virus is spreading at a local level and identify risks to particularly vulnerable populations on 20 march 2020 the department of health and social care dhsc on behalf of the secretary of state for health and social care issued a notice under regulation 34 of the health service control of patient information regulations 2002 copi regulation 34 allows the secretary of state having had independent advice from the confidentiality advisory group to give notice to health organisations general practices and local authorities that confidential information will be required dhsc 2020 for a certain purpose the purpose in this case is covid-19 and includes understanding risks and trends including amongst other thingslocating contacting screening flagging and monitoring such patients and collecting information about and providing services in relation to testing diagnosis self-isolation fitness to work treatment medical and social interventions and recovery from covid-19 dhsc 2020 2 this widely framed notice mandates the processing and sharing of confidential information in circumstances where patients have not given informed consent together with the proposals to share information with private companies for the production of the dashboard it is a high-risk strategy that will have profound implications if public trust is undermined whilst efforts will be made to protect the identity of the patients anonymity is not a binary concept and as argued above in relation to the brighton case media interest in super-spreaders could lead to jigsaw identifiability and to moral blame which in turn could impact on trust the term super-spreader makes an exciting headline but its employment in social media sometimes lacks a scientific basis rather it often points to unintended action or is suggestive of negligent actions of an individual and apportions moral blame and yet it is essential that we promote a culture of ethical research on the biological behavioural and environmental influences on transmission the argument set out in this article is that the definition is too broad to be helpful and that its misuse in some social media has resulted in negative connotations consideration of the tendencies of individuals to exacerbate infection rates is a worthy focus of research as more targeted public health responses are developed to replace widespread physical distancing policies it is increasingly important that heterogeneity of covid-19 transmission is explored and factored into responses to the extent that super-spreading is an aspect of research on heterogeneity there is a risk that the negative connotations the term has attracted will result in public reticence to give up the private information upon which that research might depend greater accuracy of definition would help ensure that debate around the term is not at cross-purposes help reduce or prevent moral blame of those who unwittingly infect others and could enhance public trust around the use of confidential data the aim of this article has been to draw attention to problems in the use of the term super-spreader turning briefly to potential solutions one option would be to avoid use of the term altogether but it is well accepted in the scientific literature see for example lloyd-smith 2005 stein 2011 gopinath 2014 and its abandonment could disrupt important linkage between current and previous research another option would be to encourage the use of the terms super-spreading and super-spreading events in epidemiology in place of super-spreader this might reduce stigma but it is unlikely to limit more general misapplication of the term another option would be to encourage the development of a clearer taxonomy of super-spreading so as to take scientific ownership of the term and discourage inappropriate lay adoption potentially through a classification of behavioural environmental and biological super-spreading  modeling covid-19 epidemic in heilongjiang province china tingzhe sun yan wang   in december 2019 the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 occurred in wuhan hubei province and then unfolded in china and all over the world 1 the novel coronavirus has been a serious threat to public health 2 china has taken strict measures such as quarantine social-distancing suspicious isolation community surveillance to restrain covid-19 outbreak by late february however heilongjiang has now become the province with most diagnosed patients in china ie even worse than hubei province massive imported cases emerge and continue to increase specifically a recent super spreader or imported escaper in heilongjiang province has led to tens of diagnosed or asymptomatic cases 3 therefore evaluating the epidemic of covid-19 in heilongjiang province may help provide effective strategies to restrict covid-19 transmission recently many mathematical models have been constructed to investigate the epidemic of covid-19 some models have made modifications based on the conventional seir model 4 and concluded that strictly controlled interventions are critically important to impede covid-19 outbreak 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 several other model instead established a stochastic transition model to evaluate the transmission of covid-19 and also emphasized the necessity of interventions such as social-distancing isolation and quarantine 1213 meanwhile asymptomatic patients are covert cases which represent a serious threat to public health 14 a few models have been developed to evaluate the role of coronavirus transmission based on asymptomatic cases 111516 however all these models have ignored the covid-19 transmission from bats and unknown hosts a recently proposed novel model has characterized these interactions among bats unknown hosts and people in details 17 they estimated the basic reproduction number r0 to be 24829 and indicated that model is locally asymptotically stable if r0  1 17 these important models have greatly improved our understanding about the epidemic of covid-19 in current work we developed a mathematical model to characterize imported escaper and asymptomatic patients we trained our model based on covid-19 epidemic in heilongjiang province from january 23 to march 25 by which the last confirmed patient was cured in heilongjiang province using this model we performed stochastic simulations and found that partial relief in strictly controlled interventions may contribute to the occurrence of diagnosed patients recently from april 9 to april 19 provided that there is only one imported patient without surveillance 3 meanwhile we predicted that there is still an unidentified pool of asymptomatic patients we suggested that strict or mild interventions should still be implemented to restrain a potential covid-19 outbreak the number of experimentally confirmed patients and curedrecovered cases january 23 to april 19 was obtained from health commission of heilongjiang province httpwsjkwhljgovcn table s1 note that only domestic cases epidemiologically associated with the super spreader between april 9 and april 19 were recorded and simulated the total susceptible population was set to be the total population in heilongjiang province from national bureau of statistics 3771 million httpwwwstatsgovcn owing to closure of wuhan on january 23 there are no wuhan returnees to heilongjiang province since then the total population

 describes the discharge rate from quarantine i i1 2 3 describes the averaged contact rate between s and c a or i respectively specifically 1 is the average contact rate between susceptible population and close contacts 2 describes the average contact rate between susceptible population and asymptomatic patients 3 denotes the averaged contact between susceptible population and infected patients  denotes self-recovery rate for asymptomatic cases since specific asymptotic patients can recover without treatments 18 19 20 1 and 2 represent the transition rate from close contacts to asymptomatic and diagnosed ones respectively 3 is the transition from asymptomatic to diagnosed cases 18 19 20  is the maximum average recovery rate since the health-care capacity in different provinces differ significantly owing to economic development we further incorporated a threshold behavior for the recovery we assumed that higher numbers of inpatients and quarantined cases will lower the average recovery rate the health-care capacity will be improved if there are fewer diagnosedquarantined patients a hill function was used to characterize the threshold behavior the threshold was represented as a parameter k and the cooperativity effect was described by the parameter n see model 1 initial values for i and r were obtained from the official site httpwsjkwhljgovcn the total susceptible population was set to be the total population in heilongjiang province as described above other parameters and initial conditions c and a were estimated based on epidemic data from heilongjiang province for parameter estimation 400 stochastic runs using potterswheel toolbox 21 were implemented and the best fit parameter set was shown in table 1
 since the best fit for initial asymptotic population is 1 0042736 we set initial value for a to be 0 since a should be an integer we note that the parameter n in the best fit set was 102545 suggesting that the threshold behavior in recovery rate has relatively low cooperativity parameters were estimated by potterswheel using a trust-region method 21 a 2 criteria was used for model identification 2n1 n is the number of data points 21 we did not incorporate death similar to recent assumptions 1322 the -leap method was used for stochastic simulation 23 ordinary differential equations odes were numerically solved using ode23s in matlab r2018b the ksdensity function in matlab was used for kernel estimation the model was first trained with epidemic data from heilongjiang province using a reasonable initial guess we performed unbiased parameter fitting by sampling parameters in logarithmic scale totally 400 sets the top 200 fits were harvested we noted that fitted initial values from 200 top fits for asymptomatic patient number a approximated zero with mean value 01 and therefore the initial value a for is set to be 0 the best fit was shown for infected and recovered patients by march 25 figure 1
a notably the fitted i i1 2 3 values were to the order of 1010 to 109 suggesting that strong interventions were implemented to restrain mutual contacts table 1 meanwhile n is around 1 102545 suggesting that the cooperativity was neglectable the best fit parameter set was shown in table 1 we further estimated a dynamic reproduction number based on ordinary differential equations 24 the results showed that the reproduction number initially reached 50692 and then quickly dropped below 1 by feb 14 and finally reached 08702 figure s1 therefore our model could faithfully match the epidemic data in heilongjiang province and found that continuously strict measures indeed impeded the covid-19 transmission we then performed stochastic simulations using -leap method 23 since mutual contacts among different populations act as potential risk factors to covid-19 outbreak 25 all i i1 2 3 values were multiplied by a contact factor f i fi i1 2 3 therefore f1 indicated strongly controlled interventions as implemented between late january and mid-march while f1 represented mild or relieved interventions f1 was associated with strongly weakened or no interventions the imported escaper or super spreader the super spreader here means that all recently confirmed patients can be associated with this super spreader in an ongoing epidemiological study arrived in heilongjiang province at march 19 and was then subject to home quarantine 3 therefore the number of infected patients was increased by 1 at march 19 in the stochastic model however the home quarantine was failed as reported possibly owing to accidental egress by escalator or stairs 3 we modeled this by increasing f from 3 to 8 and then performed stochastic simulations results suggested that even a moderate relief would not lead to the reported local outbreak f34 and 5 figure 2
a increasing f to 6-8 however will result in possible matches between stochastic simulations and reported epidemic data black dots epidemic data colored curves stochastic simulations figure 2a the median values from 500 stochastic runs were shown for increasing f values blue curves figure 2b the shaded areas denote 25 and 75 quartiles therefore we predicted that the mutual contacts for the super spreader was significantly elevated to around 7 we further matched our simulations to the reported asymptomatic patients setting f7 stochastic simulation could match the epidemic data figure 2 however we noted a large gap between the simulated number of asymptomatic patients to the reported cases f7 figure 3
a since asymptomatic patients usually do not seek medical tests owing to lack of symptoms the reported number of asymptomatic cases may be lower than the actual number figure 3a 18 19 20 the underestimation was significant for f6 or f7 on april 19 dashed line the mean value figure 3b the discrepancy seemed to grow if intervention strength was not altered figure 3b these simulations implied that the unidentified asymptomatic patients might be another serious concern since the asymptomatic cases can also be contagious 18 19 20 since the confirmed patients have undergone an ongoing increase we then evaluated the effect of establishment of strict interventions since april 20 black dot figure 4
a strict interventions were implemented f1 or 2 since april 20 we measured the time to peak and the recovery time since april 9 at which the first reported domestic patient occurs in heilongjiang province 26 we found that roughly 33 days were used to reach the peak for f1 whereas for f2 the duration was increased to 53 days figure 4b and 4c left 80 days were required for total recovery if f1 whereas about 139 days were needed for f2 figure 4b and 4c right therefore these simulations suggested implementation of strict interventions is strongly required to impede a potential outbreak in this study we constructed a modified model which incorporated threshold behavior in recovery rate and asymptomatic patients with significant difference to seir model 4 however ongoing importation into china especially in heilongjiang province has been a serious threat recently furthermore the asymptomatic patients are not easily identified owing to lack of obvious symptoms 20 we estimated the influence of asymptomatic patients based on a data-driven model from heilongjiang province we anticipated that an area- or province-specific model may help unravel the underlying features of covid-19 epidemic from simulation we found that even one imported patient or super spreader reported recently can lead to up to  40 infected patients and unpredictable pool of asymptomatic patients till april 19 3 we anticipated that the relaxed home quarantine for this imported patient 3 is unsuccessful and has initiated a local outbreak potentially simulation suggested that the mutual contacts from the relaxed home quarantine might possibly increase to f7 compared with f1 for strictly controlled interventions the occurrence of the imported escaper might be ascribed to the significantly longer latent period 2 the weakened surveillance for covid-19 inpatient transfer in specific hospitals and the murky mismanagement for covid-19 tests 3 all these deficiencies may possibly lead to a secondary blockage of some hospitals and communities for haerbin city in heilongjiang province more seriously the associated pool of asymptomatic patients was underestimated from official report since asymptomatic patients are also contagious the potential impact of these covert cases should attract extensive attention as least about one month is still required if strict measures are immediately implemented therefore the imported escaper argues for further epidemiological investigations as well as strongly controlled interventions as more data are available our model could be used for analyzing these novel epidemic data liu et al recently constructed a model with asymptomatic patients 11 however asymptomatic populations in their model will eventually become diagnosedconfirmed patients with clear symptoms and are more likely to be pre-symptomatic 14 which is in stark contrast to recent definition ie asymptomatic patients were those who never develop symptoms 18 19 20 we modeled the covid-19 epidemic induced by one imported patient without strict quarantine lessons from the emerging diagnosed patients recently in heilongjiang province since april 9 should catch attention as they are epidemiologically associated with this imported escaper furthermore we recommended that the strict measures such as isolation home or centralized quarantine should be re-established especially in haerbin city of heilongjiang province to lower the risk of a potentially secondary outbreak finally our model could also be applied elsewhere with adjusted parameters to monitor covid-19 epidemic not required

heterogeneity and super-spreading event of covid-19 in a metropolis of china yunjun zhang yuying li lu wang mingyuan li xiaohua zhou   in december 2019 many cases of viral pneumonia-like disease similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars were detected in wuhan china later they were confirmed to be caused by a novel coronavirus provisionally called 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov on 30 january 2020 world health organization who declared the 2019-ncov outbreak as a global health emergency of international concern 1 on 11 february 2020 who named the diseases coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and announced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 as the name of the new virus on 11 march 2020 who declared covid-19 a pandemic as of 18 april 2020 more than 2160207 cases were confirmed globally and the national health commission nhc of china reported a total of 82735 cases of covid-19 in mainland china including 77062 recoveries and 4632 deaths the dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak depends on both the potential and the heterogeneity of disease transmission the transmission potential of an infectious pathogen is usually represented by its reproduction number denoted as r which is the average number of secondary cases caused by a typical infectious individual estimates of r1 ie supercritical outbreak such as for the early outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in china 2003 2 indicate the great risk for an infection pathogen to generate a major outbreak estimates of r1 ie subcritical outbreak such as for the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in south korea 2018 3 imply that the outbreak is slowing down with declining trend of incidence though different in transmission potential both sars and mers shared the same feature of high level of heterogeneity which involved the uneven transmission patterns with a number of super-spreading events sses where some individuals spread to a disproportionate number of individuals compared to most individuals who infected a few or none 24 sses of sars and mers were responsible for triggering the initial outbreaks in several large cities such as beijing hongkong and singapore and therefore sustaining the spread of disease worldwide besides sses were also documented in many other infectious disease 5 detection of transmission heterogeneity may direct prevention efforts and reduce future infections 367 the transmission potential of covid-19 has been studied based on mathematical models yielding consistent evidence for the high level of reproduction number r 19522 within a completely susceptible population 8910 however evidence for the transmission heterogeneity of covid-19 and the related sses was limited and conflicting so far two studies found no heterogeneity in singapore 11 and in a southern city of china 12 but one study confirmed heterogeneity based on data from 46 countries 13 in addition several possible sses have been reported in china 1415 which involved large numbers of infections therefore it would be essential to further explore the transmission heterogeneity sses and relevant factors of covid-19 in this study we investigated the transmission characteristics of covid-19 using the epidemiological data of all the confirmed cases in a metropolis in northern china we analyzed the transmission chains and then estimated the reproduction number and the transmission heterogeneity using a branching model along with a negative binomial offspring distribution 16 in addition we identified the sse according to the 99-percentile criterion in 2 and assessed the effect of control measures employed by local government tianjin is a municipality and a coastal metropolis in northern china with a population of 1566 million and an area of 11966 square kilometers since the first case of covid-19 in tianjin was confirmed on 21 january a total of 135 cases were confirmed by the time of data collection 26 february 2020 of the current study from 600 on 22 februaryto 1800 on 26 february the city had no new confirmed cases for 108 consecutive hours the municipal government publicized the epidemiological information of the cases every day diagnosis of covid-19 were based on the protocol issued by china cdc 17 from the official websites of the municipal health commissions 18 we retrieved data of the 135 confirmed covid-19 cases in tianjin including demographic characteristics and epidemiological characteristics ie travel history and contact history with confirmedsuspicious cases according to this information the infection relationship within the scope of tianjin can be specified each case was given a unique number according to its sequential order as reported we adopted the definition in 16 to define a transmission chain as a group of cases connected by an unbroken series of local transmission events we grouped all the confirmed cases in tianjin into transmission chains and for each transmission chain we identified the primary case calculated the chain size ie the total number cases including the primary case and reconstructed the transmission history ie who infected whom according to the extent of resolution of the reconstructed information three types of transmission chains were further identified the first type was the simple transmission chain of which the transmission history could be clearly recovered the second type was the ordinary transmission chain of which the transmission history was not clear but the single primary case could be clearly identified and the chain size was also clear the third type was the complex transmission chain of which the chain size was clear but the primary case could not be clearly identified more than one individual in the chain exhibited similar behaviorclinical characteristics so we have to regard them as the primary cases as covid-19 was first reported in wuhan a city in the middle of china a primary case was defined if the individual had a history of travel to or residence in wuhan within one month had direct contact with an individual who had confirmed infection outside tianjin having fever outside tianjin or had the earliest onset of symptoms in the transmission chain to quantify the transmission potential and heterogeneity for the covid-19 outbreak in tianjin we adopted a stochastic model based on branching process to characterize both the distribution of secondary cases ie a negative binomial distribution and the resulting distribution of transmission chain sizes under the same parameterization of reproduction number r and dispersion parameter k lower value indicating higher heterogeneity for subcritical epidemic 16 we first fitted the stochastic model to the retrieved information of the simpleordinary transmission chains then in handling a complex transmission chain with two primary cases we regarded it could be separated into two ordinary transmission chains each of which was led by a primary case the difficulty lay in that the exact size of each ordinary chain was unclear we dealt with this ambiguity in two ways one was the combinatorial method in 16 by allowing for all the possible combinations and treated the sum as an overall probability further detail can be found in section sb supplementary materials the other was to adopt the expectation-maximization em algorithm by treating the sizes of two separated chains as latent variables the em algorithm also estimated the latent chain size which was informative for dividing the complex transmission chain into constituent chains further detail can be found in sections sc and sd supplementary materials to identify possible sses in the tianjin outbreak we adopted the definition in 2 to define a super-spreader as any infected individual causing more infections than would occur in 99 of infectious histories in a homogeneous population the transmission in a homogeneous situation was modelled with a poisson distribution which is the special case of negative binomial distribution without heterogeneity based on the stochastic model accounting for transmission heterogeneity we assessed the control measures imposed by the tianjin government we compared the transmission characteristics ie r and k for the periods of before and after the control measures taking effect then based on the estimate of transmission characteristics before control we simulated the expected distribution of outbreaks that might occur in tianjin if no control measures were taken each simulated outbreak was initiated with 43 infectious individuals as the number of transmission chains in tianjin and was propagated with the branching process model on the basis of inferred characteristics among the 135 patients included in the study 72 533 were male and 63 467 female with an average standard deviation age of 478 183 years and 501 152 years respectively as shown by figure 1a of the total 135 cases 34 252 cases were imported cases among the 101 cases of local transmission the majority 55 407 were infected in household 35 259 cases were infected in public places including a shopping mall and working places and 11 81 were unclear in the source of infection when we examined the chronological development of the infection in tianjin we found that the confirmed cases were mainly composed of the imported cases and the household infections in the early and the later stage of outbreak respectively the transition happened around 3 february the 135 cases were grouped into 43 transmission chains including 36 simple chains 47 cases average size 13 5 ordinary chains 78 cases average size 156 and 2 complex chains 10 cases average size 5 table 1 figure 2 detailed information of three types of transmission chains shown in section sa of supplementary materials both the combinational method and the em algorithm gave lower value of k with the corresponding 95 confidence intervals cis being lower than 1 table 2 suggesting significant evidence for the transmission heterogeneity in the outbreak at tianjin in addition both combinatorial method and em algorithm gave the same estimate of reproductive number r067 being lower than the critical value of 1 indicating the local transmission would finally die out note that these estimates of transmission potential were based on the data by 26 february implying the average trend over the same period when comparing the cis from different methods we observed that the em algorithm generated slightly narrower cis for both parameters than the combinatorial method in addition the em algorithm had advantage on the ability of providing more information on the split of complex transmission chain as it also produced a probabilistic insight of unknown partitions of the chain recall that the covid-19 data in tianjin contains two complex transmission chains of size 5 for each for these two complex chains the em algorithm tended to split it into one size-1 and one size-4 transmission chain posterior probability  955 instead of two chains with size 2 and size 3 posterior probability  45 furthermore the estimates along with the 95 cis and confidence regions of combinatorial method were plotted in figure 3a the confidence region incorporated the uncertainty in both parameters simultaneously thus it undoubtedly gave much wider range than the ci especially for k we also found figure 3b that the observed chain size distribution was close to the expected distribution based on the estimated characteristics ie r067 and k026 particularly the probability of a chain with size over 5 was less than 10 and the probability of a single infected case resulting in a chain of size 45 the largest size of transmission chain in tianjin was about 08 it indicated that the outbreak of a comparatively large chain was not likely to happen in tianjin we found notable transmission heterogeneity k025 in the local spreading of covid-19 in tianjin suggesting that there were likely to be sses 5 as sses were more likely to occur at the early stage of the outbreak to trigger out the local spreading in the epidemic of sars and mers we suspect the existence of sses at the early stage of outbreak in tianjin adopting the criterion in 2 to define sse we calculated the cut-off as the 99th percentile of the poisson distribution with mean value of 22 ie the reproduction number at the early stage the cut-off value was 6 suggesting that an infected individuals who infected 6 or more secondary cases could be regarded as a super-spreader of the covid-19 outbreak in tianjin according to this criterion a 57-year-old man case 2 was a super-spreader he infected six colleagues in close contact with him before being confirmed on 21 january 2020 figure 2 these six colleagues as secondary cases in this transmission chain successively infected other colleagues or their relatives tianjin municipal government deployed a series of policies to control the spread of covid-19 from 28 january 2020 including strong traffic restriction and quarantining individuals who had suspect contacts with confirmed cases 19 by allowing for the median incubation period of 51 days 20 we assumed that the control measures had been taking effect since 1 february 2020 when we compared the transmission characteristics before and after the intervention taking effect table 3 we found that the reproduction number r decreased from 074 to 053 while k increased from 014 to 077 suggesting a decrease in both transmission potential and heterogeneity after taking control measures however the overlapping cis were likely to be caused by the small sample size compared with the observation of 135 confirmed cases in total and the longest transmission chain with 4 generations figure 2 the simulation study showed that the local outbreak in tianjin would have sustained for 756 generations and would have led to 165 infections on average if there were no control policies figure 4 based on individual-level information of covid-19 infection cases in tianjin we discovered significant transmission heterogeneity k025 95 ci 013088 and subcritical transmission potential r067 95 ci 054084 and we identified one super-spreader who infected 6 individuals suggesting that the local outbreak in tianjin was considerably heterogeneous even though it would finally die out in addition our numerical results successfully verify the effectiveness of government control deployed on 28 january in tianjin our finding of significant transmission heterogeneity of covid-19 outbreak in tianjin was inconsistent with the previous studies conducted in shenzhen china k058 95 ci 035118 12 and in singapore k04 95 ci 01inf 11 the absence of heterogeneity in these two studies could have been due to the failure of tracking some epidemiological links among cases in addition our result was consistent with another study conducted among 46 countries k01 95 ci 00502 13 however it should be noted that the large-scale spread of covid-19 is likely to be heterogeneous because many extrinsic factors such as weather and control measures may affect the transmission of pathogen the transmission heterogeneity revealed in the current study was in a local outbreak which indicates that some intrinsic properties of the pathogen might have contributed to the heterogeneity this finding is more meaningful for the development of targeted control measures besides the super-spreader in tianjin as discussed in the results some other sses were also identified based on our criterion in other cities of china such as in ningbo zhejiang 21 in harbin heilongjiang 22 and in hong kong 23 with the tendency of pandemic of covid-19 all governments should strengthen controls to prevent sses previous studies identified multiple underlying reasons for the emergence of sses and high transmission heterogeneity 5 for example sses of mers-cov and sars-cov were largely driven by the environmental and clinical factors such as hospital transfer substantial delay of diagnosis and fundamental crowding of population 45 the transmission heterogeneity and the identified sse of covid-19 in tianjin however exhibited different features the sse happened in a working place and there was no obvious delay of diagnosing the super-spreader 3 days from onset of symptom to diagnosis in addition the longest transmission chain as shown in figure 2 occured after the initiation of level one response of public health emergency by the tianjin government moreover the public were advised to avoid mass gathering and stay at home obviously the aforementioned reasons for the transmission heterogeneity in mers-cov and sars-cov did not hold in the covid-19 outbreak therefore we suspected the transmission heterogeneity of covid-19 were driven by some other epidemiological characteristics such as asymptomatic transmission and contagiousness during incubation period ie transmission can occur before symptom onset the onset of viral shedding prior to the onset of symptoms or in cases that remain asymptomatic is a classic factor that makes infectious disease outbreaks difficult to control 24 a recent reported transmission chain of large size in harbin china was triggered by asymptomatic infections 25 which justified our speculation and highlighted the need for efficient measures such as rapid testing suspected cases to reduce the transmission from subclinical cases additionally our estimate of transmission potential r1 suggested that the spreading of covid-19 would not cause large infection in tianjin this estimate was the average trend over the period of data collection from 21 january to 26 february and was considerable lower than that of other studies especially at the early stage of covid-19 outbreak 10 the differences in the reproductive number reported from different studies are largely due to differences methods differences in data sources and time periods used to estimate the reproductive number in addition as indicated with our evaluation based on simulation the value of r1 indicated that the control measures imposed in succession by the local government had been considerable to reduce the spread of virus regarding the effect of control measure undertaking by the local government there were changes in point estimates of r and k of before and after government control but the difference was not statistically significant with overlapping confidence intervals even though by considering the resulted decrease of 19 infection from 165 cases to 135 cases within 25 days these control measures still had some practical implication although the spread of covid-19 is currently under control in china it is still facing the risk and challenge brought by the resumption of work and imported cases from other countries the verification of transmission heterogeneity and sse in tianjin outbreak of covid-19 reminds the government to pay much attention to asymptomatic transmission and other factors that may lead to the transmission heterogeneity and sses furthermore more efforts are also needed to explore the emergence of sse and its contributing factors it is also worth mentioning the limitations of our study totally 34 imported cases were reported in tianjin during the period of our study but we identified 43 transmission chains which meant some epidemiology links among cases were missing the estimate of heterogeneity might be driven up if the confirmed cases were condensed into fewer transmission chains meanwhile we only analyzed covid-19 data from tianjin 135 confirmed cases a relatively small sample size compared with the total number in china exceeds 80000 confirmed cases and our case data might be subject to bias or under-reporting however this could not alter our final conclusion of significant heterogeneity since a study 26 explored small-sample bias and under-reporting bias and found that maximum likelihood estimates of k can be biased upward but are not biased downward in conclusion we proved that the transmission of covid-19 is heterogeneous and identified the existence of one sse in tianjin we also showed that the control measures undertaken by the local government effectively alleviated the outbreak in terms of infection size and duration as a pandemic which is still spreading worldwide at a startling speed the transmission characteristics of covid-19 needs more exploration and investigation in a large scale  airflow as a possible transmission route of middle east respiratory syndrome at an initial outbreak hospital in korea minki sung seongmin jo sang-eun lee moran ki bo choi youl jinkwan hong   a korean businessman returning from a business trip to the middle east was admitted to pyeongtaek st marys hospital south korea from 15 to 17 may 2015 he was confirmed to be infected with middle east respiratory syndrome mers on 20 may and spread the infection both directly and indirectly resulting in 186 infections and 38 deaths in korea 1 by 23 december 2015 which was officially declared as the end of the mers outbreak 2 approximately 17000 suspected patients were isolated and korea suffered significant economic losses estimated at us85 billion 3 an estimate from the transmission model by zhang et al 4 revealed a higher reproductive number for mers outbreaks in south korea than other small outbreaks which was mainly related to healthcare-associated settings according to choi 5 approximately 80 of the total mers patients in south korea were infected in healthcare facilities by four super-spreaders who infected more than five individuals each 6 this indicates the importance of the isolation and treatment of super-spreaders using prompt epidemiologic investigations for the prevention of large-scale infections park et al 6 and kim et al 7 analyzed the epidemiologic characteristics of 36 secondary and tertiary patients infected by the initial super-spreader patient at pyeongtaek st marys hospital and suggested the necessity of additional investigations into the cases of infected patients for whom close contact was not confirmed as the infection route cho et al 8 examined the infection route by conducting epidemiologic investigations on super-spreaders and secondary infected patients who infected 82 people in an emergency room at the samsung medical center it was found that several infected patients were not in direct contact with the super-spreaders and the infection was not caused by a contaminated environment given that no patient or medical staff was infected after the isolation of the super-spreaders nam et al 9 and park et al 10 conducted epidemiologic investigations on the clinical symptoms and medical environment of other super-spreaders and infected patients who spread secondary infections in the daejeon area and identified close contact as the main infection route the study by wong et al 11 who compared the super-spreaders of mers severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and ebola revealed that super-spreaders play a significant role in large-scale infection cases it is important to identify and prevent any possible infection route of such super-spreaders regardless of its relative probability furthermore mers is known to spread mainly by large droplets through close contact similar to sars which is also caused by a coronavirus cov 12 however given that close contact does not explain the spread of infection as suggested by the previously mentioned epidemiologic studies infections via other routes such as fomites and air were suspected 1314 in the case of sars which spread from hong kong and china and resulted in the infection of 8096 patients worldwide in 2003 15 close contact was identified as one of the infection routes and the possibility of infection through the air was suggested in several studies 16 li et al 17 yu et al 18 and qian et al 19 suggested the possibility of infection through the air for secondary infected patients for whom close contact could not be established as the infection route in addition the importance of ventilation in the control of infections indoors was emphasized using epidemiologic investigations and numerical analyses in the prince of wales hospital in which the initial infected patient was known to have infected 125 secondary patients previous studies in south korea were mainly focused on the identification of the infection route via close contact based on the epidemiologic characteristics of group infections caused by the initial mers patient however it is necessary to examine all possible infection routes with respect to super-spreaders as with the sars cov the aim of this study was to identify the airflow as a possible infection routes of secondary infected patients for whom close contact was not identified using the spatial distribution and environmental analysis of pyeongtaek st marys hospital in which the initial mers patient directly and indirectly infected 38 people after being admitted to the hospital on 15 may 2015 for two nights and three days thus the possibility of the spread of the mers infection via the indoor airflow was examined by the analysis of the ventilation systems and the results of an epidemiologic investigation conducted to identify the infection routes in the hospital 20 the hospital located 65 km south of seoul was built at the beginning of 2015 and was only in operation for several months prior to the outbreak it is a nine-story building with inpatient wards on the fourth to the ninth floors the initial patient was admitted on the eighth floor for three days where 38 patients were directly or indirectly infected including family members and hospital staff on the seventh and eighth floors the initial patient was assumed to mostly cause infections on the eighth floor and infections on the seventh floor spread through secondary infected patients after the initial patient had been released the hospital according to the epidemiological investigation 7 an extended epidemiological investigation was conducted during june 2015 through interviews with patients families and medical staff who stayed at the eighth floor to identify the transmission routes during the three days we also investigated the building systems windows and doors on the eighth floor because their conditions are closely related with indoor airflow tracer experiment was also conducted as an epidemiological investigation to identify the airflow and possible dispersion of infectious aerosols through the airflow we conducted tracer experiments by replicating the conditions of the initial two nights and three days after the initial patient was admitted to the hospital the entire hospital was closed on 29 may 2015 upon the confirmation of the mers group infection and a primary disinfection was performed in the hospital thereafter a tracer experiment was conducted on 7 june 2015 in the experiment the conditions of the hospital during the occurrence of the infection were maintained except patients and medical staffs who were isolated in other facilities a tracer experiment was conducted using sulfur hexafluoride sf6 gas as the tracer gas sf6 gas is commonly used to trace the dispersion of pollution substances or measure the ventilation performance given that it has a low toxicity and seldom exists in normal indoor environments the tracer gas was continuously generated on the bed in the room of the initial patient at a rate of 1 lmin the concentration of sf6 was measured at a height of 12 m at the centers of room 8104 rooms 8103 and 8106 adjacent rooms rooms 8110 and 8113 rooms across the corridor and room 8218 a single-patient room using a photoacoustic multi-gas monitor 1412 lumasense technologies inc santa clara ca usa as shown in figure 1 at the end of tracer gas experiment the airflow near room 8104 was visualized and verified using a smoke generator during the experiment the conditions of the eighth floor were maintained as during the mers outbreak with the exception of the external conditions all the windows were open and the air conditioning systems were not operated according to the epidemiological investigation the operation of the ventilation systems and the opening of the doors were changed during the experiment as their status could not be confirmed from the investigation the movement of the experimenter wearing personal protective equipment was minimized throughout the experiment from the epidemiological investigation a patient and a caregiver who remained for an additional half of a day in addition to two caregivers of the first patient who remained on the window side of the bed in room 8104 were all infected as shown in figure 2 in each of the adjacent rooms 8103 and 8105 one patient and one caregiver were infected in two 7-patient rooms rooms 8107 and 8108 along the same corridor three patients and two caregivers were infected recently song et al 21 conducted a seroepidemiologic investigation and confirmed that one patient in room 8102 was also infected without the display of symptoms in addition to the adjacent rooms nine patients and seven caregivers were infected in room 8109 which is 15 m from room 8104 in addition to the rooms across the corridor rooms 81108113 this could be explained by the conjecture that the range of the mers infection which is known to spread through droplets is within 2 m although contact by the movement of the infected patients was also suspected there were many secondary infected patients for whom contact due to the movement of the initial patient was not confirmed the initial patient did not walk around the rooms of the other patients and only used the elevator for transport to medical examinations in addition to walking outside close contact with other patients in the elevator or in the hospital was also limited according to the interview with the patient and the review of the closed-circuit television footage it was therefore necessary to examine the possible infection routes through fomites or air nevertheless no infected patients were reported in the maternity ward with single-patient rooms which is located in the south there were 19 single-patient rooms six 2-patient rooms six 7-patient rooms and one 5-patient room on the eighth floor each patient room is cooled using air conditioners installed on the window side of the ceiling and heated by hot-water radiators installed on the window side of the floor moreover heat recovery ventilation units were installed for the ventilation of 26 rooms supply diffusers with diameters of 300 mm were located at the window side and exhaust vents of the same size were located at the door side the locations and sizes of all the diffusers and vents were identical in all the patient rooms and the air change rate of the unit was approximately four air changes per hour ach each room has an affiliated toilet with exhaust air of 100 m3h and a small project window for natural ventilation which can be opened or closed however only room 8104 in which the initial patient was hospitalized does not have a ventilation system the air conditioner in each room can be operated by the patient using the operation switch located in the room in the corridor air conditioners were installed in the ceiling without any ventilation systems the air conditioning systems were seldom operated and the windows were mostly open due to the mild outdoor temperature with the exception of night time according to our epidemiological investigation as shown in figure 3 the concentration in room 8104 reached 53 ppm in approximately 10 min and the average concentration of 495 ppm standard deviation 109 ppm was maintained until the gas generation was stopped after 2 h after the door was closed the average concentration increased from 10 ppm to 60 ppm all other rooms exhibited a concentration increase according to that of room 8104 however the degree and time of the increase varied depending on the room first the concentration increased in adjacent rooms 8106 and 8103 and room 8110 approximately 8 min after the gas generation in particular the concentration increased significantly to 159 ppm 32 of the average concentration of room 8104 in room 8110 approximately 18 min after the sf6 gas generation and maintained the highest concentration average of 209 ppm and maximum of 374 ppm among the rooms with the exception of room 8104 until the sf6 gas generation was stopped in contrast the concentration increased to 056 ppm in adjacent room 8103 and decreased after the door was closed thus reaching an average value of 018 ppm in room 8106 the concentration was relatively low similar to that of room 8103 however it increased to 207 ppm and maintained an average value of 163 ppm until the sf6 gas generation was stopped in room 8113 which is opposite room 8104 but farther to the south the concentration increased approximately 15 min after the sf6 gas generation which was somewhat delayed when compared with those of the other rooms moreover it reached 167 ppm decreased and then maintained an average value of 063 ppm after the door was closed the concentration of room 8104 increased by approximately 20 however the concentrations of the other rooms did not decrease until the sf6 gas generation was stopped the airflow through the undercut of the sliding door which was also verified by the subsequent smoke test was assumed to maintain the dispersion of the tracer gas to the other patient rooms in room 8218 which is a single-patient room in the maternity ward to the south of room 8104 where no mers patient was admitted the concentration increased to 012 ppm after the initial sf6 gas generation and maintained the lowest concentration with an average value of 0048 ppm after the gas generation was stopped there was a rapid decrease in the concentration in room 8104 in addition to that in room 8106 however the concentrations in rooms 8110 and 8113 decreased gradually overall room 8110 which was the farthest from the source had sf6 concentrations similar to or higher than those of the rooms adjacent to room 8104 moreover the attack rate of room 8110 was also the highest among the measured rooms as shown in table 1 after the tracer gas experiment the airflow from room 8104 to the corridor was confirmed using a smoke generator the airflow could be attributed to the presence of strong westerly winds when the tracer-gas experiment and smoke test were conducted given that wind was introduced to room 8104 through the open window and flowed out toward the corridor as shown in figure 4 during the tracer gas experiment the air change rate estimated using the average concentration of 495 ppm and the emission rate of sf6 before closing the door during was approximately 20 ach a large amount of outside air was introduced by strong westerly winds through the relatively small window of the room at approximately 17 ach even after the door was closed the air change rate estimated by stopping the generation of the tracer gas and using the attenuating concentration was also high at approximately 15 ach when the air change rate is high the concentration of pollutants can be diluted and dispersed indoors through the corridor if they are not discharged outside through ventilation ducts therefore the causes of the dispersion of the tracer gas from room 8104 to the other rooms through the corridor along with the introduced wind could be estimated using the results of the tracer-gas experiment in addition the gas from room 8104 did not disperse to room 8218 given that the outdoor airflow in the westsouthwest direction was introduced to the maternity ward through the windows the results of the tracer-gas experiment revealed that the highest concentration of sf6 gas from room 8104 was in room 8110 which is one of the rooms on the east side although mers is known to spread mainly by droplets via close contact as mentioned earlier several infection cases could not be explained by droplet infection in a study by xiao et al 13 the multi-route analysis of the mers outbreak was conducted in the same hospital the conditions in the hospital during the three-day period were assumed and the probabilities of the airborne close contact and fomite infection routes were analyzed and compared however there was a low probability of close contact with the initial patient according to the epidemiological investigation and interviews with the infected patients in the patient rooms far away from room 8104 moreover the average attack rate of the rooms on the west side adjacent to room 8104 was 241 and that of the rooms on the east side far away from room 8104 was 400 therefore in this study the possibility of long-distance infection through the air was not assumed to be low and was examined using the tracer-gas experiments according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 22 airborne precautions should be taken with respect to mers-infected patients this is because droplets containing viable mers-cov could be transferred over large distances in certain environments such as healthcare facilities where large amounts of droplets could be released during coughing or medical treatments and transferred over distances significantly larger than 12 m by airflow the propagation distance and time of droplets or droplet nuclei in the air may increase depending on the indoor environment 2324 which may be affected by mechanical or natural ventilation bin et al 25 and kim et al 26 performed the environmental sampling of negative-pressure isolation rooms in which mers-confirmed patients were hospitalized moreover mers-cov was detected in the ventilation ducts in the ceiling the detection of mers-cov in the air-conditioner filter in the ceiling of the room opposite room 8104 among the unpublished environmental sampling results of the hospital also indicates that the droplets or droplet nuclei from patients can travel over large distances in certain environments though investigations were conducted the operation status of the ventilation system and air conditioner installed in the room of the hospital during the stay of the initial patient could not be clearly determined the control devices of the ventilation system and air-conditioner were in the room and the patient had access to them however the cooling or heating system was not operated given that the average temperature of pyeongtaek was 178 c 103264 c from 15 to 17 may when the initial patient was hospitalized according to the epidemiological investigation moreover it was not clear whether the ventilation system was operated during the outbreak furthermore room 8104 did not have a ventilation system due to a construction flaw apart from the ventilation system each room had a small project window for natural ventilation which could be opened or closed by the occupants of the room the window was opened for ventilation given that the outside air was mild with the exception of the night time it is necessary to examine the effects of the introduction of the outside air through the window and the effect of the indoor airflow formed by the outside air on the dispersion of droplets or droplet nuclei in room 8104 figure 5 presents the wind direction and wind-speed distribution measured at the same weather station with figure 4 from 15 to 17 may when the initial patient was hospitalized the main wind was that in the westsouthwest direction and the wind speed in this direction was high in particular on may 16 the average wind speed was 215 ms the maximum wind speed was 109 ms and the wind was mostly in the westsouthwest wind direction therefore it is possible that airborne particles from room 8104 were introduced to the corridor by the outside air entering through the window when the window and room door were open this is similar to the external airflow observed when the tracer experiment was conducted using sf6 gas the tracer experiment also confirmed that pollutants from room 8014 were dispersed into adjacent rooms and rooms on the opposite side some of the tracer gas was assumed to flow into adjacent rooms 8103 and 8106 in addition to the dominant dispersal into the patient rooms on the opposite side due to changes in the wind direction and speed and the inflow of exhaust air to the affiliated toilets of adjacent rooms during the experiment previous experiments and the results of the computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis conducted in sars cases also confirmed the possibility of long-distance dispersion due to indoor airflow 17181927 in addition it is also possible that a high concentration of airborne particles including the mers virus accumulated in room 8104 which does not have a ventilation system given that its window and door were closed at night thereafter the particles may have been discharged in large amounts by the opening of the window and door in the morning according to the world health organization who 28 with respect to the layout of the patient rooms and corridors for infection management a single-side corridor courtyard or atrium type may be used for natural ventilation however the central corridor type is not appropriate given that infectious viruses from one room may travel to opposite rooms through the corridor due to the natural ventilation pyeongtaek st marys hospital has a central corridor layout thus it is highly probable that viruses spread into opposite rooms through the corridor as shown in the results of tracer experiment in this study the dispersion of mers-cov was simulated using tracer gas this experiment has been widely used to observe the dispersion phenomenon of airborne bacteria 2930 however at sites different to controlled laboratories it is difficult to derive reproducible results due to the interference from high-concentration airborne particles already present in indoor and outside air although the sf6 gas used in the tracer-gas experiment is seldom detected in normal environments and therefore not subject to interference it exhibits an aerodynamic dispersion behavior different from that of particles as it contains gas molecules smaller than particles in previous studies on sars 1727 airflow indoors and outdoors was analyzed using passive contaminant to identify the dispersion of sars virus based on the assumption that the droplets exhaled from the infected patient are evaporated very quickly and get smaller enough to flow like airflow for the same reason sf6 gas is widely used for the dispersion of pollution substances such as gas and airborne particles or for airflow examinations as it can be used to simulate airflow 3132 besides we tried to conduct the tracer experiment in the same condition with the initial outbreak period at the hospital however the patients medical staff and their movements could not be simulated because the hospital was evacuated and they were isolated in other facilities moreover the hospital was still under risk of contamination the movements and heat generation from the occupants could accelerate the dispersion of air and particles from the initial patient room the tracer gas was not measured in several important patient rooms such as 8108 8109 and 8111 due to the limited supply of measuring equipment moreover the effect of the heat generation of the occupants in each room was not simulated the experiment was prepared and conducted on 8 june 2015 approximately 1 week after the hospital was evacuated to determine the infection route including the airborne route which was not confirmed at that time the measuring equipment was therefore limited due to the urgent demand a more precise analysis for all the patient rooms may be conducted in future work using cfd simulations we identified the dispersion of tracer gas from the initial patient room to long-distance patient rooms which implies that airflow could be an infection route the results also correspond epidemiologically with attack rates however the correspondence does not directly indicate infection by the dispersed portion of tracer gas from the initial patient room because biological factors such as host susceptibility and infective dose of mers-cov are not yet clear in this study epidemiological investigation and tracer experiments were conducted to identify airflow as a possible infection route this was achieved with the exception of the droplet infection route identified in pyeongtaek st marys hospital the conclusions of the study can be summarized as followsthe tracer gas from room 8104 in which the initial patient super-spreader was hospitalized was confirmed to spread over long distances to patient rooms across the corridor this indicates the significant effect of the outdoor wind entering through the windowthe high concentration in room 8104 was probably spread to the corridor and rooms on the opposite side due to the strong airflow entering from the outsidethe results indicate that cross ventilation by outdoor wind in central corridor inpatient ward could cause dispersion of infectious aerosols to indoor through airflowalthough there were limitations in confirming the infectivity of propagated airborne particles the possibility of the spread of infections by airflow was presented for the analysis of relatively long-distance infection cases for which the close-contact infection route by droplets could not be identified precautions are essential for every mode of unknown or known infectious diseases especially in their early stages of outbreak for example the mers-confirmed and mers-suspected patients were quarantined in the negative pressure isolation wards that were primarily intended for airborne infection patients the findings in this study can be used in initial epidemiological investigations and precautions with respect to outbreaks of mers or similar unknown infectious diseases  modeling super-spreading events for infectious diseases case study sars thembinkosi mkhatshwa  super-spreading events for infectious diseases occur when some infected individuals infect more than the average number of secondary cases several super-spreading individuals have been identified for the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars we develop a model for superspreading events of infectious diseases which is based on the outbreak of sars using this model we describe two methods for estimating the parameters of the model which we demonstrate with the small-scale sars outbreak at the amoy gardens hong kong and the large-scale outbreak in the entire hong kong special administrative region one method is based on parameters calculated for the classical susceptible -infected -removed sir disease model the second is based on parameter estimates found in the literature using the parameters calculated for the sir model our model predicts an outcome similar to that for the sir model on the other hand using parameter estimates from sars literature our model predicts a much more serious epidemic  severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a highly contagious respiratory disease which is caused by the sars coronavirus it is a serious form of pneumonia resulting in acute respiratory distress and sometimes death sars emerged in china late 2002 and quickly spread to 32 countries causing more than 774 deaths and 8098 infections worldwide one of the intriguing characteristics of the sars epidemic was the occurrence of superspreading events super-spreading events for a specific infectious disease occur when certain infected individuals called super-spreaders infect more than the average number of secondary cases according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention a person is a super-spreader if they cause more than 10 secondary infections such super-spreading individuals have been identified in the sars outbreak and they are thought to have caused most of the secondary infections for example in singapore about 80 of infections have been attributed to only 5 superspreading individuals  7  one extreme super-spreading individual in hong kong caused more than 100 secondary infections  13  to contrast in singapore most individuals caused 0 secondary infections  10  one differential equation model for super-spreading individuals was proposed before the recent sars outbreak by kemper 6  he presents a modified susceptibleinfected -removed sir disease model to capture the effect of the super-spreading individuals in which the infected individuals are split into two different infected classes with different transmission rates the superspreaders have a higher transmission rate meaning more of their contacts with susceptible individuals result in a new infection than the regular infected individuals this was the first model designed specifically to address the effect of super-spreading individuals on the course of infectious disease epidemics due to the extreme influence of super-spreading individuals during the sars outbreak many mathematical epidemiologists developed models for the spread of sars which included the occurrence of the super-spreading events 1  it is interesting to note how each incorporated the super-spreading events into their model first are models where the super-spreading individuals have a higher transmission rate than the regular infected individuals as in kemper 6  for example masuda et al 10  developed a contact network model which had different transmission rates for regular infected individuals and for super-spreading individuals second are models in which parameters are taken from probability distributions making the super-spreading individuals naturally appear as the right-hand tail of the distributions lloyd-smith et al  9  developed a stochastic compartment model and fang et al 4  developed a spacial lattice combined with a deterministic compartment model wherein the individual reproduction numbers are drawn from a continuous probability distribution the goal of this paper is to capture the effect of the superspreading individuals using a modification of the classical sir disease model the modification is inspired by li et al 8  who determined that for sars the daily infection rate did not correlate with the daily total number of symptomatic cases but with the daily number of symptomatic cases who were not admitted to a hospital within 4 days of onset of symptoms this means that the number of infected individuals is closely associated with the number of individuals who remain outside of isolation longer than most other infected individuals these individuals remaining outside of isolation longer than normal are related to the disease severity they have more contacts with susceptible individuals and thus more chances to spread the disease in other words they are the superspreaders in our model we split the infected individuals into two classes with two different removal rates these two rates determine how long an infected individual remains outside of isolation in this paper we modify the classical sir disease model to capture the effect of a super-spreading event using the idea that super-spreading individuals stay out of isolation longer than individuals who are not super-spreading a description of the sip r model the model equations and some basic model properties are given in section 2 we demonstrate the model using a small-scale and a largescale outbreak of sars in section 3 our discussion follows in section 4 we conclude the introduction with a brief review of the classical sir disease model a more detailed review is given in murray 11  and in ching et al  2  and the references given there the classical sir disease model splits a fixed-size population n  into three distinct classes the susceptible individuals s those do not have the disease and can become infected the infected individuals i those who have the disease and can infect susceptible individuals and the removed individuals r those who have recovered die or moved into isolation individuals in the removed class gain permanent immunity and remain in the r class forever schematically the sir model is figure 1  sip r model schematic where s are the susceptible individuals i are the regular infected individuals p are the super-spreaders r are the removed individuals  is the transmission rate b is the probability that a new infection will be a regular infected person 1  b is the probability that a new infection will be a super-spreading individual  1 is the removal rate for a regular infected individual and  2 is the removal rate for a super-spreading individual equations describing the sir model is where  is the transmission rate and  is the removal 2 rate we describe the sip r model a modification of the classical sir model which captures the effect of superspreading individuals schematically the model is given in figure 1  while the basic sir model has one class of infected individuals the sip r model has a second class of infected individuals the super-spreaders denoted by the variable p  in the sip r model we divide the population of fixed size n  into four groups namely the susceptible individuals s the regular infected individuals i the super-spreaders p  and the removed individuals r a susceptible individual can become infected through contact with either a regular infected individual or a super-spreading individual then with probability b the new infected individuals become regular infected individuals move to class i and with probability 1  b the new infected individuals become super-spreading individuals move to class p  we assume most new infections are regular infected individuals that is b  1  b we assume that the two infected classes i and p  have the same transmission rate  to capture the effect of the super-spreading individuals we use the idea that individuals who are super-spreaders stay out of isolation longer than the regular infected individuals the regular infected individuals stay out of isolation the r class for 1 1 days and the superspreading individuals stay out of isolation for 1 2 days with 1 1  1 2  therefore the model has two distinct removal rates namely  1 and  2  corresponding to regularly infected individuals i and super-spreading events p  respectively when a person is removed to the r class there is no possibility of becoming susceptible again but rather they recover and gain permanent immunity or die in either case they remain in the removed compartment forever based on the previous descriptions and assumptions we formulate a system of four ordinary differential equations for the sip r model subject to the following initial conditions the sip r model given by equations 1 has the following properties  the sip r model has a unique global solution  the components of the solution st it p t and rt of the sip r model are non-negative and bounded by n for all time t  0  the sip r model has equilibrium points n 0 0 0 s   0 0 r   for any 0  s   s 0  and 0 0 0 n   the individual reproduction number is the properties of the sip r are in general the natural modification of the corresponding properties of the classical sir model it is interesting to note that the r 0 for the sip r model is the r 0 for the corresponding sir model for each of the two infected classes i and p  multiplied by the probability of a new infected individual becoming an i or a p  respectively the sip r model can be used to analyze any infectious disease where super-spreading events have been identified as a particular example super-spreading events have been identified in one outbreak of measles as described in paunio et al  12  we use the sip r model to study the spread of sars on a small scale in the amoy gardens apartment complex in hong kong and on a large scale in the entire hong kong special administrative region in both cases we fit the model to the data using two parameter estimation methods we begin with a description of the estimation procedures the general parameter estimation procedure was as follows the sip r system of equations 1 was solved repeatedly with parameter sets taken from the allowable range of possible parameters and the least squares error between the cumulative number of cases of the solution and the actual data was computed the least squares error was minimized all computations were done with matlab using the function fminsearchbnd in parameter estimation method 1 we used the parameters estimated with a fit of the classical sir model to the data for the data on the entire hong kong special administrative region we were unable to find sir parameters therefore we began with fitting the classical sir model to the data a summary of the sir model parameters is given in table 1  we use the transmission rate of the sir model as the transmission rate of the sip r model the transmission rate the removal rate and the initial number of susceptible individuals are used to determine the basic reproduction number r 0  we estimate parameters b  1  and  2 so that together they have r 0 as calculated and they satisfy b  1  b and  1   2  in parameter estimation method 2 bounds for the parameters in the sip r model were determined from the literature then using these bounds we estimate the parameters that give the best fit to the data details and references for these bounds are given in the next paragraph and in subsections 31 and 32 for estimation method 2 we make some assumptions regarding the parameters that apply to both the small-and large-scale outbreaks in situations with super-spreading individuals it is assumed that most infected individuals are not super-spreaders which is the case for the spread of sars sars outbreak in singapore 80 of infected individuals infected no one else this leads us to set a lower bound on the probability of becoming a regular infected individual of 08 and we have 08  b  1 for sars after onset of symptoms regular infected individuals stayed out of isolation between 3 and 5 days  3  we assume the average and set  1  14 we assume that on average super-spreading individuals moved into isolation 10 days after they became infectious that is  2  110 finally many researcher have shown that the individual reproduction number r 0  for the sars outbreak is between 15 and 4 1 we assume this region for r 0  which gives a constraint on the parameters  b  1  and  2  we use the sip r model to study the spread of sars at the high rise apartment building amoy gardens block e in hong kong we assume that the cumulative number of confirmed cases of sars in the amoy gardens summarized in table 2 table 2  for parameter estimation method 2 we survey literature to determine appropriate bounds on all of the sip r model equations we assume that the total number of infected individuals at t  0 is 4 as in ching et al  2  we conservatively assume 0    001 the bounds and constraints for each parameter as well as the estimated parameter values are given in table 3  the resulting number of confirmed cases of sars are presented in table 2  we examine the first and third periods only using the sip r model the first time period corresponds to quick spreading of the disease and we show this region has an r 0 value above 1 the third period corresponds to the end of the disease and correspondingly has an r 0 value below 1 in 2003 the hong kong area had a total population of 6803 million people the number of susceptible individuals in hong kong during the sars epidemic is not the entire population the number of susceptible individuals must be approximated katriel formula to estimate the percent of the population that is susceptible during an epidemic the number who are susceptible can be computed using the r 0 value and the percent of the population who became infected riley et al 13  determine the r 0 value specifically for the sars outbreak in hong kong is in the region 22 -37 using this we compute that the number of susceptible individuals falls in the range 18 million -31 million where the smaller population correspond to larger r 0 values we assume a large r 0 value and therefore we use the lower value n  18 million for parameter estimation method 1 we use the parameters determined by fitting the data sets to the classical sir model the fixed and estimated parameters of the sip r model are given in tables 5 and 6  corresponding to time period one and three respectively the resulting number of confirmed cases of sars are presented in table 4  for parameter estimation method 2 we survey literature to determine appropriate bounds on all of the sip r model equations we assume that the total number of infected individuals at t  0 is 1 for time period one corresponding to the index case and 470 for time period three 5  corresponding to the number of confirmed cases on march 29 2003 the bounds and constraints for each parameter as well as the estimated parameter values are given in tables 5 and 6  the resulting number of confirmed cases of sars are presented in table 4  we summarize the infections for each of the data sets and their fitted parameters in table 7  specifically the table contains the total number of individuals who became infected the total number who became infected through contact with a regular infected i and super-spreading individuals p  the total number of regular infected i and super-spreading individuals p  and the individual reproduction numbers for the i and p classes as sir models we have presented a modification of the classical sir disease model that captures the effect of super-spreading individuals on an infectious disease epidemic using an idea from the progression of the sars outbreak we distinguish the regular infected individuals from the superspreading individuals by how long they remain outside of isolation the super-spreading individuals spend longer outside of isolation than most infected individuals the model was fit to data from the sars epidemic using two different parameter estimation methods parameter estimation method 1 used parameters estimated for the classical sir model the resulting parameters show only a slight super-spreading behavior in all cases studied for amoy gardens and the short-term outbreak in hong kong the i and p classes are not distinguished by how long each stays outside of isolation they are also not distinguished by their individual reproduction numbers in each case the two recovery rates are similar to eachother and similar to the recovery rate day   feb 21 mar 17  19  21  29  apr 12  26  may 10  24  jun 6  20  confirmed  1  95  150  203  470  1108  1527  1674  1724  1750  1755  sir  1 table 7  summary of the outbreaks for each of the data sets and their fitted parameters the total number of individuals who became infected the total number who became infected through contact with a regular infected i and super-spreading individuals p  the total number of regular infected i and super-spreading individuals p  and the individual reproduction numbers for the i and p classes as sir models of the sir model estimated parameters it is not surprising therefore that the final number of infected individuals given by the final number of individuals in the removed class in the two models are within just a few individuals the fitted parameters for the long-term outbreak in hong kong using parameter estimation method 1 indicate that regular infected individuals move so quickly into isolation that we can disregard their influence on the disease spread as evidence over the entire course of the disease they collectively only infect a total of 44 individuals due to the incredibly short time spent in the infected class the individual reproductive number in this case is very low though the outbreak in the entire hong kong special administrative region was split into three time periods corresponding to three different disease dynamics the fit parameters do not match the third time period data set as well as one might hope this is noticed for the classical sir model and since the sir parameters are used for estimation method 1 we also see this in the fit parameters for method 1 one possible fix for this problem is to split the third time period into other periods in which the outbreak has common dynamics parameter estimation method 2 used research to set a priori bounds on the parameters of the sip r model in every case the resulting parameters show superspreading behavior for example the two infected classes are distinguished by their individual reproduction rates all three cases show that on average each regular infected individual infects less than 1 other individual while each super-spreading individual infects more than 1 other individual considering the specific case of the outbreak at the amoy gardens apartment complex method 2 predicts that without any other intervention almost all of the residents of block e will become infected in this case both the regular infected and super-spreading individuals have basic reproduction numbers larger than one it is clear from the dire outcome predicted for the residents of the amoy gardens block e super-spreading individuals must be brought into isolation as quickly as possible for the long-term outbreak in hong kong in the third time period the overall individual reproductive number is less than 1 which matches the notion that individuals were taking precautions to protect themselves and the disease spread was slowing down using the sip r model we see that the regular infected individuals do have an individual reproductive number less than 1 however the super-spreading individuals have a reproductive number larger than 1 again we see that it is imperative that the super-spreading individuals be brought into isolation as quickly as possible finally it is evident from the short-term outbreak in hong kong in the first time period that without any control measures the spread of sars in hong kong would have been extreme the model predicts that more than 17 million residents would have been infected over the course of the disease outbreak correspondingly they would have experienced a large disease related mortality the death rate for sars is estimated to be around 10 and so hong kong would have lost an estimated 170000 residents noting that the final death toll in hong kong was though tragic only 299 people the control measures put in place by the government of hong kong saved thousands of lives the sip r model is versatile it can be used to examine an outbreak of any disease known to have super-spreading individuals measles for example see  12  on the other hand the model was built using the idea that super-spreading individuals stay out of isolation longer than regular infected individuals as during the sars epidemic there are documented cases of sars infected individuals violating strict isolation mandates 6  for diseases where the super-spreading behavior is a result of differing transmission rates one should use the kemper model  6  super-spreading individuals for infectious diseases pose a serious threat to public health the sip r model clearly demonstrates that infectious individuals must be removed from interactions with the susceptible individuals as quickly as possible to decrease the seriousness of an infectious disease epidemic  sars unanswered questions catherine zandonella   even as the world health organization declared that severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is coming under control everywhere but in china researchers meeting in new york on saturday said that too little is known about the sars virus to predict what will happen next to gain some clues the scientists looked to other coronaviruses to shed light on the new diseases next move chief among the questions on their minds where did the new virus come from what causes some people to become super spreaders of the virus and how can scientists use years of expertise in developing treatments and vaccines for animal coronaviruses to design therapeutics for sars perhaps if we spend more time studying disease in wildlife we might learn enough to prevent diseases like sars from causing problems in humans said w ian lipkin director of the center for immunopathogenesis and infectious diseases at the mailman school of public health at columbia university lipkin was one of the organizers of saturdays meetingat the new york academy of sciences to trade information on the latest sars research however he addressed the attendees via telephone from home having quarantined himself after developing a fever and cough following his return from china last week in all the coronaviruses which cause a variety of diseases in cows pigs chickens house cats and other animals the spike s glycoprotein is the key protein involved in docking the virus to a cell and infusing the virus into the cell membrane during infection it also elicits an immune response from the body making it an attractive target for a vaccine but coronaviruses are otherwise extremely species-specific-viruses that infect pigs do not tend to infect cows - so finding an animal model for sars could be difficult the two previously known human coronaviruses which cause colds do not have animal models experimentally researchers have been able to mutate the s glycoprotein and cause the coronavirus to jump species but the sequence of the sars virus is so different from those of the three known subfamilies of coronaviruses it doesnt have enough similarity to any known species to have jumped said kathryn v holmes a microbiologist at the university of colorado health sciences center it is much more likely to have evolved separately as to speculation that the virus has already mutated since first appearing in humans holmes said rna viruses mutate at a much higher rate than other viruses but most of the mutant strains dont radically change the behavior of the virus more likely the mutants will serve as epidemiological marks for tracing who gave the virus to whom even so small mutations in animal coronaviruses have led to major changes in how the virus behaves a deletion mutation in the gene coding for the s glycoprotein in a pig virus caused it to shift from colonizing the gastrointestinal tract and causing diarrhea to invading the respiratory tract and causing pneumonia said linda saif an expert on animal coronaviruses at ohio state university in cattle the route of infection can determine the severity of the disease said saif an animal infected via inhaled aerosolized particles sheds virus for a longer period of time and experiences more severe illness than an animal infected via the inhaled droplets spread through close contact the infection dose also determines the duration and amount of shedding of the virus said saif scientists are still unsure how the virus gets deep into the lungs where it causes alveolar damage that can be fatal most cold and flu viruses lodge in the upper respiratory tract including the nose sinuses and throat the sars virus may lodge there and then work its way down or it may diffuse into the bloodstream and reemerge in the lungs if the latter is true then blood levels of virus or titer could be very important in charting the course of the disease no one has yet correlated titer with severity of the disease because samples from patients were not collected in the early days of the outbreak we were too busy dealing with the disease said donald low who treated sars patients at mount sinai hospital in toronto scientists are also still puzzled about why some sars-infected individuals are able to infect tens or hundreds of other people the answer does not lie in the genome said the experts there is no unique genetic sequence for super spreaders said holmes instead super spreaders may be coinfected with another disease that makes them more contagious in cows dual infection with a coronavirus and flu leads to a longer period of shedding and increased fecal shedding as well as prolonged fever and respiratory disease david ho an hiv researcher at the aaron diamond aids research center thinks super spreading is due not just to the spreader but also to something about the immune systems of the people the super spreader infects he thinks the spreading has a strong genetic component why else would everyone in the family succumb he asked scientists hope to use what they know about animal coronaviruses to inform the process of designing therapeutics and vaccines the history of developing a vaccine for coronavirus disease in cats suggests researchers need to proceed with caution warned thomas monath of acambis in that case the vaccine actually helped the virus enter the host cells we must not increase the risk of infection on re-exposure to the virus in the future he and others emphasized the urgent need to find an animal model for the disease until we get species easier to work with than monkeys said monath we wont make much headway he estimated that developing a vaccine would cost 60 to 100 million over five to six years ho reported that china is moving ahead with a number of studies using killed viruses and serum from convalescing patients last week ho went to china to test a strategy of stopping the fusion of the virus into the host cell using peptides that block the virus from entering the cell - a strategy he developed to stop hiv five of the 12 peptides tested had antiviral activity in cell culture ho told the meeting he plans to try the peptides in monkeys next in the end treatment will probably involve both attacking the virus and boosting the immune system of the patient said catherine laughlin of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases existing therapies using a combination of the antiviral drug ribavirin and steroids may actually do more harm than good ribavirin is very toxic and steroidal treatments could actually delay the bodys ability to clear the virus according to studies done with respiratory syncytial virus we have to move very carefully clinically to not exacerbate the disease said laughlin  special issue control of severe acute respiratory syndrome in singapore kwai chan peng  a severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak occurred in singapore from february to may 2003 a high vigilance for the disease frequent and regular temperature monitoring early case identification and isolation of patients as well as tracing and home quarantine of contacts played major roles in controlling the outbreak hospitals were dedicated to the screening and treatment of sars patients within and between hospitals movement by healthcare workers patients and visitors were restricted as was the number of hospital visitors staff education and audits of infection control practices also featured prominently to prevent cross-border transmission incoming travellers from sars affected areas had to complete health declaration cards they as well as all outgoing travellers from singapore were monitored for fever in the meantime the public was urged to refrain from travelling to sars affected regions containment elements targeting the community included school closure public education on good hygiene and readily accessible public information in response to a laboratory acquired sars infection laboratories were audited and directives issued on the mandatory use of biosafety level 3 laboratories for sars virus culture and compliance of laboratory workers to biosafety guidelines  the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak in singapore began in late february 2003 with the return of a traveller from hong kong her stay at a hotel there had coincided with that of a sars-infected medical doctor from guangdong china 1 on 31 may 2003 singapore was removed from the world health organisation who list of countries with local transmission of sars this paper describes the measures taken to control the epidemic an outline of the outbreak is given here to lend perspective to these measures during the outbreak 238 people were infected of whom 33 139 died 2 the disease was primarily transmitted in hospitals in a report on 206 probable sars cases 408 were health care workers hcws 398 were family members friends or visitors to hospitals and 122 were hospital inpatients 3  as shown in fig 1  most of the infections occurred in 3 hospitals fanned by 5 super spreaders who are defined as patients who infected 10 or more other people 1  the first super spreader was the 22 year-old returned traveller from hong kong who was admitted to tan tock seng hospital ttsh where she infected 24 persons 1 3  among these was a 27 year-old nurse who had attended her before being isolated the nurse was admitted to an open ward for 3 days infecting 25 persons one of these was a 53 year-old patient with diabetes and ischaemic heart disease in whom sars was not suspected because of her many medical complications 3  consequently n95 masks were not used by her health caregivers and 27 sars-infected persons were eventually traced to her another patient with diabetes and chronic renal disease on discharge from ttsh was admitted to an open ward in singapore general hospital sgh on march 24 for gastrointestinal bleeding and urinary tract infection like the 53 year-old patient in ttsh his medical problems resulted in atypical sars symptoms his sars infection was unrecognised in spite of his caregivers deliberating on his possibly having sars he spread the infection to 37 hcws patients and visitors this started an outbreak in sgh that resulted in 60 cases his brother who had visited him in sgh was subsequently admitted on 8 april to an open ward of national university hospital nuh for suspected cardiac failure from acute myocardial infarction he was there for less than a day before being transferred to the intensive care unit he was then moved to ttsh when his sars contact history became known by which time he had started a cluster of 15 cases in nuh the control measures taken to contain sars in singapore can be broadly grouped into those in health institutions at checkpoints and in the community a summary of these measures is listed in table 1  due to the health care associated nature of the disease the majority of control measures applied to the health sector these were implemented and modified progressively as the outbreak unfolded super spreader 1 a 22 year-old traveller was admitted to ttsh super spreader 2 a 27 year-old nurse was infected by super spreader 1 super spreader 3 a 53 year-old patient was infected by super spreader 2 super spreader 4 was infected during hospitalisation in ttsh for chronic medical problems he was not recognised as a sars case and after discharge was admitted to another hospital sgh where he started an outbreak super spreader 5 visited his brother super spreader 4 in sgh and was subsequently admitted to nuh where he started a cluster of sars cases  infected case ttsh tan tock seng hospital sgh singapore general hospital nuh national university hospital a containing spread in health institutions i dissemination of information as the number of atypical pneumonia cases increased in singapore and as similar cases in china hong kong and vietnam were reported the ministry of health moh began issuing medical alerts and updated information to all medical practitioners through email and short messaging services urging vigilance for the disease this mode of disseminating information was maintained throughout the outbreak and the medical community was kept abreast of cases and policies and guidelines on patient management one of the pillars of control was early identification of cases and the sars case definitions from who were used besides medical practitioners being alert for cases the public was also urged to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms compatible with sars developed if symptoms onset within 2 weeks of history of travel to sars afflicted areas or if there was close contact with persons with sars rapid laboratory confirmation of infection was a priority to differentiate sars from non-sars patients for isolation contact tracing and epidemiological investigations personnel from diagnostic and research laboratories met regularly to pool knowledge and resources in an effort to cope with the escalated demands for laboratory testing for a novel virus iii mandatory notification of sars in mid-march immediate notification of suspected and probable sars to moh was made mandatory under the infectious disease act for tracing contacts and ring-fencing the source of infection contact tracing was a crucial factor in the containment strategy it limited the spread of infection through identifying exposed individuals those who were ill were referred immediately for medical assessment while those who were asymptomatic were monitored and quarantined speed in tracing contacts of sars patients was of the essence and this was effected through teams set up at moh and hospitals besides contact tracing another crucial component was patient isolation all patients were screened at triage points that were specially set up at hospitals and clinics to separate febrile from afebrile patients where existing facilities did not permit such segregation improvisations were made tents for example that were fully equipped with laboratories x-ray facilities and pharmacies were established outside polyclinics 4 patients fitting the sars case definition were given masks to wear and were isolated immediately in a separate room if available from other patients they were then transported to ttsh using a 24-hour dedicated ambulance service specifically set up for this purpose in all hospitals suspected and probable sars patients were nursed in isolation rooms later other febrile patients were also kept isolated until a diagnosis was made in mid-april after the sgh cluster of sars cases was triggered by the patient with atypical presentation existing inpatients in sgh who developed fever or respiratory symptoms as well as those on steroids and other immunosuppressive therapy were isolated as well as a precautionary measure patients from sgh were discharged only 3 days after the subsidence of fever to confine sars to one hospital and prevent spread to and in others ttsh was designated a sars hospital besides direct admissions of suspected cases it also received hcws and patients from other hospitals who became infected with sars resources were freed up in ttsh for treating probable and suspected sars patients by scaling down specialist outpatient clinic activities cancelling elective surgery and diverting new non-sars patients to other health institutions a dedicated team of hcws who would not perform outpatient or non-sars inpatient tasks was assigned to manage sars patients to further minimise exposure of other hospital staff to sars areas in ttsh where sars patients were managed were cordoned off movement of hcws and patients within and between hospitals was restricted and movement logs of these people and visitors were maintained to facilitate contact tracing should the need arise as it became clear that sars was mainly linked to hospitals the number of visitors was limited to 2 per patient visitors were screened for fever and their contact particulars recent travel history and relationship to the patients recorded for potential contact and epidemiological tracing they were provided with surgical masks to wear and advised to avoid contact with other patients and their belongings with the recognition of a sars cluster in sgh the hospital further restricted visitors to 1 per patient per day from 18 april by 29 april when data showed that about 38 of sars cases were visitors to hospitals all public hospitals implemented a no visitor rule for patients 5 the exception to this was departments treating children or providing obstetric care where 1 visitor per patient was permitted the rule was also relaxed on a case by case basis for seriously ill patients strict infection control measures were implemented to reduce risk of transmission to health care staff in all areas where there was a possibility of exposure to patients with sars staff workers were required to wear personal protective equipment which included n95 masks ie masks that are 95 efficient in filtering particles of 03 m size and above gloves and gowns hand washing or decontamination with alcoholbased hand rubs after each patient contact was emphasized staff education was another element of control it was compulsory for hcws to attend teaching sessions on infection control for sars 6  moh staff conducted audits of hospitals and of general practitioner and traditional chinese medicine clinics for compliance with infection control measures x temperature monitoring at the same time the health status of all hcws was actively monitored through temperature checks initially twice then thrice daily with the first check before starting work for early detection and isolation of affected staff staff workers with fever were not allowed to work but were kept under surveillance either as hospital inpatients or at home via telephone communication xi home quarantine from 17 april patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes chronic lung disease or cardiac renal or hepatic failure were quarantined at home for 10 days after hospital discharge they were required to monitor their temperature twice a day and daily telephone surveillance of their well-being was maintained if unwell they were recalled to the hospital for evaluation 7 a 10-day home quarantine was similarly imposed on hcws patients and visitors exposed to sars patients 6  xii modification of hospital work processes sgh adopted a modular team system of doctors and nurses so that a reserve team of hcws would be available should the active team be exposed to sars another measure adopted was the suspension of elective services to reduce non-critical attendance at the hospital 6 the focus at land sea and air checkpoints was early detection of imported cases incoming travellers from sarsaffected areas and later on all incoming flights were required to complete health declaration forms they were given health advisory cards bearing a hotline number to call should sars symptoms develop their temperature was screened and nurses stationed at the checkpoints would refer febrile and visibly unwell passengers to ttsh for assessment 8 all outgoing travellers from singapore were similarly monitored for fever to prevent exportation of sars meanwhile the public was urged to heed the travel advisory from who and refrain from travelling to sars affected areas c minimising community spread i early detection early detection of cases was facilitated through educating the public and general practitioners on sars via the mass media and government websites each family was issued with a thermometer for monitoring body temperature twice daily and urged to seek immediate medical attention if unwell ii dedicated sars transport sars patients and those suspected to have sars were conveyed to ttsh in dedicated ambulances which were available by calling a hotline number other means of public and private transportation were not allowed iii contact tracing contacts of cases were actively sought those who were sick were referred to ttsh while all other contacts exposed to sars patients were quarantined iv home quarantine additional powers were invoked under the infectious disease act to quarantine all asymptomatic contacts at home for 10 days to minimise their interaction with other people those quarantined were checked daily by telephone and would be referred immediately to ttsh if symptoms of sars appeared logistical problems such as the provision of food and other necessities had to be overcome as a deterrent to defying the quarantine order quarantine breakers if caught were liable to fines or imprisonment or both all schools from play groups to junior colleges childcare centers as well as tuition and recreational classes were closed from 27 march for 3 weeks in addition sports activities and competitions were suspended or cancelled to prevent the congregation of big groups of children during the closure schools were cleaned and ventilated when schools re-opened pupils and visitors had to declare if they had visited other sars affected regions the ministry of education prepared and distributed information packages to students to encourage the practice of good personal hygiene a thermometer was issued to each pupil for daily temperature monitoring and parents were tasked with the responsibility of not sending their sick children to school markets and food centres were cleaned and temperature checks of stallholders and assistants were imposed recognition in the form of certificates was given to shopping centers and hotels that practised good hygiene public education messages were carried by the mass media to promote the practice of respiratory etiquette and frequent hand washing and to discourage spitting in common areas as country after country was pronounced sars-free by who there was concern that sars might re-emerge from a laboratory accident and it did in singapore on 3 september 2003 a graduate student who had been working in a research laboratory where work on sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov was conducted was admitted to sgh for a febrile illness sars was suspected and later confirmed by the virology laboratory 9 this incident did not result in secondary transmission and another outbreak but deserves mention for the additional control measures instituted in the laboratories investigations revealed that the student was infected while working with a west nile virus sample that had been contaminated with sars-cov there were deficiencies in the practice of biosafety in the laboratory and lapses in containing sars the incident triggered audits of other laboratories handling sars-cov ensuing recommendations included mandatory use of biosafety level 3 laboratories for sars virus isolation compliance of laboratory workers to biosafety guidelines restriction of diagnostic testing and research on sars to designated laboratories the maintenance of an inventory of sars samples and viral strains by these laboratories and immediate reporting of laboratory incidents national control of the importation of any sars material will be instituted could the outbreak have been managed better gaps existed one of these was the sub-optimal use of information technology to manage the vast quantity of data generated in the course of contact tracing laboratory investigations quarantining exercise and epidemiological tracking there was also a failure to efficiently transmit instructions for timely and coordinated action among and within hospitals in the initial phase of the outbreak in ttsh the lack of visitor records was an impediment to identification of all contacts 3 this was later rectified in all health facilities the sgh experience has shown that in an outbreak situation where the causative agent is new and little is known about the disease a fever cluster albeit linked to an index patient with atypical presentation should be treated as a manifestation of the outbreak until proven otherwise and all contacts quarantined immediately 4 in both ttsh and sgh had all exposed persons been identified and quarantined quickly the outbreak might have been contained sooner controlling the sars outbreak was a profound learning experience for singapore dealing with a new virus and disease we were dependent on the collective information and experience of other countries that were similarly afflicted we had to respond rapidly to new and unexpected developments sometimes with improvised methods the outbreak in singapore was controlled with the concerted effort of everyone in the country the darkness is put behind us perhaps only for a while we have to remain vigilant for the disease and we hope that the lessons learnt at such cost will prepare us in the event of a re-emergence  topological dynamics of the 2015 south korea mers-cov spread-on-contact networks chang yang hoon hyejin jung   transmission of infectious disease through contact among individuals increases the risk of outbreaks with epidemic potential however understanding how diseases spread over networks of contacts remains a challenge in particular outbreaks of potentially devastating infections such as sars 2003 ebola 20142015 and zika 20152016 have shown that the dynamics behind the spread of disease has become more complex limiting our ability to predict and control epidemics in this regard patterns of disease transmission should be used to design specific public health strategies to enhance sustainable capacity while building activities to improve government responses to infectious diseases therefore an analysis of disease dynamics based on the contact patterns can be used to build practical guidance while framing disease prevention and management strategies the interpersonal contact patterns of disease transmissions have often been discussed in a network context while modelling epidemics14 most potential disease contact takes place in localized communities among individuals occupying a local geographic space around the diseased if such contacts are repeated within a given period certain patterns of links will arise these link patterns can be represented as networks which show the spread of an infection among individuals thus certain disease dynamics represented in a contact network can be characterised by topologies previous studies on super-spreaders have identified two major types of networks small-world network5 and scale-free network6 in the small-world network a small number of shortcuts are discovered either by randomly connecting the nodes or randomly rewiring the links from the shortcuts it can be inferred that the average node length between any two individuals is shortened thereby making geographic distance a causal factor in epidemic outbreaks7 in the small-world network context thus it is important to control the super-spreading events to prevent completely new outbreaks89 in the scale-free network on the other hand the number of contacts per individual exhibits a power-law distribution of infection links the variation in the connectivity distribution of the scale-free network is infinite because it does not exhibit the threshold phenomenon hence an outbreak can occur at any time10 it can be inferred from both networks that the average shortest path length and a small degree of separation are important factors in the epidemic network analysis11 furthermore the super-spreading characteristic of epidemics has been associated with the spatial proximity of neighbouring nodes in the network512 localised transmission of the epidemic is facilitated by high clustering coefficients because of the close spatial proximity in node connectivity and its influence on their relation thus nodes with a high spatial proximity tend to intensify super-spreading events within clusters making it easy for the disease to spread locally over the considered population or areas it is known that three factors can cause a disproportionately large number of secondary contacts during super-spreading events13 host factors including physiological behavioural and immunological factors viral factors including virulence and co-infection factors and environmental factors including density failure to recognise the disease inter-hospital transfers and airflow dynamics among these various factors previous studies have focused specifically on the behaviour of the host and environmental factors in explaining the outbreak of sars and mers1415 it has been established that certain behaviours of the hosts such as doctor shopping visiting multiple doctors and facilities play a critical role in the spread of infectious disease as multiple visits by the super-spreaders can lead to the contamination of several medical facilities in addition to the behaviour of the infected individual a high population density also correlates to a higher number of infections emanating from both the sars and mers hosts because the probability of infection in such a setting tends to be high15 given that the edges in the epidemic network represent physical proximity a high level of clustering implies that infection occurs locally and spreads rapidly16 the 2015 outbreak of the middle east respiratory syndrome mers in south korea has been paid much attention as the outbreak was the first and biggest to occur outside saudi arabia where the disease was identified in 2012 it has been known that the human-to-human transmission of mers-coronavirus cov which is a viral respiratory infection caused by a coronavirus is relatively limited owing to its lower level of contagiousness according to centers for disease control and prevention cdc17 mers is thought to be transmitted through respiratory secretions however the particular way in which the virus spreads is not fully understood during the mers epidemic of 2015 186 people across 16 healthcare facilities were infected of whom 39 lost their lives this biggest outbreak in a relatively short time began with an index patient who had visited the middle east and returned to korea on may 4 the patient sought treatment for respiratory symptoms at several healthcare facilities and was later confirmed to have a mers infection on may 20 by then 31 people had come in contact with the patient including family members patients visitors and hospital staff in one instance of contact a second patient was exposed to mers while sharing an emergency room where the index patient sought care the two patients became super-spreaders assumed to generate many transmission events thus they were likely to initiate infection among the susceptible population our expectation is that super-spreaders are more likely to hold certain structural advantages in facilitating continued transmission this study investigates the spread of infections over networks of contacts among individuals by exploring the 2015 mers outbreak in korea we assume that the spread of a disease in a population depends on both the dynamics of the disease transmission and the structure of the contact networks over which they spread11824 one perspective contends that the hosts who transmit the mers infection are those who are highly central in the contact network thus many neighbouring hosts form relational ties to others vulnerable to infection another perspective argues that if a host has already been infected and other hosts are not yet exposed healthcare facilities play the pertinent role of delivering the infectious virus to other susceptible hosts we analyze structural network properties of the epidemic transmission by examining both the relationship matrix of the infection tracing of infected individuals from-whom-to-whom and the bipartite transmission routes of infected individuals by healthcare facilities visited for treatment in this study we explore two research questions about the mers outbreak in korea a how did the infectious disease become widespread through a network in a relatively short period of time and b how did a small fraction of individual hosts spread the mers virus to a majority of the population the dataset contains records of all 186 people across 43 hospitals who were infected with the mers virus between may 20 and july 4 2015 in korea the data is publicly available on press mentions from the korea centers for disease control  prevention the data includes diagnosis and reporting date sex age at diagnosis source of infection transmission route and stage of mers scholarly papers in various journals and news media also provided current issues of the mers event the use of multiple sources of evidence allows us to validate the research findings in this study the contact patterns coming from marquetoux et al25 are established by tracing the relationship matrix of individuals and hospitals the data for the analysis contains two types of contacts personal and hospital a personal contact is defined as the person-to-person route the format for a personal contact is a daily record for every pair of individual hosts between whom infectious contacts occurred on a given date there is a daily record including the source infector and target individuals infected presented with the spread of the mers infection a hospital contact is defined as a hospital-acquired infection also known as nosocomial infection a contact occurs when an infected individual visits healthcare facilities for a limited time period for mers diagnosis treatment and follow-up visit records each hospital contact corresponds to an actual visit of the individual hosts and includes the date on which the contact event occurred we construct a matrix of contact patterns of individuals and hospitals the number of observations for the personal contacts are 161source n and 31target k and those for the hospital contacts are 186 infected host n and 43hospital k among the 186 confirmed cases including one case confirmed by china the rates of infection were confirmed to be as follows 441 82 cases among in- or out-patients sharing wards with the mers patient 344 64 cases among the hospitalised mers patients cohabiting family members or visitors and 210 39 cases among the healthcare workers or staff employed at the mers-affected hospital26 based on this data we use an adjacency matrix to construct contact networks consisting of all recorded transmission routes of mers infections from may 20 to july 4 in the personal contact network each pair of individuals p is examined to determine whether the infection was passed from a source individual i to a target individual j thus rijp is equal to 1 if there is an infectious contact between individuals i and j the personal contact network is as follows rp  1 if rijp  1 and 0 otherwise in the hospital contact network we first use a two-mode incidence matrix to form individual host-by-hospital contact relations in which rijh  1 if individual host i visited hospital j and rijh  0 otherwise next we construct a bipartite graph consisting of the union of the individual hosts and hospitals as nodes with the edges only connecting individual hosts with hospitals for hospital-acquired infection therefore individual hosts are connected only by co-presence in hospitals and hospitals are connected only by having individual hosts in common thus the exposed contacts through which the infection can spread are represented by the co-presence of two individual hosts in the same hospitals all the data in ms excel network measures and visual displays of disease contact relations are produced using ucinet 627 net-draw28 and vosviewer29 this study examines the 2015 mers outbreak in korea using network analysis tools such as the indicators of centrality egocentric network core-periphery and cut-points first centrality pertains to the nodes as unit of analysis individual host position in a network through specific analysis that is preoccupied with the degree betweenness closeness and eigenvector of the geodesic distances30 then the egocentric network is used to identify the topologies of the contact networks in which single individual hosts are bound with their neighbouring individual hosts to reveal the link between direct contact and the spread of the mers infection31 furthermore the core-periphery structures in a given network can reveal how the infection is transmitted locally or globally through the interaction of the core and periphery32 finally a cut-point approach is used to identify the key hosts whose removal from the network would divide the network into un-connected parts indicating a potential weakness in the network or disruption of the infection transmission flow33 the comprehensive analysis can reveal how a disease contact network can be formed among individuals exposed to nosocomial infections and the impact of the super-spreaders on the prevalence of infectious diseases within a relatively short period every node can be reached from every other node by a small number of steps in a small-world network5 the personal contact network was assumed to have distinct clusters of individual hosts exposed to the path of mers transmission whereas the geodesics among these clusters were small in a given network of personal contacts the overall network density of 0014 implies that only 14 of potential personal connections were actually realized the average path length was 3131 disregarding the directness of relationships and the average clustering coefficient was 0258 which is significantly larger than the value for the corresponding classical random network 1117162  0007 table 1 thus the network was considered to have a small-world property small-world index 1046 with the presence of a small number of highly connected hub hosts scale-free characteristics additionally the distance-based cohesion of 0355 demonstrated a large fragmented network with a relatively weak structural cohesion that is the network would become disconnected if specific hosts who acted as shortcuts between the two clusters removed as shown in fig 1 the relations of infection transmission within the personal contact network are visually displayed by three sub-groups based on k-core regions34 the first group marked in red contains hub infectious hosts 14 1 as well as the high in-degree susceptible hosts 37 39 9 11 12 the second group marked in blue comprises susceptible hosts mainly infected through direct contact with hosts 14 and 1 the third group marked in black includes the most peripheral indirect host infections through interpersonal transmission see supplementary figs 13 for further details in network analysis the nodes are individual hosts and the links between individuals represent interactions that may allow disease transmission the descriptive statistics demonstrate that the average degree of infectious hosts was 1117 which was quite low given that there were 161 other hosts table 2 we see that the range of out-degree was significantly larger than that of the in-degree minimum and maximum and that there was more variability across the hosts in the out-degree than in the in-degree standard deviations and variances the coefficient variations for out-degree and in-degree were 587 and 047 respectively thus the population was more heterogeneous in structural contact positions with regard to out-degree than with regard to in-degree the overall centralization of out-degree was high at 46 and the in-degree centralization was low at 24 of these theoretical maximums we arrived at the conclusion that the network of disease transmission might have been dominated more by key hosts than by various groups of individuals that is the heterogeneity of the number of contacts tended to affect the spread and persistence of infection62535 we sought to investigate the degree centrality of mers contact relations because super-spreaders involved in disease transmission pathways are known for their role in disease dynamics the degree centrality describes the extent to which an individual host may be cohesive to a network of personal contact relations in the degree centrality results table 2 hosts 14 m14 and 1 m1 had higher percentages of out-degree links indicating that they were in direct infectious contact with many other target hosts in the network because each had more than 19 network centrality 46 for 14 and 193 for 1 most other hosts in the network had relatively fewer connections these direct contacts made hosts 1 and 14 more accessible to other hosts generating several transmission chains that led to the infection of the susceptible target population in the network this means that small fractions of highly connected hub hosts acting as potential super-spreaders played a pertinent role in fueling and driving epidemics of infectious diseases infectivity3639 in other words both host 1 the index case the first host infected in a chain of transmission and host 14 secondary case typical infectious host were well-characterised super-spreaders who held prominent structural advantage in facilitating continued transmission of the infection to susceptible hosts in their neighbourhoods by contrast host 37 had a high in-degree and was more at risk of becoming infected through contact with other infectious individuals followed by hosts 39 162 and 179 in other words the more often a host was exposed to a potential threat by way of coming in contact the more vulnerable he or she was to the risks leading to the mers infection vulnerability regarding betweenness centrality which measures the extent to which a particular individual host lies between other hosts in the network the overall network centralization was very low at 035 of the purely centralized network table 2 thus most contacts could be made in this network without the aid of any intermediary despite this structural constraint hosts 16 and 76 along with the typical infectious host 14 provided a spatial link or pathway through which mers was transmitted from the source to the target host populations for instance host 14 who acquired the infection through contact with infectious host 1 infected host 76 and the infection transmission continued to emerge through personal contacts within a population of susceptible hosts without the tie to bridge hosts therefore other susceptible individuals might have been largely isolated from mers infections the closeness centrality indicates the potential independence of a host from the relation of disease contact with closeness hosts 1 and 14 had significant potential to make infectious contacts with the target host because of the shorter paths to transmission possibilities thereby enabling the initial introduction and subsequent spread of mers towards its target population with transitory contacts as a result overall closeness centralization was higher than betweenness centralization this suggests that there were decentralized short-distance disease contact routes with centralised hub hosts however no significant mediation was observed 472 the distributions of in-and out-closenesses could not be computed because the network was weakly connected finally the eigenvector of geodesic distances offers a measure of the diversity of a personal contacts network the results show that host 14 had the highest eigenvector centrality indicating the consistent hub host of infection transmission in the personal contact network which is more central to the main pattern of contact distances among all of the individual hosts degree of inequality was 9918 of the maximum possible table 2 to understand the modular structures of this disease contact matrix egocentric personal contact networks were examined the ego networks of personal contacts consist of both a focal infectious host ego and a set of susceptible hosts alters which received infectious contacts from the ego and a measurement of contact relations among these alters the results showed that host 14 was the infectious individual host having the largest egocentric network and 74 individual hosts had established infectious contacts table 3 among the 74 susceptible hosts in the network of host 14 four were direct person-to-person transmitted infections out of 5402 possible infectious contact relations which confirmed the presence of 007 of all possible contact relations of infection transmission between hosts the results of other infectious hosts also show the very fragmented nature of egocentric contact network relationships thus the spread of the mers infection by hub infectious hosts was more likely in a small-world network where the individual hosts were not tightly connected in local structures see supplementary fig 4 a core-periphery structure based on the density of connections comprises at least a pair of core and periphery blocks the core block has many intra-block connections whereas the peripheral block has relatively few contact density was higher for core-to-core relations 03 each core host contacted on average 30 of the other hosts in the core of this network and tended to transmit the mers infection more densely among themselves representing six identified hosts at a higher risk of infection high out-degree hosts 1 9 and 14 with high in-degree hosts 37 46 and 67 table 4 core hosts were also a source of infection transmission for peripheral hosts 0108 however this relation was significantly looser than the one at the core position core hosts tended not to receive infection from peripheral hosts 0002 this shows that hosts in the core transmitted 54 times as many mers infections to peripheral hosts as peripheral hosts infected core hosts in other words the personal contact clusters at the core position via hub hosts were considered to be very dense local structures where a small number of tightly embedded hosts could cause the mers infection to spread locally in a population additionally a cut-point analysis as an indicator of networks weak spots vulnerable to disruptions in the infection transmission flow was performed to determine the key hosts who could act as brokers among otherwise disconnected personal contact relations in the network around 141 blocks into which cut-points divided the network structure were identified with 17 cut-point hosts hosts 1 3 6 14 15 16 17 36 50 52 76 118 119 123 132 135 and 143 if those 17 hosts were removed from the personal contact relation the network structure would be fragmented into 141 unconnected parts red dots in fig 1 we see that a number of hub infectious hosts with top-ranked centrality were in cut-point positions suggesting that they may have been targeted for control strategies to limit the spread of the mers infection in this population we identified 43 healthcare facilities where patients sought treatment for respiratory symptoms related to the mers infection between the months of may and july 2015 we assumed a probability of the introduction of the mers virus proportional to the daily patient flow of each hospital we then observed the timeline of the mers epidemic as reported by the ministry of health and welfare and calculated the probability of distributions for the time and place of the introduction of mers in korea figure 2a shows the posterior distribution for mers introductions in 16 out of the 43 major healthcare facilities initiating a hospital-acquired outbreak figure 2bc show the generated posterior distribution of the introduction time and place respectively these are indicative of a change in the epidemic spreading behaviour of mers the largest posterior distribution was associated with an introduction of hospital-acquired outbreak in ssc the full name of hospital abbreviations in fig 2 on june 7 2015 and over 60 of infection transmission was more likely to occur between june 6 and 16 the places where mers was most likely to be introduced were ssc and pmh although ssc generated the highest probability of mers transmission between infected and susceptible individuals the earliest outbreak was observed in pmh on may 21 which failed to control mers transmission from the index patient host 1 to other susceptible neighbours as shown in fig 2d the epidemic in most healthcare facilities declined after june 7 because the sudden outbreak of mers produced an epidemic time curve with a sudden onset and a rapid decline the epidemic curve was suggestive of a mixed outbreak pattern in which individual hosts were exposed to the common source or point source over a short time and spread infection to others via ongoing person-to-person contact with an average incubation period of 68 days range 48 days analyzing the contact relationships causing nosocomial infection and identifying the underlying network structure of hospital contact patterns are significant in defining how the nosocomial infection was structurally constructed and how the disease was transmitted we examined network structures representing hospital contact relations weighted by locations of individual hosts and healthcare facilities accordingly the links from infection transmission consisted of two nodes individual hosts and hospitals they visited for mers diagnosis and treatment the exposed contacts through which the infection could spread are represented by the co-presence of two individual hosts in the same hospital the bipartite graph of all pairs of nodes shows that eight healthcare facilities ssc pmh ddh dkh pgh skh hhc and skc were more central than any of the individual hosts on the degree centrality measures table 5 for instance dkh had 14 links to mers infection and transmission whereas hosts 1 and 14 had only four and three links respectively it also shows that ssc was the most central and was followed by pmh ddh and dkh in this order in other words ssc pmh ddh and dkh played key roles in the transmission of mers via individual movements there was more consistency among the healthcare facility scores where ssc pmh ddh and dkh had the highest scores across the centrality measures except in the closeness centrality where ddh and dkh where other 14 peripheral hosts visited and infected respectively were replaced by pgh in which hub host 14 had connection and passed mers to host 118 as the eigenvector shows in this result the largest given to ssc 0996 provided further evidence of the likelihood of increasing the contact event among individual hosts with mers infection possibilities looking at the individual hosts from the bipartite method host 173 who had the highest score compared with that of other hosts visited five healthcare facilities four of which were low-centrality hospitals and one skh was a central hospital it was not as influential as individual hosts such as host 1 who visited two low-centrality hospitals and two central hospitals ssc pmh host 14 who visited just three central hospitals ssc pmh pgh and host 76 who visited one low-centrality hospital and three central hospitals ssc skh skc in this case we might expect infectious hub hosts 1 and 14 along with 76 to have higher centrality scores ie betweenness and closeness than those of other hosts because they made contact with hosts in the majority of both high-and low-centrality healthcare facilities we can see the network as comprising four clusters and these relations were connected by having healthcare facilities in common for instance the 1 to 14 relation had the healthcare facility pmh in common the 14 to 76 relation had ssc in common the 76 to 173 relation had skh in common fig 3 this implies that there was a patterned mers risk for the individual hosts affiliating with these healthcare facilities a core-periphery analysis was conducted to further explore the network structure of hospital contact patterns the result shows a core composed of 96 individual hosts including high out-degree hosts 1 16 and 76 with high in-degree hosts 10 39 46 74 and 107 who were all very likely to come in contact with three healthcare facilities ssc pmh and dkh table 6 in other words the core healthcare facilities were more likely to increase the contact event among individual hosts with mers risk because they were all visited by 96 or more hosts the peripheral hospitals had 37 or fewer partition not shown hosts the remainder of the hosts was grouped into the periphery as both presenting less frequently and having few hospitals in common a considerable number of healthcare facilities were also grouped as peripheral in the sense that they were less visited by infectious hosts and these hosts had little in common on the other hand a host in the core visited either one or more core hospitals or one core hospital and at least three peripheral hospitals for instance nodes that interacted with host 1 were on the core side whereas nodes that were likely to interact with host 14 were unexpectedly located in the same topological area of the periphery host 1 localised in a cluster containing another three healthcare facilities ssc pmh and dkh which were observed to associate with major nosocomial infections see red green and blue dots in fig 3 interestingly the ssc cluster was connected via the shared hub host 1 to a cluster consisting of pmh additionally pgh and hhc were present in the periphery and localised to a host 14 partition of the network yellow dots in fig 3 this implies that based on the idea of the structural equivalence3240 hosts 1 at the core of the network and 14 at the periphery were not structurally equivalent although they were highly connected because they occupied unequal positions or had non-identical relationships with alters the result also shows that core hosts presented themselves less frequently 0016 at peripheral healthcare facilities whereas peripheral hosts presented themselves somewhat more heavily 024 at core hospitals table 6 network analysis tools for exploring the infectious contact network provides a key opportunity to uncover the topologies of the contact networks of individuals in the transmission of mers however the epidemiological topology of the contact network of infectious individuals and healthcare facilities has not until now been systematically investigated in relation to mers this underscores the necessity of understanding the structural properties in contact networks particularly as infection transmission correlates to the super-spreading characteristic of epidemics and the prevalence of nosocomial infection in healthcare facilities the results show that a small number of healthcare facilities where hub infectious hosts tended to visit for a limited time for mers diagnosis and treatment had an excessively certain influence on the early spread of mers throughout the population the mers epidemic was more likely to be associated with the increased probability of contact events among individual hosts and nosocomial infections rapidly increased the proportions of epidemic additionally personal contacts initiated by super-spreaders were considered as potential risk factors for the persistence of the mers infection on networks and contributed to the epidemic onset with high transmissibility in healthcare settings in other words both nosocomial and personal contacts might have played a dominant role in enhancing the risk of the transmission of mers and subsequent infection in healthcare facilities in a relatively short period of time this implies that infection prevention and control policies to limit the spread of diseases should aim at targeted surveillance programs and control strategies by investigating and monitoring the introduction and spread of infectious diseases through contact networks our findings contribute to previous studies in several ways it highlights the role of network analysis tools in analysing the epidemiological topologies of infectious diseases through comprehensive analytical methods it also underscores the need for further research to develop different epidemiological models for a broader understanding of the structural properties of epidemic transmission in addition we reveal that the small-world network with scale-free dynamics is highly relevant to the emergence of complexification of the disease-spreading dynamics and tends to minimise the average path distance over all the pairs of infectious and susceptible individuals finally notwithstanding the relatively high prevalence and probability of person-to-person disease transmission based on the movement and relationships of individuals our results confirmed that mers was often a nosocomial infection based on results we suggest clear implications on strategy-driven interventions to prevent disease transmission first prevention and control efforts should target individuals with the highest likelihood of transmitting the disease our results justify the interventions directed towards investigating and monitoring the introduction and subsequent spread of diseases by highly infectious super-spreaders to mitigate the super-spreading of the mers among people in homes and in communities home care for patients with mild symptoms should be provided under close medical observation after patients and family caregivers must have received appropriate training on personal hygiene basic infection prevention and control measures however patients with worsening conditions should seek prompt medical attention following a monitor of their health status for 14 days after the exposure event4142 secondly our analysis reveals that relatively large tertiary hospitals have higher rates of mers transmission than small community hospitals because in addition to poor disease control facilities they typically have large numbers of patients and visitors who are engaged in doctor shopping4344 therefore it is necessary to put effective quarantine and adequate facility ventilation on the agenda furthermore to improve the response activities of hospital staff in infection prevention and control timely education and training must be provided43 it is also necessary that regardless of the diagnosis healthcare facilities should always share essential information in a timely manner with other facilities at the early stage of the outbreak finally until more is understood about mers the government should provide reliable and timely information to the public and establish an efficient disease-control system as preventive measures against the initial spread of mers despite the comprehensive findings this study has several limitations first it is difficult to control any confounding factors that could influence the study results information such as the determinants of the patients choice of healthcare facilities are frequently not available which can result in bias in the contact network analysis second this study is based on contact network relationships as traced among individual hosts infected by the mers therefore it is necessary for future research to identify and analyse the patients in relation to the different patterns associated with both modes of transmission person-to-person contact transmission and nosocomial infection to provide a more profound insight into how they differ furthermore the study is limited to the mers-infected population in korea therefore the generalisability of findings may be limited we believe that the limitations of this study can be overcome by comparing various epidemiology models that demonstrate the spread of infections with sufficiently large evidence-based datasets  super spreader cohorts and covid-19 patrick esch van  a simple two-cohort sir like model can explain the qualitative behaviour of the logarithmic derivative estimations of the covid-19 epidemic evolution as observed in several countries the model consists of a general population in which the r 0 value is slightly below 1 but in which a super-spreading small subgroup with high r 0  coupled to the general population is contaminating a significant fraction of the population the epidemic starts to slow down when herd immunity is reached in this subgroup the dynamics of this system is quite robust against non-pharmaceutical measures  the covid-19 epidemic dynamics has to be understood in order to have an intelligent policy that optimizes societys well-being without understanding that dynamics one might take measures that are highly ineffective andor place a huge burden on society with a cost-benefit ratio that is far from optimal unfortunately not much high-quality data is available that allows us to test against sophisticated epidemiological models the most important data which describes the propagation of infections is simply not publicly available for most populations  confirmed cases depend strongly on ever changing policies of testing and are potentially severely biased they are very bad proxies to estimate infections hospitalisation entries are also depending on decisions which are different from country to country and may be changing over time the only more or less reliable data are the numbers of dead which are most probably within a factor 2 or 3 from the actual numbers of victims of covid-19 the problem with this proxy is that theres a long delay and a large smoothing in time due to the probability distribution that links the event of being contaminated with dying of the disease the simple sir model suggests that one can obtain an estimate of the    factor by calculating the deconvolved logarithmic derivative of a proxy curve for contamination in a recent paper 3  the logarithmic derivative of the curves of the number of deceased people of different countries has been calculated for countries that have applied different sets of non-pharmaceutical policies and have different climates the behaviour 1  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the

this logarithmic derivative seems to be quite universal independent of the measures taken and of other specific factors the universal curve is a more or less linear decrease of the logarithmic derivative starting around 03 per day and steadily decreasing to a value of about -005 and then remains more or less constant this might be an effect of the policies put in place but it might also be the natural dynamics of the epidemic independent of any policy we re-calculated the same kind of curve here for a few selected european countries we took the data from 1 and we applied a moving 7-day average to have less noisy data and remove weekly cyclic phenomena calculating the logarithmic derivative of the reported deceased cases for some european countries we confirm the behavioural findings of the cited paper we note the extreme similarity between all these curves only italy has a somewhat slower decay but it starts out also around 03 all these curves level off towards the same slightly negative value of about -005 it is also intriguing that the tendency sets in quite a few weeks before one expects to see the effects on the deaths of the lock-down policies put in place in some countries it was the essential point raised in 3  this doesnt necessarily mean that those policies have no effect  it means that the linear decrease is not much affected by those policies we will come to that a more interesting curve to look to is that of brazil brazil is interesting for several reasons the first one is that the country is in the southern hemisphere all seasonal effects should be opposite there the second one is that the policies put in place are quite different from those in europe only very partial lock-downs 2  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is

we notice again the same behaviour however it seems that the constant part is rather slightly positive rather than negative even though the data is noisy and it is not clear if theres still not a slope downward we find again a similar behaviour by analysing for instance the entries in belgian hospitals since march 15 these data were taken from 2 unfortunately there is no data available before this date so the plot is truncated on the left we had to average the entries over a week because there were weekly periodic effects and the daily data was too noisy but if one averages over 7 days and one calculates the logarithmic derivative of the hospital entries one finds again the same universal curve in this paper we try to build a model that displays a similar qualitative behaviour we do not fit that model to any real-world data and we do not pretend at all to 3  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display

covid-19 epidemic we are only exploring a potential mechanism that might explain the universal qualitative behaviour of the logarithmic derivative of observed data by building a very simple model exhibiting a similar qualitative behaviour in the classical sir model there are 3 compartments the susceptible population the infected and contagious population and the recovering and non-susceptiblenoncontagious population in reality we only care about the first two compartments because we want to study the dynamics of contagion not of recovery the sir model models the contagion dynamics with two hypotheses the first is that any member of the i compartment will potentially contaminate  people per day but of these  potential people only a fraction sn 0 is actually susceptible to be infected the second is that each member of i has a probability of  per day to become a member of r that is to say to lose its contagious statute and to be removed from the people concerned in the contagion process essentially it comes down to saying that on average a contagious person is contagious for about 1 days the equations implementing the above hypotheses are as follows the logarithmic derivative of the infected cases or of any proxy that is proportional to the infected cases such as the number of dead equals we recall that r 0 is defined to be and is interpreted as being the average number of people that a contagious person will contaminate over time if the population is naive that is s  n 0  if r 0  1 the illness can start propagating in a naive population in the same vain rt is defined as and is interpreted as being the instantaneous number of people a contagious person will contaminate over time in a population that has already some immunity if r  1 4  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 20 2020  the illness continues to propagate if r  1 the epidemic starts dying out the condition r  1 equals the condition di dt  0 and is the point where the number of contaminated people starts diminishing when the epidemic starts dying out it is not the point where no more new infections are happening but it is the point where herd immunity has been reached if at that point there are still a lot of contagious people they will continue for a while to contaminate others but their numbers will decrease herd immunity is reached when in other words when a fraction 1  1 r 0 of the population got ill in an sir model initially the logarithmic derivative equals    and as the fraction of the susceptible population sn 0 decreases as immunity increases the value evolves towards an asymptotic value between 0 and  when the epidemic ends the logarithmic derivative tends towards a constant at first sight this corresponds exactly to what has been observed for the covid-19 epidemic proxies a steady almost linear decrease from a value around 03 towards a value close to -005 or so followed by a constant value however that would mean that herd immunity has been reached in those populations most preliminary studies seem to indicate that in most countries herd immunity is still far away and only about 10 or so of the population has been removed from the susceptible status in order to try to reconcile the behaviour of the logarithmic derivative which points to herd immunity reached and the low attack rate in the overall population we propose to consider a small super-spreader subgroup in the population we consider a small group which is initially also in a susceptible state and which will also evolve into its own infectious state and end up in a recovering state however we suppose that this small group can infect also a significant amount of people in the general population the index 1 is used for the general population of sizen 0  and the index 2 is used for our super spreader group of size n s  if we were to have two separate groups which do not interact but of which the second group has a much more contaminating behaviour than the first group we would obtain the following set of model equations 5  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in

described by  is of course the same but the first group has a coefficient of daily potential contaminations equal to  1 and the second group has a much higher  2 number of potential daily contaminations it isnt very interesting to study this model because they are simply two independent sir models it becomes more interesting if we introduce the fact that our super spreaders do contaminate also a lot of people from the first group the difference with the previous set of equations resides in the extra term  c i 2  added to  1 i 1 in the first two equations it means that each super spreader in the box i 2  will on average contaminate on top of his colleagues from group 2 potentially also  c people from group 1 per day so people from group 1 can be contaminated by other people from group 1 or from super spreaders from group 2 we propose the following values of the parameters for our first model model 1 which will serve as baseline the size of the population is like the population of belgium with a super spreader cohort of about 50 000 people in the general population r 0     067 which means that the virus doesnt propagate epidemically in the general population however in the spreader cohort r 0  333 and a spreader contaminates 3 people per day in the general population the average time that one is contagious equals t c  1 gamma  67 days we start out with 5 people contaminated in the general population but 50 people in the spreader cohort on day 0 6  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

rather quickly herd immunity and beyond more than 95 of the spreader cohort ends up infected the spreader cohort serves also as a driver for the dynamics in the general population and the general population logarithmic derivative follows the spreader cohort logarithmic derivative the slowdown of the epidemic is slower in the general population than it was in the super spreader cohort because  2 s 2 n s ends up being smaller than  1 s 1 n 0  as such it seems that the epidemic is still keeping on for a long time in the population at the same time the speed of infection slows down significantly after 2 weeks while only 5 of the population is infected which seems low as compared to the estimated necessary herd immunity if one interprets this dynamics in the frame of a simple sir model in the end about 20 of the population will end up having been infected if we increase now  1 to 014 keeping all the rest equal so we bring the general population closer to criticality and we call this model 2 we obtain cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder

general population that will get infected we see that bringing the population close to criticality r 0 close to 1 can significantly increase the amount of people that get infected however lowering  1 instead of increasing it down to 003 from the 01 of the base model will reduce the amount of infected people only moderately we will obtain about 10  of the people infected in order to reduce  1 from 1 down to 003 takes a significant effort for a non-proportional gain in infected people reducing the coupling  c from 30 down to 10 will have a larger effect on the people involved only 77  gets infected trying to reduce the self-infection rate in the super spreaders bringing  2 down from 05 to 03 will not reduce the end result much in the general population but will spread out the epidemic

16  infected cases but everything is much more spread out in time let us look at a case where the illness is epidemic in the general population be it at a very low level that is to say let us consider an r 0 slightly above 1 we put  1 at 02 so slightly larger than  which is 015 which gives us an r 0 value of 133 herd immunity corresponds to 25 of the population we also diminish the coupling of our super spreaders to the general population to a much lower value by putting  c to 05 we call this model 4  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity as we can see the behaviour is still very similar to the behaviour of the base model however this time the logarithmic derivative remains a very long time slightly above 0 it is remarkable that even with a very slight coupling between the super spreaders and the general population the initial logarithmic derivative of the general population is still dominated by the influence of the super spreaders with a simple coupled model of a small super spreader population within a general population we can obtain the qualitative characteristics of the a priori puzzling evolution of the logarithmic derivative of proxies of the covid-19 epidemic evolution as found in several countries indeed the dynamics of this epidemic seems paradoxical at first sight when interpreted in the frame of a simple sir model the very high apparent r 0 derived from the extremely fast doubling times of the epidemic would hint at a huge peak and a necessary herd immunity which would be above 60 of the population given the cfr of the order of 1 that has lead to predictions of large numbers of death but the epidemic seems to have a quickly diminishing logarithmic derivative of most of its proxies be it hospital admissions or deceased patients while at the same time absolutely not reaching anything near herd immunity of course one may think that this is due to the policies put into place but the differences in policies put in place and the universality of this observed dynamics may raise questions as to the influence of these policies versus the dynamics of this epidemic the coupling between a super spreader group that does reach herd immunity and the larger population can qualitatively explain such a phenomenon if the covid-19 10  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 20 2020  dynamics has such a kind of phenomenon as a basis then the dynamics seems to be quite independent of any non-pharmaceutical measures taken the model calculations show that even if the policies do have influences on the  parameters these influences dont modify strongly the overall behaviour if the overall population had already an r 0 significantly smaller than 1 then all policies decreasing this value even further dont have much effect on the outcome it is only if the initial r 0 is very close to 1 that they might have a effect if measures diminish the coupling  c between the overall population and the super spreader cohort then the effect will be significant though finally if the measures diminish  2 in the spreader cohort this will only spread out the whole dynamics in time but it will not affect much the end result this may explain why there seems to be a universal behaviour to the epidemic quite insensitive to specific policies that try to diminish the  factors without having a very strong effect on  c  the only parameter that seems to have a proportional influence on the outcome the coupled dynamics of a super spreader cohort within a general population that isnt critical is quite robust against non-pharmaceutical measures but even in a general population that is slightly critical a small group of super spreaders will dominate the behaviour in the beginning of the epidemic the only difference is that the value of the logarithmic derivative is slightly positive after a while instead of taking on a negative value it might be that brazil is in this case the model of a population in which the disease cannot propagate epidemically or would give rise to a very slightly propagating epidemic with an r 0 value near one in which a strongly coupled but small super spreader cohort is present in which the disease is strongly epidemic large r 0 value in that group will have a robust dynamics that resembles the one observed of the covid-19 pandemic displaying a very high initial logarithmic derivatives decreasing steadily towards a small value this dynamics is quite robust against non-pharmaceutical measures that modify the individual  values of this model  super-spreaders in infectious diseases richard stein a   many early studies on infectious disease epidemiology assumed that susceptible hosts within a population had equal chances of becoming infected1 subsequent observations unveiled marked heterogeneities in pathogen transmission with some individuals exhibiting a higher ability to infect others in what became known as the 2080 rule a concept documented by observational and modeling studies and having profound implications for infection control 20 of the individuals within any given population are thought to contribute at least 80 to the transmission potential of a pathogen2 and many hostpathogen interactions were found to follow this empirical rule a fundamental epidemiological parameter used to characterize infectious disease outbreaks at the population level is the basic reproductive number r
0 which expresses the mean number of secondary infections generated during the entire infectious period of an infected individual while r
0 is valuable in assessing outbreak severity and its benefits in guiding public health interventions cannot be overemphasized3 4 this population estimate as recently pointed out could obscure inter-individual variations in infectiousness that were described for many infectious diseases5 in addition to population-wide measures of pathogen transmission estimates of inter-individual variability should therefore be incorporated into analyses describing hostpathogen dynamics the minority of individuals who infect disproportionately more susceptible contacts as compared to most individuals who infect few or no others became known as super-spreaders and their existence is deeply rooted in history between 1900 and 1907 typhoid mary infected 51 individuals three of whom died even though she only had an asymptomatic infection6
 super-spreaders were described for many infectious diseases in 1992 41 of the 97 contacts of an index person with cavitary tuberculosis from a minnesota bar tested positive and 14 14 developed active tuberculosis despite the fact that only 12 of infectious patients close contacts normally develop tuberculosis7 this super-spreader alone contributed with 35 of all new active tuberculosis cases from minneapolis during 1992 in july 1998 a 9-year-old child from north dakota whose female guardian had been diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis was found to have bilateral cavitary infection and 56 20 of his school contacts had a positive tuberculin skin test and were presumed infected nevertheless his twin brother had a mild case and was not infectious8 this is even more remarkable considering that children with tuberculosis have few bacilli in their lesions often do not produce sputum and rarely have communicable disease9 10 11 in 1989 at a high school in finland one student infected 22 others with measles even though eight of the contacts were vaccinated one of them twice12 and during the 1995 ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak from kikwit the democratic republic of the congo13 two individuals both exhibiting gastrointestinal hemorrhage probably represented the source of infection for over 50 secondary cases several studies found increased urethral hiv shedding in individuals co-infected with other sexually transmitted pathogens for example an eight-fold higher hiv shedding was reported in men with urethritis as compared to men without urethritis having similar circulatory viral burdens and in men with gonorrhea hiv shedding decreased subsequent to antibiotic treatment14 15 16 a heterosexual man co-infected with hiv hepatitis c virus and herpes simplex 2 virus had unusually high semen hiv rna levels which exceeded plasma levels by one order of magnitude and were explained by recurrent asymptomatic herpes infections17 maternal herpes virus infection was associated with increased perinatal and intrapartum hiv transmission18 19 and herpes virus suppressive therapy was shown to reduce hiv shedding in dually infected women20
 the concept of super-spreaders re-surfaced in the context of another recent infectious disease during the 20022003 sars outbreaks not all patients harboring the virus were equally infectious the majority had very low infectivity and super-spreading events represented one of the most particular features of this outbreak21 a stochastic model that analyzed 1512 patients from the first 10 weeks of the hong kong sars pandemic22 showed that the virus was moderately transmissible with 27 secondary infections for every index case when excluding super-spreading events a similar modeling of the singapore outbreak23 revealed that in a fully susceptible population that has not yet implemented infection control an individual would infect approximately three secondary contacts in fact among the first 201 probable sars patients in singapore 81 had no evidence of infecting others but five individuals infected 10 or more secondary contacts each23 24 by using mathematical and statistical analyses li et al found that approximately 71 and 75 of the infections from hong kong and singapore respectively were attributable to super-spreader events and suggested that delaying hospital admission more than 4 days after the onset of symptoms could partly be responsible for super-spreading events underscoring the importance of early diagnosis and isolation21
 the analysis of a transmission chain early during the beijing sars outbreak revealed that from 77 patients examined 66 did not infect others and seven infected three individuals or fewer each but four patients infected eight or more contacts each and were considered super-spreaders25 this study revealed that high numbers of close contacts represent a risk factor for super-spreading events25 another risk factor for super-spreading events emerges from the report of a 54-year-old male who presented on april 15 to pingjin hospital in china seeking treatment for coronary heart disease type ii diabetes and chronic renal failure26 subsequent to his admission the same day the patient developed fever myalgia and a sore throat and a physician later suspected sars based on previous contact with a sars patient in another hospital on april 17 the patient was transferred to the tianjin thorax disease hospital and received treatment for two days and on april 19 he was again transferred to the tianjin infectious disease hospital where he died only in pingjin hospital this patient directly infected 33 others implementing active surveillance limiting inter-hospital transfers and quarantining patients who could have been exposed emerge as important lessons from this experience at least two super-spreading events were described in hong kong21 in the prince of wales hospital the index patient was a 26-year-old man admitted on march 4 2003 who as part of his right upper lobe pneumonia treatment was administered bronchodilators via a nebulizer together with overcrowding and an outdated ventilation system this is thought to have facilitated the spread of the virus within the next two weeks 156 individuals including hospital staff patients and visitors were admitted to the hospital all of them traceable to this patient and sars was diagnosed in 138 of them27 28 29
 the index patient in the second super-spreader outbreak was an individual on hemodialysis for chronic renal failure who had diarrhea and on two occasions stayed with his brother in block e in the amoy gardens residential complex30 31 amoy gardens has 19 residential blocks with eight apartments on each of the 33 floors31 in several bathrooms from block e it was reported that the u-shaped traps linking the vertical drainage pipes known as risers to the sanitary fixtures did not function properly as a result when water flowed down the backflow from the risers was able to generate aerosols and spread pathogens into individual bathrooms in addition powerful window fans installed by residents in many bathrooms created a significant negative pressure that amplified the aerosol backflow in the amoy gardens complex outbreak 329 individuals were infected and 42 died32 the cases occurred in clusters at specific floor levels in a pattern that simple person-to-person transmission could not explain and an epidemiological investigation proposed as a plausible explanation a common source of exposure for all infected individuals33 approximately 45 of the infections occurred in block e the same block that the index patient visited and approximately 60 were within flats 7 and 8 bordering the specific vertical riser thought to be involved an investigation found that the index patient had very high concentrations of virus in the urine and feces and proposed that aerosolization as a result of the hydraulic effect inside drainage pipes facilitated the spread of the pathogen32 this outbreak revealed the importance of taking indoor air quality and building ventilation into account when exploring the dynamics of airborne pathogens it was in addition suggested that in certain individuals immune system defects could increase the viral load and make them become super-spreaders as could have happened with the index patient who was undergoing hemodialysis which is known to impair both innate and adaptive immunity27 34
 an interesting observation came from the vietnam outbreak when on march 12 2003 the vietnam french hospital in hanoi was closed for new admissions and 33 patients were admitted to another hospital until may 2 no nosocomial infections were reported in the second hospital and none of its healthcare workers became ill with a condition that resembled sars35 revealing that in the absence of super-spreading events most patients do not infect others super-spreaders are not limited to humans capparelli and collaborators36 examined water buffaloes from an area in italy endemic for brucellosis and found that while most infected animals shed brucella abortus at low levels in their milk a few animals shed large numbers of bacteria kilpatrick et al37 showed that mosquitoes infected with west nile virus feed on american robins turdus migratorius a species that represented 4 of the avian abundance approximately 17 times more frequently than expected by chance revealing strong heterogeneities that exist in the transmission of this pathogen in a study that examined sin nombre virus transmission among deer mice which usually requires direct contact such as biting or scratching clay et al described significant heterogeneities in the contact frequency and contact length between hosts and showed that a small percentage of animals controls most transmission events38 a cross-sectional survey conducted on 474 scottish cattle farms by matthews et al39 unveiled marked differences in infectiousness with approximately 20 of the most infectious animals being responsible for approximately 80 of the transmission and showed that interventions targeted to the 5 most infectious individuals could reduce r
0 to values lower than 1 fecal sample analysis conducted at a uk abattoir revealed that approximately 9 of the cattle examined over a 9-week period were high escherichia coli o157 shedders 104 cfug and they accounted for over 96 of the bacteria shed by all animals tested40 and a survey of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium fecal shedding by mice identified a subset of animals that shed high numbers of bacteria 108 cfug a phenotype linked to the presence of two bacterial virulence determinants the spi1 and spi2 pathogenicity islands41
 it is still unclear why certain individuals infect disproportionately large numbers of secondary contacts increased strain virulence higher pathogen shedding and differences in the hostpathogen relationship were advanced as potential explanations13 42 an interesting observation comes from the 2003 hong kong outbreak where a runny nose unusual for sars was described in a super-spreader fueling the hypothesis that patients with slightly different symptoms perhaps as a result of co-infection with another microorganism could become super-spreaders43 in 1960 eichenwald and collaborators described cloud babies  infants who in nurseries after infection with a respiratory virus became highly contagious and were able to spread staphylococcus aureus they were colonized with44 and the same phenomenon was more recently described in adults45 in early 1983 a nurse colonized intranasally with s aureus was linked to staphylococcal skin infection outbreaks in two nurseries from two different florida hospitals it was subsequently revealed that during each of the two outbreaks she had an upper respiratory tract infection and phage typing confirmed the identity between the strain she was colonized with and the ones causing the outbreaks46 a physician colonized intranasally with s aureus exhibited a 40-fold increased airborne dispersal after acquiring an upper respiratory rhinovirus infection becoming thus a cloud adult47 and a study that examined volunteers with s aureus nasal carriage revealed on average a two-fold increase in bacterial dispersion into the air after rhinovirus infection with up to 34-fold higher dispersion observed in one volunteer48 this process is mechanistically insufficiently understood and one scenario that was proposed is that rhinovirus-induced swelling of the nasal turbinates could create a high-speed airflow that establishes aerosols47
 the observation that sterile clothing but not a sterile mask often reduces s aureus airborne dispersal in rhinovirus-infected individuals pointed towards a possible initial effect that rhinoviruses exert locally followed by the subsequent colonization of the skin and clothing which could serve as reservoirs and subsequently amplify the airborne dissemination of staphylococci48 49 bischoff et al proposed that sneezing contributes to pathogen dispersal and several groups of individuals including those with respiratory allergies could thus become potential sources of airborne bacteria50
 two major questions surrounding super-spreaders persist as important gaps in our knowledge and the answers have fundamental public health implications what makes certain hosts become super-spreaders and how can we identify them in a timely manner models that do not take into consideration transmission heterogeneity and super-spreading events will inaccurately portray pathogen dynamics and hinder the successful implementation of infection control strategies1 on the other hand identifying the 20 of the hosts that are super-spreaders would enable control over approximately 80 of the pathogen transmission events in the population as it is apparent from the examples presented above each outbreak offers specific insights into factors that might shape super-spreading events it is imperative to explore all facets of host and pathogen biology as well as environmental factors that might shape their interaction and analyze the observations provided by previous outbreaks table 1
 all these examples are becoming fundamental teachings that have valuable practical applications in managing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and in developing robust pandemic preparedness plans

 from may to july 2015 a large outbreak of mers-cov infection occurred in south korea from a traveller returning from the middle east which led to 186 confirmed cases patient 1 to patient 186 in the country10 patient 1 was diagnosed at our hospital samsung medical center seoul south korea after transmitting the virus at several health-care facilities before he came to our hospital patient 14 was exposed to patient 1 outside the hospital and sought additional care at our hospital without knowing he was infected with mers-cov therefore we experienced both south koreas first mers-cov case and the case of highest transmission of mers-cov following a single patient exposure in an emergency room we aimed to investigate the epidemiology of mers-cov infection in a crowded emergency room outside of the middle east and the presence of multiple super-spreaders in may 2015 two patients with mers-cov infection patient 1 and patient 14 sought care in our emergency room at the samsung medical center without knowing they were infected with mers-cov while these patients were in the emergency room a large number of patients visitors and health-care workers were exposed during both events 
research in context
evidence before this study
little information on nosocomial outbreaks caused by middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov outside the middle east had been available before the large mers-cov outbreak in south korea in 2015 for which global alert was issued we searched pubmed for reports published in english from may 1 2015 to dec 31 2015 using the terms mers-cov and korea we identified 38 reports none of which provided detailed description for the contact investigation of massive transmission of mers-cov from a super-spreader in an overcrowded emergency room setting
added value of this study
to our knowledge this study is the first to categorise exposed patients into groups according to the type of exposure and to document group-specific incubation periods and attack rates furthermore this study provides detailed epidemiological data including a floor plan of the emergency room to understand how mers-cov spread by a single super-spreader through several modes of transmission
implications of all the available evidence
results from our contact investigation showed increased transmission potential of mers-cov from a single spreader as has been documented in the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic the potential for similar outbreaks anywhere in the world should be noted as long as mers-cov transmission continues in the middle east our study provides evidence that hospitals laboratories and governmental agencies should be prepared for mers-cov infection
 when mers-cov infection was suspected in patient 1 and patient 14 contact investigation was immediately initiated since no one developed mers among contacts who were exposed to patient 1 only contacts of patient 14 are reported here we identified from electronic medical record review and security video footage all patients who had been in the emergency room with patient 14 as contacts regardless of the location and duration of exposure we categorised patient contacts into three groups on the basis of their maximum exposure patients who were in the same zone in the emergency room group a considered close contacts those who were in different zones but had time overlap with patient 14 in the registration area or radiology suite 30 min before and 2 h after group b and those who were in different zones group c patients who were admitted to hospital for treatment of their primary illness after exposure in the emergency room were quarantined in private rooms for 14 days from the last exposure or discharged home after treatment was finished and continued isolation at home patients and their family members who were already discharged home were reached by telephone informed about possible mers-cov exposure and provided with hotline numbers for any inquiries health-care workers who were exposed were identified through interviews and review of employees duty schedules electronic signature on medical records of patient 14 and patient contacts security video footage and self-report health-care workers who provided direct care to patient 14 were initially considered close contacts and were placed into quarantine at home for 14 days from the last day of exposure other health-care workers who worked in the emergency room during the same time period continued to work with monitoring and were removed immediately from duty if symptoms developed a confirmed case was defined as a person with laboratory confirmation of mers-cov infection from sputum samples initially by real-time rt-pcr testing with amplification targeting the upstream e region upe and then confirmed by subsequent amplification of open reading frame 1a orf1a using powerchek mers real-time pcr kits kogene biotech seoul korea patients demographic information underlying disease dates of emergency room visit duration of stay with exact arrival and departure times and location within the emergency room were collected if radiographic examinations were done the time of examination was collected for health-care workers age sex occupation history of patient assignments and working or visiting zone and dates and time of duty or emergency room visits were collected the attack rate was calculated by dividing the number of confirmed cases by the total number of exposed individuals in the emergency room in each group because the total list of visitors was unavailable we estimated the number of visitors who were in the emergency room by assuming that one patient had at least one visitor during their stay we also simulated the scenarios of two and four visitors per patient to avoid underestimation we chose the assumption of one visitor per patient which would give the highest attack rate among the scenarios the incubation period was defined as the time of first exposure to the onset of clinical symptoms of mers-cov infections categorical variables were presented with frequency percentage and continuous variables were summarised with median range iqr we calculated overall comparison of attack rates across the groups with 2 test and across zones with fishers exact test incubation period and exposure time were compared among groups with kruskal-wallis test followed by tukeys test using ranks for multiple comparisons to assess the risk factors for mers-cov infection among all patient contacts we did a multiple logistic regression analysis based on likelihood ratio by regressing on age sex underlying disease and groups in a subgroup analysis of patients in group a the length of stay in the same zone and location were included for these analyses odds ratios and 95 cis were reported p values and 95 cis were adjusted with bonferronis correction for multiple comparisons if necessary two-sided p values of less than 005 were considered significant we used sas version 94 and graphpad prism version 604 for statistical analyses samsung medical center is a modern 1982-bed university-affiliated tertiary hospital providing referral care in south korea total population roughly 50 million with roughly 9000 staff including more than 1400 physicians and 2600 nurses the emergency room entrance is located on the ground floor near the south gate of the main hospital building more than 200 patients are seen in the emergency room each day the average duration of stay in the emergency room was 15 h before the mers-cov outbreak see appendix p 2 for details on emergency room overcrowding index the emergency room has seven patient care areas including zones i to iv for adults a trauma zone a resuscitation room and a paediatric zone figure 1
 the paediatric zone and zone iv are separated from the rest of the main areas two negative-pressure rooms are located in the paediatric zone and two are in zone iv the emergency room has its own radiology suite for emergency room patients only the sizes of each zone were as follows zone i 1217 m2 zone ii 642 m2 zone iii 1683 m2 and zone iv 2239 m2 zones i and ii included seating areas 50 chairs in zone i and 26 chairs in zone ii where stable patients received treatment and waited for test results seriously ill patients who required close observation and needed a designated bed were moved to zone iii 17 beds or zone iv 23 beds zone iv was used for patients being admitted beds in zones iii and iv were spaced roughly 18 m apart with curtains in between nurses were assigned to work in designated zones whereas physicians and transfer agents took care of patients in several zones all zones in the emergency room were covered by the same air handling units there was no funding source for this study the corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication on may 20 2015 south koreas first case of mers was diagnosed in a 68-year-old man patient 1 in samsung medical center appendix p 3 although he denied travel history to saudi arabia he had actually travelled to bahrain united arab emirates saudi arabia and qatar between april 18 and may 3 on may 11 he developed fever and cough and visited three health-care facilities from may 12 to may 17 he visited the emergency room at samsung medical center on both may 17 and may 18 because of increasing symptoms he stayed in zone ii for 4 h on may 17 and in zone i for 5 h on may 18 before placement into isolation 285 patients and 193 health-care workers were exposed to patient 1 but no transmission occurred in our hospital however it was later found that patient 1 transmitted mers-cov to 28 individuals in health-care facilities he had visited before coming to our hospital10 patient 14 was one of the patients who contracted mers-cov from patient 1 at another hospital and subsequently sought care in our emergency room without knowing about mers-cov exposure the 14th patient with confirmed mers in south korea patient 14 was a 35-year-old man who was initially treated for community-acquired pneumonia at another hospital where patient 1 had also been admitted from may 15 to may 17 patient 14 stayed in the same ward with patient 1 patient 14 was discharged from the first hospital with improvement on may 20 after antibiotic treatment on may 21 he was readmitted to the first hospital because of fever and was cared for 5 days until may 25 when he moved to another hospital second hospital because of deteriorating respiratory symptoms eventually he left the second hospital and came to the emergency room at samsung medical center on may 27 he had not yet received notification about his exposure to mers-cov during his previous stay in the first hospital upon arrival at our emergency room he denied having travel history to the middle east and any possible exposure to people infected with mers-cov he was treated for possible bacterial pneumonia on the basis of partial improvement from previous antibiotic treatment and increased c-reactive protein concentration of 130 mgdl normal 03 mgdl appendix p 4 during his stay in the emergency room he was provided with a mask but frequently could not hold it because of severe respiratory symptoms he was not isolated in a separate room a negative-pressure room was not considered at that time as his dyspnoea aggravated on may 28 supplemental oxygen was administered at 2 l per min via a nasal cannula up to 5 l per min however no aerosol-producing procedures including nebuliser treatments were given on the night of may 29 he received a notification call from the health authorities about possible exposure to patient 1 notified our hospital and was immediately transferred from the emergency room to isolation in a negative-pressure isolation room mers-cov infection was confirmed on may 30 and he was transferred to the nationally designated health-care facility from may 27 to may 29 he stayed in three zones in our emergency room zone ii for roughly 10 h on may 27 zone iii for 19 h from may 27 to may 28 and zone iv for 25 h from may 28 to may 29 figure 1 additionally from may 27 to may 29 he went to the radiology suites four times on may 27 he walked around and outside the emergency room and went to the toilet several times because of diarrhoea between may 27 and may 29 2015 the average ventilation rate in the emergency room was maintained at three air changes per h taking 2 h to remove airborne contaminant with a 999 efficiency11 the median temperature was 238c range 144322 and the median relative humidity was 329 range 271368 675 patients 117 in group a 58 in group b and 500 in group c an estimated 683 visitors and 218 health-care workers were identified as contacts of patient 14 table 1
 we assumed that each patient had one visitor and added eight extra visitors five to group a and three to group c because two or more visitors were confirmed with mers-cov infection per patient from may 30 to june 23 82 cases 33 40 patients 41 50 visitors and eight 10 health-care workers of mers-cov infection were confirmed after exposure between may 27 and may 29 demographic and epidemiological data of all contacts and individuals with confirmed mers-cov infection are shown in table 1 the epidemic curve of this emergency room-associated outbreak is shown in figure 2
 the incubation period was determined from 73 confirmed mers-cov cases six cases were excluded because we could not determine the date of symptom onset and data were not available from three visitors the median incubation period was 7 days range 217 iqr 510 among 59 patients and visitors in groups ac excluding six who were not initially identified as contacts the median incubation period was significantly shorter in group a than in group c figure 2 excluding three patients with confirmed mers-cov infection who were not identified in the initial patient contact investigation appendix p 5 the overall attack rate for patients in the emergency room was 4 30 of 675 patients in group a had the highest attack rate 20 23 of 117 compared with 5 three of 58 in group b and 1 four of 500 in group c figure 3
 after adjusting for age sex underlying disease and groups patients in group a had the highest risk for mers-cov infection table 2
 in group b all three patients who had mers-cov infection had time overlap in the radiology suite with patient 14 the median exposure time for patients in group a to patient 14 was 30 h in zone ii range 05103 iqr 1945 139 h in zone iii 06189 63184 and 174 h in zone iv 02232 92214 the attack rates were 23 13 of 57 in zone ii 32 seven of 22 in zone iii and 8 three of 38 in zone iv figure 3 after adjusting for age sex underlying disease and exposure time staying in zone ii was associated with a significantly higher risk for mers-cov infection than staying in zone iv table 2 mers-cov transmission occurred in zone iii despite the fact that the distance from patient 14s bed to the beds of other patients were as far as 6 m figure 4
 in zone iv patient 14 moved from bed 12 to bed 23 and six additional cases were documented in patients and visitors occupying beds in the middle of this zone which were not adjacent to patient 14s bed no mers-cov infection was reported in patients and visitors who had been in the emergency room on may 29 during the time period when they were exposed only to zones ii n81 or iii n15 while patient 14 was confined to zone iv these patients were exposed to areas that were potentially environmentally contaminated but not to patient 14 himself figure 4 under the assumption of one visitor per patient and excluding three visitors with confirmed mers-cov infection who were not identified in the initial visitor contact investigation appendix p 5 the overall attack rate for visitors was 6 38 of 683 the attack rates for patients and visitors were 20 47 of 239 in group a 5 six of 116 in group b and 2 15 of 1003 in group c under the assumptions of two visitors per patient and four visitors per patient the overall attack rates for visitors were 3 and 1 respectively 218 health-care worker contacts were identified and five 2 developed mers-cov infection three health-care workers who were not initially identified as contacts one security guard one physician and one patient transfer agent developed mers-cov infection although they were not involved in the direct care for patient 14 they visited the emergency room between may 27 and may 29 only close contacts were furloughed and other health-care workers were isolated when they developed symptoms there were no secondary cases from health-care workers among contacts during the their duty hours we did a contact investigation of the mers outbreak at the samsung medical center by grouping exposed individuals on the basis of the extent of exposure to patients 1 and 14 to our knowledge we are the first to document group-specific incubation periods and attack rates our results showed the increased transmission potential of mers-cov from a single patient in an overcrowded emergency room setting overcrowding is an important issue for this outbreak and is also a common feature of modern medicine this study is unique because the index exposure occurred in a large emergency room in a tertiary-care centre with electronic medical record information available to track the location and duration of exposure thus enabling near-complete tracing of exposed contacts the classic definitions of close contact as being within roughly 6 feet 18 m or within the same room or care area for a prolonged period of time were difficult to apply to an emergency room setting with high patient volumes ongoing traffic within the emergency room and to and from the radiology suite and large numbers of visitors and family members we considered all patients who visited the emergency room during the stay of patients 1 and 14 as exposed contacts developed criteria for close contacts by expanding on the definitions of the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc12 and categorised patients into different groups therefore we could establish group-specific viral incubation periods and attack rates during the outbreak in close contacts who stayed in the same zone the incubation period was shorter and attack rate was higher than patients who stayed in different zones additionally in zones iii and iv patients were infected even when they were separated by curtains most of the time and were apart as far as 6 m for beds on either side of the nurses station figure 4 similar to the sars outbreak we observed so-called super-spreaders among patients with mers-cov infection and these super-spreaders can cause large outbreaks through several modes of transmission similar to those in the sars outbreak13 among patients who stayed in various locations those who overlapped with patient 14 at the radiology suite or registration area had higher attack rates 5 than the rest of the patients 1 suggesting that transmission might occur by even brief exposures to recently contaminated objects or encounters with individuals carrying a super-spreader comparisons of environmental exposure and patient exposure also revealed unique findings no patient developed mers-cov infection after exposure on may 29 only to the environment that had been potentially contaminated on may 27 zone ii and may 28 zone iii while patient 14 was confined to zone iv on may 29 it is plausible that even if the environment was heavily contaminated by a super-spreader the virus might not persist long enough in the environment to be capable of causing any new infection although patient exposure is clearly the most important factor in the spread of mers-cov more research is needed to address the potential of environmental spread14
 increased viral load and larger amounts of respiratory secretions have been suggested as the factors for sars-cov super-spreaders15 16 in this mers outbreak frequent ambulation of the index case could be considered as one factor related to high levels of viral transmission in addition to large amounts of respiratory secretions and high viral load cycle thresholds 186 for upe and 193 for orf1a from patient 1s sputum17 and 162 for upe and 199 for orf1a from patient 14s sputum of note patient 1 infected 28 patients in another hospital but caused no confirmed secondary cases in our hospital whereas patient 14 caused an additional 82 cases in our hospital the difference of transmissibility between these two individuals could be caused by a combination of factors such as the time from onset of disease clinical symptoms duration of contact exposure pattern of behaviour inside and near the emergency room and kinetics of viral shedding we showed that obtaining a travel history from patients is an important element of history taking by all physicians and not only those specialising in infectious diseases or those working in infection control suspicion for unusual infections should be maintained if patients do not or cannot report accurate histories readiness of laboratory support is essential for initial investigation and for control of outbreaks and overly rigorous requirements for laboratory testing have the potential to delay diagnosis and further spread disease hospital leadership needs to lead in preparedness for disaster management of high-risk communicable infectious diseases emergency preparedness at a national level and communication and support from government agencies are imperative to prevent and control any serious outbreak the results of this study need to be interpreted with caution because the study was not sufficiently powered to study risk factors for transmission some of our data were collected retrospectively analysis on visitors was limited because we did not have detailed data serological tests were not done simultaneously and attack rates were calculated on the basis of results from real-time rt-pcr of mainly symptomatic individuals the potential transmission of mers-cov by asymptomatic carriers is under investigation in conclusion we report a large nosocomial mers outbreak that occurred outside the middle east the potential for similar outbreaks anywhere in the world from a single traveller should be noted as long as mers-cov transmission continues in the middle east emergency preparedness and vigilance are crucial to the prevention of further large outbreaks in the future our report serves as an international alarm that preparedness in hospitals laboratories and governmental agencies is the key not only for mers-cov infections but also for other new emerging infectious diseases  comparison of transmissibility of coronavirus between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients reanalysis of the ningbo covid-19 data guosheng yin huaqing jin  we investigate the transmissibility of coronavirus for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using the ningbo covid-19 data 1  through more in-depth and comprehensive statistical analysis we conclude that there is no difference in the transmission rates of coronavirus between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients which is consistent with the original findings in chen et al 1  since outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 in december 2019 the coronavirus has spread over the world at an unprecedented rate by april 2 2020 more than 150 countries have been affected by covid-19 with a total of close to one million confirmed cases and over 47000 deaths the covid-19 has been declared as an international public health emergency by the world health organization who during the incubation period a percentage of coronavirus carriers may have no symptoms or minimal symptoms and thus often go undetected these covert coronavirus carriers may not even be aware of the infection themselves who however would be confirmed as positive cases if tested using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr if the percentage of asymptomatic carriers is large and if their transmissibility of coronavirus is as high as the symptomatic cases this would pose a great threat to the public therefore it is critical to determine the percentage and transmissibility of asymptomatic coronavirus carriers in the population it has been reported that the viral load detected in the asymptomatic patients was similar to that in the symptomatic patients which suggests the potential transmissibility of asymptomatic patients 2   cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

chi-squared test yielded a p-value of 0288 which indicates that there is no statistically significant difference between the two transmission rates they further investigated the transmission rates for different relationships and different types of contact with the infected patients including both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and concluded that the differences in the transmission rates are statistically significant across different relationships and types of contact respectively the closer the contact with the infected patients the higher chance of infection however in their original statistical analysis 1  the chi-squared tests were unduly used because the counts in some cells of the contingency tables are rather small and even zeros which violates the assumptions of a chi-squared test and thus casts doubt on the validity of the hypothesis test moreover when comparing the transmission rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases chen et al 4 included the cases associated with a super-spreader who mainly transmitted the disease in an air-conditioned bus and a buddhism activity gathering however this may reduce the generalization of the findings as the super-spreader should be regarded as an outlier and removed from the primary analysis from january 21st to march 6th 2020 there were 157 symptomatic cases and 30 asymptomatic cases in the ningbo covid-19 data 1  these infected cases resulted in 2147 close contacts with them among which 2001 exposures were caused by the symptomatic cases and 146 by the asymptomatic cases the average number of close contacts by the symptomatic cases is 13 and that by the asymptomatic cases is 5 and the difference is statistically significant with a p-value of 610 -6 from a permutation test  cc-by 40

asymptomatic patient which however is not statistically significant as the 95 confidence interval covers one furthermore as the 95 confidence intervals for the difference of transmission rates cover

medrxiv preprint  institutional preparedness to prevent future middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus-like outbreaks in republic of korea min jeon huok tae kim hyong   the suspected transmission route for human middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infection was a direct contact with the saliva of infected camels or through consumption of unpasteurized milk or undercooked meat 2 kayali et al showed that the seroprevalence of mers-cov was several times higher in persons with regular exposure to camels than in the general population 3 further muller et al reported a 15- and 23-times higher seroprevalence of mers-cov antibodies in shepherds and in slaughterhouse workers respectively compared with the general population 4 person-to-person transmission of zoonotic disease has been reported for only a limited number of diseases 5 the incapability of mers-cov to infect animal models like hamsters mice and ferrets indicates the presence of a species barrier however an experimental study showed that human cell lines were susceptible to mers-cov infection 6 and the reports of human-to-human transmission have increased 789 the modes of human-to-human mers-cov spread are incompletely defined 10 however some experts have suggested the occurrence of secondary infections through droplets or direct contact with infected patients or fomites 11 furthermore an epidemiological study reported the potential for mers-cov nosocomial transmission through contaminated surfaces of bed sheets bed controllers bedrails medical devices and even air-ventilation equipment 12 although the school-going children of the community were not initially a suspected at-risk population for virus transmission growing public fear finally resulted in closure of more than 1160 kindergartens schools and even some universities during this time people riding subways buses and other public transports while wearing face masks was a common sight increasing public fear resulted in cancellation of social meetings and the downtowns were no longer crowed 13 however there still are no strong evidences supporting mers spread in community-settings and therefore the usefulness of these social efforts to prevent mers spread in the community remains uncertain chowell et al suggested that a few early super-spreading events fueled the mers outbreak in republic of korea 1 the index patient who infected 30 secondary cases and another two second generation cases who infected 80 and 23 secondary cases respectively fig 1 these cases were termed as super-spreaders while the vast majority of cases induced relatively few secondary infections according to some researchers super-spreading events follow the 2080 rule 14 where approximately 20 of the infected individuals are responsible for 80 of the transmissions moreover lloyd-smith et al reported that super-spreading is a normal feature of disease transmission 15 stein et al summarized the contributing factors resulting in a super-spreader as follows pathogens virulence factors co-infections decreased host immunity misdiagnosis delayed hospital admission inter-hospital transfers host behaviors such as ignoring instructions regarding infection control and poor environmental conditions such as crowding poor ventilation etc 16 an observational laboratory-based study of outbreaks in jeddah and riyadh reported that the mers super-spreading events and the observed overdispersion of mers transmission may similarly result from a combination of factors including individual viral shedding and contact rates hospital procedures and locations as well as population structure and density 17 predicting super-spreading events is thus very important in infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans 16 however it may be difficult to identify the super-spreaders before the onset of an epidemic in both the french 9 and the german mers-cov cases 18 which had similar findings listed above the exposed healthcare workers did not get infected although appropriate infection-protection measures were not in place in the korean outbreak as well some non-super-spreaders had similar conditions to those favoring super-spreading events high viral titer delayed awareness narrow and crowded rooms and unprotected close contact such as intubation despite this no confirmed secondary cases were found amongst thousands of exposed persons data not published the consequence of this discrepant transmission can be summarized in a statement by galvani and may heterogeneously infectious emerging disease will be less likely to generate an epidemic but if sustained the resulting epidemic is more likely to be explosive 14 fig 2 a korean mers outbreak epidemiological study was undertaken to estimate the case fatality rate cfr among senior patients 19 the cfr for patients aged 60 years or older with underlying diseases was estimated at 482  as of july 31 2015 the estimated cfr among other cases were as follows 18  in the lowest risk group age  60 years without any underlying diseases 136  for those aged 60 years or older without any underlying diseases and 111  for those younger than 60 years with underlying diseases senior patients were thus 93-fold 95  ci 53169 more likely to die compared to younger patients while presence of underlying diseases resulted in a 78-fold 95  ci 40167 higher likelihood of fatality 19 although the researchers were not able to ensure a systematic and consistent review of all common comorbidities these findings showed that enhanced hospital infection control practices protecting the specific at-risk groups from mers exposure were very important to reduce associated mortality the health care system of republic of korea is a very unique structure in which a 39 year-old universal social welfare system the utilitarian national health insurance system nhis and competitive private clinics and hospitals miraculously co-exist the efficiency of the korean medical insurance system is among the highest in the world having even numerous mega-sized hospitals running at relatively low medical costs although the reimbursement system of the medical costs are public there is no limitation to hospital use in different regions and relatively few restrictions exist in choosing from large university hospitals or tertiary care centers thus patients can select a medical institution they want to visit and move easily from one hospital to another further even though accurate transfer notes are mandatory the patient management and clinical testing information are not adequately shared by the referring hospitals these factors may make hospital-to-hospital infection transmission more common 20 in addition with an aim to restrict over-charging by individual institutions medical expenditures including institutional safety-related expenditures are strictly controlled by the health insurance review  assessment service hira consequently more than 50 of the hospital rooms in korea have more than 4 beds per room and family members or privately hired health care aides usually stay with the patients in theses crowded hospital rooms this situation has not been ameliorated with the recently built large-sized university hospitals and this increased vulnerability to easier viral transmission as a result of overcrowding has long been considered a common occurrence at the larger hospitals 20 in the korean mers outbreak a number of cases could not be suspected in the first hospital visit as early clinical manifestations of mers are non-specific consequently significant secondary exposures were provoked unconsciously drostein et al suggested that viral spread may have been limited by awareness of the disease among healthcare workers and patients 17 therefore an efficient alerting system including proper education on newly spreading diseases to the healthcare workers is necessary in addition medical providers must adopt a mandatory travel history checking policy when screening patients presenting with fever or respiratory symptoms thereon systems to share adequate medical information between hospitals should be established the uss centers for disease controls and prevention cdc recommends that the aiirs should be single negative pressure patient rooms with a minimum of 12 air changes per hour cdc also recommends a direct discharge of air from these rooms to the outside or filtration through a high-efficiency particulate air hepa filter before recirculation before the mers outbreak the korean government prepared a total of 119 negative pressure beds however many of these did not meet the recommended criteria and some were not even built as single patient rooms 21 the resultant shortage of aiirs meant that not all mers suspected patients were isolated at the peak of the korean outbreak furthermore aiirs and specialized healthcare settings were also disproportionately distributed between public and private hospitals thus as newly built aiirs were concentrated in public hospitals under local government most advanced healthcare facilities and critical care personnel were linked to large sized private university hospitals during the outbreak many public hospitals had to recruit medical personnel from university and army hospitals and also volunteer nurses cdcs ppe recommendation are as follows 22 workers must receive training on and demonstrate an understanding of when to use ppe what ppe is necessary how to properly don put on use doff take off ppe how to properly dispose of or disinfect and maintain ppe and the limitations of ppe any reusable ppe must be properly cleaned decontaminated and maintained after and between uses during the korean mers epidemic although doctors and nurses used ppe some of them were infected with mers-cov even as the reasons for infection in these healthcare workers were uncertain some epidemiologic researchers attributed this to inadequate use of ppe during the korean mers outbreak only a few doctors and nurses at each healthcare facility were engaged in mers patients care the number of infectious diseases specialists was less than 200 for the 50 million korean people at the time of the 2015 mers outbreak this resulted in overworked healthcare professionals which could be a threat for both the healthcare workers and the patients 23 the korean government plans to increase the numbers of infection control and epidemiology professionals and establish specialized infectious diseases hospitals however this seems to be a half successful measure since the numbers of trained specialists that existing societies and educational associations could certificate annually are far from the goal almost all secondary infected korean mers cases were patients healthcare workers or visiting family members who were exposed to source patients in crowded hospital environments such as multiple occupancy rooms and emergency rooms these close personal contacts may allow easy transmission of mers-cov therefore stronger policies need to be in place to initially maintain patients with acute febrile andor respiratory illness in single patient rooms preemptive isolation followed by a move to multiple occupancy room depending on infectiousness moreover regulations and restrictions on visiting acquaintances in hospital are also needed thus even as visiting sick family members of friends in hospital is a friendly way to express social relationship for koreans for long time this culture should be modified to better prevent catastrophic contagious diseases last year struggling with an unfamiliar syndrome the korean healthcare system was unable to find infected cases in time and to react quickly and accurately as the first imported case was reported multiple potential factors were associated with the super-spreading events misdiagnosis delayed hospital admission inter-hospital transfers without accurate information and also behaviors such as ignoring instructions regarding infection control and poor environmental conditions institutional and healthcare systems preparedness is required to prevent such outbreaks efforts to halt transmission of infectious diseases need to be prioritized and should include reviewing existing recommendations improved contact tracing policy improved public hospital facilities for critical care of severe infections and pre-emptive isolation for unknown acute respiratory infection these strategies are crucial to prepare for a future mers-like epidemic in korea  sars responding to an unknown virus p tambyah a   the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a newly recognized coronavirus infection that emerged in southern china 1 with subsequent global spread to 29 countries 25 in countries where local transmission has occurred hospitals have been the major foci of infection especially in singapore 6 and canada 7 in february 2003 reports began emerging on promed mail of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in the guangdong province in southern china 8 it is now believed that the first cases of sars occurred in the city of foshan in the guangdong province 1 however throughout november until the late part of february sars was largely confined to the province of guangdong the global dissemination of sars is believed to have begun on the ninth floor of hotel m in hong kong where a physician from guangdong stayed for one night on 22 february 2003 9 at least 16 individuals who were staying on the ninth floor of the hotel were subsequently infected with sars although none of them reportedly had direct contact with the ill physician the newly infected individuals traveled onward to their homes or next destinations in the usa canada singapore hong kong and ireland sparking off epidemics of varying degrees of severity in each of those countries mainly in hospitals but also in their respective communities it is striking to realize that the entire global dissemination of this epidemic can probably be traced to this single event of one overnight hotel stay it has almost become a clich to report that the sars epidemic the first emerging infectious disease of the 21st century heralded an unprecedented collaboration between researchers across the globe within weeks of the first cases electronic publications reviewed the clinical syndromes 4 5 as well as the characteristics of the virus and methods for its detection by the polymerase chain reaction 2 3 the genome of various strains of the virus were sequenced which contributed tremendously to knowledge of its molecular epidemiology 10 there was an explosion of reports about the sars coronavirus with more than a thousand publications available on pubmed by the beginning of march 2004 the first anniversary of the global emergence of the virus it is beyond the scope of this review to cover all of the virological and clinical information contained in these articles and i would refer the reader to the excellent review by peiris et al 11 the present review focuses on the response to this emerging disease and its evolution in light of increasing information outstanding issues that remain to be resolved are also highlighted one of the first unusual aspects of this emerging infection was the recognition that healthcare workers hcw were uniquely susceptible to the then unknown etiologic agent in hong kong the first clue that a new infection had emerged was a cluster of ill hcws the same was noted in vietnam and led to the world health organization who sending a team to vietnam under the leadership of dr carlo urbani who later died from the virus he helped to define 12 as soon as sars was recognized as a nosocomial infection guidelines were issued by various authorities including the who 13 the united states centers for disease control and prevention 14 and the hong kong health authority 15 health canada 16 and the ministries of health of singapore 17 and malaysia 18 among others it is important to recognize that in the beginning of the sars outbreak there was no information about the agent responsible for the infection or its mode of transmission hence there was a tendency to over-protect as the epidemic evolved so did the guidelines which are constantly being updated and might indeed be out of date by the time this report is read all guidelines are published on the internet 1318 and the reader is encouraged to review the websites for the latest information the physician from guangdong who became the source of the global epidemic through his stay at hotel m was admitted to a hospital in hong kong the day after his arrival in the city he became progressively more ill and died 10 days later it is striking that although he was critically ill and intubated on a ventilator in the intensive care unit only one hcw who attended to him in the emergency department became ill 19 the reason for this is likely that hong kong hospitals had been on the alert for highly pathogenic avian influenza in february there had been a small cluster of cases of avian influenza in a hong kong family that had traveled to mainland china 20 a directive had gone out from the hong kong department of health on 21 february 2003 to maintain strict infection control with droplet precautions for all cases of atypical community-acquired pneumonia because of concerns that highly pathogenic avian influenza might be easily transmissible from person to person one of the singaporean women who returned from hotel m was indeed isolated as a possible case of avian influenza in one of singapores large general hospitals and no secondary cases resulted from her because of the concerns for possible avian influenza or some unknown pathogen with an uncertain mode of transmission most of the initial strategies devised for the prevention and control of sars were directed against a highly contagious airborne pathogen in 1997 21 18 previously healthy young people were infected and six died from highly pathogenic avian influenza in hong kong this mortality rate 33 is much higher than the normal mortality rate for influenza especially among young healthy individuals 22 in response to the outbreak more than one million chickens were slaughtered and the disease was rapidly brought under control seroepidemiologic studies of hcws done at the time 23 demonstrated the efficacy of personal protective equipment ppe in preventing transmission and identified the risk associated with close personal contact in addition to the viruss lack of efficient human-to-human transmission capability 21 fears of a recurrence of a more virulent or easily transmissible form of avian influenza directed the initial efforts against sars however sars possessed an unusual quality in that it seemed to be transmitted in the healthcare setting far more efficiently than in households where measles varicella and other airborne viruses usually take rapid hold 24 this has yet to be explained completely but it supports the argument that close contact is the major mode of transmission of the sars virus fomites have been a cause for concern with the sars coronavirus since the initial global dissemination stemming from individuals in hotel m who had no direct contact with the index case but had stayed in the same corridor and probably had occasion to touch elevator buttons or railings that might have been contaminated with the sars virus in the outbreak of sars in the amoy gardens apartments in hong kong 25 more than 70 individuals who had no known direct contact were infected possibly through the aerosolisation of contaminated sewage the implications of fomite transmission of sars are considerable and would mandate a much greater degree of environmental cleaning than is currently practiced however there are many unanswered questions in this arena for example why did the individuals staying on the same hotel floor as the index case in hotel m get infected but none of the staff 9 sars has been convincingly demonstrated to be caused by a coronavirus 26 certain other characteristics have been ascertained from the previously known coronaviruses 229e and oc43 including their ability to survive after drying on inanimate surfaces in the hospital environment as well as differences in the viability of the virus at different conditions of temperature and humidity 27 28 while the sars coronavirus has a certain amount of homology with the other pathogenic human coronaviruses 10 too little is known about its behavior under different environmental and atmospheric conditions to make a definitive statement about the role of the environment in nosocomial transmission there have been reports of the sars coronavirus persisting for prolonged periods of up to 2 days on environmental surfaces 29 survival in stool is reported to be even longer at up to 4 days in alkaline diarrheal stools this would certainly help explain such circumstances as the hotel m outbreak the attack rates for sars have generally not been high in singapore for example the index case for the national outbreak was nursed in a general ward by staff who were not wearing protective covering of any kind and the attack rate was only 18 doctors 930 nurses and 112 fellow patients in the same ward areas 30 again the distribution of infections suggests that close contact is the most important factor leading to the transmission of this pathogen in hospitals the widespread emphasis on ppe has been seen by some as placing an undue emphasis on hcw protection without adequately considering the protection of other at-risk individuals such as other patients in the same area the use of ppe is also not without its own adverse consequences 31 as reactions to latex are common among hcws some with serious consequences it should also be noted that the use of respirators has been associated with fatal adverse events 32 costs are also an issue and in resource-poor settings 12-ply cotton masks have been used which have reportedly been effective in preventing the nosocomial transmission of the virus in at least one large public hospital 33 in a case-control study seto et al 34 found that surgical masks were also effective in preventing transmission of sars to hcws which is in line with our understanding of the epidemiology of the virus in singapore one of the successes of our approach to the control of sars was the widespread availability of full ppe for any staff member who requested it this was even before the widespread dissemination of the virus led to the mandatory use of full ppe in all hospitals and it provided staff the reassurance that their welfare was a high priority in the midst of an epidemic there have been concerns that the use of n95 masks alone might not be adequate for preventing the nosocomial transmission of sars since cases have occurred among fully protected hcws 35 36 these cases possibly resulted from contact transmission recognition of the role of contact transmission has led to the inclusion of recommendations for the use of gloves and gowns in all guidelines 1318 while these garments have been shown to be effective in preventing the nosocomial transmission of other respiratory viruses 37 few data are available for their efficacy regarding sars travel restrictions were among the more controversial aspects of the sars epidemic the economies of most affected countries in east asia were devastated by these travel advisories while other pathogens have been documented as being transmitted on airplanes most notably influenza 38 the number of individuals infected with sars during air travel was remarkably low according to the who 39 there have been 35 flights carrying symptomatic probable sars patients and 31 of those flights did not result in a single secondary infection overall 27 cases of secondary infection resulted from symptomatic individuals one flight alone ca112 which flew from hong kong to beijing on 15 march is now known to have accounted for 22 of these 27 cases olson et al 40 reported that one flight with four symptomatic individuals with sars was associated with an attack rate for confirmed sars of zero while another flight with a single symptomatic individual was associated with an attack rate of 18 the singapore experience 41 was that three flights with symptomatic sars patients resulted in only one transmission the overall attack rate for the flights into singapore was thus less than 1 despite one symptomatic individual being a so-called super-spreader and another being critically ill at the time of the flight requiring intubation soon after arrival interestingly olson et al 40 point out that fully 45 of the fellow passengers who became infected with sars had no direct contact as defined by the who with the index patient on their ill-fated flight they do not offer any explanation for the differing attack rates although a careful reader would realize that among the 22 individuals allegedly infected on the flight ten were traveling together as part of a tour group also the flight with the four symptomatic individuals was much shorter than the flight that was associated with widespread transmission this is supported by icu data from canada 42 that showed time of exposure to be a major risk factor overall however what these reports demonstrate is that a much more detailed analysis is required in order to truly understand the epidemiology of this unusual virus during the peak of the sars epidemic in china 128 april 2003 when the who had travel advisories and alerts in place there were more than 27000 visitors from china and hong kong 43 who entered singapore and not a single case of transmission was recorded from any of these individuals in taiwan a strict 10-day quarantine 44 was placed on all individuals returning from countries that were on the who list of sars-affected countries a total of 80813 individuals were quarantined among whom 11 had probable sars and only one of whom had laboratory-confirmed sars thus the detection rate was 001 for probable sars and 0001 for laboratory-confirmed sars these figures have to be balanced against the costs and psychological impact of quarantine for more than 80000 individuals who were perfectly well thanks to excellent isolation and case finding with contact tracing the number of people infected with sars with each successive generation of the outbreak was progressively reaching extinction levels 45 in the sars-affected countries with the re-emergence of sars at the beginning of 2004 drastic travel restrictions have fortunately not been instituted to date since there is no evidence yet of widespread dissemination of the virus across international air routes by travelers it could also be argued that since we now have much better knowledge of the epidemiology of the virus travel restrictions might not be necessary the next time around all of the guidelines agree it would be ideal if patients with sars could be nursed in isolation rooms 1318 there are differences however in the recommendations for negative pressure with separate ventilation systems and these perhaps reflect the differences in resources available for healthcare one drawback of isolation rooms is that unless there are adequate nursing or medical resources the degree of attention that the patient will receive in a single isolation room is obviously lower than in an open well-ventilated area patients isolated for infection control purposes are known to be at risk for adverse events in hospital 46 and this again has to be balanced against the benefits in terms of reduced nosocomial transmission while all of the available evidence points to droplet and contact transmission there is a possibility that the virus might be aerosolized during such procedures as high-flow oxygen therapy or possibly via the use of extractor fans which were blamed for the aerosolisation of contaminated sewage during the amoy gardens outbreak 25 therefore n95 respirators or higher should be used this is a cause for concern as in many countries including singapore without adequate pre-prepared negative-pressure rooms powerful extractor fans similar to the ones used in the bathrooms at the amoy gardens apartments are used to create a form of laminar uni-directional airflow while these may serve to direct the flow of air away from areas of heavy traffic it is possible that they might be hazardous by facilitating the aerosolisation of infectious droplets in singapore 47 and canada 48 transmission of the sars virus has been noted in crowded emergency rooms where patients routinely wait for hours for a hospital bed in singapore sars was documented as being transmitted to a patients visitor who was waiting in a corridor during the patients radiological procedure 49 again a common occurrence in many healthcare settings in our own hospital the national university hospital the largest cluster of sars cases occurred in one of our eight-bed wards 47 where patients are deliberately placed eight to a cubicle in order to support the philosophy of healthcare financing in singapore the sars outbreak has clearly been a wake-up call for health authorities worldwide 50 as they try to adjust health systems primarily designed to minimize costs into systems designed to protect staff and patients the isolation and segregation of patients with suspect and probable sars has been credited with markedly reducing the transmission of the virus 45 lipsitch et al 45 reported a reduction in the time to isolation of patients with sars as the epidemic progressed with a corresponding decline in the number of secondary cases as knowledge of the virus increased the majority of individuals with sars have not transmitted the virus to anyone 49 while it is tempting to ascribe this to infection control measures many of these individuals were infected and hospitalized long before the institution of infection control methods this has given rise to the concept of super-spreaders it is known that the presence of common viral upper respiratory tract infections can turn some hcws into so-called cloud hcws 51 these individuals have been linked with the airborne dispersal of agents that are normally only spread through contact such as group a streptococci or staphylococcus aureus the hypothesis is that the presence of upper respiratory tract infections transforms these individuals into efficient transmitters of pathogens through increased coughing sneezing or nose rubbing alternatively airborne dispersal could result from the use of various respiratory therapies the index patient for the singapore epidemic was not isolated and 22 hcws visitors and fellow patients were infected 6 the second generation of cases associated with this cluster before the institution of infection control practices or strict isolation included only 13 cases the situation in canada was similar with cases in the second generation occurring pre-isolation 7 it is quite clear however that non-isolated patients are hazardous to staff visitors and other patients single non-isolated patients have led to well-documented outbreaks in hospitals in singapore 49 taiwan 52 canada 53 and hong kong 54 the phenomenon of super-spreaders has been invoked to explain why so few transmissions resulted from the majority of non-isolated individuals while a few rare cases were associated with the vast majority of transmissions 49 the jury is still out as to whether these are indeed individuals who are for some reason more able to transmit infection or whether events such as the use of high-flow oxygen therapy are more responsible for what are probably more accurately described as super-spreading events until we have more virologic information we have to assume that all individuals with sars are super-spreaders until proven otherwise and we have to take all the necessary precautions again because of the concern that an undiagnosed patient might turn out to be a super-spreader the threshold to isolation has become progressively lower initially hospitals and clinics were using the who case definitions of suspect and probable sars cases to determine which cases to isolate as we and others have pointed out atypical presentations 55 are the achilles heel of such a strategy and these have been associated with significant nosocomial transmission in a very important report from a sars screening clinic rainer et al 56 pointed out that the who criteria which were actually designed for epidemiologic purposes while relatively specific have a sensitivity of only about 25 in predicting which individuals will turn out to have sars the implications are that a large number of individuals will need to be isolated and monitored very closely until their clinical course becomes evident in practice in singapore this resulted in the conversion of large numbers of hospital wards to isolation facilities cancellation of elective surgeries and an overall paralysis of the healthcare system we used a regime of 4-hourly temperature monitoring without any use at all of antipyretics together with daily serial chest radiographs and blood counts and comprehensive chemistry work ups with this regime we found a sensitivity of 28 specificity of 96 positive predictive value of 11 and negative predictive value of 99 for the who criteria at patient presentation 57 it is clear that an accurate rapid diagnostic test is urgently needed to allow us to filter out individuals who are at low risk of sars or better still at lower risk of transmitting the virus should they not be isolated current diagnostic tests 58 which are based on either molecular methods or serological diagnosis are severely limited not predominantly by sensitivity or specificity but by the fact that they take awhile to become positive during which time widespread dissemination of the virus could have occurred from a single non-isolated super-spreader fever screening is widely practiced as a sars-prevention measure there was even a period when the who called for fever screening at airports to prevent the global spread of sars unfortunately fever is a non-specific and insensitive screening tool for sars 56 atypical presentations of sars without fever have been reported especially in older and immunocompromised patients 59 one case is particularly illustrative 47 a 63-year-old man cleared a fever triage area in an emergency room as he was afebrile he was then admitted to a general ward not a fever ward as a case of heart failure and he remained afebrile until he developed a low-grade temperature after being transferred to the medical intensive care unit for progressive shortness of breath two other patients one visitor and one nurse who had been in the same emergency department area as this patient were infected with sars the visitor a previously healthy 28-year-old woman died and her husband and son were subsequently infected in the brief period the index patient was in the general ward two other patients and the entire shift of nurses working in the ward at the time who were only wearing n95 masks were infected by the time the patient became febrile in the intensive care unit staff were wearing full ppe and no further infections resulted thus a single patient who passed two strict fever screens managed to be the source of at least nine infections in less than 24 h this patient was critically ill and died 3 days later thus he may have had a very high viral load this case illustrates the limitations of cookbook screening by using fever protocols without paying attention to a careful clinical history and physical examination in this case an alert cardiology team who re-did the patients history and examination and performed a bedside echocardiograph to prove that he was suffering from pneumonia not heart failure made the diagnosis during the sars outbreak the inter-hospital transfer of patients in canada 53 taiwan 52 and singapore 6 was a very efficient means of dissemination of the sars virus in singapore on 22 march the decision was made to close one hospital to new admissions and to concentrate all sars patients there 6 this unfortunately led to patients recently discharged from this hospital being shunted to other hospitals and starting off epidemics there now in singapore once a cluster of cases with even a low degree of suspicion is identified the unit is locked down with no admissions transfers or discharges in order to prevent a recurrence of the former situation this strategy was also used successfully in vietnam to contain the sars virus which led to vietnam being the first country to be declared free of local transmission of sars 60 while we have learned a tremendous amount in the brief period since sars first emerged in november 2002 there are still a number of unresolved issues for practicing clinicians the cases of sars in early 2004 have quashed hopes that the virus was put back in the box and in the formerly affected countries many clinicians are deeply worried about dealing with a devastating resurgence of the virus i have a personal wish list of questions that i would like answered before too long these include what are the conditions required for the airborne transmission of the sars coronavirus when can we be sure that transmission does not occur when can we get a good rapid diagnostic test that is positive early in the course of the illness what makes a super-spreading event is quarantine really necessary i can only hope that the answers to these and numerous other questions raised by infection control practitioners hospital epidemiologists infectious disease clinicians and researchers can be answered before we face the next sars outbreak or something worse even as this is being written avian influenza rampages across east asia affecting primarily birds but also claiming the lives of more than 20 individuals if this becomes a pandemic form of influenza sars will pale in comparison  sars-cov lessons for global health ralph baric steven   on 16 november 2002 a man developed high fever and respiratory symptoms and was hospitalized and treated for pneumonia in foshan china zhao 2007 after several weeks in intensive care and subsequent spread of the mysterious respiratory disease to his wife and several relatives he recovered and was released on the 8th of january 2003 in early december a restaurant chef in shenzhen developed a fever with flu like symptoms and while suffering a severe disease course was hospitalized in heyuan infecting seven hospital staff and a patient between the 16th and 28th of december in parallel multiple cities around guangzhou in guangdong province were reporting sporadic cases of an atypical pneumonia between the end of december 2002 and through early january 2003 oftentimes in chefs or dealers of exotic animals in wet markets and their close contacts while this scenario may have been repeated in earlier years given the low seroprevelance rates noted in archived serum samples zheng et al 2004 it was the super spreader events that took place in the hzs-2 hospital in guangzhou that catalyzed the global severe acute respiratory syndrome sars pandemic two brothers working in restaurants and then a third individual were all hospitalized with severe acute respiratory symptoms sars in hzs2 between the 18th and 30th of january leading a pneumonia-related hospital outbreak on 31 january 2003 while each transmitted disease to family and health care workers the third individual infected over 30 hospital members and patients during his 48 h stay in hzs2 21 hospital staff after transfer to a second hospital hzs3 and about 23 relatives and friends this key super spreader event allowed the epidemic to gain critical momentum another major turn of events occurred in shanxi province after a business woman traveled to guangdong in late february after returning home she subsequently became sick at the time knowledge regarding the developing outbreak was not common so she transmitted the disease to eight family members and five hospital staff in shanxi after being transfer to a beijing hospital on 1 march 2003 she became the index case for the outbreak in beijing as well zhao 2007 global spread of the outbreak began on the 21st of february 2003 when a physician from the hzs2 hospital traveled to hotel m in hong kong although he did not attend atypical pneumonia patients in hzs2 his health quickly deteriorated and he was admitted to a hospital in hong kong on the 22nd during his short stay at hotel m a super spreader event transmitted the disease to 16 guests who subsequently spread the disease to toronto singapore vietnam and then beyond the indication of a new global emerging virus respiratory threat was first reported by dr carlo urbani md in vietnam to the who on february 28th resulting in a global alert notification on march 12th tragically dr urbani became infected while treating patients and subsequently died from sars infection a fate shared by many other health care professionals who were engaged in treating patients suffering from this new disease importantly dr urbanis sacrifice focused global resources on the new epidemic disease resulting in the rapid implementation of public health measures diagnostic criterion and the scientific research community which undoubtedly saved countless of lives globally peiris et al 2004 within a few weeks of the hzs2 super spreader event atypical pneumonia had spread to 25 countries across five continents infecting some 8000 people and resulting in 774 deaths before succumbing to aggressive public health measures in early july 2003 in addition to the large outbreaks widely recognized in cities in singapore taiwan china and canada smaller communities were also affected an individual visiting a sick relative in canada contacted the disease during the second wave of the toronto outbreak returning to north carolina in late may 2003 he developed symptomatic disease 1 day after working several days on a rural college campus in central north carolina after being confirmed as a sars case the university spent 4050k screening some 42 potentially exposed individuals amazingly a mystery disease whose index case was identified 6 months earlier on the other side of the globe had arrived in rural north america it is not surprising that the panic caused by the rapid spread of an unknown highly pathogenic fatal respiratory virus is enormous and no community is exempt coupled with the current globalization of the world trade it was inevitable that the economic impact would be extensive between march and may of 2003 tourist arrivals in asia dropped between 30 and 80 with about half of all flights being canceled depending on the country and region as word of the mystery illness spread the asian equity market indices declined by 15 over a 4-week period ultimately the world bank reported a 2 loss of east asian gdp in the second quarter of 2003 during the sars outbreak the asian development bank placed the global economic loss at 59 billion usd with the bulk of these losses located from mainland china 179 billion and hong kong 12 billion while canada suffered losses of more than 1 billion most financial losses were associated with disruptions of trade travel investment interruption of product supply chains and behavior changes in consumers rather than from medical costs or the loss of human life for comparison sake the bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic in the uk the sporadic avian influenza virus cases and the uk foot and mouth disease epidemic caused 1013 1520 and 2530 billion in economic losses respectively the sars-cov has revealed a clear vulnerability in the global economy as the world economy relies increasingly on manufacturing centered in asia and elsewhere and the transport of those goods globally pandemic outbreaks of disease have serious global consequences including the potential collapse of the asian european and us equity markets interruptions of trade and travel manufacturing stasis and decline and reduced availability of goods foods and medicines given the current interconnection of the global marketplace and the speed of transcontinental travel significant investments in basic and applied biomedical research are essential for maintaining the health of economies and the overall public health of the global community emerging infectious diseases are clearly recognized as threats to human health and a significant public health problem new emerging pathogens lists published prior to 2002 included hiv influenza the filoiviruses hantaviruses and various arboviruses recognizing that many emerging pathogens were zoonotic in origin despite the recognition that new emerging viruses are difficult if not impossible to predict standardized lists were developed based primarily on epidemiologic trends over the past 50 years another consistent theme was the near universal agreement that coronaviruses were not emerging pathogens but rather were only associated with relatively benign upper respiratory tract infections in humans because coronaviruses have relatively high mutation and rna recombination rates and rapidly undergo cross species transmission events in vitro and in vivo baric et al 1999 baric et al 1997 treshman et al 1996 we and others in the field have speculated that coronaviruses might be important emerging pathogens as early as 1996 baric et al 1996 notably several major coronavirus pandemics had been recorded over the past 25 years in economically important animal species in 1978 porcine epidemic coronavirus pedv emerged and has remained among the most important causes of severe gastroenteritis in swine in europe and asia sequence analysis suggested that pedv likely evolved from human coronaviruses bridgen et al 1993 duarte and laude 1994 in 1984 the less pathogenic porcine respiratory coronaviruses prcv evolved from the highly virulent enteric strain transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev pensaert et al 1986 this was accomplished by either a single nucleotide mutation or deletion in the major surface glycoprotein gene spike sanchez et al 1999 wesley et al 1991 currently prcv affords some level of cross protection against tgev van nieuwstadt et al 1989 wesley et al 1991 although more virulent forms of prcv have recently emerged saif 1999 a closely related arterivirus the porcine respiratory and reproductive disease virus prrsv emerged in the late 1980s in canada and europe and is currently the most important swine pathogen worldwide responsible for economic losses of 200 millionyear in the us alone blaha 2000 rossow 1998 in 1992 a new respiratory pathogen was recognized that caused shipping fever in cattle a severe oftentimes fatal pneumonia sequence analysis suggests that shipping fever was caused by a respiratory bovine coronavirus bcv-r which likely evolved from an enteric bovine coronavirus by acquiring mutations in s and the replicase gene storz et al 2000 concordant with this hypothesis sequence comparisons have now indicated that host shifts even between distant avian and mammalian species are common events in coronavirus phylogeny rest and mindell 2003 coronaviruses have emerged rapidly by mutation or recombination of existing strains altering tissue tropisms andor species specificity in animals and despite intensive management and vaccine efforts these new coronaviruses are still major problems worldwide the emergence of a new human coronavirus from zoonotic reservoirs is not surprising given the widespread activity noted in economically important animals in reality epidemiologic trends for many viral pathogens are based on relatively short 60 years timelines with underreporting of disease surveillance trends in human populations the emergence of the sars-cov underscores the critical need for maintaining active basic science research not only on the medically relevant human pathogens but also on virus families that are associated with limited or benign disease outcomes in humans the limited investment in coronavirus research primarily in europe and the us provided key investments necessary for the rapid identification and sequencing of the sars-cov genome the prompt development of rapid pcr-based detection methods the identification of the s gene as the likely candidate target for vaccine development potential problems in vaccines and therapeutics development and the development of reverse genetic systems all within a few months of emergence the nation hardest hit by sars was china and the sars-cov epidemic underscores the importance of local research infrastructure and governmental support in controlling new emerging diseases in the end the successful control of the sars-cov is a triumph for the chinese basic clinical and public health research infrastructure the chinese research community was among the first to successfully culture the virus sequence the genome and develop rapid rt-pcr based detection strategies consortium 2004 despite an early belated response by governmental officials aggressive quarantine and other public health measures demonstrated the effectiveness of classic methods of tracking cases and their contacts as an effective means of curtailing disease spread the chinese research community rapidly demonstrated that sars-cov originated from animals and that the open markets were likely sources of future disease outbreaks guan et al 2003 the closing of the animal markets has played a key role in tempering the scope and duration of sars and will likely serve to temper the severity and scope of future outbreaks using epidemiology molecular genetics and genome sequencing strategies a detailed catalogue of the key genomic changes that contributed to disease emergence and spread have been identified and cataloged for future research consortium 2004 other key contributions include the development of animal models vaccines and pathogenic studies perhaps most importantly a local well-funded basic scientific community is key not only for protecting global public health but also in protecting the health of global economies in many ways we were lucky with sars asymptomatic infections were rare and transmissibility was usually inefficient and typically occurred after disease onset allowing for pubic health intervention strategies to control the outbreak peiris et al 2004 sars highlighted the importance of rapid reporting infection control tracing and quarantine of contacts in controlling new emerging diseases however if super spreader events were more common the story may have been dramatically different importantly the outbreak has underscored critical vulnerabilities in global public health intervention strategies highly pathogenic respiratory viruses are clearly capable of near instantaneous global transmission and as such rapid approaches are needed to rapidly a detect b sequence and c develop and test candidate vaccines and therapeutics to protect human populations safe universal vaccine platforms are needed that can be tailored to new pathogens as they emerge quickly tested for safety and then strategically used to control new disease outbreaks in human populations basic investment into structure replication genetics and pathogenesis in each virus family is justified and among the first line of defense against future emerging threats it is no longer sufficient that only the developed world be poised and able to protect itself from new emerging diseases threats rapid vaccination and therapeutic platforms are needed for the developing world as well positioned to engage local research and public health communities in controlling local disease outbreaks at the source if control measures can be implemented rapidly then the scope duration and suffering in epidemics will be minimized the number of laboratories engaged in sars-cov research was enormous at the height of the epidemic and many laboratories have made significant contributions to our current understanding of sars epidemiology replication cross species transmission and pathogenesis sars highlighted the success of the basic research community and public health infrastructure as the principle determinants against new emerging diseases this special issue of virus research reviews only a small subset of the enormous number of high quality scientific contributions made by the global research community  middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov outbreak in south korea 2015 epidemiology characteristics and public health implications kh kim te tandi jw choi jm moon ms kim   middle east respiratory syndrome mers first reported in saudi arabia in 2012 is becoming an increasing threat to global health security much like ebola or swine flu1 between march 2012 and 1st november 2015 the world health organization who reported 1611 confirmed cases and 575 deaths worldwide2 mers-outbreak countries include saudi arabia 1255 cases and 539 deaths south korea 185 cases and 36 deaths and the united arab emirates 81 cases and 11 deaths3
 the first case of mers in south korea occurred on 20th may 2015 in a 68-year-old male who had contracted the disease while on a business trip to multiple middle east countries subsequently 186 cases were confirmed with 38 deaths in addition 16752 suspected cases had a substantial impact on the education tourism political and economic sectors4 domestic and international media sources attributed the spread of mers in south korea to many factors reuters reported that south koreas mers situation would not be abated without information transparency and cooperation with international virus hunters pointing out the south korean governments refusal to seek help from international parties as particularly troubling5 science highlighted problems such as inadequate in-hospital ventilation extensive transmission caused by unmanaged super spreaders poor infection control measures and refusal to disclose the names of hospitals where confirmed cases of mers had been treated or sought treatment6 the korea centre for disease control and prevention kcdc reported that problems with the initial response in south korea could be attributed to inconsistent definition and isolation of close contacts subsequent failure to conduct pre-emptive quarantines and the governments failure to implement appropriate crisis communication measures7
 in the face of such speculation about the main reasons for the initial failure to contain the mers outbreak in south korea the authors undertook a comprehensive review of the temporal progression of the outbreak and the infection histories of confirmed patients an overview of worldwide publications on mers between 1st january 2010 and 31st may 2015 did not include all of the south korean cases8 whilst previous reports from south korea have not reviewed the outbreak comprehensively7 9 10 the main objective of this study was to compare the south korean experience with that of other countries including clinical outcomes and infection control processes the timeline from the first confirmed mers case in south korea and the first death to the latest death is outlined in figure 1
 data were analysed based on the south korean governments mers information portal and policy briefings officially managed by mohw and kcdc11 12 the official daily briefing reports included patient serial number day of diagnosis infection route sex age and hospital the sex and age of all 186 south korean cases were determined outbreaks were defined as occurring in hospital within the family or in the community sources of exposure were divided into three groups healthcare professionals doctors nurses medical technicians eg radiologists and medical transport staff infections contracted in hospitals by inpatients or outpatients and infections acquired through visiting hospitalized patients or familial care-giving thirty-eight deaths were identified via the official daily briefings from mohw and kcdc the sex age and underlying diseases were recorded in these cases where patients had multiple underlying diseases duplicate aggregation was permitted with each disease treated as one case super-spreading events are found to occur during infectious disease events in which according to the pareto principle 20 of the infected population is the cause of transmitting the disease to the other 8013 14 three super spreaders were identified in this study patient 1 who infected 28 patients at st marys hospital pyeongtaek patient 14 who infected 85 patients at samsung medical centre seoul and patient 16 who infected 23 patients at konyang university hospital and daejeon hospital the 186 mers cases comprised 111 597 males and 75 403 females overall the 5059-years age group was most affected 226 of all cases followed by the 6069-years and 7079-years age groups females with mers tended to be older than males table i
 the 186 cases comprised the index case his wife infected in the household setting and 184 nosocomially acquired cases the most common route of exposure was through hospital visits including family members who acted as care-givers which accounted for 103 557 cases fifty-four 292 cases occurred in patients who were hospitalized for other reasons and 25 135 cases were occupationally acquired by healthcare workers table i twenty-six of the 38 fatalities were males the fatality rate in males 234 was higher than that in females 160 the average age of patients who died was 679 years table ii
 twenty-nine patients had underlying diseases the most common underlying diseases were respiratory disorders 11 cases 305 cancer 11 cases 289 hypertension eight cases 222 cardiovascular diseases five cases 139 and diabetes four cases 111 table iii
 from identification of the first mers patient to mid-june 2015 the numbers of confirmed and suspected mers cases increased rapidly the first death from mers occurred on 1st june 2015 on 17th june 2015 the number of suspected cases placed in isolation peaked at 6729 by 26th october 2015 16752 people had been isolated the 186th confirmed case was diagnosed on 4th july 2015 and no further cases were confirmed the last death occurred on 25th november 2015 the mers outbreak in south korea involved both intra- and interhospital transmission9 the index case visited four hospitals whilst symptomatic between 11th and 20th may 2015 when he was diagnosed with mers during this period he infected 28 people patient 14 was likely to have been infected during his stay at st marys hospital pyeongtaek between 15th and 17th may 2015 he was subsequently admitted to the emergency room at samsung medical centre on 20th may 2015 and was diagnosed with mers on 30th may 2015 during his stay at samsung medical centre he infected 81 patients he then infected a further four patients at good-morning hospital pyeongtaek patient 16 was also infected at st marys hospital pyeongtaek between 15th and 16th may he then infected 23 people at konyang university hospital and daejeon hospital figure 2
 south korea has the worlds second highest number of confirmed mers cases after saudi arabia while south korea has officially reported 186 confirmed cases of mers who reports 185 confirmed cases2 this discrepancy is due to the fact that the south korean government included a south korean patient who was diagnosed with mers in china during a business trip despite the fact that he was a suspected case while in south korea as in saudi arabia mers was more common in males than in females in south korea15
 mers-cov has the same coronavirus lineage as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov16 zumla et al and chowell et al compared the general characteristics between mers and sars8 10 they reported that more than 90 of both mers and sars cases were adults however whereas 645 of mers cases were males 57 of sars cases were females8 9 10 the reason for this apparent difference between the two infections is unknown it may be related to differences in the sex distribution of the total populations at risk of the two infections17 the average age of confirmed mers patients in south korea was 55 years which is a little higher than that reported by zumla et al 50 years8 9 zumla et al also reported a case of mers in a 1 year old although only 2 of cases were in children8 the youngest confirmed case in south korea was a 16-year-old male case no 67 who was the son of case no 4611 12
 the fatality rate for mers in south korea was 199 in contrast the european centre for disease control and prevention reported that the global mers fatality rate between march 2012 and october 2015 was 386 1616 confirmed cases and 624 deaths there were marked regional differences in mortality rates 411 in the middle east 533 in europe and 400 in africa compared with 192 in asian countries3 among probable sars cases that occurred during 2002 and 2003 the global case fatality rate was lower at 96 774 deaths in 8098 cases but again there was considerable regional variation18 one of the reasons why south korea has a lower fatality rate than other mers-outbreak countries may be accessibility to a high level of emergency medical treatment the difference does not appear to be attributable to mutations in the virus19 there was also a difference in the types of underlying conditions associated with fatal mers in south korea compared with saudi arabia in saudi arabia diabetes mellitus 74 of patients was the most common underlying condition in fatal cases followed by end-stage renal disease 52 lung disease 43 and cardiac disease 3920 however in south korea respiratory disease 305 cancer 278 and hypertension 222 were the most common underlying conditions oboho et al reported that 109 973 of 112 patients in the jeddah area of saudi arabia who were not healthcare workers contracted mers through contact with someone in a healthcare facility20 likewise the present study found that 994 of cases were nosocomially acquired the mers infection routes in south korea are characterized by both intra- and interhospital transmission9 cases of community-acquired transmission were not found corroborating the findings of the who report that there was no evidence of transmission outside hospitals in south korea16 21 22 however it was noted that mers testing was only available to patients known to have been in close contact with a confirmed or suspected case as such more casual contacts of mers cases may have been missed because they were not tested however global experience does indicate that mers is predominantly a nosocomially acquired infection18 so restrictions on visitors are likely to play a key role in controlling mers23
 immediately after the mers outbreak in south korea many researchers reported various problems with the south korean governments mers control measures it was reported that south koreas mers outbreak was caused by poor hospital infection control standards and lack of monitoring close contacts which was also the case in saudi arabia19 it was highlighted that public risk communication was delayed because the south korean government prioritized the determination of all details of the outbreak rather than information disclosure this resulted in widespread panic during the mers crisis24 jack pointed out that while the biological basis for the initial failure to contain mers is unclear a number of factors contributed significantly including doctor shopping behaviour ie a patient seeks treatment from various hospitals for the same ailment lack of epidemiology experts the culture of frequent hospital visits and familial care-giving and the south korean governments steadfast stance on keeping information contained25 who experts indicated that problems with the initial spread of mers in south korea included prevalent occurrences among medical staff lack of hospital infection management procedures extremely crowded emergency rooms and multi-bed rooms in some hospitals doctor shopping behaviour and the spread of infection through patients family members or friends during hospital visits26 finally choi et al reported that south koreas initial failure to control mers was caused by south koreas rigid application of mers control guidelines which failed to isolate all close contacts failure to recognize super-spreading events environmental factors such as inadequate ventilation insufficient infectious disease management capacity in secondary hospitals and the south korean governments inadequate crisis management communication4
 many healthcare professionals in south korea reported that the spread of mers in south korea could be characterized by the fact that hospitals acted as the main infection location and by super-spreading events where one case infects a number of others 4 9 10 the occurrence of super-spreading events is known to be determined by physiological factors of the host transmissibility of the pathogen and the environment eg crowding27 lim pointed out that as the mers-cov isolated in south korea did not differ from that isolated in other countries there is a lack of biological evidence to support the occurrence of super-spreading events28 as such super-spreading events must have been caused by environmental factors including the south korean governments inadequate crisis response management other countries should be aware of this in their response to imported mers cases the debate on mers infection handling in south korea continues with many local experts proposing improvement measures locally to prevent future national outbreaks of infectious diseases29 30 31 32 33
 this narrative account of the south korean experience of mers describes some issues that are of local importance alone but also contains some important lessons of wider relevance first the importance of early detection of cases second the role of super spreaders of the virus and third the importance of restricting hospital visitors as a control measure it is also suggested that hospitals need to be prepared for eventualities such as mers such as by ensuring that they have the necessary facilities and equipment for patient isolation for countries such as south korea where medical care is insurance based insurance coverage for infectious diseases should be included in insurance plans to ensure that there are no delays in clinical care none declared  super-spreader businesses and risk of covid-19 transmission purpose the united states has the highest number of confirmed covid-19 cases in the world to date with over 94000 covid-19-related deaths the true risk of a covid-19 resurgence as states prepare to reopen businesses is unknown this paper aims to classify businesses by their risk of transmission and quantify the relationship between the density of super-spreader businesses and covid-19 cases methods we constructed a covid-19 business transmission risk index based upon the frequency and duration of visits and square footage of businesses pre-pandemic in 2019 in 8 states massachusetts rhode island connecticut new hampshire vermont maine new york and california we used this index to classify businesses as super-spreaders then we analyzed the association between the density of super-spreader businesses in a county and the rate of covid-19 cases we performed significance testing using a negative binomial regression the main outcome of interest is the cumulative number of covid-19 cases each week results we found a positive association between the density of super-spreader businesses and covid-19 cases a 1 percentage point increase in the density of super-spreader businesses is associated with 5 higher covid-19 cases all else equal conclusion higher densities of super-spreader businesses are associated with higher rates of covid-19 cases this

reproductive numbers understanding the geographical expansion of urban dengue outbreaks ta-chou ng tzai-hung wen   the basic reproductive number r0 is a fundamental measure used to quantify the transmission potential of an epidemic1 it is defined as the number of infections caused by an index case within a completely susceptible population ie a population in which there is no pre-existing immunity r0 is a summary index suggesting both the intrinsic transmissibility of a pathogen and the infrastructure that allows the disease to spread in a given setting in particular the value of r0 is affected by transmission probability contact rate and duration of infectiousness2 based on deterministic homogenous-mixing epidemic models3 public health practitioners usually regard r0  1 as a useful threshold for ensuring the development of an outbreak referred to as the epidemic threshold4 the health authorities also use r0 for predicting final epidemic size35 and assessing the resources required to contain the outbreak eg determining what proportion of people should be vaccinated2 therefore it is of great practical importance to estimate r0 for a possible outbreak in public health practice the value of r0 is estimated from the initial growth rate of an epidemic based on mechanistic models such as the susceptible-infected-recovered model36 for example r0 has been estimated at approximately 15 for 2009 h1n1 influenza7 at 3 for the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak8 and at 1218 for historical measles outbreaks9 as an epidemic unfolds however the depletion and recovery of the susceptible population cause fluctuating effective transmissibility so the value of r0 cannot reflect the time-varying nature of an epidemic moreover when an epidemic occurs in a realistic contact network r0 can also fail to characterize the transmission potential at the initial stage10 on the other hand the effective reproductive number r is defined as the number of infections caused by any case11 the difference between r and r0 is that the value of r does not depend on the assumption that the population is completely susceptible which is often violated in later stages of an outbreak or in a situation in which the population has been exposed to the pathogen previously therefore r aims to characterize the progression of an epidemic in a realistic scenario intuitively counting the branches of infection on transmission trees ie who infects whom6 precisely quantifies the value of r however doing this is impractical in most circumstances except for confined outbreaks where contact tracing is feasible12 the epidemic curve an illustration of the number of new infections does not encode transmission dynamics and cannot be used to infer r directly the renewal equation11 which describes the temporal transmission relationship between propagating generations of infected cases is therefore proposed to estimate r from incidence data in different epidemic periods more specifically the renewal equation estimates the values of the time-varying effective reproductive number rt defined as the population-level transmission potential at time t1113 in a fully susceptible population early values of rt should approximate r0 but rt is more informative in that it tracks the subsequent evolution of transmission potential during the course of an outbreak the values of rt can also reveal the time when an outbreak was contained by monitoring the epidemic threshold during the 2014 ebola outbreak in west africa rt captured a distinct temporal pattern of transmission potential in different countries signaling the different levels of control measures needed14 as the change in transmission potential is highly correlated to control measures public health practitioners can evaluate the effectiveness of control measures by determining the change in rt after implementation for example sudden drops in rt from 3 to approximately 07 after the issuance of a global alert during the 2003 sars outbreak indicated the effectiveness of the alert15 time-varying effective reproductive numbers can be estimated by the renewal equation with a weighted ratio of infectors and infectees11 the generation interval defined as the infection time interval between a potential infector and an infectee is the major component of the process of determining the temporal weights of possible transmission a major pitfall of the renewal equation method is that it automatically assumes homogeneous mixing of individuals in effect the temporal weight assumes that transmission probability is determined only by the temporal difference in onset of illness between the infector and infectees regardless of possible variations due to geographical and social proximity human mobility and contact patterns are highly structured in the real world1618 and inevitably violate the homogeneous mixing assumption19 studies have demonstrated spatial heterogeneities in the transmission of dengue20 cholera21 influenza22 and foot-and-mouth disease23 recent studies have also shown that spatial distance between cases strongly influences short-term movement24 and hence the spread of these diseases moreover short-range transmission has served the essential mode of disease transmission25 ie patients typically have a higher chance of infecting others nearby although this spatial effect has been considered in the aforementioned studies and in the transmission tree reconstruction of some diseases2627 the effect of spatial distance on the estimation of the effective reproductive number has not yet been explored the spatial relationship between individuals can be utilized to calculate the discriminative transmission potential for each individual fig 1 see the methods section for details neglecting the spatial variation conversely may smooth out heterogeneities in transmission potential obscure high-risk spreaders and hamper the effectiveness of control measures in summary the effect of spatial proximity or distance should be accounted for in the estimation of effective reproductive numbers therefore the objective of this study is to propose such method for quantifying spatially adjusted reproductive numbers that reflects spatial heterogeneity in exposure risk it generates individual-level effective reproductive numbers rj and a summarized indicator for the whole population rt by the transmission probability estimated for all infector-infectee pairs based on both temporal and spatial characteristics temporal weighting functions account for the fact that infected cases can only transmit the disease effectively within a certain time window the generation interval when only temporal weighting is considered our method is equivalent to the renewal equation assuming homogeneous mixing the spatial weighting function on the other hand accounts for the decaying chance of transmission when the distance between individuals increases the value of spatially adjusted rj can provide more information regarding spatial heterogeneities in transmission potential and can better aid in the implementation of control measures data from dengue epidemics in southern taiwan are used to demonstrate the ability of this method to identify early spreaders contributing to the geographic expansion of dengue transmission taiwan 23778n 120930e is an island country at the border of tropical and subtropical climate zones due to its geographic proximity to dengue endemic countries in southeast asia fig 2a dengue outbreaks in taiwan are triggered by imported index cases from endemic regions large outbreaks have occurred in the tropical monsoon regions of southern taiwan particularly in the cities of tainan tn and kaohsiung kh these two large tropical cities feature high temperatures and high humidity high population density and highly urbanized landscapes all of which provide appropriate breeding habitats for aedes aegypti the main vector mosquitoes of dengue virus thus as dengue outbreaks occur frequently in late summer and wane in winter the two cities form natural settings for the repetitive observation of dengue invasion and epidemic propagation dengue fever is listed as a notifiable infectious disease in taiwan this means that physicians are mandated to report suspected cases in which the patient lives in or has a history of travel to a dengue-affected area and has corresponding symptoms including fever rash eye pain leukopenia etc the reported cases are then confirmed by standard laboratory tests including real-time pcr elisa and antigen detection28 these surveillance data are recorded and provided by taiwan centers for disease control ministry of health and welfare29 the dengue database starts in 1998 when the electronic reporting system was implemented and we include all records since 1998-01-01 individual-level information including date of disease onset and x-y coordinates of residence is also provided each pair of residence coordinates is listed as the center of a basic statistical area which is the smallest geographic unit for socioeconomic surveying in taiwan there was a total of 78749 confirmed dengue cases 44 of them were imported cases in taiwan from 1998 to 2017 925 of which occurred in tainan and kaohsiung cities figure 2b shows the historical records of dengue epidemics in taiwan since 1998 the five most severe outbreaks were included in this study among the five outbreaks two occurred in tainan 2007tn 2015tn and three occurred in kaohsiung 2002kh 2014kh 2015kh the sizes of the outbreaks ranged from 22784 cases in 2015tn to 1183 cases in 2011kh generally dengue outbreaks start in june reach their peak around september and end near the end of the year or early the next january in this study we analyzed the largest outbreak 2015tn to demonstrating our method while detailed results for the other four epidemics are presented in our supplementary results of the 22784 total infections in 2015tn only 19 cases 01 were imported from foreign countries suggesting that indigenous transmission was well established in contrast with kaohsiung city very few outbreaks occurred in taiwan before 2015 the renewal equation specifies the relationship between generations of incident cases as shown in eq 1 it can be applied to estimate time-varying effective reproductive numbers due to its simplicity and generality regarding the temporal transmission dynamics1113301documentclass12ptminimal

a total of 22784 cases we divided the outbreak into six stages emerging i growing ii and iii peak plateau iv and decaying v and vi to depict the spatiotemporal evolutions of the outbreak figure 3b shows the adjusted rt and non-adjusted rt of the outbreak these rt curves are median or mean estimates of the adjusted and non-adjusted individual reproductive numbers summarizing the temporal evolution of population-level transmission potential adjusted rt provides further information the shaded area represents the interquartile range iqr of adjusted individual reproductive numbers reflecting the spatial individual heterogeneity of the transmission potential in contrast individual reproductive numbers of incident cases that shared identical dates of illness onset are constants in non-adjusted rt this indicates that the incident cases during this period were highly geographically heterogeneous in their transmission potential the distributions of adjusted rj in these stages are also multimodal and right-skewed which indicates that some incident cases could have higher transmission potential ie super-spreaders figure 3c shows the spatial distributions of incident cases in these stages we can identify the linkages between time-varying reproductive numbers fig 3b and spatial-temporal distributions of incident cases fig 3ac in different stages in the emerging stage the irregular growth of adjusted rt reflects the initial growth of the outbreak with a sporadic distribution of incident cases and a small emerging cluster fig 3c subsequently in the growing stages from stage ii to iii the epidemic curve started to show exponential growth fig 3a the larger iqr of the individual reproductive numbers fig 3b reflects some incident cases with higher transmission potential that occurred and resulted in vigorous expansion of disease clustering fig 3c in the stage of peak plateau stage iv adjusted rt dropped under the epidemic threshold 1 indicating that the outbreak was contained the spatial distributions of cases also show that the clustering areas remained and stopped expanding in sum the time-varying reproductive numbers adjusted rt and non-adjusted rt can reflect the timing of the outbreak containment according to the epidemic threshold the adjusted rt can further reflect the timing of epidemic expansion when the iqr of individual reproductive numbers increases in fig 4 the distributions of individual transmission distance were compared between the two methods non-adjusted and adjusted rj based on the neighborhood transmission setting of adjusted rj the transmission distance of an infector is around 200300 meters and few long-range transmission links longer than 2 kilometers furthermore we used adjusted rj  10 as a threshold to categorize super- adjusted rj  10 and normal- adjusted rj  10 spreaders the figure also shows that long-range transmission links are from super-spreaders the result indicates that dengue cases with high transmissibility have the ability to spread pathogens to geographically distant areas to further explore spatial relationships of super-spreaders and dengue epidemic expansion we illustrated the locations of super-spreaders and clustering tendency of the dengue epidemic during the rapidly growing period stages ii and iii as shown in fig 5 except the very beginning of the stage ii june-25july-6 the figure shows that super-spreaders tend to distribute at or outside the edge of the main clusters from july-06 to august-23 in addition the circle size of the super-spreaders in fig 5 represent their transmission range therefore the locations of larger circles would reflect long-rage transmission occurred at the edge of dengue clusters it implied that the role of super-spreaders could be the drivers of geographic expansion of the dengue epidemic in order to profile the roles of different spreaders in detailed spatial transmissionexpansion process we classified the cases into two types early spreaders and succeeding spreaders early spreaders are regarded as the sources of new emerging clusters and succeeding spreaders are those that come after early spreaders figure 6 presents a succeeding spreader a panel a and an early spreader b panel b in each panel we also compared different methods spatially adjusted and non-adjusted that estimate the transmission probability from a spreader to its potential infectees the time of the incident cases on these maps is the 30th day after the onset day of the given spreader infectees labeled with darker colors have a higher probability of becoming infected by spreader a or b by the non-adjusted method the two spreaders have identical transmission probabilities and individual reproductive number because of the homogenous mixing assumption non-adjusted ra  non-adjusted rb  415 however they should play different roles in the spatial expansion of the outbreak spreader a the succeeding spreader occurred in an ongoing cluster thus this case is unlikely to be the primary source that triggered this local outbreak spreader b the early spreader on the contrary initiated a new cluster where no case had occurred before and the following cases that emerged were centered on spreader b thus a subsequent local outbreak can be logically attributed to spreader b as the primary ancestor the adjusted method left-side maps in fig 6 which takes into account the spatial-temporal relationships of incident cases differentiates the individual reproductive numbers of early and succeeding spreaders adjusted ra  184 adjusted rb  574 it also yields more reasonable spatial transmission potential by upweighting the potential infectees proximity to spreader a in fig 6a to clarify the distinct roles of early and succeeding spreaders in the outbreak expansion process we compared the distributions of adjusted rj between different types of spreaders in fig 7a we found that all the super spreaders adjusted rj  10 are early spreaders and most of succeeding spreaders have low adjusted rj to examine the generalization of this pattern we estimated adjusted rj of dengue cases in top five largest dengue epidemics since 1990 in taiwan including kh2002 tn2007 kh2014 kh2015 tn2015 as shown in fig 7b non-adjusted rj were used as the baseline to control for the fluctuations across different stages of the outbreak the figure showed consistent patterns among these large-scale dengue outbreaks which means early spreaders with high transmissibility can be generally highlighted by the spatially adjusted method the effective time-varying reproductive number is a commonly used indicator for measuring disease transmissibility however the index conventionally does not capture spatial dynamics of disease transmission we proposed a new method of calculating the spatially adjusted effective reproductive number by incorporating a spatial-weighting function that captures the nature of heterogeneous mixing unlike the averaged time-varying reproductive number this method estimates different individual-level reproductive numbers rj for given onset times and locations of dengue infections thus it can reflect spatial heterogeneity in transmission potential among individuals and identify the possible super-spreaders35 with high rj during the rapidly growing period our results also reveal that dengue cases with high transmission potential and long-transmission distance are usually located at the edges of the epidemic foci which means they could be the drivers of further outbreak expansion therefore our proposed method depicts a more detailed spatial-temporal dengue transmission process and identifies the significant role of the edges apart from the epidemic foci which could be the weak spots in disease control and prevention our spatially adjusted method also could further apply to assess individual-level transmission potential of other acute contagious diseases such as influenza and zika virus infection with observed generation interval and the context of neighborhood transmission the effective reproductive number of dengue as estimated in past studies reflected an averaged overall epidemic trend which did not take into account the spatial heterogeneity of transmissibility hsieh36 estimated the effective reproductive number at the initial stage of the 2015tn outbreak to be 684 which is similar to our averaged estimates fig 3b hsiehs study also showed that kaohsiung consistently possessed lower effective reproductive numbers from 129 to 287 implying that tainan city may have epidemiological characteristics such as a lack of herd immunity that make it more prone to dengue transmission than kaohsiung internationally guzzetta25 reported that the time-varying reproductive number of non-endemic urban cities in brazil is much smaller than the estimates from tainan and kaohsiung cities maximum rt is approximately 22 codeco31 and pinho37 also estimated time-varying reproductive numbers in salvador and brazil with a maximum rt of approximately 45 comparing the values of rt among different cities may be subject to possible confounding factors such as weather conditions host immunity and circulating viral strands some studies considered location information to determine reproductive numbers for quantifying transmissibility of foot-and-mouth disease fmd3839 these models considered spatial distribution of farms however it was difficult to capture fmd disease transmission process among animals in other words the time-varying reproductive numbers in these models are difficult to reflect nature course of fmd transmission in terms of implementing general interval and renewal equation furthermore farm-level models for fmd outbreaks can be categorized the farms into infected and susceptible ones to determine relative transmissibility of each farm at a specific time it may be difficult to estimate the amount of susceptible persons living around the infected cases for human infectious diseases such as influenza and dengue fever other studies have also explored spatial heterogeneity by performing stratified analysis of rt with respect to different administrative regions and with respect to region-to-region transmission4041 these studies used a spatial weighting function to emphasize the interregional transmission process but still assumed a homogeneous-mixing model within each region thus these studies did not address the spatial heterogeneous mixing issue when estimating reproductive numbers our study considered individual-level spatial heterogeneity and used the spatially adjusted reproductive number to measure the transmission potential of each individual like the basic reproductive number rj can be regarded as a function of duration of infectiousness incubation period transmission probability vector mosquito density and host-vector contact rate the adjusted rj in this study could reflect vector mosquito density and host-vector contact rate which are also highly heterogeneous in space42 meanwhile the dispersal of vector mosquitoes is largely confined to neighboring areas average radius of 28199 meters43 providing an effective infectious zone of an infector an exponential spatial weighting function herein represents this infectious zone guzzetta25 estimated the mean transmission distance of dengue in a metropolis area to be approximately 127 m and further indicated that an exponential distribution described the data better than a radiation model which is a more dispersed distribution effectively describes human mobility44 kissler et al45 also reported the aptness of the exponential distribution when an outbreak is typically dominated by short-range transmission therefore the exponential spatial weighting function in this study is an appropriate substitute for the effective infectious zone for measuring dengue transmission the exponential distance-decayed function also avoids overestimating the transmission probabilities of infector-infectee pairs with long geographic distances especially for large-scale dengue epidemics in sum areas with high rj are potential risk areas for high dengue transmission knowledge of such areas is important for spatial targeting during dengue epidemics spatial epidemiological studies focused for many years on developing methods for identifying significant disease clustering in time and space such as space-time scan statistics46 or point pattern analysis47 hotspot areas identified are usually regarded as significant risk areas and as high-priority sites for intervention strategies aimed at mitigating an epidemic4849 the significance of the study is to introduce the perspective of individual-level transmission potential to disease risk mapping we found that locations of individuals with high transmission potential are usually located at the edges of growing disease clusters which can easily be neglected when intervention resources focus on epidemic clusters a previous study found that urban villages that were originally at the edge of the city but are now enclosed by urbanized lands act as transfer stations for dengue outbreaks50 in this study we further provide a better understanding of outbreak expansion by categorizing different types of spreaders early spreaders with high transmission potential may initiate new source of infection at the edges of the main cluster resulting in geographic expansion at the exponential growing stages of the outbreak therefore the edge of the outbreak should be a priority of spatial targeting to contain the outbreak regarding both range and magnitude succeeding spreaders are indeed still important in tallying morbidity and fatality however their high-density clustering patterns make them prone to the depletion of local susceptible populations and degenerating transmission potential in summary the center and edges of epidemic clusters play different roles in developing epidemic progression in terms of different types of spreaders succeeding vs early and different patterns of epidemic growth intensifying vs expanding these findings provide important insights for implementing different interventions in the center and on the edges of epidemic clusters there are several limitations to this study first the method of estimating time-varying effective reproductive numbers is a retrospective procedure that uses observed infectee generation to estimate the rj of the infector generation in other words it cannot be used for predicting future epidemic progression in real time nonetheless the method is helpful for understanding the course of an epidemic and studying the possible mechanisms of geographical expansion second this study considers only geographical distance as a factor in transmission potential other factors influence the spatial spreading of dengue among these host heterogeneity including variations in density51 mobility52 and susceptibility53 strongly modulates the transmission dynamic42 and should be considered in further studies finally the spatial weighting function reflects the assumption of distance-decayed properties neighborhood transmission however the assumption may not reflect long-distance transmission54 and complex urban transport and mobility52 the question of how to develop more detailed spatial weighting schemes that capture realistic mobility patterns warrants further investigation  household transmissions of sars-cov-2 in the time of unprecedented travel lockdown in china

2020 china raised the national emergency response to the highest level triggered an unprecedented travel ban starting from the lockdown of wuhan on 23 january and 14 cities nearby wuhan on 24 january and more than 30 provinces thereafter figure 1a although this countrywide travel lockdown was aimed to interrupt case exportations from the epicenter we have estimated 130 95 cri 190 369 high-risk cities that have introduced sars-cov-2 cases prior to wuhans lockdown4 recent studies56 report similar estimates for the rapid geographic expansion of sars-cov-2 these coincide with the frequent reporting of infection events in china outside of hubei province during the three weeks following wuhans lockdown figure 1c since the last week of january 2020 more than 260 chinese cities have implemented intensive non-pharmaceutical controls figure 1b which brought the epidemic under control789 however as of 19 february 2020 this epidemic still has caused 10000 cases in china outside of hubei province to enhance public health preparedness and public awareness chinese health authorities have publicly reported detailed records of confirmed cases since 20 january 2020 this provides a unique resource and an opportunity for understanding the transmission patterns routes and risk factors of the covid-19 epidemic in china 27 provincial and 264 urban health commissions have publicly posted 9120 confirmed case reports online since 20 january 2020 which comprises 727 of all cases confirmed in china outside of hubei province by 19 february table s9 we compiled a line-list database from these reports with extracted demographic characteristics social relationships travel history timelines of potential exposure symptom onset confirmation and hospitalization we obtained the daily population movement data in china between 1 january and 13 february 2020 from baidu qianxi web portal httpsqianxibaiducom we estimated the daily number of passengers leaving each province by using the migration scale index for moving out of that province each day more details on our real-time mobility and line-list case data are provided in supplemental material and will be available at our github we identified 1407 infection events with known social relationships for each infection event we term the infector the primary case and the infectee the secondary case we also consider connected chains of confirmed cases we term the original case the index and the entire chain of cases including the index the transmission cluster figure 2a we stratify infection events by household versus non-household transmissions where household includes any infection event among members within the same family eg between parents and children and non-household include all others eg colleagues classmates the numbers of household 662 and non-household 745 infection events are almost even for each infection event with known symptom onset timelines we compute the serial interval ie the number of days between the reported symptom onset date for the primary case and that for the secondary case we estimate the distribution of serial intervals by fitting a normal distribution to 679 infection events with known serial intervals supplemental material the age-stratified hazard of infection for household relative to non-household contacts is estimated by the ratio between the probability that a secondary case of age group b was infected by a primary case of age group a within the same household and the probability that a secondary case of age group b was infected by a primary case of age group a outside of households gender-specific hazard of infection is measured similarly supplemental material we reconstructed 643 transmission clusters from 1407 infection events figure 2a the sizes of 587 transmission clusters are smaller than 5 whereas the size of the largest cluster exceeds 20 we observed 34 primary cases acting as super spreaders stratification by household shows that 356 92 and 34 primary cases infected only 1 member 2 members and at least 3 familial members within households respectively 276 78 and 75 primary cases infected 1 2 and at least 3 secondary cases outside households respectively figure 2b only 5 household super-spreading events were observed the mean serial interval is estimated to be 495 days standard deviation 524 days within households and 519 days standard deviation 528 days for non-household transmissions notably 26 of 339 household- and 29 of 340 non-household infection events reported negative-valued serial intervals implying pre-symptomatic transmission the hazard of being infected within households is higher for age groups of young 18 and elderly 65 people whereas the hazard of being infected outside of households is higher for age groups between 18 and 64 years table 1a primary cases of elderly 65 people are more prone to cause household infections hazard of infection between different genders is higher for households than non-household transmission table 1b we reconstructed 1407 infection events formed 643 transmission clusters from 9120 covid-19 cases confirmed in china outside of hubei province as of 19 february 2020 the entire database will be available at our github although super-spreading events have been reported by media reports and a recent study11 which focuses on special settings eg restaurant chalet before february 2020 systematic analyses with a sufficiently large sample size is lacking here we identified 34 primary cases classified as super-spreader majority of the super-spreading events involve more non-household transmissions than household transmissions this indicates the importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions eg cancellation of public gatherings limited access of public services as the potential mitigation strategies see table s2 household study helps identify risk factors for certain demographic groups12 the age-stratified and gender-specific hazard of infection suggests a higher risk of infection within households for age groups of young 18 and elderly 65 and female people the higher risk of being infected outside of households for male people of age between 18 and 64 years indicates their role in driving household secondary infections in the households included in our data perhaps because these were travelers from wuhan of working age we identified 55 infection events 4 with the secondary case reporting symptom onset prior to the primary case which is consistent with our preliminary analysis4 and recent clinical reports1314 negative-valued serial intervals indicate the potential occurrence of pre-symptomatic transmissions we estimate that the mean serial interval is 5 days for both household and non-household infections which is considerably shorter than the mean serial interval estimated for sars eg 84 days15 and mers eg 76 days 16 these evidences impose a significant barrier to case identification and management our findings have several limitations first the size of each household and the primary cases without secondary infections are unknown from original disclosures this may give biased estimates if we estimate the household reproduction number and secondary attack rate from raw data field surveys will be helpful to adjust biases second the information on nosocomial infections is unknown from original disclosures so that the observation of super-spreading events may be less common from our dataset   jian xiao min fang qiong chen bixiu he min 2  fang  words count 150 main text words count 3209 in the recent two decades three global viral infectious diseases severe acute  viral infectious diseases have always been a threat to human survival in the recent two decades three global viral infectious diseases severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and the current coronavirus disease 1 2 3  have occurred worldwide and all the pathogens are the types of coronavirus 4  the pathogen of sars is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 5  it first occurred in november 2002 and originated from guangdong province southern china 6  according to the aggregate data of who a total of 8096 cases were reported resulting in 774 deaths the case-fatality ratio is 956 in 26 countries on 5 continents during the sars epidemic 7  the pathogen of mers is named as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov by the coronavirus study group csg 8  the virus was first isolated from a patient that died of the disease in june 2012 in jeddah saudi arabia 9  according to the summary of who at the end of january 2020 a total of 2519 confirmed mers cases including 866 associated deaths the case-fatality rate is 3438 have been reported globally 10  china 11  soon afterwards based on phylogeny taxonomy and established practice the csg named the pathogen of covid-19 as sars-cov-2 12  as of 30 april 2020 a total of 3024059 confirmed cases have been reported globally including 208112 deaths the case-fatality ratio is about 688 13  healthcare workers hcws are defined as personnel responsible for direct treatment care service or help of patients mainly consisting of doctors and nurses as well as physiotherapists laboratory technicians respiratory therapists housekeepers or even medical waste handlers 14 15 16  hcws need to be in close contact with these virus-infected patients and their contaminated environments at work so they are at great risk of job exposure in this study we aim to review the infection status of hcws in the past battles of sars and mers and to summarize the infection status 18  most of the probable sars cases 5714 3663 identified in the vietnam outbreak were hcws all of which occurred in a private hospital in hanoi 19  and lack of sars transmission among the public hcws 20  l clifford mcdonald and colleagues 21 reported that 164 hcws in the greater toronto area were infected with sars which is more than the total number of infected hcw in canada as summarized by who table 1  however the reason for the inconsistency in the total number of these reports may be that the former involved suspected cases  conducting a retrospective analysis therefore it can be speculated that the current number of hcw cases infected with mers may be more than 450 table 2  south korea has the largest number of mers infections outside saudi arabia in the world with 186 confirmed cases 26  among them 25 cases were occupationally acquired by hcws accounting for 1344 25186 of total infection cases in south korea 27  table 2  the super-spreader of mers-cov is the main cause of mers outbreak and infection of hcw in south korea having followed a single patient exposure in a hospital in south korea sun young cho and colleagues 28 found 82 individuals were infected with mers-cov from a super-spreader and 8 of them were hcws  china has 84369 covid-19 cases with of 4643 deaths as of 30 april 2020 13  since the outbreak of covid-19 the infection among hcws has been reported gradually in china by extracting data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 wei-jie guan and colleagues found a total of 35 about 38 of 1099 confirmed cases are hcws 29  dawei wang and colleagues reported that 40 hcw infected cases among 138 hospitalized patients 30  hospital is the important place for secondary transmission of sars mers and covid-19 14 38 39  densely staffed and packed with public facilities and people 41  studies suggest that when no eye protection was worn sars-cov-2 could also possibly be spread by aerosol contact with conjunctiva and cause infection of hcws 42 43 44  close proximity between patients and ophthalmologists during slit lamp examination intraocular pressure measurement direct ophthalmoscopy pupillary dilatation and others may pose an infectious risk to ophthalmologists 44  hence these factors may increase the risk of cross-infection between hcws and patients in the department of ophthalmology nosocomial transmission of sars mers and covid-19 can be categorized as patient-to-patient patient-to-hcw hcw-to-patient and hcw-to-hcw confirmed or suspected cases of these infectious diseases can be physically separated by setting up isolation wards or establishing isolation hospitals to avoid patient-to-patient transmission 38 45 46  therefore the subsequent key issue that needs to be persistently considered solved and prevented is how to prevent the transmission of patient-to-hcw are facing the super-spreader whose transmission ability is simply overwhelming 47 48 49  therefore how to identify the super-spreaders as early as possible is of vital importance as to reducing the chance of patient-to-patient and patient-to-hcw transmission hand hygiene is recognized as an easy and effective way to prevent the spread of respiratory infections that include sars mers and covid-19 38 50 51 52  correspondingly wearing masks is the simplest and most important ppe to prevent infection of these infectious diseases both surgical and n95 masks can effectively prevent hcws from being infected with sars mers and covid-19 however if conditions permit wearing n95 masks maybe relatively better 53 54 55 56 57  other ppe such as gloves hats protective clothing isolation clothing and others are also important for hcws to prevent infection depending on the working environment improving the compliance of using ppe and standardizing the putting on and taking off process of these ppes can better protect hcws by investigating the frontline of hcws combating sars cindy w c tam and colleagues reported that the stress and psychological distress among hcws were high accounting for 68 and 57 respectively 58  robert maunder also reported that a high level of distress was experienced by 29-35 of hcws and the relevant contextual factors were having contact with sars patients being a nurse and having children 59  similarly study conducted by namhee oh and colleagues reported that high stress had also shown in hcws engaged in patient nursing during the mers outbreak 60  dae hyun um and colleagues found that 266 doctors involved in mers care showed symptoms of depression 61  recently jinghua li and colleagues 62 reported the prevalence of depression j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f patients were associated with a higher risk of depression anxiety insomnia and distress hcws were anxious regarding their safety and reported psychological effects from mortality reports from covid-19 infection 64  therefore hospital administrators need to pay sufficient attention to and ease the stress and psychological distress on frontline hcws fighting the covid-19 epidemic previous studies have found that some hcws developed post-traumatic stress syndrome after coping with sars or mers outbreaks 65 66 67 68  because of perceived risk of fatality from sars increased work stress and affected social relationships some hcws were even considered switching or resigning from their job 69  these previous evidences remind hospital managers that during the outbreak of covid-19 the pandemic of covid-19 gave medical students a big practical lesson the chinese ministry of education has postponed the spring start of colleges and universities and discourages medical students from returning to hospitals for internships before the outbreak is under control 75  italy government has announced a plan to add 20000 new hcws to meet the demand to fight against covid-19 and called on students who have completed their medical degrees and are in the final year of specialist training to participate 76  the england chief medical officer has announced that the final year medical students may have their duty rights extended 77  anyway governments have made appropriate arrangements for medical students in their countries according to their own epidemic situation however on the other hand we also need to consider whether the covid-19 epidemic has affected the future career planning of medical students and whether it has caused a psychological burden and discouraged them from engaging in the medical industry in the future in the face of the current global epidemic disaster and alike major outbreaks that may also occur in the future we should encourage medical students in a suitable way to strengthen their confidence in the medical industry and encourage young people to choose to study medicine   super-spreading events and contribution to transmission of mers sars and covid-19 ja al-tawfiq aj rodriguez-morales   there is no clear definition for the term super-spreader or super-spreading event the world health organization refers to a super-spreader as a patient or an event that may transmit infection to a larger number of individuals than is usual by one individual or event in the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars situation a super-spreading event was defined as the transmission of sars to at 8 contacts and other authors defined this as individuals infecting an unusually large number of secondary cases 12 a super-spreading event could merely be defined as an event in which one patient infects far more people than an average patient does which is estimated by the basic reproduction number r0 a super-spreading event was recognized during the sars outbreak when a flight attendant infected more than 100 patients in singapore 3 in the situation of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov one patient infected 82 individuals during his course of illness during an outbreak in south korea 4 this index case in the republic of korea resulted in 27 secondary cases one of these cases infected an additional 24 tertiary cases and a third patient caused 73 tertiary cases 5 in the current coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic the third british man contracted sars-cov-2 at a conference in singapore and then travelled to france and stayed with family in a ski chalet alpine resort five of his contacts tested positive 6 in south korea 37 cases were linked to the religious sect the shincheonji church of jesus there are multiple explanations for the occurrence of super-spreading events including immune suppression increased disease severity and viral load asymptomatic individuals and extensive social interactions 7 individuals with immune suppression may shed virus at a higher level and for a longer duration and may have atypical presentation 8 patients with severe disease may have higher viral loads and thus are more likely to shed higher infectious doses in one study of mers-cov critically ill patients had a longer duration of transmission and shedding of the virus 9 another explanation is that super-spreading events may occur because individuals with no or mild symptoms may go unrecognized and no measures are implemented such cases would then lead to widespread dissemination of the virus before recognition and application of infection control measures the contribution of asymptomatic individuals to the spread of coronavirus is not well understood serologic testing in the case of sars-cov showed a positive rate of 13 in asymptomatic individuals compared with 82 in severe disease and 4 in those with mild symptoms 10 one study indicated that an asymptomatic patient with covid-19 transmitted the sars-cov-2 to another patient in germany 11 another possibility is that super-spreading may be the result of increased interaction between the index case and other people so an individual who has multiple and extensive social life is more likely to infect individuals than the person who has limited social interaction thus it is imperative to practice social distancing to flatten the curve during an epidemic children may be at higher risk of being asymptomatic and thus may shed the virus and cause infection in other people however previous studies of sars and mers did not reveal a high rate of childhood infection one study of 1250 patients showed that paediatric cases constituted 33 in those aged 10 years and that serologic assay was positive in 01 of children compared to 07 overall 12 another possible contributing factor is variability in viral shedding super-spreading events have been linked to extensive and prolonged viral shedding and in sub-optimal infection control 13 additional factors that might also contribute to a super-spreading event include prolonged duration of exposure the practice of seeking care at multiple healthcare facilities frequent inter-hospital transfer and large numbers of contacts 14 a higher viral load more environmental contacts and more interpersonal contacts and a complex network of interactions made by individuals may also play further roles in super-spreading events in conclusion the occurrence of super-spreading events has contributed to the transmission of sars mers-cov and sars-cov-2 there are multiple factors contributing to this event including immune suppression increased disease severity and viral load asymptomatic individuals and extensive social interactions none none declared  understanding and modeling the super-spreading events of the middle east respiratory syndrome outbreak in korea byung chun chul   super-spreading events sse have been reported for many infectious disease outbreaks such as measles 1 tuberculosis 2 ebola 3 and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 456 the sars outbreaks in singapore hong kong and china in 2003 particularly made the importance of sse evident in understanding transmission dynamics predicting models and containing outbreaks however the criteria of sse and their effects on outbreak control measures are still unclear though there is an arbitrary definition for sse 56 there is no consistent and generally accepted definition yet 7 lloyd-smith et al introduced  the individual reproductive number which is the expected number of secondary cases transmitted by a particular primary case to explain a sse with epidemiological modeling and successfully show that sse are not exceptional events but are normal features of disease spread as observed from the right-hand tail of a distribution of  7 in a traditional epidemic model the variation of  is ignored and   r0 for all cases yielding z  poisson r0 where z is the number of secondary infections caused by each case and r0 is the basic reproductive number lloyd-smith et al generated a general model z  negative binomial r0 k where  is gamma distributed with the mean r0 and dispersion parameter k the lesser the value of k is the greater is the heterogeneity of  after fitting these models to the sars outbreaks in singapore and beijing they found that the negative binomial model was unequivocally favored over other models for example k in the sars outbreak in singapore was estimated as 016 with the negative binomial model which meant that  was highly over-dispersed results showed that a majority of sars cases 73 were barely infectious   1 but a small proportion 6 were highly infectious   8 7 according to their findings an infectious disease with a large individual variation of infectiousness  shows infrequent but explosive epidemics after the introduction of a single case they also defined a super-spreader as any infected individual who infects more than the 99th percentile of the poisson r distribution where r is the effective reproductive number of a disease sse also played a crucial role in the middle east respiratory syndrome mers outbreak in korea in 2015 the outbreak could be summarized as an explosive epidemic by infrequent super-spreaders the number of secondary cases in the transmission tree was extremely skewed among 186 confirmed cases 166 cases 892 did not lead to any secondary cases but 5 27 super-spreaders lead to 154 secondary cases the imported index case was a super-spreader who transmitted the mers virus to 28 people referred to as secondary cases and 3 of these secondary cases became super-spreaders who infected 84 23 and 7 people respectively eighty-four secondary cases resulting from a single case is one of the largest numbers observed in a sse since the sars outbreak in prince of wales hospital in hong kong none of the super-spreaders in the mers outbreak in korea was a healthcare worker fitting a negative binomial distribution to the korean mers data using the r statistical package provided maximum likelihood estimates of the mean basic reproductive number r0  093 95 ci 013 175 and the dispersion parameter k  003 95 ci 001 004 the estimated value of k was much lesser than 1 suggesting that individual infectivity was highly over-dispersed 7 the k value of the mers outbreak was even lesser than that of the sars k  016 7 and ebola k  018 3 outbreaks fig 1 shows the empirical and theoretical density distributions and the cumulative density function where r0  093 and k  003 some remaining big questions include what is the effect of sse on predictive modeling and the public health measures used to control outbreaks how we can identify super-spreaders and make practical models including sse 489 what determines the heterogeneity of individual infectivity in a certain outbreak is unclear stein summarized the factors that may shape sse as follows host factors including physiological behavioral and immunological factors pathogen factors including virulence and co-infection and environmental factors including crowding misdiagnosis inter-hospital transfer and airflow dynamics that influence the heterogeneity of infection 9 these lists of factors may be incomplete but they seem to explain the sse in the korean mers outbreak of 2015 the primary goal of control strategies was to reduce reproductive numbers and the serial changes of time-dependent generational and case reproductive numbers during the mers outbreak in korea were estimated to evaluate the effect of counter-measures 10 sse added a further complication and suggested inadequacies in the traditional approach 7811 sse played a major role in spreading infections like sars and mers and the prevention and control measures for sse should be central in controlling such outbreaks 4711 one missed super-spreader could cause a new outbreak lloyd-smith et al showed that individual-specific strategies for example isolation of the infected individuals were more likely to exterminate an emerging disease than population-wide interventions such as advising an entire population to reduce the behaviors associated with transmission 711 according to the model proposed by lloyd-smith et al isolating infected individuals increased the heterogeneity of infectiousness and when the variation of infectiousness was large extinction occurred rapidly 711 by taking advantage of heterogeneity control measures could be directed towards the smaller group of highly infectious cases or the high-risk groups understanding of sse is tremendously important to make prediction models and plan prevention and control strategies for outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases including mers we could gain a better understanding of heterogeneity parameters and their associated factors by analyzing and modeling the epidemic data of the mers outbreak in korea  importance of interaction structure and stochasticity for epidemic spreading a covid-19 case study gerrit gromann michael backenkhler verena wolf  in the recent covid-19 pandemic computer simulations are used to predict the evolution of the virus propagation and to evaluate the prospective effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions as such the corresponding mathematical models and their simulations are central tools to guide political decision-making typically ode-based models are considered in which fractions of infected and healthy individuals change deterministically and continuously over time in this work we translate an ode-based covid-19 spreading model from literature to a stochastic multi-agent system and use a contact network to mimic complex interaction structures we observe a large dependency of the epidemics dynamics on the structure of the underlying contact graph which is not adequately captured by existing odemodels for instance existence of super-spreaders leads to a higher infection peak but a lower death toll compared to interaction structures without super-spreaders overall we observe that the interaction structure has a crucial impact on the spreading dynamics which exceeds the effects of other parameters such as the basic reproduction number r0 we conclude that deterministic models fitted to covid-19 outbreak data have limited predictive power or may even lead to wrong conclusions while stochastic models taking interaction structure into account offer different and probably more realistic epidemiological insights  on march 11th 2020 the world health organization who officially declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 to be a pandemic by this date at the latest curbing the spread of the virus then became a major worldwide concern given the lack of a vaccine the international community relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions npis such as social distancing mandatory quarantines or border closures such intervention strategies however inflict high costs on society hence for political decision-making it is crucial to forecast the spreading dynamics and to estimate the effectiveness of different interventions mathematical and computational modeling of epidemics is a long-established research field with the goal of predicting and controlling epidemics it has developed epidemic spreading models of many different types data-driven and mechanistic as well as deterministic and stochastic approaches ranging over many different temporal and spatial scales see 49 15 for an overview computational models have been calibrated to predict the spreading dynamics of the covid-19 pandemic and influenced public discourse most models and in particular those with high impact are based on ordinary differential equations odes in these equations the fractions of individuals in certain compartments eg infected and healthy change continuously and deterministically over time and interventions can be modeled by adjusting parameters in this paper we compare the results of covid-19 spreading models that are based on odes to results obtained from a different class of models stochastic spreading processes on contact networks we argue that virus spreading models taking into account the interaction structure of individuals and reflecting the stochasticity of the spreading process yield a more realistic view on the epidemics dynamic if an underlying interaction structure is considered not all individuals of a population meet equally likely as assumed for ode-based models a wellestablished way to model such structures is to simulate the spreading on a network structure that represents the individuals of a population and their social contacts effects of the network structure are largely related to the epidemic threshold which describes the minimal infection rate needed for a pathogen to be able to spread over a network 37  in the network-free paradigm the basic reproduction number r 0  which describes the mean number of susceptible individuals infected by patient zero determines the evolution of the spreading process the value r 0 depends on both the connectivity of the society and the infectiousness of the pathogen in contrast in the network-based paradigm the interaction structure given by the network and the infectiousness given by the infection rate are decoupled here we focus on contact networks as they provide a universal way of encoding real-world interaction characteristics like super-spreaders grouping of different parts of the population eg senior citizens or children with different contact patterns as well as restrictions due to spatial conditions and mobility and household structures moreover models based on contact networks can be used to predict the efficiency of interventions 38 34 5  here we analyze in detail a network-based stochastic model for the spreading of covid-19 with respect to its differences to existing ode-based models and the sensitivity of the spreading dynamics on particular network features we calibrate both ode-models and stochastic models with interaction structure to the same basic reproduction number r 0 or to the same infection peak and compare the corresponding results in particular we analyze the changes in the effective reproduction number over time for instance early exposure of superspreaders leads to a sharp increase of the reproduction number which results in a strong increase of infected individuals we compare the times at which the number of infected individuals is maximal for different network structures as well as the death toll our results show that the interaction structure has a major impact on the spreading dynamics and in particular important characteristic values deviate strongly from those of the ode model in the last decade research focused largely on epidemic spreading where interactions were constrained by contact networks ie a graph representing the individuals as nodes and their connectivity as edges many generalizations eg to weighted adaptive temporal and multi-layer networks exist 31 44  here we focus on simple contact networks without such extensions spreading characteristics on different contact networks based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible sis or susceptible-infected-recovered sir compartment model have been investigated intensively in such models each individual node successively passes through the individual stages compartments for an overview we refer the reader to 35  qualitative and quantitative differences between network structures and network-free models have been investigated in 22 2  in contrast this work considers a specific covid-19 spreading model and focuses on those characteristics that are most relevant for covid-19 and which have to the best of our knowledge not been analyzed in previous work sis-type models require knowledge of the spreading parameters infection strength recovery rate etc and the contact network which can partially be inferred from real-world observations currently for covid-19 inferred data seems to be of very poor quality 24  however while the spreading parameters are subject to a broad scientific discussion publicly available data which could be used for inferring a realistic contact network practically does not exist therefore real-world data on contact networks are rare 30 45 23 32 43 and not available for large-scale populations a reasonable approach is to generate the data synthetically for instance by using mobility and population data based on geographical diffusion 46 17 36 3  for instance this has been applied to the influenza virus 33  due to the major challenge of inferring a realistic contact network most of these works however focus on how specific network features shape the spreading dynamics literature abounds with proposed models of the covid-19 spreading dynamics very influential is the work of neil ferguson and his research group that regularly publishes reports on the outbreak eg 11  they study the effects of different interventions on the outbreak dynamics the computational modeling is based on a model of influenza outbreaks 19 12  they present a very high-resolution spatial analysis based on movement-data air-traffic networks etc and perform sensitivity analysis on the spreading parameters but to the best of our knowledge not on the interaction data interaction data were also inferred locally at the beginning of the outbreak in wuhan 4 or in singapore 40 and chicago 13  models based on community structures however consider isolated parts of cities and are of limited significance for large-scale model-based analysis of the outbreak dynamic another work focusing on interaction structure is the modeling of outbreak dynamics in germany and poland done by bock et al 6  the interaction structure within households is modeled based on census data inter-household interactions are expressed as a single variable and are inferred from data they then generated representative households by re-sampling but remain vague on many details of the method in particular they only use a single value to express the rich types of relationships between individuals of different households a more rigorous model of stochastic propagation of the virus is proposed by arenas et al 1  they take the interaction structure and heterogeneity of the population into account by using demographic and mobility data they analyze the model by deriving a mean-field equation mean-field equations are more suitable to express the mean of a stochastic process than other ode-based methods but tend to be inaccurate for complex interaction structures moreover the relationship between networked-constrained interactions and mobility data remains unclear other notable approaches use sir-type methods but cluster individuals into age-groups 39 28  which increases the models accuracy rader et al 41 combined spatial- urbanization- and census-data and observed that the crowding structure of densely populated cities strongly shaped the epidemics intensity and duration in a similar way a meta-population model for a more realistic interaction structure has been developed 8 without considering an explicit network structure the majority of research however is based on deterministic network-free sir-based ode-models for instance the work of jos loureno et al 29 infers epidemiological parameters based on a standard sir model similarly dehning et al 9 use an sir-based ode-model but the infection rate may change over time they use their model to predict a suitable time point to loosen npis in germany khailaie et al analyze how changes in the reproduction number mimicking npis affect changes in the epidemic dynamics using epidemic simulations 25  where a variant of the deterministic network-free sir-model is used and modified to include states compartments for hospitalized deceased and asymptotic patients otherwise the method is conceptually very similar to 29 9 and the authors argue against a relaxation of npis in germany another popular work is the online simulator covidsim 1  the underlying method is also based on a network-free sir-approach 50 51  however the role of an interaction structure is not discussed and the authors explicitly state that they believe that the stochastic effects are only relevant in the early stages of the outbreak a very similar method has been developed at the german robert-koch-institut rki 7  jianxi luo et al proposed an ode-based sir-model 1 available at covidsimeu all rights reserved no

postpandemic future by kissler et al 27  some groups also reside to branching processes which are inherently stochastic but not based on a complex interaction structure 21 42  a very popular class of epidemic models is based on the assumption that during an epidemic individuals are either susceptible s infected i or recoveredremoved r the mean number of individuals in each compartment evolves

may 8 2020  httpsdoiorg1011012020050520091736 doi medrxiv preprint each node represents one individual or other entities of interest at each point in time each node occupies a compartment for instance s i or r moreover nodes can only receive or transmit infections from neighboring nodes according to the edges of the graph for the general case with m possible compartments this yields a state space of size m n  where n is the number of nodes the jump times until events happen are typically assumed to follow an exponential distribution note that in the ode model residual residence times in the compartments are not tracked which naturally corresponds to the exponential distribution in the network model hence the underlying stochastic process is a continuous-time markov chain ctmc 26  the extension to non-markovian semantics is trivial we illustrate the three-compartment case in fig 1  the transition rates of the ctmc are such that an infected node transmits infections at rate  hence the rate at which a susceptible node is infected is neighi where neighi is the number of its infected direct neighbours spontaneous recovery of a node occurs at rate  the size of the state space renders a full solution of the model infeasible and approximations of the mean-field 14 or monte-carlo simulations are common ways to analyze the process general differences to the ode model this aforementioned formalism yields some fundamental differences to network-free ode-based approaches the most distinct difference to network-free ode-based approaches is the decoupling of infectiousness and interaction structure the infectiousness  ie the infection rate is assumed to be a parameter expressing how contagious a pathogen inherently is it encodes the probability of a virus transmission if two people meet that is it is independent from the social interactions of individuals it might however depend on hygiene masks etc the influence of social contacts is expressed in the potentially time-varying connectivity of the graph loosely speaking it encodes the possibility that two individuals meet in the ode-approach both are combined in the basic reproduction number note that throughout this manuscript we use  to denote the infectiousness of covid-19 as an instantaneous transmission rate another important difference is that ode-models consider fractions of individuals in each compartment in the network-based paradigm we model absolute numbers of entities in each compartment and extinction of the epidemic may happen with positive probability while ode-models are agnostic to the actual population size in network-based models increasing the population by adding more nodes inevitably changes the dynamics another important connection between the two paradigms is that if the network topology is a complete graph resp clique then the ode-model gives an accurate approximation of the expected fractions of the network-based model in systems biology this assumption is often referred to as well-stirredness in the limit of an infinite graph size the approximation approaches the true mean all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission was not certified by peer review is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity  to transform an ode-model to a network-based model one can simply keep rates relating to spontaneous transitions between compartments as these transitions do not depend on interactions eg recovery at rate  or an exposed node becoming infected translating the infection rate is more complicated in odemodels one typically has given an infection rate and assumes that each infected individual can infect susceptible ones to make the model invariant to the actual number of individuals one typically divides the rate by the population size or assumes the population size is one and the odes express fractions naturally in a contact network we do not work with fractions but each node relates to one entity here we propose to choose an infection rate such that the network-based model yields the same basic reproduction number r 0 as the ode-model the basic reproduction number describes the excepted number of individuals that an infected person infects in a completely susceptible population we calibrate our model to this starting point of the spreading process where there is a single infected node patient zero we assume that r 0 is either explicitly given or can implicitly be derived from an ode-based model specification hence when we pick a random node as patient zero we want it to infect on average r 0 susceptible neighbors all neighbors are susceptible at that point in time before it recovers or dies let us assume that like in aforementioned sir-model infectious node becomes infect their susceptible neighbors with rate  and that an infectious node loses its infectiousness by dying recovering or quarantining with rate  according to the underlying ctmc semantics of the network model each susceptible neighbor gets infected with probability   26  note that we only take direct infections form patient zero into account and for simplicity assume all neighbors are only infected by patient zero hence when patient zero has k neighbors the expected number of neighbors it infects is k    since the mean degree of the network is k mean  the expected number of nodes infected by patent zero is now we can calibrate  to relate to any desired r 0  that is note that we generally assume that r 0  1 and that no isolates nodes with no neighbors exists in the graph which implies k mean  1 hence by construction it is not possible to have an r 0 which is larger than or equal to the average number of neighbors in the network in contrast in the deterministic paradigm this relationship is given by the equation cf 29 9  note that the recovery rate  is identical in the ode-and network-model we can translate the infection rate of an ode-model to a corresponding networkbased stochastic model with the equation while keeping r 0 fixed in the limit of an infinite complete network this yields to lim n   ode n  which is equivalent to the effective infection rate in the ode-model ode n for population size n cf eq 1  example consider a network where each node has exactly 5 neighbors a 5regular graph and let r 0  2 we also assume that the recovery rate is   1 which then yields  ode  2 the probability that a random neighbor of patient zero becomes infected is 2 5     which gives   2 3  it is trivial to extent the compartments and transitions for instance by including an exposed compartment for the time-period where an individual is infected but not yet infectious the derivation of r 0 remains the same the only the only requirement is the existence of a distinct infection and recovery rate respectively in the next section we discuss a more complex case we consider a network-based model that is strongly inspired by the ode-model used in 25  we document it in fig 2  we use the same compartments and transition-types but simplify the notation compared to 25 to make the intuitive meaning of the variables clearer 3  we denote the compartments by c  s e c i h u r d where each node can be susceptibles exposed e a carrier c infected i hospitalized h in the intensive care unit u dead d or recovered r exposed agents are already infected but symptom-free and not infectious carriers are also symptomfree but already infectious infected nodes show symptoms and are infectious therefore we assume that their infectiousness is reduced by a factor of    1 sick people will reduce their social activity individuals that are hospitalized or in the icu are assumed to be properly quarantined and cannot infect others note that accurate spreading parameters are very difficult to infer in general and the high number of undetected cases complicate the problem further in the current pandemic here we choose values that are within the ranges listed in 25  where the ranges are rigorously discussed and justified we document them in table 1  we remark that there is a high amount of uncertainty in the spreading parameters however our goal is not a rigorous fit to data but rather a comparison of network-free ode-models to stochastic models with an underlying network structure note that the mean number of days in a compartment is the inverse of the cumulative instantaneous rate to leave that compartment for instance the mean residence time in compartment h is as a consequence of the race condition of the exponential distribution 47  r h modulates the probability of entering the successor compartment that is with probability r h  the successor compartment will be r and not u inferring the infection rate  for a fixed r 0 is somewhat more complex than in the previous section because this model admits two compartments for infectious agents we first consider the expected number of nodes that a randomly chosen patient zero infects while being in state c we denote the corresponding basic reproduction number by r 0  we calibrate the only unknown parameter  accordingly the relationships from the previous section remain valid we explain the relation to r 0 when taking c and i into account in appendix a substituting  by  c gives naturally it is extremely challenging to reconstruct large-scale contact-networks based on data here we test different types of contact networks with different features which are likely to resemble important real-world characteristics the contact networks are specific realizations ie variates of random graph models different graph models highlight different potential features of the real-world interaction structure the number of nodes ranges from 100 to 10 5  we only use strongly connected networks where each node is reachable from all other nodes we refer to 10 or the networkx 18 documentation for further information about the network models discussed in the sequel we provide a schematic visualization in fig 3  we consider erds-rnyi er random graphs as a baseline where each pair of nodes is connected with a certain fixed probability we also compute results for watts-strogatz ws random networks they are based on a ring topology with random re-wiring the re-wiring yields to a small-world property of the network colloquially this means that one can reach each node from each other node with a small number of steps even when the number of nodes increases we further consider geometric random networks gn where nodes are randomly sampled in an euclidean space and randomly connected such that nodes closer to each other have a higher connection probability we also consider barabsi-albert ba random graphs that are generated using a preferential attachment mechanism among nodes and graphs generated using the configuration model cm-pl which are-except from being constrained all rights reserved no reuse allowed without permission

results to those of the ode are expected we are interested in the relationship between the contact network structure r 0  the height and time point of the infection-peak and the number of individuals

solution of the corresponding stochastic network-based model using monte-carlo simulations code will be made available 4  we investigate the evolution of mean fractions in each compartment over time the evolution of the so-called effective reproduction number and the influence of the infectiousness  setup we used contact networks with n  1000 nodes except for the complete graph where we used 100 nodes to generate samples of the stochastic spreading process we utilized event-driven simulation similar to the rejection-free version in 16  the simulation started with three random seeds nodes in compartment c and with an initial fraction of 31000 for the ode model one thousand simulation runs were performed on a fixed variate of a random graph we remark that results for other variates were very similar hence for better comparability we refrained from taking an average over the random graphs the parameters to generate a graph are er k mean  6 ws k  4 numbers of neighbors p  02 re-wire

thereby we analyze how well certain network structures generally support the spread of covid-19 the evolution of the mean fraction of nodes in each compartment is illustrated in fig 4 and fig 5  based on the monte-carlo simulations we analyzed how the number r t of neighbors that an infectious node infects changes over time cf fig 6  hence r t is the effective reproduction number at day t conditioned on the survival of the epidemic until t for t  0 the estimated effective reproduction number always starts around the same value and matched the theoretical prediction independent of the network r 0  18 yields r 0  205 cf appendix a in fig 6 we see that the evolution of r t differs tremendously for different contact networks unsurprisingly r t decreases on the complete graph cg as

around 1 in most parts the sharp decrease in the end stems from the end of the simulation being reached this indicates that the epidemic slowly burns through the network in contrast in networks that admit super-spreaders cm-pl hh and also ba it is principally possible for r t to increase for the cm-pl network we have a very early and intense peak of the infection while the number of individuals ultimately affected by the virus and consequently the death toll remains comparably small when we remove the super-spreaders from the network while keeping the same r 0  the death toll and the time point of the peak increase plot not shown note that the high value of r t in fig 6 c in the first days results from the fact that super-spreaders become exposed which later infect a large number of individuals as there are very few super-spreaders they are unlikely to be part of the seeds however due to their high centrality they are likely to be one of the first exposed nodes leading to an explosion of the epidemic in hh-networks this effect is way more subtle but follows the same principle experiment 2 calibrating r 0 to a fixed peak next we calibrate  such that each network admits an infection peak regarding i total  of the same height 02 results are shown in fig 7  they emphasize that there is no direct relationship between the number of individuals affected by the epidemic and the height of the infection peak which is particularly relevant in the light of limited icu capacities it also shows that vastly different infection rates and basic reproduction numbers are acceptable

plot note the different scales on x-and y-axis washing wearing masks in public and keeping distance to others can significantly flatten the curve in the series of experiments we tested how various network types influence an epidemics dynamics the networks types highlight different potential features of real-world social networks most results do not contradict line with real-world observations for instance we found that better hygiene and the truncation of super-spreaders will likely reduce the peak of an epidemic by a large amount we also observed that even when r 0 is fixed the evolution of r t largely depends on the network structure for certain networks in particular those admitting super-spreaders it can even increase an increasing reproduction number can be seen in many countries for instance in germany 20  how much of this can be attributed to super-spreaders is still being researched note that superspreaders do not necessarily have to correspond to certain individuals it can also on a more abstract level refer to a type of events we also observed that cm-pl networks have a very early and very intense infection peak however the number of people ultimately affected and therefore also the death toll remain comparably small this is somewhat surprising and requires further research we speculate that the fragmentation in the network makes it difficult for the virus to reach every corner of the graph while it burns out relatively quickly for the high-degree nodes we presented results for a covid-19 case study that is based on the translation of an ode model to a stochastic network-based setting we compared several interaction structures using contact graphs where one was a finite version of the the implicit underlying structure of the ode model the complete graph we found that inhomogeneity in the interaction structure significantly shapes the epidemics dynamic this indicates that fitting deterministic ode models to real-world data might lead to qualitatively and quantitatively wrong results the interaction structure should be included into computational models and should undergo the same rigorous scientific discussion as other model parameters contact graphs have the advantage of encoding various types of interaction structures spatial social etc and they decouple the infectiousness from the connectivity we found that the choice of the network structure has a significant impact and it is very likely that this is also the case for the inhomogeneous interaction structure among humans specifically networks containing super-spreaders consistently lead to the emergence of an earlier and higher peak of the infection moreover the almost linear relationship between r 0   ode  and the peak intensity in ode-models might also lead to misplaced confidence in the results regarding the network structure in general we find that super-spreaders can lead to a very early explosion of the epidemic small-worldness by itself does not admit this property generally it seems that-unsurprisingly-a geometric network is best at containing a pandemic this would imply evidence for corresponding mobility restrictions surprisingly we found a trade-off between the height of the infection peak and the fraction of individuals affected by the epidemic in total for future work it would be interesting to investigate the influence of non-markovian dynamics ode-models naturally correspond to an exponentially distributed residence times in each compartment 48 16  moreover it would be interesting to reconstruct more realistic contact networks they would allow to investigate the effect of npis in the network-based paradigm and to have a well-founded scientific discussion about their efficiency from a risk-assessment perspective it would also be interesting to focus more explicitly on worst-case trajectories taking the models inherent stochasticity into account this is especially relevant because the costs to society do not scale linearly with the characteristic values of an epidemic for instance when icu capacities are reached a small additional number of severe cases might lead to dramatic consequences all rights

pandemic yewei xie zaisheng wang huipeng liao gifty marley dan wu weiming tang   the emergence of covid-19 has made it the first infectious disease pandemic in the 21 st century as of april 23rd a total of 2544792 covid-19 cases has been reported and confirmed with 175694 deaths globally while more than 30 countries had issued the highest level of response the sars-cov-2 pathogen of covid-19

outbreaks in many countries to fill the research gaps mentioned above this article systematically summarizes global findings on the natural history clinical spectrum transmission patterns laboratory findings ct results and risk factors of the covid-19 we searched for publications in epidemiology and clinic domains of the covid-19 broadly as it was a novel rapidly extended infectious disease both the english and chinese were used in searching as the covid-19 was firstly reported in wuhan most of the real-time study were in chinese then we searched the following databases chkd v31 of the cnki

of researches about the covid-19 outbreak systematically from the beginning until the latest date before we submitted this paper because the objective of this study aimed to get a bird view of the covid-19 outbreak and updated the clinical spectrum and natural history of the covid-19 we synthesis data narratively thus to assess the heterogeneity and reporting bias of the included studies in a 55924 covid-19 patients study based in china the majority of patients aged 3069 778 with only 24 of the patients being 18 years and below the median age of the patients was 51 ranged 2 days-100 years old w3 similarly in the united states more than half of patients aged between 2064 years 65 and patients under 19 only accounted for 5 of all patients older aged patients were more prone to getting infected compared to the young 1 the uss data also indicated that patients younger than 19 had milder covid-19 illness with almost no hospitalizations or deaths reported w4 based on a worldwide data the elderly aged over 60 were at a high risk of developing into severe disease or death w3-w5 2 about the gender ratio the male to female ratio of confirmed cases was 106100 in china 3 however in south korea and iceland the male population had a higher incidence rate than the female population 1 2 males had double times the secondary attack rate than females 4 globally the transmission of the covid-19 can be categorized into 4 temporal stages the first stage people with exposure histories to huanan seafood market hsm got infected 5 forty-one patients were found to be having sars-like symptoms in december 2019 and the hsm was believed to be one of the origins of the virus however 13 of the 41 patients reported no prior exposure to the hsm thus indicating that the origin of the virus needed further investigation 6 the second temporal stage is the transition from community transmissions to the outbreak in wuhan 5 the virus was mainly spread to multiple communities directly and indirectly by people with hsm exposure histories the interpersonal transmissions and clustered transmissions formed community transmissions 5 an early study showed that the proportion of patients with hsm exposure histories decreased from 5586 within 22 days indicating people who did not have exposure histories to the hsm became infected 7 8 the third stage the epidemic in china at this stage transmissions began to expand to communities outside wuhan and the hubei province as a whole 5 on 26th jan 2020 a study involving 62 covid-19 patients outside wuhan found that all the patients had been exposed to wuhan which demonstrated an established local transmission outside wuhan 9 the fourth temporal stage is the global pandemic on 13th jan 2020 the first case outside china was reported in thailand w1 on 30th jan 2020 the who declared a public health emergency of international concern pheic w1 it subsequently took about 51 days for transmission to escalate from the first reported case to the 10000th reported case outside china globally it took 16 days for the number of reported cases to increase from 10000th cases to 100000th cases 21 days from 100000th cases to 500000th cases only 6 days from 500000th cases to 1000000th cases and 13 days from 1000000th cases to 2000000th cases w1 the main transmission form of this virus was by human-to-human spread since only 118 patients among 1099 confirmed patients had history of direct contact with wild animals 10 the vital transmission routes were through respiratory droplets and contact transmissions there remains the possibility of aerosol transmission when exposed to high concentrations of aerosols for a long time in a relatively closed environment w6 fecal-oral transmission and the mother-to-child transmission were also possible but lacked direct evidence until now 11 12 other suspected routes of transmission still needed to be clarified the transmission patterns of covid-19 included community transmission nosocomial transmission household transmission and transmission in closed environments firstly the community transmission was considered to be an important pattern in covid-19 spread w3 in the netherlands community transmissions were found in the noord-brabant regions w7 w8 in north america community transmissions were reported in winnipeg canada and eastern idaho united states w9 w10 secondly the potential risk of transmission among medical personnel and through medical facilities was deemed high and thus should be paid extreme attention transmissions between patients and health workers were in higher proportion during the sars outbreak while transmission through medical facilities was higher proportion during the mers outbreak 13 in wuhan the proportion of severely infected medical workers was higher than the national average 3 in italy 2629 health workers were reported infected with the covid-19 before 18th march and accounted for 83 of the total number of cases nationwide the number however increased to 8358 by 30th march and represented 9 of the countrys total number of cases w11 w12 in spain the number of diagnosed cases among medical workers increased to 5969 within 6 days and more than 12 of the countrys confirmed cases remained among medical workers until march 30th w12 update from another source reported an increase in the number of cases from 1214 among spain healthcare workers by 31st march and this was attributed to lack of medical supplies such as masks and gowns other reasons accounting for these high infection rates among medical personnel varied according to different countrys circumstances an italy study pointed out hospitals as a potential hotspot for infection facilities and medical personnel turned into untested vectors and patients w13 w14 in the us for example the reasons that turned hospitals into infection hotspots included the overload of covid-19 patients and inappropriate management against the pandemic in hospitals w15 similar to the us 200 medical workers got infected in a county hospital in romania due to inadequate hospital management in egypt a serious wave of emigration by physicians for years led to patient overload for remaining medical workers and placed them at higher risk of infection through continuous exposure the emigration wave was purportedly caused by low salary undesirable working conditions lack of legal protection and shortage of medical supplies and equipment w16 thirdly household transmission contributed to cluster infections and was the major transmission pattern observed in china for instance among 1836 reported cases in guangdong and sichuan provinces most cluster infections occurred in families 7885 w3 the who in this regard issued a statement that household transmission highly occurred among medical workers families than health facility infection in china household transmission was also a significant pattern observed in south korea and the us w1 w15 the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc had provided guidance for the control of household transmission in european countries w3 w17 what made household transmission worse was that some groups age 18 and  65 had high risk got infection within households than the general population w18 so children and elderly living with medical workers at a higher risk of getting than other populations fourthly transmissions in a closed environment besides the home should also be of a keen focus on the prevention and control of this outbreak a japanese health department reported that a closed environment could promote super-spreading events because the transmission of the sars-cov-2 in a closed environment was the same as large-scale transmission such as the ski chalet-cluster infection in france and the church-hospital infection clusters in south korea w19 for example outbreaks of the covid-19 were observed in multiple prisons in china the uk and the us w20 w21 3 cluster infections also happened on cruise ships such as the diamond princess grand princess golden princess ruby princess phoenix reisen ms westerdam and punta arenas w22 further studies are however required to identify and assess other potential transmission patterns for further prevention especially since some cases were asymptomatic 15 16 in addition patients who were considered cured and no longer needed quarantine still tested rt-pcr positive after 5 to 13 days 17 we systematically pooled data on the incubation period and the reproduction numbers for analysis the pooled data suggested that the mean incubation period was 524 days 95 ci397650 5 studies and ranged from 374 days w23-w27 however the incubation period in some special cases could be as long as 24 days 10 the pooled results also illustrated that the basic reproduction number r0 of sarscov-2 was 332 95 ci324339 14 studies and varied between 06647 w24-w35 15 the results suggested that the transmission ability of sars-cov-2 was stronger than sars 3 and mers  1 w36 w37 moreover the median time from the first symptom to first hospital admission was 7 days with the median duration from illness development to severe symptoms development being 58 days for dyspnea 89 days for ards 105 days for mechanical ventilation and icu admission 6 18 for covid-19 related deaths the duration from the onset of symptoms to death averaged 9 days in china 5 and in italy median w5 and 10 days in south korea median 2 by 21 st apr 16 nations had reported over 20000 covid-19 cases in each of the countries together contributed to 846 of the confirmed cases and 924 of death in the world w38 the global case fatality rate cfr was 70 on 21st apr however it was apparently different by country among the 16 countries 6 had over 10 cfr with an apparently increasing trend after reported the over-100 cases fig 2 these countries were france 177 belgium 146 italy 133 united kingdom 132 netherlands 112 and spain 104 which were all from the european region among the other 10 countries the cfr of brazil canada switzerland portugal and germany slowly increased to 63 46 41  35 and 32 respectively the cfr of china russia and turkey was relatively stable at 55 09 and 24 respectively the cfr of iran and the united states largely fluctuated the cfr of iran firstly declined to 25 on 8th mar then increased to 79 on 24th mar and slowly decreased again and became stable at 62 on 21 st apr the cfr of the united states decreased to 11  on 20th mar and then slowly increased to 54 on 21st apr as the pandemic outbreak continued more surveillance is needed for the cfr of covid-19 fever 830909 and cough 576708 were the most common symptoms of the covid-19 in china other common symptoms included fatigue 294410 dyspnoea 145456 sputum production 287326 sore throat 140141 etc nausea and vomiting 5489 and diarrhea 4761 were atypical symptoms 1922 besides a study pointed out that most patients 90 had more than one symptom 18 additionally there were 209 of patients without viral pneumonia symptoms 10 which was opposite to previous studies 6 18 23 however in italys report the most commonly observed symptoms were fever and dyspnea whiles cough diarrhea and hemoptysis were less common overall 64 of patients did not present any symptoms during hospital admissions w5 in europe one study found olfactory and gustatory disorders were common symptoms which were totally different from chinas findings 24 in the us the gastrointestinal symptoms were shown more frequently than in china 25 the top 3 common symptoms among mild and severe patients are summarized and displayed in a figure fig 3 6 10 18 2630 fever was found to be the most common symptom in all patients in a study 438 of patients had fever initially and the proportion increased to 879 following hospitalization 10 the body temperatures of 44471  of patients ranged between 381390c the higher body temperatures above 390c as well as dyspnea and anorexia were more frequent among patients in severe conditions only 6 10 29 cough and fatigue on the other hand were more widely reported among mild and severe patients whats more another study reported that dyspnea 76 was the most common symptom among severe patients in the united states 31 the proportion of patients who needed icu care varied based on the local pandemic circumstances for example the who speculated that around 138 of patients were in severe conditions in china w3 however 2332 of patients needed icu care in wuhan 6 18 23 currently documented covid-19 related complications include ards rna-anemia arrhythmia shock acute cardiac injury acute respiratory injury acute renal injury and secondary infection etc the ards was the most common complication with incidence rate ranging from 89328 in china 6 1823 and 964 in italy w5 the progress of some patients with ards to septic shock was fast and quickly evolved into multiple organ failure finally 23 most icu patients had a higher risk of developing ards and having complications 6 18 among covid  19 patients a decrease in leukocytes such as eosinophil and lymphocyte were commonly reported this might be because the cytokine storm caused by the novel virus changes the peripheral of white blood cells and immune cells 6 810 18 23 severe lymphopenia was also common among the dead patients 6 30 myocardial zymogram abnormality was found in many patients for instance 76 of patients had an increase in lactate dehydrogenase while 13 of patients had increases in creatine kinase 23 the level of c-reactive protein was important to evaluate the infection 10 most patients were found to have a higher level of c- reactive protein 86 and serum ferritin 63 compared to the normal range 23 the biomarkers related to liver and renal damage were found to be abnormal among covid-19 patients the abnormality of liver-related biomarkers was not widespread but yet still common in severe cases 6 910 32 besides although only 7 of patients showed renal biomarker abnormalities renal damage might contribute to the final multi-organ failure and death outcome 33 34 the icu patients showed higher levels of white blood cells neutrophil counts d-dimer creatine kinase and creatine with longer prothrombin times 6 10 18 compared to patients who survived the patients who died had higher levels of d-dimer high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i serum ferritin lactate dehydrogenase il-6 blood urea creatinine white blood cell counts and neutrophil counts severe lymphopenia was also common among dead patients 6 30 most patients had ggo and the bilateral lung involvement 6 23 3537 one study found that bilateral lung involvement was more frequently shown in the intermediate course and late course compared to the earlier clinical course 38 the clinical course could be divided into four stages based on ct scan findings 37 in the first stage pre-symptom ggo unilateral and multifocal were observed among most patients in this stage 37 38 in the second stage symptoms 1 week lesions soon developed into bilateral and diffused except for ggo this stage was considered a period from transition to consolidation a mixed pattern of transition and consolidation develops during this stage in the third stage symptoms 12 weeks the ggo was still common and the consolidation pattern showed findings indicated an interstitial change which was considered as the development of fibrosis in the fourth stage symptom 23 weeks consolidation and mixed patterns were more common and the ggo started to shrink 37 the consolidation was gradually absorbed among patients who recovered at last 39 among icu patients the bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation were considered typical findings 6 patients in severe condition showed diffuse lesions with density increasing in both lungs ct scans showed white lung appearances indicating the serious influence the infection has on patients lung functions 40 being old  65 years old having comorbidities eg hypertension diabetes cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases etc and developing complications were three vital risk factors for patients to develop severe conditions 18 26 27 findings from multiple studies have shown that patients who are more than 65 years of age and with comorbidities such as diabetes and heart diseases had a high mortality rate 26 30 4143 late hospitalization and bacterial infections were also considered high risk factors for disease progression 23 27 42 smoking history could be a potential risk factor for developing severe conditions 23 27 people with underlying disorders were considered to be at a high risk of getting infected w3 our review identified several research gaps firstly large amounts of data for countries outside of china were missing from this review this is because the first case of covid-19 was found in china and lasted for three months while other countries were still at the early stages of the epidemic except for south korea w38 besides published studies of coronavirus in china grew rapidly since the sars outbreak in 2002 maintaining a top 2 position in the world 44 secondly although mother-to-child transmission was conceded to be a possible transmission route w39 no direct evidence has proved this and further investigation is needed 3 45 besides there exist unknown transmission patterns that need to be identified in future studies third a super-spreader was defined as infected individuals who made infected numerous others during the sars outbreak for example a nephrotic hospitalized patient was defined as a super-spreader during the sars in china causing 22 people infected 19 in 22 patients were the medical workers contacted with the super-spreader the incident rare among the medical workers was 5938 1932 in the nephrotic department 46 in the covid-19 super-spreaders were found in multiple places worldwide a saudi arabic study issued the super-spreader to superspreading event the study mentioned that super-spreader might cause unexpected transmission during the pilgrimage 47 when huge number of people gathering with a high population density reasons causing the super- spreading event might include immune suppression increased disease severity and viral load asymptomatic individuals and extensive social interactions 48 however the characteristics and features of how an individual became a super-spreader were not clear w40 summarizing the features of the super spreader concept as well as their characteristics and role in transmissions are needed in future disease control 49 fourth it has been reported that some cured patients covid-19 retested positive by pcr after being discharged and quarantined at home in multiple places w41 17 the reason for this phenomenon is still unclear and hence further investigations are required for future pandemic control w42 there existed some limitations in this review firstly this review base on the english and chinese resource as the covid-19 transform to global pandemic from regional outbreak comprehensive collection of the related information worldwide is needed secondly the clinical spectrum based on general population while subgroup analyzes may help to figure more entire picture of the covid-19 for instance kawasaki disease were found in children in the uk and europe countries w43 however other places did not report the gathering kawasaki disease cases as the uk and europe by collecting and analyzing published covid-19 articles we found the average incubation period of covid-19 was 524 days the r0 was 332 indicated a stronger transmission ability than sars and mers the common symptoms had a little difference in europe and asia body temperatures above 390 c dyspnea and anorexia were more common symptoms in severe patients age over 60 years old having co-morbidities and developing complications were high-risk factors developed into severe conditions or death a decrease in leukocytes was common the abnormal lab biomarkers of cardiac liver and renal were found observed from the ct findings ggo and the bilateral lung involvement were common the longer the time after symptoms onset the more consolidated lung lesions were found  stochastic and spatio-temporal analysis of the middle east respiratory syndrome outbreak in south korea 2015 hyunsun lee   early contributions to infectious disease modeling were pioneered mostly by public health physicians the first known result in mathematical epidemiology was to appraise the effectiveness of a controversial inoculation against smallpox in 1760 by a mathematician daniel bernoulli 1766 in 1889 p d enko contributed to the development of theoretical basis of epidemiology dietz 1988 correlating a discrete time model with actual cases of a measles epidemic and hamer developed a discrete time model to understand the spread of the measles epidemic in 1906 hamer 1906 ross assumed that the rate of a new infection was proportional to the numbers of susceptible and infectious individuals and developed the ordinary differential equation models of vector-borne diseases to first model malaria in 1911 ross 1911 however one of the early triumphs in mathematical epidemiology was the formulation of a simple model by kermack and mckendrick in 1927 kermack  mckendrick 1932 mckendrick 1926 their predictions explained the behavior of countless epidemics including one of the worst epidemics in history known as the great plague of london that dicimated more than 15 of londons population in 16651666 the kermack and mckendrick epidemic model is a standard sir model consisting of three compartments that are susceptible s infected i and recovered r and assumes that the sizes of the compartments are large enough so that each compartment is assumed to be homogeneous or at least there is homogeneous mixing in each subgroup if the population is stratified by activity levels the compartment model has been often used modified and applied to different epidemic models brauer  castillo-chavez 2011 hethcote 2000 keeling  rohani 2008 as well as other phenomena in social networking viral marketing sensor networking etc however at the beginning stage of a disease outbreak there are a relatively small number of infected individuals and the transmission of the infection is stochastic rather than homogeneous where the individual contacts between members of the population are distinguishable and traceable to describe the early stage of an epidemic stochastic branching process first formulated by galton and watson in 1874 was used to model the reproduction of a population from generation to generation it was also used to study the extinction of family names by galton and watson gets et al lloyd-smith and schreibergetz 2006 introduced a natural generalization of the basic reproductive ratio that was critical in controlling disease outbreak in the stochastic branching process model the major interest is placed on finding the probability that the disease eventually dies out ie the probability of ultimate extinction during the transmission besides the mathematical models to predict epidemics the temporal and spatial proximity of subjects has been studied and used to characterize an epidemic that occurs through direct contacts at different places and times earlier spatial patterns were analyzed to describe the geographical spread of plant and human diseases campbell  noe 1985 nicot rouse  yandell 1984 snow 1855 john snow snow 1855 greatly contributed to the early medical geography by mapping and analyzing the major cholera outbreak of london in 1854 however it was later realized that the disease outbreak patterns needed to be explained not only spatially but also temporally the techniques of spatio-temporal autocorrelation were introduced with an example of population diffusion in north-west england by bennett bennett 1975a 1975b and it was well summarized in subsequent literature reynolds  madden 1988 recently the spatio-temporal analysis and autocorrelation were used to analyze fatal infectious human diseases such as dengue fever epidemics in southern vietnam cuong et al 2013 and the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in mainland china cao et al 2016 etc cao in the analysis of the spread of sars in china cao et al 2016 used bayesian maximum entropy modeling and observed the empirical covariance based on a fitted theoretical covariance model with behavior of sine fluctuation in space and exponential decay in time in this section we provide the introduction and statistical summary of the mers outbreak in south korea to have the general picture of the outbreak though it may be known or published earlier middle east respiratory syndrome mers is an infectious illness caused by a coronavirus that was first identified in saudi arabia in 2012 it resulted in a total of 2220 laboratory-confirmed cases including 790 related deaths with a case-fatality rate of 356 as of may 2018 according to world health organization who south korea was free of mers until 2015 the outbreak of mers in south korea started in may 2015 and officially ended in december 2015 the index case of the outbreak in south korea was a 68 year-old male who developed symptoms on may 11 2015 and sought care at two outpatient clinics and two hospitals according to who as a result he exposed mers to a number of medical staff hospital patients their family members and visitors but was not diagnosed with mers until may 20 2015 nine days later the last patient diagnosed also with lymphoma spent 172 days in quarantine after being diagnosed with mers on june 7 2015 and died on november 25 2015 the ministry of health and welfare mohw in south korea declared a formal end to the mers virus outbreak on december 23 2015 which was the 218th day since the confirmation of the first patient the end date was achieved after 28 days without any new infection or twice the maximum incubation period for the mers virus among 186 infected patients 39 died of mers equating the fatality rate of mers in south korea to 2097 in this paper we define a super-spreader as a laboratory-confirmed patient who infected the disease to more than five contacts the characteristics of the mers outbreak in south korea are that one index case who traveled to middle eastern countries introduced the disease to the population of south korea and the pattern of transmission is limited to inter-hospital or intra-hospital infection except one possible case of household transmission the size of the outbreak is much smaller than the size of the whole population in south korea it enables us to investigate the detailed transmission dynamics of the infectious disease this paper is designed to make a situational assessment on the outbreak of mers in south korea based on the basic reproductive ratio and the probability of ultimate extinction furthermore spatio-temporal proximity of the occurrence between patients is investigated using an autocorrelation function the data were publicly available by the ministry of health and welfare the korea centers for disease control and prevention and other press releases in south korea each infected patient was numbered in chronological order based on the infection confirmation date in this study we count the period of the infection starting from day 1 which corresponds to may 20 2015 since there is no change in epidemic status after day 200 we use the outbreak period from day 1 may 20 2015 to day 200 december 5 2015 for figures in this paper fig 1 displays the cumulative number of patients and deaths the generation is determined by how closely a patient is linked to the index case patient 1 the index case is the only member of gen 0 generation 0 in this outbreak gen 1 is a group of people who were directly infected from patient 1 gen 2 is infected from the members of gen 1 and so on the mers outbreak in south korea ended with four generations from gen 0 to gen 3 with a total of 186 mers patients the outbreak started in seoul south korea the shaded region in fig 2 and spread out to the neighbor provinces there were 17 hospitals where these 186 patients were confirmed with mers the hospitals are identified with the first letter of the province where each hospital is located and a number by random numbering within the province in fig 2 table 1 provides the hospital identification and its corresponding location in latitude and longitude for geographic information and it will be used for spatio-temporal analysis later in this paper the box plot on the left in fig 3 displays the distribution of age where the box represents the middle 50 with the median in red the median age of the entire population of patients in this mers outbreak is 55 which is ten percent higher than the world median age 50 of mers patients reported by the centers for disease control and prevention the gender ratio of patients is 1451 with 110 male and 76 female patients the fatality rates are 2364 for male and 1579 for female indicating male predominance with p-value  00885 based on a one-sided test gen 2 has the highest rate of fatality shown on the right in fig 3 with 2973 for male and 1800 for female fig 4 summarizes the distribution of total new cases indicating gender and status where the square dots represent male and the round dots represent female in the same figure the shaded dots indicate the survivors and the unshaded dots indicate the deceased each generation spanned about two weeks which is close to the maximum incubation period for the mers virus the mode of the distribution in each generation is primarily determined by the time when the super-spreaders appear in the previous generation the mode of the distribution in fig 4 is day 19 in gen 2 the distributions of infection period for both the survivors and the deceased are right-skewed as shown in fig 5 the median durations of infection are 15 days with the interquartile range 1221 for the survivors and 11 days with the interquartile range 515 for the deceased the basic reproductive ratio is important since a disease outbreak is classified as a minor outbreak or a major outbreak depending on this number a minor outbreak ultimately extinguishes itself with the probability of 1 when r1 while a major outbreak defines itself by the boundless spread of the disease with a positive probability when r1 there are more than one possible interpretations for the definition of the basic reproductive rate r we adopt the survival function method that is introduced in heesterbeek  dietz 1996 known as the gold standard determination of r in this approach the reproductive ratio is defined as1r0tftdtwhere t is the average number of newly infected individuals whom one infectious patient will produce per unit time when infected for total time t and ft is the survival function ie the probability that a newly infected individual remains infectious for at least time t the function tft is called the reproduction function this approach allows us to use a time dependent t instead of a fixed constant rate  the stochastic branching process model is often used to describe the beginning stage of a disease outbreak when the number of infected patients remains significantly smaller than the entire population the network of individual contacts and transmission is more focused in this approach and a network diagram of patients consisting of two major objects vertices and edges is often used to visualize it vertices represent infected patients in our study and edges are contacts between the members that cause transmission of the disease we assume that every contact through each edge leads to an infection the orientation of transmission always flows from a generation to a higher generation but never flows reversely which means that the previous generation cannot be infected again by any subsequent generation the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to the vertex in the network for a random node with a vertex degree k the excess degree of the vertex is defined as the number of contacts infected by the current vertex since the current vertex has the k connected neighbor vertices including the source node who infected the disease to the current node and a patient cannot be infected again from its descendants as we assumed earlier then the excess degree of the current node is k1 the distribution of vertex degree is essential in the description of disease transmission since it determines how fast or slow the disease spreads or dies out we start with the probability generating function of the neighbor distribution in a power series representation2gzezxx0prxxzxwhere prx is the probability density function for a discrete random variable x the power series 2 converges for 0z1 since this series is differentiable and x0prxx1 the interval 01 is taken as the domain for gz since z represents probability let qk1 be the probability that a vertex has excess degree k1 and consider the probability generating function of the descendent distribution in terms of qk3g1zk1qk1zk1 to derive the probability of ultimate extinction let zn be the probability that the infection will die out within n generations we assume that q0 is positive otherwise the infection will never die out and that qj is non-negative for all j0 for a random vertex with excess degree j the probabilities zn and zn1 are compared and depicted in fig 6 the sequence zn is monotonically increasing since the probability that an infection dies out within n generations is generally larger than or equal to the probability that it dies out within n1 generations for a certain j the probability of ultimate extinction of the infection within n generations is the product of qj and zn1j thus the probability zn is the summation over all possible non-negative integers jj which is the expected value of zn1j where jn04znezn1jj0qjzn1jg1zn1 since zn is a cauchy sequence then it converges let z be the limit value of zn as n goes to infinity limnznz by taking the limit to equation 4 then we have5zg1z which is a fixed-point problem it is important to know where the zeros of equation 5 are located since it provides the probability for equilibrium when the infection eventually dies out if z is 1 then the infection will certainly extinguish otherwise it may manifest into a major outbreak the detailed calculation and derivation can be found in brauer  castillo-chavez 2011 while the stochastic branching process model gathers the information of the individual transmission in each generation and predicts the probability of the ultimate extinction of the disease it does not include both spatial and temporal information of the transmission autocorrelation analysis is the most straightforward way to establish direct links between two series in this section we adapt the autocorrelation function to analyze the spatio-temporal proximity of occurrence during a disease outbreak we modify the traditional definition of autocorrelation function reynolds  madden 1988 for our analysis let a realization xij indicate occurrence of a disease where xij1 if a vertex vi infects the disease to another vertex vj otherwise xij0 we note that the direction of transmission is always from one generation to the next generation but never in reverse let i be the index set of vertices and ni be the index set of vertices that are infected by a vertex vi in the neighborhood of vertex vi for ii we define indicator functions s in space and t in time respectively such thatijs1ifdsvivjs0otherwiseijt1ifdtvivjt0otherwisewhere dsvivj and dtvivj are the spatial distance and serial interval of occurrence between two vertices vi and vj respectively for the sake of simplifying notation we adoptxijsijsxijxijtijtxijwhere xijs plays as an indicator if the distance between the two serial vertices vi and vj is s or not and xijt plays as an indicator whether the serial interval between these two vertices is t or not for all ii and jni we define the spatio-temporal autocorrelation function of occurrence as6costiijnitijtxijssijsxijtiijnitijtxijs212iijnisijsxijt212which describes how likely the distance and time difference between two connected vertices vary together when one vertex vi transmitted the disease to the neighbor vertices vj for jni the autocorrelation in equation 6 is defined differently from traditional definitions where only the fluctuation parts of variables are considered however we use the full variable term instead of the fluctuation part since we are interested in the number of occurrences rather than the fluctuation of occurrence the network map for the transmission of mers in south korea during 2015 is shown in fig 7 the vertices without any shade represent the deceased it starts from the index case gen 0 numbered as 1 in the map who transmitted mers to 29 people in the next generation gen 1 and so on since the sources of infection for patients 43 44 51 53 166 178 183 184 and 185 are unknown we assume that their excess degree of vertex is 0 the source of infection for patient 52 is also unknown but the excess degree of vertex is 1 as patient 52 infected mers to patient 119 in fig 7 there are a few super-spreaders patients 1 14 15 16 and 76 who contributed to 83 of all active cases to calculate the reproductive rate for the mers outbreak in south korea we use equation 1 in a discrete form the average number t of new patients from an infectious patient per unit time one day and the survival function ft at time t are graphed in fig 8 the calculated reproductive ratio based on these two functions is r37949 which is considerably larger than 1 and this outbreak is classified as a major outbreak for the probability of ultimate extinction that is the root of equation 5 we define hzg1zz the graph on the left in fig 9 shows hz and the probability of ultimate extinction for r1 ie the zero of the function hz less than 1 is located at z04996 the graph on the right shows the profile of the probability of ultimate extinction over the outbreak the probability drops but immediately increases after the appearance of super-spreaders on days 1416 which indicates how important successful quarantine of super-spreaders is during an epidemic the demographical distribution of each generation over the 17 hospitals in fig 2 as well as in table 1 is depicted in fig 10 one may expect a strong association between the size bed counts of the hospital and the number of mers cases however we found the association to be very weak with a coefficient of determination close to zero for this particular outbreak this explains the importance of quarantine regardless of hospital size our interest lies in the spatio-temporal proximity of occurrence between two patients where one patient infected mers to the other ie the two connected vertices in fig 7 for this purpose we use the geographical distance and the difference of the confirmation dates serial interval between these paired patients the distance is measured by the haversine formula between two hospitals in latitude and longitude in table 1 while this euclidean distance may not give the exact travel distance in a metropolis such as seoul in south korea we assume that it is sufficient to characterize the geometrical distances between hospitals or the travel distances of patients the distributions of the distance and the serial interval between all connected vertices in fig 7 are depicted in fig 11 as we observe in the graph on the left in fig 11 there are three major distances approximately 0 km 53 km and 81 km that are well associated with the major distances in fig 10 characterizing inter-hospital or intra-hospital transmission most of the patients in gen 1 are located at hospital k1 in fig 10 where the index case in gen 0 was also confirmed contributing the highest probability at the distance of 0 km in the left graph of fig 11 the major hospitals in gen 2 are s2 k1-k3 and d1-d2 considering the three prominent distances in the graph on the left in fig 11 we infer that the disease was transmitted intensely between s2 and k1-k3 about 53 km apart and between k1-k3 and d1-d2 about 81 km apart rather than transmitted directly between s2 and d1-d2 about 133 km apart unless otherwise intra-hospital 0 km apart transmission in gen 2 lastly the major hospitals in gen 3 are located mostly within 25 km from each other in seoul and the total number of patients in gen 3 is not as high as those in other generations the mean serial time interval is 98057 days with a 95 confidence interval of 91975 10414 in the graph on the right in fig 11 fig 12 demonstrates the spatio-temporal autocorrelation results of the mers outbreak in south korea based on equation 6 the first row in fig 12 is the profile of cost over the entire transmission period in the three-dimensional presentation in the left and the corresponding contour plots in st -plane in the right the second to the fourth rows in fig 12 are the autocorrelations for gens 1 2 and 3 respectively the autocorrelation over the full domain has a few distinct spikes at certain s- and t-lags the peaks in the spatial and temporal lag domain explains that there are a few hospitals mainly involved in the transmission that characterizes a typical pattern of inter- and intra-hospital transmission these patterns of the autocorrelation in spatial and temporal directions can be closely associated with fig 11 the transmissions in gen 1 were mainly intra-hospital as there is very little spatial distribution the index case was confirmed with mers in hospital k1 and most of gen 1 were located at the same hospital which creates a strong autocorrelation at s0 as depicted in the second row in fig 12 in fig 10 we can infer that most of gen 2 in hospital s2 were infected by patients from hospital k1 in gen 1 that were located about 53 km apart this explains the peak in the autocorrelation in gen 2 the patients in gen 3 were mostly infected from patients at the same hospital or nearby hospitals to understand these graphs better we note that the projections of the autocorrelation in the first row in fig 12 onto s-axis and t-axis have similar patterns with the left graph and the right graph in fig 11 respectively in this paper we examine and assess the outbreak of mers in south korea based on the reproductive ratio and the probability of ultimate extinction as well as the spatio-temporal autocorrelation of occurrence the basic reproductive ratio is the expected number of secondary infections arising from an infectious individual over the entire epidemic since the estimation of the reproductive ratio is based on sufficient data acquired from the fully-completed or well established epidemic the prediction of further development of the epidemic is somewhat limited mills et al 2004 though there are different approaches for estimating the reproductive ratio hefferman smith  wahl 2005 we chose to use the survival function method that is widely applicable as there is no assumption of a constant transmission rate to calculate the reproductive ratio the average contact rate t as a function of t is directly simulated from the data instead of using a constant rate in other works chang 2017 choi jung choi hur  ki 2018 and the survival function is also examined from the outbreak data the resulting reproductive ratio for the mers outbreak in south korea is r37949 and the mers outbreak in south korea is classified as a major outbreak the stochastic branching process model fits well with this scenario of the mers outbreak in south korea since it involves a relatively small number of patients compared to the whole population of south korea allowing us to trace the individual contacts and gain the detailed dynamics of the transmission based on the transmission data we estimate the probability of ultimate extinction by using the probability generating function and assuming the probability of extinction eventually reaches the equilibrium state the probability of ultimate extinction of the mers outbreak in south korea is calculated as 04996 while the reproductive ratio and the probability of ultimate extinction are useful to classify the outbreak and predict the extinction of the disease in a long term it fails to provide any spatial or spatio-temporal aspects of the transmission the spatial and temporal proximity of the transmission between occurrences is measured based on the autocorrelation function that describes how likely the spatial and temporal differences between patients vary together the autocorrelation profiles the entire transmission period as well as over each generation period and provides good insight in understanding and characterizing the patterns of inter-hospital or intra-hospital transmission of the mers outbreak in south korea we observed a few distinct peaks of autocorrelation values in the spatial and temporal domain clearly displaying the characteristics of the mers outbreak in south korea finally we observe that a few super-spreaders greatly contributed to the mers epidemic in south korea infecting 83 of all active cases and elevated the reproductive ratio to reduce the number of super-spreaders and consequently the reproductive ratio more thorough quarantine can be ordered however lipsitch et al lipsitch et al 2003 also argued the trade-off between reducing the reproductive ratio and stressing the population with excessive quarantine suggesting that the reproductive ratio may not always be the best measure as a future endeavor modeling super-spreading events with non-diffusive terms in mathematical equations will be investigated and a better quarantine plan will be suggested none no conflict of interest  bronchoscopy in the age of covid-19 david ost e   the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has led to 95333 confirmed cases as of march 5 20201 in this issue of the journal the american association for bronchology and interventional pulmonology aabip has provided an initial statement on the use of bronchoscopy and respiratory specimen collection in patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection2 this statement has received an expedited peer review by the journal in an effort to disseminate high-quality information in a clinically useful timeframe that ultimately will help patients at this point in time much remains unknown and evidence-based guidance regarding bronchoscopy precautions and sars-cov-2 infection will require updating as new information becomes available but as william osler reflected medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability so even though there is much that is still uncertain we need to act prudently in a timely manner rather than waiting for perfect information the aabip statement is an initial step in this process and it will be updated accordingly at the web site of the aabip httpsaabronchologyorg subsequent updates will also be reviewed and published in the journal with free access to all in an expedited manner the aabip statement highlights the fact that while interventional pulmonology is a procedurally oriented discipline it remains important for physicians to be cognizant of epidemiological concepts and the context within which procedures are performed bronchoscopy is a tremendous tool for diagnosis and treatment of a variety of conditions but it can also transmit disease if appropriate precautions are not followed in the cases of sars-cov-2 there are risks to both patients and health care providers the aabip statement appropriately highlights this and emphasizes that bronchoscopy is not an appropriate tool for diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infectionthe benefits are far outweighed by the risks there are also more nuanced aspects to the epidemiology that should impact how we think about bronchoscopy in the age of covid-19 one way to characterize infectious epidemics is to calculate the basic reproduction number also called the basic reproductive ratio r0 r0 is not a rate but rather a ratio it is the ratio of the expected number of cases directly generated by a case in a population in which all members are susceptible to the infection3 note that this definition makes certain assumptionsspecifically that all members of the population are susceptible so r0 technically is not changed by interventions such as vaccination this number attempts to quantify the potential for the transmissibility of an infectious agent while r0 is a valid biological metric the value itself is usually estimated with mathematical models that are in turn based on key assumptions so interpretation of its value is complex and estimated values for the same pathogen can vary widely depending on the models used4 while r0 is conceptually useful the more relevant number is the effective reproduction ratio r which is different this is the number of cases generated in the current population at a moment in time but it does not assume complete susceptibility in the population the effective reproduction ratio can change with vaccination both r0 and r are not solely determined by the pathogen although the pathogen of course has a large impact other factors such as population density behavior patterns and interventions can change r for most situations when r1 the infection will be able to spread within a population while if r1 it will not be able to spread estimates of the median daily reproduction number in wuhan declined from 235 before travel restrictions to 105 after travel restrictions1 other investigators have estimated r to be 22 95 confidence interval 14-3915 over time r will hopefully decrease as interventions take effect in the prior severe acute respiratory syndrome sars pandemic of 2003 r was estimated initially at 275 but with interventions r dropped 1 rapidly however the previous sars epidemic also demonstrates another important point namely that even when r was 1 super-spreader events occurred and the epidemic continued in toronto most early sars cases occurred in hospitals with the movement of sars patients between hospitals contributing to the outbreak67 in taiwan hong kong and singapore transmission often occurred through transmission in hospital wards while the typical infected patient transmitted to 1 other patient occasional outliers transmitted to multiple individuals threshold value defining a super-spreader was 8 in sars8 how can we apply the epidemiology and the lessons from the sars epidemic to bronchoscopy screening based on symptoms even in the best case scenario is not sensitive if a routine bronchoscopy patient eg for a lung nodule is infected but asymptomatic and therefore remains undetected then health care providers will be unprotected now this is true in many areas of health care delivery not just the bronchoscopy laboratory but unlike other areas of health care the act of bronchoscopy is likely to increase the probability of transmission to bronchoscopy personnel due to respiratory droplets that same bronchoscopy personnel provide care to other particularly vulnerable patients every day setting up a super-spreader situation since infected individuals have close contact with a particularly vulnerable population with frequent comorbidities including cancer and immunosuppression910 in addition data is still scant on whether sars-cov-2 can survive outside the body for long the coronavirus that caused middle east respiratory syndrome demonstrated the ability to survive outside the body for up to 60 minutes a report of a cluster of 19 cases in a shopping mall suggests that the virus might have spread via indirect transmission but the evidence is not definitive at this time11 one possible step to at least partially address this risk is to test all patients before undergoing any type of bronchoscopy andor increase the level of health care provider protection in the bronchoscopy area this of course is only possible once testing becomes more widely available such that all other higher priority patients can be tested another intervention is to consider delaying elective cases when possible the available data suggests that for diagnosis and staging of cancer a brief delay could be implemented without much adverse impact12 in the absence of widely available testing one option would be to implement a 2-week delay combined with self-quarantine for elective cancer diagnosis and staging cases patients who remain asymptomatic would have their elective bronchoscopy after a brief 2-week downtime the daily flow of elective cancer cases would return to more normal levels so that delays in cancer care would not be excessive while balancing the need for containment of the pandemic which interventions to implement and when to implement them will be context-dependent depending in large part on the prevalence of the disease in each locale and the available resources so individualization to each particular hospitals context is important current testing paradigms are based on the probability of identifying a true positive patient which is a very reasonable strategy especially given limited resources but good decisions are based on an assessment of probabilities and consequences a rare event with disastrous consequences warrants a different decision threshold13 super-spreader events provide insight into the probabilities and consequences in this context transmission of sars-cov-2 in the health care environment is always a concern because of the vulnerable population we serve but the risk of transmission to staff is even higher in the bronchoscopy area and the consequences would be worse than in other health care settings it is a weak link in our defense system and we should tend to it the current aabip statement on the use of bronchoscopy and respiratory specimen collection in patients with suspected or confirmed sars-cov-2 infection is timely and can help synthesize current expert-based recommendations it will have to be a living document that will evolve as our knowledge evolves however the covid-19 epidemic impacts not just bronchoscopy in patients with suspected or confirmed sars-cov-2 infection it should impact how we think about bronchoscopies for other indications even in patients where we have no suspicion of the disease this will require additional data collection and analysis as well as timely and prudent decision making that incorporates not only probabilities but consequences as well bronchoscopy in the age of covid-19 needs to change but the underlying concepts of epidemiology and decision theory can still serve us well as we work together to address these problems  new approaches to quantifying the spread of infection louise matthews mark woolhouse   recent major disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and foot-and-mouth disease in the uk coupled with fears of emergence of human-to-human transmissible variants of avian influenza have highlighted the importance of accurate quantification of disease threat when relatively few cases have occurred traditional approaches to mathematical modelling of infectious diseases deal most effectively with large outbreaks in large populations the desire to elucidate the highly variable dynamics of disease spread amongst small numbers of individuals has fuelled the development of models that depend more directly on surveillance and contact-tracing data this signals a move towards a closer interplay between epidemiological modelling surveillance and disease-management strategies deterministic a process that does not contain an element of chance deterministic models are often used to describe the progress of an epidemic through large populations in which small fluctuations at the individual level are assumed not to have an important effect on the dynamics  one of the first examples of an epidemiological investigation as would be recognized today was the identification by nineteenth-century physician john snow of the cause of the 1854 london cholera outbreak by creating a map of cholera deaths and tracing the source of water used by victims he pinpointed the origin of infection to a contaminated water pump on broad street -and in doing so rejected the prevalent bad air theory of cholera transmission 1  his approach would not be out of place in modern epidemiology recent dramatic disease outbreaks such as foot-andmouth disease in the uk and emerging diseases in the human population such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars have highlighted the role of a suite of epidemiological tools -molecular typing surveillance tracing of infectious contacts and mathematical modelling -in monitoring disease spread and determining appropriate control measures what john snow lacked in his toolkit was the modern science of mathematical epidemiology which provides a quantitative framework for describing the spread of disease in 1911 another physician ronald ross determined a threshold value for the density of the mosquito vectors below which the transmission of malaria could not be sustained 2  this was an important breakthrough and heralded the arrival of modern epidemiological theory this threshold value was given a solid mathematical footing by kermack and mckendrick 3  and arrived thanks to macdonald 4 and dietz 5  in its modern form as the basic reproduction ratio r 0 see ref 6 for a historical review the basic reproduction ratio is the average number of secondary infections produced by one infected individual when that individual is introduced into a previously unexposed population if r 0 1 then on average the number of new infections will grow whereas if r 0 1 new infections will on average decline and a major outbreak cannot occur an extensive and highly successful body of epidemiological theory 7 that is centred around this idea lays claim to key concepts which include outbreakcontrol strategies herd immunity 8  vaccination and disease eradication policies 9 and the identification of core groups in heterogeneous populations as targets for control 10  despite its many successes it has long been known that this deterministic theory which deals with the average progress of disease spread through a population does not capture key features of infection nature the average number of secondary infections that is produced by one infected individual when that individual is introduced into a population that might have been previously exposed to infection contain vaccinated individuals or be subject to control measures to limit transmission generation time the mean time interval between an individual becoming infected and an individual that they infect becoming infected dynamics that surround disease invasion persistence and extinction 11 12 13  these elements hinge on chance stochastic events in the chain of transmission which influence the spread of infection amongst small numbers of individuals 14 and can lead to different outbreak scenarios conceptually probabilistic models that take into account stochastic pathogen dynamics are not new 15 16  however their apparent inscrutability compared with their deterministic counterparts coupled with the complexities of fitting these models to data to estimate parameters has limited their widespread use recently however increasing computational power modern statistical methods 17 18 19 20 21 and availability of detailed outbreak tracing and surveillance data are allowing the practical implementation of models that better reflect the underlying variability in the biological processes this article focuses on recent developments in this area of mathematical modelling with application to specific disease outbreaks examples we consider include i quantification of the reproduction ratio in the early stages of an outbreak for sars and foot-and-mouth disease ii the distribution of outbreak sizes which allows the monitoring of trends in disease epidemiology towards disease emergence or re-emergence for measles and avian influenza and iii modelling transmission dynamics within small populations vancomycin-resistant enterococci in a hospital setting escherichia coli o157 on cattle farms and an outbreak of norovirus in schoolchildren the global sars outbreak of 2003 stimulated the development of a range of models from classic deterministic compartmental models 2223 to a detailed stochastic metapopulation model 24  all aimed at quantifying the spread of infection and exploring the potential effectiveness of different control measures the outbreak will be remembered for the dramatic effect of super-spreaders -highly infectious individuals -who seeded several large clusters of cases 25  quantifying the impact of these individuals on the transmission dynamics was a source of difficulty for the models the possibility that an infection might generate a super-spreading event introduces inherent uncertainty in predicting the future course of the outbreak however it was precisely the heterogeneities in the transmission dynamics of sars that served to underline the importance of a model structure that captured the possibility of chance or stochastic events in the infection process a deterministic model produces a single unique outcome whereas the probabilistic nature of a stochastic model means that for the same underlying input parameters it can produce a tree of possible outcomes further variability can arise from various sources including differences between individuals in risk of acquiring infection 26-28  infectiousness once infected 29 and patterns of contact with other individuals 10  consequently of two people infected at the metropole hotel in hong kong the individual arriving in vancouver produced no further infections 30  whereas the individual arriving in toronto infected several family members triggering an outbreak in which ultimately hundreds of people were infected 31  in estimating the effective reproduction ratio r for the sars outbreak lipsitch et al 32 took a dual approach that spanned both traditional and modern methodologies the standard deterministic approach is to express r in terms of parameters that describe the average growth rate of infected cases here it is assumed that significant depletion of susceptible individuals has not occurred so that the number of cases grows exponentially at a rate determined by r and the generation time describing the dynamics in this way provides a straightforward estimate for r with uncertainty in generation-time estimates translating into uncertainty in r lipsitch and colleagues 32 obtained estimates for r in the range of 22-36 for generation times ranging from 8 to 12 days however this approach did not capture either the heterogeneities underlying the spread of infection or the variability generated by the stochastic nature of the process if distributions that capture the heterogeneities are known simulating the tree of possible outcomes can be relatively straightforward 33  the real challenge lies in reversing this process to estimate unknown parameters from an observed rate of spread the last decade has seen important advances in this area with increased computing power allowing the practical implementation of likelihood and bayesian methods 18 19 20 34  which explore the tree of possible epidemic paths and in doing so identify probable ranges for parameter values the essence of the bayesian approach is that it provides a means of incorporating prior knowledge about a system for example on the range or probable distribution for a parameter into subsequent data analysis or model fitting lipsitch et al 32 used such a technique to derive estimates for r in the early phase of the sars outbreak in hong kong key to their analysis was the availability of detailed clinical and contact-tracing data for the first 205 cases in singapore these data enabled them to produce as input for the model prior distributions that characterize without specifying them exactly the person-toperson variability in infectious period and the highly skewed distribution of secondary cases produced by an infected individual the estimates they obtained for r contained considerable uncertainty -a mean of 35 with a range of 15-77 -which reflected the striking heterogeneity in transmission dynamics generated by the super-spreaders the super-spreaders dramatically increase the variance in the prior distribution for secondary cases which broadens the spectrum of possible simulated outcomes and consequently increases uncertainty in estimates for r the sars outbreak highlighted the vital role of tracing data in identifying heterogeneities in the number of secondary infections generated by an infected case in this outbreak contact tracing was carried out by reconstructing the detailed movements the average number of secondary infections that is produced by a single individual infected at time t it is typically smaller than the basic reproduction ratio as factors such as depletion of susceptible individuals or implementation of control measures will reduce the number of secondary cases generated of infected individuals however additional means of contact tracing are offered by molecular typing of isolates rna viruses such as the sars coronavirus are characterized by high mutation rates so tracking the evolution of the virus through a population is one method of identifying sources of infection whereas molecular typing of isolates was not a practical tool for contact tracing during the sars outbreak a microarray has recently been developed for resequencing isolates of the sars virus 35  this type of technical advance might be useful as a practical tool for tracking the spread of pathogens sars or other small-genome pathogens at the individual level in future outbreaks molecular typing could therefore make direct reconstructions of the epidemic tree of the sort we discuss later for foot-and-mouth disease a realistic possibility that said this form of contact tracing would not replace the tracing of social contacts as the identification and pre-emptive isolation of potentially infective individuals is in its own right an important public-health control measure 36-40  the exceptionally close monitoring of the uk footand-mouth outbreak in 2001 allowed the development of detailed models that aimed to capture both the temporal and spatial spread of infection 41-43  these models varied from the microsimulation model of keeling et al 42  which was based on known locations of farms to the more mathematically abstract representation of the spatial clustering of cases adopted by ferguson et al 41 although they provide valuable insight into transmission dynamics the construction of such models often requires simplifying assumptions about important epidemiological processes such as contact structure infectiousness distribution and susceptibility to infection additionally the models might be difficult to fit to data to obtain estimates for unknown parameters if what is required is a retrospective estimate for r instead of a prediction of the future course of the outbreak 4142  then an alternative is offered by a novel parameter-free method developed by haydon et al 44 this approach uses the detailed surveillance data to reconstruct the epidemic tree on a case by case basis this was done by assigning a parent to each daughter case either from known infectious contacts identified by contact tracing or selected from the premises that were known to have been infectious when the case became infected this approach is appealing for several reasons the method is straightforward and transparent and by using the data directly it naturally encompasses case-to-case variability for example in infectious period which allows the modelling of a complex spatio-temporal process with minimal assumptions foot-and-mouth disease arose in the uk in early february of 2001 with the first case confirmed on 20 february a national movement ban was imposed on livestock 3 days later a retrospective outbreak investigation by the department for environment food and rural affairs defra formerly the ministry for agriculture food and fisheries estimated that 78 livestock premises across the uk were infected by this time prior to the ban the outbreak was characterized by widespread dissemination of infection on a national scale through animal movements between farms and livestock markets applying the methodology of haydon et al 44 to the spread of foot-and-mouth prior to the movement ban reveals a highly skewed distribution of secondary cases produced per infected case fig 1 reconstruction of the outbreak prior to the ban produces an estimate for r 0 of 299 95 confidence interval ci 115-523 45  but when infections linked to markets are removed the estimate falls to 195 95 ci 095-346 this reveals the substantial effect of the markets in disseminating infection over a third of infections arising during this period were attributed to markets indicating that in the context of foot-and-mouth infection they were acting as super-spreaders  after implementation of the ban transmission of foot-and-mouth was predominantly local with estimates for the case reproduction ratio r t  falling shortly after to about 15 ref 46 an epidemic is only considered to be under control when the r t is less than one the method of haydon et al 44 was used to monitor the r t on a week-by-week basis to assess the efficacy of implemented control measures though this approach is ostensibly a means of reconstructing the observed epidemic using tracing data as input it also provides a flexible environment for examining what if  scenarios by pruning branches that depend on the existence of links between particular parents and daughters this type of analysis indicates that if the national movement ban had been imposed two days earlier the final size of the epidemic would have been reduced to 48 95 ci 39-63 of its observed size output from this model also provides a distribution of r t values that coupled with information about the generation time of the pathogen this can be used to make accurate short-term predictions box 1 the foot-and-mouth and sars examples highlight the benefits of data-driven approaches in epidemiological modelling in the case of sars the method is parametric a subset of the data is used to provide prior distributions for relevant parameters and estimates are obtained by fitting to the total outbreak data by contrast the approach for the foot-andmouth outbreak is non-parametric distributions are taken directly from the data and used to reconstruct the epidemic tree in both cases heterogeneities in the number of secondary infections generated by an infected case exemplified by the super-spreaders of the sars outbreak mean that contact-tracing data is essential for proper quantification of uncertainty in the reproduction ratio awareness of the potential threat to public health that would be posed by the adaptation of the avian influenza virus to generate a human-to-human transmissible strain has focused attention on surveillance measures to assess whether any such strain has emerged 47  the 2003-2004 outbreak of avian influenza in south-east asia resulted in relatively few human cases but mortality rates were extremely high -almost 70 of cases were fatal 48 -a statistic that compares starkly with the 2-3 fatality rate of the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 ref 49 and the 13 fatality rate of the sars outbreak 37  therefore it is vital to identify unusually large clusters of influenza cases as early as possible as this might signal that a human-to-human transmissible influenza virus has emerged ferguson et al 50 investigated the power of a quantitative approach to detect the occurrence of an un usually large cluster of infection owing to the highly stochastic nature of disease transmission among small numbers of individuals data on a single small cluster of cases is unlikely to be informative but the distribution of cluster sizes follows a predictable pattern that is dependent on r 0 refs 5152 the method of ferguson et al 50 is to fit the observed data excluding the largest cluster to date to the theoretical distribution if the largest cluster of avian influenza cases to date is indeed an anomaly then on fitting of the full data set to the theoretical distribution this would register as a decrease in goodness-of-fit importantly the method does not require the largest cluster to have been fully observed -once a certain number of cases has been reached the goodness-of-fit statistic will drop below a threshold value and trigger public-health alarm bells because this technique needs to detect potentially small increases in outbreak sizes an awareness of the impact of imperfect surveillance is important in this instance unbiased under-reporting of cases tends to reduce estimates for r 0  but counter-intuitively under-reporting combined with contact tracing of reported cases can lead to an over-estimate for r 0  as small clusters can be disproportionately missed nonetheless this method of estimating r 0 can be a useful additional tool as part of an early-warning system that comprises outbreak surveillance contact tracing to identify cases that cannot be linked to an animal reservoir and molecular typing to detect the emergence of unusual viral strains an illustration of these methods applied to the distribution of outbreak sizes for foot-and-mouth disease in the uk is given in box 2 re-emergence of measles in the uk the distribution of outbreak sizes used by ferguson et al 50 to describe clusters of avian influenza cases relies on the theory of branching processes 53  which describes the patterns of disease extinction and sizes of small outbreaks well when r 0 or r are below 1 however it is only recently that these methods have been used as a surveillance tool to detect unusual patterns and assess trends in underlying epidemiology 51 52 54  specific applications include assessment of the efficacy of vaccination programmes for childhood diseases in which the aim is to achieve a sufficient level of coverage to maintain r below 1 refs 79 using the distribution of small outbreak sizes in vaccinated populations to calculate r can identify potential failures of vaccination control programmes concerns about the potential side effects of the measles mumps and rubella mmr triple vaccine in the uk led to a decline in uptake of the mmr vaccine from 1998 onwards in parallel an apparent increase in the frequency and size of measles outbreaks was observed 52  by comparing estimates of r for the periods 1995-1998 and 1998-2002 jansen et al 52 showed that the observed trends reflected a significant increase in r -from 047 to 082 -which corresponded with the declining levels of immunity reassuringly their upper confidence limits indicate that r is still below the critical value of 1 however if r rises above 1 the re-emergence of measles as an endemic disease in the uk is possible here combining statistical analyses of surveillance data with dynamic epidemiological models makes it possible to identify whether trends in the data reflect genuine changes in underlying epidemiology moreover this allows predictions to be made -for example of probable sizes of clusters should vaccine coverage continue to fall -which owing to the nonlinear dependence of mean outbreak sizes on r could not readily be made directly from surveillance data epidemiological data can be expensive and difficult to collect in practice data might be limited to a snapshot of the prevalence of infection in different locations or across multiple populations however even in the absence of explicit information on the time-course of infected cases it is still possible to extract information on the underlying dynamics 55 56  this is done by identifying global patterns that the observed data represent for example the size of any one measles outbreak is unpredictable but the distribution of outbreak sizes arising from multiple introductions of infection follows a predictable pattern 51 52  snapshot data collected from scottish cattle farms showed that the distribution of cattle shedding the zoonotic pathogen e coli o157 across farms was highly skewed at the time of sampling most farms had no shedding animals some had intermediate numbers of shedding animals and a small percentage of farms had high numbers of shedding animals standard theory 7 suggests that for infections that lead neither to death nor long-term immunity one would expect an equilibrium prevalence of infection in a population that reflects the balance between transmission and recovery however in small groups of animals stochasticity in the dynamics can prevail leading both to occasional high prevalences and frequent extinctions of infection from the group globally we expect to find an equilibrium distribution of prevalences across groups that reflects the balance between introduction of infection either from an environmental reservoir or from another farm within-group transmission and stochastic extinction matching this theoretical distribution to the observed distribution of prevalences can provide estimates for the within-group r 0  therefore by examining the global pattern of prevalence we can draw conclusions about local transmission dynamics moreover investigating departures of the data from the expected distribution can identify important heterogeneities in transmission dynamics closer inspection of the observed prevalences of e coli o157 and theoretical distributions reveals a discrepancy -the theoretical distribution fails to accurately reproduce the numbers of farms with high numbers of shedding animals one proposed explanation for this divergence between theory and observation is that the high levels of infection are generated by a small number of cattle that are highly infectious super-spreaders of e coli o157 ref 56 incorporating this possibility into the model and estimating the different contributions to r 0 made by super-spreading and normal animals indicates that more than 80 of we illustrate the approach of ferguson et al 50 by using it to determine the effective reproduction ratio r for these outbreaks and assess whether the 1967-1968 epidemic was unusually large or within probable ranges given our estimate for r the probability pn for the number of cases n generated in an outbreak with r1 is given by 51 the point at which the goodness-of-fit statistic reaches a critical value determines a crucial size above which an outbreak can be regarded as epidemiologically distinct from preceding ones part b of the figure shows how the critical outbreak size depends on the level of confidence required in this assessment quantified by the p value here to be 95 confident that the largest outbreak in question is unusually large its size should exceed approximately 500 an outbreak below this threshold though constituting an important incident for the livestock industry should not automatically be regarded as a failure of implemented control policies more detailed analyses of the 1967-1968 outbreak have confirmed that it was indeed epidemiologically distinct from previous outbreaks in particular it was characterized by unusual atmospheric conditions that led to high levels of windborne virus transmission in the early stages 72  this resulted in high values for r that subsequently fell to about 20 ref 73a value significantly higher than our estimate for the preceding 179 outbreaks the range of biologically plausible values that can be taken by the parameters of a model transmission might be derived from fewer than 20 of animals -making these highly infectious individuals obvious targets for control 57  this example shows how snapshot data can shed light on transmission dynamics by examining infection prevalences in small groups of individuals at different stages in the cycle of invasion transmission and extinction it is possible to obtain estimates for relative rates of introduction transmission and recovery from infection if data are only available from a single population see below for the example of a hospital intensive-care unit a similar approach can be used that captures the processes of invasion transmission and extinction but in this case it is necessary to have time-series data on the number of infected cases to quantify the transmission dynamics the emergence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial infections 58 has triggered efforts to identify routes of transmission and potential control strategies in the hospital environment effective intervention to prevent antibiotic-resistant infections requires an understanding of the most important route of acquisition -whether that is cross-colonization from other patients or de novo acquisition owing to selective pressure of antibiotic use surveillance data typically reveal striking variability in the prevalence of infection -for example 0-80 over several months for vancomycinresistant enterococci vre in an intensive-care unit in cook county hospital 59  this apparent unpredictability makes it difficult using standard statistical analyses to identify routes of colonization unless extensive and expensive genotyping information is also obtained to analyse data on the prevalence of vre in an intensive-care unit an approach conceptually similar to that described above to analyse the e coli o157 data was used 60  a stochastic individual patient-based model is used to describe how the distribution of the number of infected patients evolves through time this model incorporates patient-to-patient transmission of vre infection exogenous generation of resistance equivalent to the infection-introduction term of the e coli o157 model and recovery or removal of patients parameter estimates are obtained by matching the prevalence data to this distribution at successive observation times using maximum-likelihood methods when dealing with small numbers of individuals such as found in hospital settings a stochastic model framework is a valuable aid for interpreting outbreak dynamics 59 61 62  the power of the distributional approach taken by pelupessy et al 60 is that it provides a tool for the estimation of key parameters it allows quantification of the relative importance of cross-colonization and spontaneous acquisition these analyses showed that cross-colonization is at least as important as a route of transmission as spontaneous acquisition however r given existing control measures such as hand-washing is approximately 07 indicating that cross-colonization alone cannot support endemicity in the unit in this instance extensive genotyping data were available the consistency revealed by comparing model-based estimates with those obtained directly from the genotyping data highlights this approach and more recent extensions of the approach to allow for imperfect knowledge of the infection status of patients 63  as a valuable epidemiological tool when such data are scarce it is in the integration of surveillance data with epidemiological modelling that markov chain monte carlo 64 mcmc methods are especially useful these are state-of-the-art statistical techniques that have been specifically designed to navigate efficiently through parameter space assessing the likelihood of different reconstructions of the outbreak and identifying the most probable ranges for parameter values the key feature of this methodology is the ability to handle distributions in high-dimensional parameter space allowing both the representation of biologically detailed models and a ready means of handling missing data which can be represented as unknown parameters the last decade has seen considerable advances in the application of these methods to epidemiological data 17 18 20  the explicitness with which these methods allow the infection process to be described means that models can better reflect the way the data was generated this procedure allowed detailed modelling of an outbreak among schoolchildren of norovirus 65  which until recently was generally assumed to be transmitted through the faecal-oral route 66 67  however illness was frequently associated with the onset of projectile vomiting raising the question of whether these episodes and subsequent aerosol transmission increased the risk of infection to other children following detailed recording of the outbreak the model incorporated detailed information for each child including absences from school when they reported feeling unwell when they were exposed in the classroom to other infectious children and when they were exposed to a vomiting episode by using mcmc to explore parameter space the relative risks of infection following different forms of exposure which optimise the probability of observing the time-course of cases can be assessed the estimated parameters showed an increased risk of infection of approximately 20-fold after exposure to vomit indicating that during these episodes infected children are highly infectious super-spreaders of the virus in this instance the result confirms the conclusions of a more standard statistical analysis 67  however in less clear-cut cases the need to include multiple factors in the model for example within-and between-class mixing and exposure patterns a time-varying force-of-infection and differing exposure times of the children requires the framework of mcmc which has the flexibility to combine dynamic processes risk factors and surveillance data  these methods highlight the way in which current techniques differ from traditional modelling approaches by combining simulation of the epidemic process with parameter estimation the models are driven by the data to a greater extent allowing a more accurate representation of underlying heterogeneities and better estimates of uncertainty in transmission dynamics in the past few years there have been tremendous advances in statistical mathematical and computational techniques that are available for analysis of outbreak data these advances have greatly increased our capacity to generate meaningful epidemiological information from relatively small numbers of cases by better representation of the stochastic nature of outbreak events and improved methods for estimating parameters from such data the successful application of these techniques depends on the availability of required input data fig 2  which itself has benefited from advances in areas such as rapid diagnosis and strain typing the design of surveillance systems and information technology several of the examples discussed here foot-andmouth disease measles and sars illustrate that the combination of rapid collection and dissemination of clinical and surveillance data with the application of these new analytical approaches can be an invaluable aid to public health or veterinary services that have to make policy decisions in real time the most obvious contributions are as an early-warning system for situations in which there is potential for a major epidemic failure of control measures to bring an outbreak under control box 1 or trends that increase the likelihood of a major epidemic in the immediate future box 2 analysis of infectious-disease data will probably advance rapidly in the immediate future by better integration of disease data with demographic and environmental information for the host population this might include maps of host distributions in some instances now available at fine scales from census data information on rates of travel for example air traffic between big cities 68  or movements of livestock data on contact patterns for people in cities 69  and knowledge of land use and other environmental variables from satellite imagery such data will allow more rapid and accurate assessment of probable patterns of spread of an infectious disease from the earliest stages of an outbreak progress in infection modelling should provide considerable benefits for public health and animal health the rapid detection identification and assessment of an infectious-disease threat is vital because the speed with which effective control measures are implemented is usually an important if not the most important factor in the size of an outbreak 70  progress in this area requires as a crucial first step greater familiarity of public-health and animalhealth scientists with mathematical modelling and a greater familiarity of mathematical modellers with the requirements and expertise of public health and veterinary sciences louise matthews has worked as a post-doctoral researcher and currently as a research fellow at the university of edinburgh since 1997 her research interests lie in the application of mathematical models to infectious-disease data to investigate within-host dynamics of disease pathogenesis metapopulation dynamics and persistence of rare pathogens control strategies and their optimal implementation and identification of heterogeneities such as super-spreaders which drive the spread of disease mark woolhouse has held the chair of veterinary public health and quantitative epidemiology at the university of edinburgh since 1997 his research interests concern the epidemiology and pathogenesis of animal and human infectious diseases he works on a variety of infectious disease systems ranging from prion diseases to viruses bacteria protozoa and helminths the common theme is the development of a formal quantitative understanding of the dynamics of parasites and pathogens within their host populations with particular emphasis on informing the design of disease control programmes  the last decade has seen considerable advances in statistical mathematical and computational techniques that are available for the analysis of outbreak data these advances have greatly increased our capacity to generate meaningful epidemiological information from relatively small numbers of cases of an infection by better representation of the stochastic nature of the outbreak events and improved methods for estimating parameters from such data  this review focuses on the application of such models which capture the highly variable dynamics of infection spread amongst small numbers of individuals in the following areas quantifying the basic reproduction ratio r 0 in the early stages of an outbreak for footand-mouth disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars short-term predictions of outbreak progress foot-and-mouth disease trends towards disease emergence or re-emergence measles in the uk as an early warning system when there is the threat of a major outbreak avian influenza and capturing transmission dynamics within small populations antibiotic-resistant nosocomial infections  an important development is the integration of clinical surveillance and contact-tracing data into the modelling process this leads to models that are better able to capture the underlying variability in the transmission dynamics and can do so with minimal assumptions in particular heterogeneities in the number of secondary infections generated by an infected case as exemplified by the super-spreaders of the sars outbreak mean that contact tracing is essential for a proper quantification of uncertainty in the reproduction ratio  advances in the analysis of outbreak data in the near future will probably come from the further development of molecular techniques to assist contact tracing and from the better integration of disease data with demographic and environmental information  spatial approximations of network-based individual level infectious disease models nadia bifolchi rob deardon zeny feng   having the ability to produce accurate mathematical models of infectious disease spread can help provide researchers and government officials with the knowledge needed for making policy decisions directed toward containment of disease spread quick and accurate disease models may answer critical questions that can potentially save lives and protect economies for example severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 had a drastic affect on tourism food and travel costing china 85 and canada 43 billion us dollars beutels et al 2009 another example is given by meltzer et al 1999 who estimated the economic impact of a future influenza pandemic in the united states at 713 to 1665 billion us dollars generally infectious diseases propagate via complex individual-level interactions or contacts between infected and susceptible individuals in the population combining all individual contact information into a contact network enables researchers to analyze disease spread through the population there is a substantial amount of literature on network based epidemiology in diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza eg cauchemez et al 2011 dub 2009 jewell et al 2009 marchbanks et al 2011 streftaris and gibson 2004 zhen et al 2011 however network data that we may wish to use to model the spread of various diseases is often difficult to obtain collection of such data is expensive and there are issues regarding recall and privacy encroachment a connection or a contact between two individuals is usually deemed to be any contact between individuals by which the disease can spread from an infected individual to a susceptible individual the connections themselves can be hard to describe as researchers must quantify the type of relationship or contact needed for infection to transfer keeling and eames 2005 the networks may be social in nature spatial proximity based or demographic kolaczyk et al 2009 for example a network may be defined by sexual activity between two individuals in the case of a sexually transmitted disease alternatively if trying to model the spread of the norwalk virus in people we might use knowledge about which individuals live together in the same house attend the same schools or work together etc if modeling a livestock disease at the level of individual farms say we may want data on the trade networks supply networks and even social networks of farmers and farm workers due to the complexity of and difficulties in obtaining accurate information about such networks simplifications are sometimes made in the model being used for example we may use a spatial network rather than a more desirable trade network examples of such spatial simplification can be found in a number of models of the uk 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic chis ster and ferguson 2007 chis ster et al 2009 deardon et al 2010 keeling et al 2001 plant epidemiologists often make such simplifications as their subjects are generally stationary thus allowing infective pressures to decrease exponentially with distance exponential decay with a power of distance geometric decay or with a nearest neighbor effect beutels et al 2009 filipe and maule 2004 a piecewise function similar in concept to the nearest neighbor effect only with a given probability of infection from a long distance source has also been used in modeling wildlife infectious diseases in which a physical barrier such as a river reduces mixing within the population smith et al 2005 the simplest assumption to make for any infectious disease model is to assume homogeneous mixing within the population thereby with no other covariate information assuming equal infective pressure on all individuals within the population bansal et al 2007 provides insight into the ability of homogeneous-mixing compartmental models ability to predict the characteristics of network-based epidemics 
deardon et al 2010 define a class of individual-level models ilms that can be used to model the spread of disease when its spread depends on various individual-level risk factors spatio-temporal aspects of the infectious disease can easily be incorporated into such ilms enabling researchers to incorporate spatial proximity to infectious individuals in the model similarly network information can be included in such models the statistical process of fitting the model to observed data is one key aspect of analyzing epidemic data ilms and similar models can be fit to data within a bayesian statistical framework using markov chain monte carlo mcmc the purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of using spatial information as a proxy to more complex network information when fitting ilms to epidemic data our intention with this paper is to present generic insights into the cost of using a spatial model when the underlying population is connected by a spatially-based network this is carried out via two simulation studies these studies involve simulating epidemics propagated through networks of varying complexity and comparing the results obtained when both network-based and spatial-based ilms are fit to the simulated data the paper is laid out as follows the general ilm framework and specific ilms used in the paper will be outlined in section 2 epidemic study and model assessment criteria will also be discussed section 3 presents the results of the simulation studies via the use of our chosen model assessment criteria conclusions that are made from the results as well as a list of possible future work will be given in section 4 the general framework of individual-level models ilms for infectious disease is presented in deardon et al 2010 here we briefly review this framework in the context of a susceptible-infectious-removed sir compartmental class of models in a discrete time sir model each individual i can be in one of three states at any time point is implies that the individual is susceptible to the disease ii implies that the individual is infected and is infectious ir implies that the individual is removed from the population and no longer able to be infected or infect other individuals eg by recovering and gaining immunity to the disease or dying an individual i in one of these states at time t is denoted to be in the set stit or rt respectively the epidemic history comprises stitrt for t1tmax where tmax is the time at which the last infectious individual enters the removed state individuals within the epidemic may only move from si and ir individuals are defined as discrete points in space and time with the probability of a susceptible individual i becoming infected with the disease at time t equal to1pit1-exp-ijitjij-itwhere i is a function representing potential risk factors associated with susceptible individual i contracting the disease j is a function representing potential risk factors associated with infectious individual j transmitting the disease ij is an infection kernel representing potential risk factors involving both infected and susceptible individuals j and i respectively it is a function that accounts for some random behavior within the epidemic that cannot be explained by the other terms in the model eg infection of a susceptible individual by an infectious individual from outside the observed population for the purpose of this paper it is set to zero we define the epidemic history as stitrtt0tmax given the complete epidemic history the likelihood can be computed as2lyt1tmaxiit1itpitist11-pitwhere y is the observed epidemic data  is a vector of parameters 
it1it is the set of newly infected individuals at time t1 and st1 is the set of susceptible individuals at time t1 we now introduce the specific forms of the general ilm given in 1 used in this paper here if the infection kernel ijdij where dij is the euclidean distance between individuals i and j then we refer to the infection kernel as a distance kernel the primary epidemic-driving characteristic of the network ilm is the existence or not of an edge in a contact network representing the existence of a link between two individuals through which disease can potentially transfer the probability that individual i is infected at time t under the network ilm is given by3pitn1-exp-jitcijwhere  is an infectivity parameter and4cij1if a connection exists between individualsiandj0otherwisethe contact network remains constant over time and is utilized when allowing the epidemic to spread within the population and fitting the network ilm model the geometric ilm is based upon a geometric distance kernel where 
dijdij- characterizes the risk of infection depending on the distance here the probability that individual i is infected at time t is given by5pitg1-exp-jitdij-where  is an infectivity parameter for contracting the disease  is the spatial parameter and dij is the euclidean distance between individuals i and j the exponential kernel model is based upon a distance kernel dijexp-dij the probability that individual i is infected at time t is defined by6pite1-exp-jitexp-dijwhere  is an infectivity parameter for contracting the disease and  is the spatial parameter the constant piecewise model is characterized by a distance kernel that is based on a piecewise constant infectivity dependant on a single change-point the probability that individual i is infected at time t is given by7pitp1-exp-jitdijwheredijdijdij
 the homogeneous mixing model is the simplest model among all models being tested probabilities of infection are based purely on the number of infected individuals in the population at a given time the probability that individual i is infected at time t is defined by8pitm1-exp-jitwhere  is a constant transmissibility parameter thus at any given time t each susceptible individual has an equal chance of being infected the epidemic population consists of 625 individuals positioned on a 25  25 grid such that each individual i is located spatially at the coordinates xy for all combinations of xy125 simulated contact networks produced for this study are based on three parameters eineout and radius r the probability of an undirected connection between two individuals within distance r of each other is equal to ein while the probability of a connection for distances greater than r is eout a contact network for a given population can be generated for given eineout and r parameters a total of 27 combinations of parameter values are used to generate epidemics the values of the parameters used are ein030507eout0000502 and r357 epidemics are then simulated using the contact network generated and the network model 3 with 04 and an infectious period of two time units for each individual a simulation with alternative infectivity parameters was also generated with 01 and an infectious period of six time units for each individual the epidemic begins when one randomly selected individual becomes infectious at t1 the epidemic proceeds with the probability of infection being calculated for each susceptible individual at each time point t according to the network model 3 with 04 or 01 accordingly the epidemic runs for t125 there are 10 epidemics simulated per parameter combination the population for this study contains the same number of individuals grid layout and size as study one however contact networks used in this study incorporate the existence of super-spreaders in a population in which the underlying probability of contact decays continuously over distance this underlying probability of an undirected connection between two individuals follows a geometric spatial decay according to9pcij11-exp-dij-additionally super-spreaders are superimposed on the network these super-spreaders are randomly chosen individuals that are forced to have a relatively large number of connections with other individuals selected completely randomly from within the population in this study the spatial decay parameter  is either set at high or low rates of 11 and 075 respectively the number of super-spreaders is set at either 10 or 40 the number of random connections for each super-spreader is simulated from a poisson distribution with a mean of either 20 or 50 therefore eight parameter combinations are used to generate contact networks epidemics are then simulated in the same procedure and according to the same network model 3 as in study one the algorithms for both contact networks were chosen and created to provide broad yet sensible examples of possible networks the piecewise function for generating contact information within study one is simple with a clear change-point spatial relationship an example of this system could be seen in developing countries where travel distance is localized the super-spreader concept of study two increases the randomness and connectivity within the contact network lloyd-smith et al 2005 postulate that super-spreading is inherent within many epidemics this concept drove the methodology behind this contact network in both cases the underlying network generators were chosen with the view that they would generate a wide range of networks some of which a spatial ilm might be able to model well and some of which not the networks produced under these schemes will also be applicable to a wide range of disease systems from systems in which spread is very local eg soil borne plant pathogens causing root rot local with longer distance transmission eg domestic animal disease spread via animal contact such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome with or without super-spreaders eg markets in the case of a farming system and very random less spatial systems such as influenza in humans models are fit within a bayesian framework which uses the likelihood ly to update prior information p to attain the posterior distributionylypeach of the models described network ilm geometric ilm exponential ilm constant piecewise and homogeneous mixing models are fitted to the simulated epidemic via metropolis-hastings markov chain monte carlo with uniform random walk proposals for each parameter all priors used except for that of the constant piecewise radius parameter are vague consisting of independent positive half-normal distributions with a mode of zero and variance of 1000 a uniform distribution with bounds of one and ten was used for the radius parameter of the constant piecewise model this was done to force the fitting of a piecewise kernel and to not allow 0 or  which essentially results in the homogeneous mixing model see section 4 mh-mcmc chains are run for 50000 iterations with a burn-in period of 5000 convergence is confirmed through visual inspection posterior means values for each model parameter were calculated individually for all model fit was evaluated at the individual and population level via several assessment techniques the first criterion is carried out by a comparison of the one-step ahead probability of infection under the posterior mean of each of the fitted models with that of the true model this is carried out as follows for a given fitted model in an otherwise susceptible population six individuals are randomly infected in an area within the centre of the population corners of the area being given by coordinates 1010 1018 1810 and 1818 these infectious individuals make up the set i the set s contains the remaining 619 individuals not in i the probability of infection at the next time point is then calculated via the network model of 3 with 04 for the susceptible individuals s let pit be this true probability of infection with10pit1-exp-jicijwhere cij is the true contact network infection probabilities for the susceptible individuals s are then calculated under the various models using their respective posterior mean estimates and the true contact network for the network ilm the posterior mean value used is based only on the individual epidemic replication under consideration let pif be the probability of infection of individual is under the fitted model given pif and pit we define11cfipit-pif01is
12fcfswhere cf and s are the number of individuals in sets cf and s respectively thus f is the proportion of absolute differences between the fitted probabilities of susceptible individuals being infected under the true model and other considered models that exceed the cutoff value of 01 the final f reported is an average over all ten epidemic replicates a model which has a smaller f is considered to be a better fitting model this model assessment technique allows for the evaluation of model fit at the individual level and is an effective assessment criterion as it provides an overall measure of predictive power for each model at the individual level the probability of a susceptible individual i becoming infected by a single infectious individual j plotted against the distance between the individuals dij under the true model and posterior means of the fitted model for each network parameter combination for study one was also used to determined model fit at the individual level these plots present how each models spatial characteristics change the probability of infection this can be compared to the true contact networks model change evaluation of model fit at the population level involved analyzing the posterior predictive distribution of the epidemic timeline the epidemic timeline is defined as the number of newly infected individuals at each time point every posterior predicted epidemic timeline is estimated by drawing a value at random from the respective model parameters posterior distribution and allowing the epidemic to spread according to the model and its posterior values within the same population for which the posterior information is based on this procedure is repeated one hundred times for each epidemic the resulting plot presents a posterior predictive distribution of the epidemic timeline which can be compared to the true epidemic timeline of the original data precision and bias of the epidemic timeline posterior predictive distribution can then be analyzed and assessed for each model at the qualitative level quantitate information about the posterior predictive distribution of the epidemic timeline was obtained by calculating the mean predicted squared error mpse13mpse12500i1100t125nit-nt2where nit is the predicted number of newly infected individuals at time t for a given posterior predictive epidemic timeline i and nt is the true number of newly infected individuals of the original epidemic the mpse quantifies the variance and bias of each models posterior predictive distribution for the epidemic timeline the mpses of the ten replicates for each contact network parameter are then averaged and compared with lower values indicating better results the network ilm was the model for which the best results were expected since the observed epidemic was simulated using a network ilm further the true underlying contact network over which the observed epidemic was generated was used in the fitted model for all 27 parameter combinations of study one and all 8 parameter combinations of study two f are zero for the network ilm results of the mpse for the network ilm were generally favorable compared to the other models tested the non-network models fit were the geometric ilm exponential ilm constant piecewise model and the homogeneous mixing model there seem to be no obvious simple relationships between f and either ein or r however with 01 and infectious period equal to six time units there was an apparent increase in f with increasing ein the network parameter that had by far the greatest effect on f was eout all non-network models produced the lowest f values for parameter combinations involving eout00 the f values for all non-network models were substantially higher than the f values for the network ilm non-network model f values ranked on average from lowest to highest were given by constant piecewise model geometric ilm exponential ilm and finally the homogeneous mixing model results between the geometric ilm and exponential ilm were often similar plots of the fitted probability of a susceptible individual becoming infected by an infectious individual against the distance between the two individuals for each of the fitted models under the posterior means along with the true model for study one can be seen in fig 3
for various combinations of the network parameters similar to the f results mpse values were highly related to the eout value with the lowest mpses from eout00 model performance for the mpse depended on the eout value in all cases the network ilm had the lowest mpse values followed by homogeneous mixing model constant piecewise model exponential ilm and geometric ilm for eout005 and 02 however for eout00 the homogeneous mixing model performed the poorest increases in the number of super-spreaders the number of connections for each super-spreader and the spatial decay rate show a propensity to increase f values for all models but the homogeneous mixing model for which the opposite effect on f is seen the lowest f values for the geometric exponential and constant piecewise models occurred for the parameter combination with the lowest amount of network connection 11ss10n20 the parameter combination with the highest amount of network connectivity 075ss40n50 resulted in the lowest f for the homogeneous mixing model non-network model f values ranked on average from lowest to highest were given by constant piecewise model geometric ilm exponential ilm and homogeneous mixing model 
mpse values were highly correlated to the degree of super-spreading and contacts within the network as with the f results model performance evaluated by the mpse was similar for low super-spreading populations generally the network ilm had the lowest mpse values followed by homogeneous mixing model constant piecewise model geometric ilm and exponential ilm 
fig 3 shows that the geometric ilm predicts the probability of a susceptible individual becoming infected by an infectious individual against distance from the infectious individual for study one fairly well however susceptible individuals with small distances from a infectious individual have infection probabilities under the fitted model which are highly inflated similarly the right tail approaches zero which underestimates the probability of an infection of susceptible individuals that are far from the infectious individual the geometric ilms posterior predictive distribution of the epidemic timeline for eout00502 is consistent with reference to the original distribution but have the highest variance about the true epidemic timeline additionally a faster spreading epidemic is predicted for the geometric ilm posterior predictive distributions of the epidemic timeline for eout00 an example of which can be seen in fig 4
 the exponential ilm tended to result in f values similar to the geometric ilm however the geometric ilm on average was slightly better fig 3 shows that the exponential ilm underestimates the probability of a susceptible individual becoming infected against distance from the infectious individual for study one the exponential ilm posterior predictive distribution of the epidemic timeline for all eout is consistent with the original distribution but has high variance about the true epidemic timeline see fig 5 fig 6
 the constant piecewise model produced the best results under the f criterion and favorable results using the mpse criteria fig 3 shows that the constant piecewise model predicts the probability of a susceptible individual becoming infected by a infectious individual against distance between the two individuals well for study one but did underestimate infection probability for susceptible individuals and improperly estimate the radius the constant piecewise model posterior predictive distribution of the epidemic timeline for all eout is consistent with the original distribution the variance is lowest in the class of spatial models and has only slightly higher variance than the homogeneous mixing model for the eout00502 cases the homogeneous mixing model predicts the probability of a susceptible individual becoming infected by an infectious individual using the distance between the two individuals very poorly for study one the average f results were also poor for both studies one and two results at the individual level were poor because the homogeneous mixing model does not take into account the distance factor as all susceptible individuals have the same infection probability at any given time this notion is an advantage however when contact networks contain a large amount of super-spreaders andor an increased number of connections per super-spreader as such the results for the mpse were favorable as the overall population with increased connectivity can be well modeled by a homogeneous mixing model the homogeneous mixing models posterior predictive distributions of the epidemic timeline for eout00502 are consistent with reference to the original distribution the variance is lowest in comparison to all spatial model at these eout levels the posterior predictive distribution of the epidemic timeline for eout00 is severely inconsistent with the true epidemic occurring earlier than predicted this can be seen in fig 4 the purpose of this paper as stated in section 1 was to examine the effects of using a spatial kernel based ilm to model disease spread actually propagated through a contact network this was carried out by simulating epidemics propagated through two types of random networks the first type specified the probability of an edge existing between two individuals as depending on the distance between two individuals being greater or less than some constant spatial distance within the second study was also used to determine the probability of an edge between two individuals but was based on a continuously spatially-decaying probability the second study added complexity through the inclusion of super-spreaders various ilms were then fit to the resulting data model fit at the individual level was assessed by considering the one-step ahead predictive probability of infection based on the posterior mean values of the parameters for the fitted models with that of the true model at the population-level model fit was assessed my analyzing the posterior predictive distribution of the epidemic timeline through a mean predicted squared error calculation we have seen that in situations where there are only contacts between individuals within a relatively short distance of each other ie eout0 in study one or are less likely to have contacts over long distances 11 in study two there is relatively little difference between the performance of each of the spatial models as they all tend to fit reasonably well in terms of predicting infection probability however when contacts occur over longer distances the spatial models tend to perform poorly if the probability of a long-distance contact is relatively high ie eout02 in study one or n andor ss are high in study two it seems that each of the spatial models performed roughly as poorly as each other with perhaps a slight preference for the constant piecewise model model fit results were not surprising given the mechanics of the simulation essentially in the first study a piecewise function was used for the contact network generation and as such the constant piecewise model would be expected to approximate this aspect well in the case of the second study the homogeneous mixing model showed improved results when the super-spreader information overpowered the underlying spatial decay the super-spreader aspect of the contact network is random and therefore would be best approximated by the homogeneous mixing model the homogeneous mixing model is a special case of the constant piecewise model when the radius parameter  of the piecewise kernel is outside the bounds of the possible infection distances observed ie 0 or  preliminary model fit of the constant piecewise model utilized a vague prior of a positive half-normal distributions with a mode of zero and variance of 1000 for  the resulting mcmc chain would often converge to a homogeneous mixing model case for the purpose of this simulation study we wanted to force the constant piecewise model to be fitted and thus restrict the radius  parameter from extremely low or high values the use of an informative prior as described in section 29 applied this restriction of course such mcmc convergence issues are indicative of model uncertainty in the case of a real data analysis researchers may want to explore this model uncertainty and could do so using techniques such as reversible jump mcmc to explore the joint parameter and model space richardson and green 1997 there are numerous avenues for further work potentially open to us only two types of contact network generators have been studied in this paper it would be interesting to analyze the results of using the various spatial ilms for different types of more complex networks for example contact structure could be a function of several sub-networks an example of this might be given by considering influenza for human populations in which different networks describe contacts from living in the same household attending the same schoolworkplace visiting the same general practitioners and so on in this paper we assumed a known and fixed infectious period for each individual obviously it would be more realistic to have a situation where the infectious period and possibly a latent period are generated from some distribution the infectious periods and latent periods for individuals could then be estimated as part of a data-augmented mcmc scheme along with the distribution of those periods this was not done here to avoid the substantial additional computational burden that would result from such a scheme and to avoid extra uncertainty which could confuse results as previously stated obtaining complete contact network information is exceedingly challenging studies into the amount of uncertainty about the network information that could be incorporated into a bayesian analysis in which the network itself is treated as an unknown parameter before conclusions drawn from the model becomes unreliable would also be of interest the intention of this paper was to present generic insights into the cost of using a spatial model when the underlying population is connected by a spatially-based network we therefore purposefully avoided using a specific application of course when modeling a real life outbreak and specific disease system the model to be fit will need to be tailored to the data collected as well as the underlying disease system we have seen that the performance of the simple spatial disease transmission models can break down easily under various scenarios when the underlying contact structure is more complex optimal model fit is achieved when the structure of the model incorporates the characteristics of the disease spread this includes the contact network if modeling a wildlife epidemic steps must be taken to determine how the mixing is occurring at a spatial level this may mean incorporating aspects describing within herd dynamics immigration and emigration rates physical barriers to movement and peak times of activity with airborne pathogens spread to plants models highlighting the spatial decay may indeed be adequate but could be improved upon if windspeed and other weather characteristics were also taken into account perhaps the overriding lesson to be drawn from the results shown here is the importance of putting in place a policy of procedures to collect high quality network and other data from the system of interest  a super-spreader of covid-19 in ningbo city in china an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has spread rapidly it is imperative to control the epidemic by understanding the epidemiological feature preventative quarantine and effective hygiene measures in the present

events serial intervals and hazard of infection for household versus non-household settings a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 3 abstract background knowledge on the epidemiological features and transmission patterns of covid-19 is accumulating detailed line-list data with household settings can advance the understanding of covid-19 transmission dynamics methods a unique database with detailed demographic characteristics travel history social relationships and epidemiological timelines for 1407 transmission pairs that formed 643 transmission clusters in mainland china was reconstructed from 9120 covid-19 confirmed cases reported during january 15 -february 29 2020 statistical model fittings were used to identify the super-spreaders and estimate serial interval distributions age and gender-stratified hazard of infection were estimated for household versus non-household transmissions results there were 34 primary cases identified as super-spreaders with 5 super-spreading events occurred within households mean and standard deviation of serial intervals were estimated as 50 95 cri 44 55 and 52 95 cri 49 57 days for household transmissions and 52 95 cri 46 58 and 53 95 cri 49 57 days for non-household transmissions respectively hazard of being infected outside of households is higher for age between 18 and 64 years whereas hazard of being infected within households is higher for young and old people conclusions non-negligible frequency of super-spreading events short serial intervals and a higher risk of being infected outside of households for male people of working age indicate a significant barrier to the identification and management of covid-19 cases which requires enhanced non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate this pandemic  in december 2019 a novel coronavirus disease have also been reported in several recent studies 5 6 7 8  starting from the last week of january 2020 more than 260 chinese cities have implemented intensive social distancing and confinement policies which brought the epidemic under control 7 8 9 10  however the epidemic has still caused more than 10000 confirmed cases in china outside hubei province within a month to enhance public health preparedness and awareness chinese health authorities have publicly reported detailed records of confirmed covid-19 cases since mid-january this provides a unique resource for studying the transmission patterns routes and risk factors of a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 5 in mainland china 27 provincial and 264 urban health commissions have publicly posted 9120 confirmed case reports online during january 15 -february 29 2020 which accounts for 72 of all cases confirmed in mainland china outside hubei province we compiled a unique line-list database using these reports which contains detailed information about the demographic feature social relationship travel history and key epidemiological timelines eg dates of symptom onset confirmation and hospitalization in contrast to several published covid-19 data repositories 11 12 13 14 15 16 which focus on describing information about individual cases our database allows to reconstruct transmission pairs and clusters by inferring potential causal associations among different cases the entire dataset of transmission pairs is available at our github httpsgithubcomlinwangiddcovid19transmissionpairschina see supplementary materials for more details we reconstructed 1407 transmission pairs using the epidemiological evidence among reported cases the section reconstruction of transmission pairs in supplementary materials specifies how we identified a pair or a group of confirmed cases using information about their close contacts stratified transmission pairs into household and non-household settings using information about familial relationships and determined the direction of transmission between infector and infectee using information about travel histories for each transmission pair we term the infector the primary case and the infectee the secondary case we also consider connected chains of confirmed cases in which we term the original case the index and the entire chain of cases including the index the transmission cluster  figure 1a  we categorized each transmission pair by the social relationship between primary and secondary cases eg familial members of the same household non-household relatives colleagues classmates friends and other face-to-face contacts considering that during the spring festival travel season january 10 -february 18 2020 several billion human movements can occur because of the tradition of chinese new year to visit and a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 6 live with their original families we considered any transmission pair with immediate familial relationships eg a persons spouse parents and children as a household transmission pair and with other familial relationships eg a persons siblings with age older than 17 or close contacts with no familial information eg classmates colleagues as a non-household transmission pair the numbers of household 662 and nonhousehold 745 transmission pairs are almost even a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 7 we estimated the age-stratified hazard of infection for household versus non-household transmissions by the ratio between the probability that a secondary case of age group b was infected by a primary case of age group a within the same household and the probability that a secondary case of age group b was infected by a primary case of age group a outside of households ie  if  then the infection within households has a higher risk than the infection outside of households for secondary cases of age group b being infected by primary cases of age group a we estimated the gender-specific hazard of infection for household versus non-household transmissions by the ratio between the probability that a secondary case of gender b was infected by a primary case of gender a within the same household and the probability that a secondary case of gender b was infected by a primary case of gender a via non-household transmission the  we in total reconstructed 643 transmission clusters formed by 1407 transmission pairs figure 1a hazard of being infected within households was higher for the age groups of young 18 and elderly 65 people whereas the hazard of being infected outside of households was higher for age groups between 18 and 64 years table 1  primary cases of elderly 65 people were more prone to cause household infections hazard of infection between different genders was higher for households than non-household transmission table 2  a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 9 we have built a line-list database with detailed demographic information travel history epidemiological timelines and social relationships for 1407 transmission pairs that formed 643 transmission clusters in mainland china outside hubei province we identified 34 primary cases as super-spreaders majority of superspreading events were observed for non-household transmissions which is consistent with a recent study 21 on transmission settings of covid-19 eg hospitals residential care prisons boarding schools cruise ships this indicates the importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions eg isolation quarantine social distancing and confinement 722-24  in mitigating the covid-19 epidemic household studies are helpful to identify risk factors for certain demographic groups 25 26  the analysis of the age-stratified and gender-specific hazard of infection suggests a higher risk of infection within households for age groups of young 18 elderly 65 and female people the higher risk of being infected outside of households for male people of age between 18 and 64 years may indicate their role in driving household secondary infections perhaps because these were travelers from wuhan of working age we identified 50 transmission pairs 35 with secondary case reported symptom onset earlier than primary case ie negative-valued serial intervals which is consistent with recent clinical reports 2728 and epidemiological studies 29 30  we estimated that the mean serial interval is around 5 days for both household and non-household infections which is considerably shorter than the mean serial interval estimated for sars eg 8 4 days 31  and mers eg 76 days 32  our findings have several limitations first the household sizes and primary cases with no secondary infections were not provided from the original public case reports this may give rise to biased estimates if we estimate the household reproduction number and secondary attack rate from the raw data field surveys will be helpful to adjust such biases second the information on nosocomial infections and public gathering settings was not available from original case reports so that the observation of super-spreading events may be less common from our dataset third caution is needed when attempting to generalize the age-stratified hazard of infection to other a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 10 demographic settings for example in

is a severe respiratory infection caused by a novel beta coronavirus mers-cov 1-3 the symptoms of mers include fever chills cough shortness of breath gastrointestinal symptoms expectoration wheezing chest pain hemoptysis sore throat headache myalgia abdominal pain vomiting and diarrhea it can also cause death in severe cases 3-6 the causative pathogen of mers is transmitted via 4 modes animal-to-human intra-familial healthcare-associated and travel-related 78 the 186 cases that occurred in south korea hereafter korea were predominantly caused by healthcare-associated transmission 79-11 followed by intra-familial transmission according to data reported to the world health organization the rates of asymptomatic or mild infection were 44 of 398 2860 in saudi arabia the united arab emirates and the islamic republic of iran between april and june 2014 and 32 of 113 2831 in saudi arabia in june 2014 1213 however oboho et al 14 reported that 7879 26 of 33 of initially reported asymptomatic patients had at least 1 symptom in korea among the 186 confirmed cases 3 asymptomatic cases were detected among healthcare workers via screening tests 161 15 in serologic studies using indirect immunofluorescence tests for healthcare workers who were at mers-affected hospitals 2 of 457 044 had positive results 16 however no report has been published regarding the asymptomatic infection rate among non-healthcare workers in korea there is a considerable chance of human-to-human transmission as well as direct infection via the dromedary camel 17-19 therefore it is necessary to identify the rate of asymptomatic mers infections in healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers this survey was conducted between august 2015 and february 2016 after the last mers case diagnosed in july 5 2015 based on a database of quarantined individuals provided by the department of epidemiologic investigation of the korea centers for disease control and prevention kcdc individuals from 4 regions with major outbreaksseoul gyeonggi chungcheong and jeonbuk were selected individuals whose mers status was diagnosed as positive using a polymerase chain reaction test were excluded from the analysis of this study from the 14831 quarantined individuals 7233 residents 488 living in the 4 major mers outbreak regions were selected of these individuals calls requesting participation in this study were made to 3291 individuals 455 according to prioritization groupings a total of 1610 individuals 489 ultimately participated in the study figure 1 those who refused to participate have been described in another study 20 the study individuals were prioritized in groups according to the transmission intensity of the mers case they were exposed to as follows contact with super-spreading events 5 or more individuals infected 21 contact with spreaders who infected 1 to 4 individuals and contact with non-spreaders we selected study subjects according to this prioritization of groups and the selection rates were 488 164 and 158 respectively we also categorized the subjects according to their exposure intensity ie status when they were exposed to the mers case as follows inpatients or outpatients at a mers-affected hospital cohabiting family members or paid caregivers of the mers case visitors of the hospitalized mers case healthcare workers employed at a mers-affected hospital and colleague of the mers case we selected more subjects from the categories of family patients and visitors table 1 only individuals who consented to participate in the study through a telephone call and gave written consent at the time of study initiation underwent surveys at local public health centers each participant responded to a questionnaire on exposure and provided a blood sample following the first serologic test by an enzymelinked immunospecific assay elisa positive or borderline cases were tested using an immunofluorescence assay ifa and a plaque reduction neutralization antibody test prnt mers-cov antibody levels in all sera collected from contacts were measured using a recombinant s1 protein-coated human anti-mers-cov immunoglobulin g igg elisa kit euroimmun luebeck germany which was used according to the manufacturers protocol the results of the tested samples were determined by calculating the ratio of the optical density od value of the sample to the od value of the calibrator ratios  11 were considered positive ratios  08 to  11 were considered borderline and ratios  08 were considered negative ifa slides were coated with mers-cov non-infected or infected vero cells serum samples were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline pbs to 110 1100 1250 and 11000 transferred to ifa slides and incubated for 30 minutes at 37c in a humidified chamber the ifa slides were washed 3 times in pbs-t for 5 minutes each and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-human igg abcam cambridge ma usa diluted at 1800 for 30 minutes at 37c in a humidified chamber after washing 3 times in pbs-t for 5 minutes the slides were embedded with a mounting fluid topped with a cover glass and observed under a fluorescent microscope the neutralizing antibodies in the serum samples were measured by prnt the prnt procedures were performed as follows in brief 110 diluted sera were heat-inactivated at 56c for 30 minutes heat-inactivated sera were diluted serially 4-fold after an equal volume of virus mers-covkorknih002052015 was added to the volume of serum dilutions these mixtures were incubated at 37c for 2 hours the mixtures were added to each well of the 24-well plate cultured with vero cells the plate was incubated at 37c for 60 minutes and 1 ml of 15 carboxymethylcellulose overlay medium was then added after incubation for 3-4 days cell staining was performed by crystal violet the titer of neutralizing antibody by prnt50 was calculated using the krber formula as described previously 22 a titer above 120 was interpreted as positive all sera with a positive or borderline reaction in elisa were tested by the ifa and prnt assays for confirmation and cases with positive results from any 2 assays were considered to be anti-mers positive this study received approval from the bioethics committee of the kcdc 2015-08-exp-03-p-a and the institutional review board of the national cancer center ncc 2016-0058 informed consent was obtained from study participants or their parent or legal guardian for children under 14 among the 3291 selected individuals the response rates of contacts with super-spreading events 5 or more individuals infected contacts with spreaders who infected 1-4 individuals and contacts with non-spreaders were 398 552 of 1388 403 139 of 345 and 590 919 of 1558 respectively according to their status when they were exposed to the mers case the highest response rates were found for healthcare workers 994 and family members 971 followed by visitors 758 colleagues 490 and patients 368 table 1 the seropositive rate using elisa was 105 6 of 574 in patients 033 1 of 307 in healthcare workers and 043 7 of 1610 overall among the 7 elisa-positive individuals 3 had contact with a super-spreading event patient zero case 1 whoinfected 28 individuals 23 1 had contact with a spreader case 118 who infected 2 individuals and 3 had contact with a non-spreader case 89 among the elisa-positive individuals only 1 was both ifa-positive and prnt-positive therefore the confirmed rates of asymptomatic mers infection were 017 in patients and 0060 95 confidence interval 0002 to 0346 overall table 1 the confirmed asymptomatic case patient zero and 11 secondary mers patients were hospitalized on the same floor of the hospital at the same time 2324 the asymptomatic case was quarantined at home for 2 weeks after discharge the case had underlying diseases that included hypertension angina and degenerative arthritis the case reported no fever cough myalgia or gastrointestinal symptoms during hospitalization or quarantine table 2 limited information exists regarding mers-cov seroprevalence among populations other than confirmed mers cases saudi arabian data showed that the seroprevalence of mers-cov igg among the general population was 015 25 suggesting that a number of cases of asymptomatic or mild infections may be present in the general population despite a high prevalence of 186 confirmed mers cases during the outbreak of mers in korea the rate of asymptomatic infection 160 15 was lower than expected the rates of asymptomatic infection confirmed using ifa and prnt in the present study were 006 1 of 1610 for all contacts and 017 1 of 574 for patients these results are markedly lower than the rates of 027 2 of 737 among healthcare workers and 044 2 of 457 among healthcare workers at mers-affected hospitals in korea 16 moreover the rate of asymptomatic or mild infection in saudi arabia the united arab emirates and the islamic republic of iran was approximately 2800 121318 the confirmed asymptomatic case presented in this study was a patient at the same hospital as confirmed mers cases and unlike in previous studies was neither an intra-familial infection nor a pediatric infection 2627 the low rate of asymptomatic infection in korea is attributable to the different transmission pathway of mers infections compared to the middle east in korea most of the mers cases were healthcare-associated infections and none were from an animal the low asymptomatic infection rate is also attributable to the extensive epidemiological investigation conducted in korea including close monitoring of contacts with mers patients this helped identify almost all mers patients this may also have been attributable to the promotion of proactive identification of patients via mass media and the establishment of communication networks by the government leading to voluntary reports by people active quarantine and countermeasures to this public health crisis 102829 elisa is appropriate as a screening tool as it is 10-fold more sensitive than ifa however it may cross-react with seasonal human coronavirus antibodies so a spike protein-specific ifa is required for confirmation prnt is a definitive test when elisa and ifa have inconclusive results 25 only 10 of elisa-positive results are positive on a neutralization assay 25 in our study 1 of 7 patients with borderline or positive elisa results also had positive results in prnt therefore the results obtained in our study are accurate because elisa ifa and prnt were used a previous study predicted the pandemic potential of mers-cov to be  5 however this does not indicate that the risk has abated 30 prerequisites for reducing the risk include improved surveillance active contact tracing and the initiation of animal host searching 3031 during the outbreak in korea mers was classified as a notifiable infectious disease and was subjected to surveillance 32 since mers is an imported disease in korea it is recommended that precautions be taken before travel and that the time of returning from travel and incubation period be considered this study showed a low seropositivity in the population of individuals quarantined due to contact with mers cases however there is a possibility that the seropositivity rate was underestimated for the following reasons firstly the participants of the present study were mostly non-healthcare workers and were relatively healthy thus the risk of infection was low secondly the overall participation rate was 489 whereas it was 368 in the patient group at a higher risk of infection moreover we only surveyed 109 of the quarantined individuals therefore the actual rate of asymptomatic infections may be higher than reported in the present study lastly the present study may have been conducted too late in a previous study mers-cov elisa results indicated that the antibody response was highest after 3 weeks from symptom onset 33 although no reports have analyzed the duration of antibody presence in mers patients regardless of symptoms a recent study of severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers reported that antibodies in some patients persisted for up to 2-3 years after infection 3435 blood sampling for serologic test in this study was performed on contacts between october and december 2015 while exposure to the confirmed case occurred between may and june 2015 a gap of 5 months thus a loss of the mers-cov antibody titer could have taken place despite actual asymptomatic infections therefore the actual rate of asymptomatic infection may be higher than the rate presented in this report in conclusion among 1610 contacts only 1 non-healthcare worker who was a patient in a mers-affected hospital had an asymptomatic mers-cov infection to understand new emerging infectious diseases such as mers more intensive epidemiologic research is needed including an analysis of asymptomatic infections  precision public health to inhibit the contagion of disease and move toward a future in which microbes spread health david thaler s michael head g andrew horsley   the antibiotic era began in the 1940s a trend toward decreasing mortality from infectious diseases began fifty years earlier in the late nineteenth century 1 at least three quarters of the decrease in mortality from infectious disease from 1900 to the present day era appears due to public health measures because antibiotics became significant only in the 1940s see fig 1 resistances to antimicrobials are increasingly common and threaten an end of the era of reliable treatment it is our wits against their genes without a clear advantage to the former 2 new antimicrobials will be discovered and developed but new resistances will arise the continuing power of antimicrobials is at risk and alternatives must be actively considered 3 4 personalized andor precision public health could fit under already-existing rubrics of prevention via surveillance and sanitation alternatively these approaches may be considered radical and different enough to suggest personal and precision public health as including novel elements and emphases the meaning and scope of the terms personalized andor precision public health are a subject of current debate 59 there is controversy about what precision public health encompasses how new the parts are and what value they may or may not have some differences in the present article compared to other expositions should be noted here we 1 emphasize monitoring physical characteristics in smart buildings 2 de-emphasize the contribution of human genomic dna sequences as a related remark susceptibility to infectious diseases is more likely to have a meaningful and robust genetic component in the young than in adult or aged individuals 10 3 emphasize finding the optimum granularity by granularity we mean the size time or other divisions for which heterogeneity is most meaningful we hypothesize the individual human being as likely to represent an especially meaningful level of granularity with regard to the microbial environment 4 future-oriented scenarios that anticipate precision public health promoting the spread of health-promoting microbiomes including but not limited to infectious vaccines technical innovations that allow higher resolution scrutiny have led to progress- even revolutions- in many subfields of biology examples include dividing tissues into cellular subtypes 11 single cell expression profiles from defined anatomy cell types or developmental lineages 1214 and cells themselves fractionated into organelles 15 an analogous revolution in public health might be possible through higher resolution mapping of relevant parameters this commentary focuses on technologies for and the consequences of increased spatial and temporal resolution of microbiological chemical physical spatial and temporal measurements relevant to public health there is a chicken and egg or catch 22 problem in anticipating the benefits of higher-resolution data this limitation follows from our current ignorance of how heterogeneous the relevant physical and microbiological parameters are new insights and benefits are likely to be proportional to how much heterogeneity is discovered as a consequence of gains in resolution to begin research that might crack the chicken and egg problem one must initially speculate on the relevant heterogeneity by hypothesis a relevant unit of heterogeneity to consider for airborne infection will be at the level of each individual human being the scales at which heterogeneity is hypothesized to exist affect the research programs to search for it the results will subsequently be used to modify the hypotheses and research program heterogeneity will be discussed further in following sections the technical means and value of increasing spatial and temporal resolution in other areas of public health such as ensuring healthy drinking water 16 and optimal transformation of sewage 17 or compost 18 will not be covered here the human exposome is currently defined elsewhere as the sum of an individuals lifetime exposure to microbes and chemicals 19 we suggest that this definition of the human exposome misses vital elements of what matters and the definition could usefully be extended in two related ways 1 it should explicitly include microbes and chemicals sourced directly from other humans which probably are a major contributor in many circumstances and 2 the exposome should be understood as a reciprocal and interactive process to account for the fact that each individual is both a source and a sink of microbes and chemicals the current definition of the exposome seems to consign a role to individual humans as passive recipients or victims of their environment this is a valid way to model parts of the system including the political system but it is biologically an incomplete description of the consequences of our being social animals individual humans are major microbiological and probably chemical contributors to their immediate environment humans in proximity are exposed to each others microbiomes and chemicals some of this is classical epidemiology of infectious disease such as transmission of human-specific viruses including influenza some chemical influences might be classed as behavioral eg cigarette smoke and the experience of second hand smoke however it is also plausible that significant chemicals that modify the exposome of self and of others arise via the microbiome or other metabolic sources over which an individual has at present no means of knowledge or control a widely cited survey estimated that most people in the us spend 90 or more of their time either inside buildings or automobiles 30 similar considerations apply in buildings and more broadly for example ships subways and airplanes most potentially consequential microbial exposure probably occurs in these venues 31 there are three sources of microbes in buildings 32 a occupants ie people and other animals if present b penetration from the outside environment c growth inon the structure itself eg walls pipes and on surfaces that are intermittently wet 33 microbial growth in garbage among foodstuffs on furnishings and cloths contributes in some cases 34 the contribution of each source to the medically relevant microbiome is not equally distributed most airborne viruses that infect humans spread from other humans although zoonotic transmission in farms and markets should not be overlooked the optimum mode of sampling depends on the distribution of targets if the target is rare and evenly distributed then gathering as much of the environment as possible into each sample is best however if the target is unevenly distributed then smaller sample sizes may be better so that rare targets are not diluted below the detection threshold if the environment or reagents also contain inhibitors or decoy targets then large scale concentration may decrease sensitivity taq polymerase and many other reagents contain bacterial dna that is residual from their production assays that use minimal amounts of taq decrease this background 26 and small volumes assays should further help for the detection of biowarfare agents that are normally absent and for which quick specific and sensitive detection are paramount many thousands of liters of air rapidly collected are appropriate 35 on the other hand to best understand the undisturbed environment the sampling method should be gentle not itself create additional airflow and it should be granular individual vacuum samplers are an intermediate methodology they are worn or left near a patient and draw air onto a filter depending on the airflow rate they sample a variable-sized environment the time resolution is typically one to several hours as currently used the whole filter which is typically 25 mm in diameter is extracted as a single sample 36 37 insight into heterogeneity of the air might be gained through a modification of the way that the sampling filter is currently processed instead of extracting the filter in one piece suppose it were cut into a number of equal segments that are processed and assayed independently if most segments are negative but a few contain a strong signal that would be clear indication of heterogeneity in the air volume sampled this reasoning and experimental design take their inspiration from classic studies that determined the independence of bacterial mutation from its subsequent selection 38 39 if spatial and temporal variation are high then smaller more localized and less mixed samples become relatively advantageous the mouth and nose are the expected source and the reservoir for most airborne infectious agents dilution into the air volume predicts that the concentration of an airborne agent will decrease as a cubic function of distance from its source deactivation of viruses in aerosol may lead to a more dramatic drop-off of viable virus samplers should be unobtrusive and not alter the sampled environment the assay of tiny volumes and the ability isolate rare positive samples recommend a new generation of small volume andor passive samplers clothing is a promising personal environmental sampling site 40 41 but difficult to standardize one might build on the clothing idea to design defined samplers optimized for capture and preservation of the microbial and chemical environment sampling material might be housed in specially-designed holders akin to radiation badges for example in hospitals all patients staff and visitors might wear standardized samplers the top of the shoulders appears to offer a minimally obtrusive yet maximally sensitive sampling site top-of-the-shoulder samplers would be closer to the mouth and nose than samplers worn as chest badges but relative sensitivity remains to be tested epaulettes such as those worn as military insignia might provide design inspiration these approaches would potentially dovetail with simultaneously tracking movements within the environment of interest and thus early consideration of the ethical issues and public or user concerns would be critical passive samplers have different characteristics that in some scenarios may make them superior to vacuum-enhanced air sampling i if the target distribution is highly heterogenous in space then source proximity may give the highest signal to noise ratio ii the related ability to identify the source with less distortion due to the samplers altering airflow each sampling patch could contain internal standards research to design samplers might take inspiration from materials for replica plating of bacteria 39 42 there may even be specific overlap of optimal materials such as velveteen a velvet-like cloth for capture super-spreaders or super-shedders are individuals who disproportionately infect others and may dominate the epidemiology of infectious disease 4346 in some contexts super-spreaders of infectious agents might be identified prospectively by molecular criteria rather than by post facto epidemiology 47 48 asymptomatic super-spreaders of airborne infections might be identified as those whose samplers harbor the most signal for the agents in question 48 super-spreaders or super-shedders have been documented in people and also among cattle and in mouse model systems 49 50 there are important unknowns concerning super-spreaders a study in cattle argues that super-shedding may be time rather than individual dependent ie the same individuals may not be super-spreaders a mere few hours later 51 it is currently unclear- in fact the question appears to be unasked- whether super-spreaders are agent-specific or generalized by further hypothesis generalized super-spreaders might excrete more of their own dna as well as that of infectious agents in this case the detection of spreading potential might be seen in two ways i by the presence of more self-sequences on the individuals samples and ii by the presence of individual sequence-specific dna from the sampling of others the anticipation would be that those who shed either the wrong ie potential pathogen or perhaps simply too much dna may be considered candidates for a variety of control measures up to and including confinement rational discussions about policy and human rights should be informed by facts 52 not all infections spread between individuals are harmful or neutral health-positive microbial spreading eg the live attenuated oral polio and rotavirus vaccines also occurs analogous to the way that some individuals are more influential than others in spreading ideas or memes 53 some may be more influential in spreading health-promoting microbiomes if social and environmental transmission of benign and of positively helpful microbiomes turns out to be the case will it follow the same rules as the spread of detrimental infections depending on their resident microbiomes the same individuals may turn out to be super-spreaders of benign health-promoting or harmful microbes the survival and distribution of airborne infectious agents depends on temperature humidity 5460 and airflow 61 62 improved mapping of these parameters would better inform building design and real-time monitoring of these parameters in occupied buildings might open the way for their dynamic optimization for example there is generally a temperature difference between indoor and outdoor environments which results in a temperature gradient across rooms whose windows or walls form a buildings exterior regions of every intermediate temperature and relative humidity will exist when the outside is below freezing and the inside is warm temperature gradients necessarily traverse the dew point where water vapor condenses into liquid the stability of regions where water vapor liquifies and the consequences for microbes are complex and situation-specific moreover most things microbial in the built environment also depend on the behavior of occupants it is therefore challenging for modelling to predict for example that a specific region of hospital room such as the southeast corner near the ceiling happens to be in a sweet spot for bacteria or virus an increasing number of smart buildings including hospitals are fitted with sensors 6365 which monitor temperature andor humidity at a given position and are networked in an internet of things iot 66 67 these iot systems can provide 3d maps of the monitored parameters in real-time and can be used eg to optimize heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac systems 68 69 or to monitor the integrity of the building structure 70 such iot systems could be readily adapted for applications targeting the microbiome with additional sensors placed in at-risk areas sensors can be installed during building construction retrofitted permanently or temporarily installed the iot systems could be augmented with other sensors to monitor eg levels of particular gas types or volatile organic compounds voc relevant to microbial growth 7173 environmental sensing will interface with wearable technology and individual-identified information 74 in addition to the temperature and humidity information provided by an iot network of sensors there is a need for devices that provide portability remote sensing and high spatial resolution these could be used to rapidly assess large areas without having to install an iot system monitor targets otherwise difficult to access or provide the cm- or mm-scale spatial resolution required to localize problem sources high resolution remote imaging of temperature is routinely performed using infrared ir cameras for radiometry exploiting the dependence of the blackbody radiation intensity at a given wavelength on temperature this ir thermal imaging can be used eg to identify thermal leakage between indoor and outdoor environments 75 blackbody radiation is also emitted at microwave frequencies although the emission intensity from room temperature bodies is much lower at microwave frequencies than at ir frequencies microwaves can penetrate through dielectric materials such as walls to assess spaces hidden to visible or ir frequencies and can still provide spatial resolution on the mm- to cm-scale whilst promising microwave thermometry for applications in the built-environment is at a much earlier stage of development than ir cameras and requires further development with single-channel sensors of moderate sensitivity and spatial resolution reported 76 77 water in all its forms humidity moisture condensation etc and its distributions are often key variables for the health of a buildings occupants 7880 microwave radiometers are used in the large scale environment for remote measurement of atmospheric humidity water vapor can be identified from its distinct absorption peak at a frequency of 22235 ghz in its microwave spectrum 81 and multi-frequency measurements can be used to detect liquid water eg suspended microdrops however atmospheric measurements integrate over 100 s to 1000s of meters of air and the research has not been done to determine if indoor microwave radiometry integrating over much smaller volumes would provide a sufficient signal for practical humidity measurements it may be more immediately practical to look for water in materials such as walls with water leakage which can both drive local humidity and host infectious agents themselves wet material can be indirectly detected with ir imaging through the resulting change in surface temperature 75 direct remote sensing techniques for indoor water are less advanced and would require research and development effort to become practical microwave-based sensing is again promising due to its through-wall imaging capability and ability to provide sufficient spatial resolution 82 unlike radiation of longer wavelengths microwave sensors for water can be based on the scattering of microwaves generated by an external source as discussed in this issue 83 with holographic techniques able to provide 3d reconstructions of scattering objects 84 85 in the short to medium term single-channel point-sensors could be developed with imaging performed by scanning the sensor as a long-term aspiration one could envisage a camera providing images of 3d moisture levels in real time similar to temperature imaging with ir cameras schlieren and shadowgraph optics allow 3d imaging of air movements at distance 86 it remains to be seen if these andor other methods can be developed to noninvasively monitor the full range of airflows relevant to building occupants a strength of microwaves are their ability to penetrate many building materials even though they are strongly absorbed by water and reflected by metals infrared has the advantage of better specific spectra for many materials of interest real time carbon dioxide co2 imaging in the built environment seems a reasonable approach to become both practical and informative the atmospheric concentration of co2 is about 400 ppm ppm 004 and increasing at an annual rate of approximately 2-4 ppm per year 87 directly exhaled human breath is between 4 and 5 co2 approximately 100 fold more than the atmosphere increased ambient co2 correlates well with subjective reports of stuffy air 88 and local areas of increased concentration correlate well with increased airborne concentrations of mycobacterium tuberculosis 89 co2 quantification is carried out with compact devices that measure concentration via specific ir spectral absorption wavelength-specific ir is used for earth 90 and extraterrestrial 91 quantification of atmospheric co2 to our knowledge ir imaging of co2 has not yet been used in the built environment if there is clear motivation to do it then it can be done real time ir imaging of co2 might for example be used to direct a small fan into regions of high co2 thereby dispelling patches of stagnant air in an energy efficient manner the global health world is waking up to the challenges posed by respiratory infectious diseases outbreaks with lessons being learned from high profile outbreaks covering coronaviruses such as sars and mers and the bird flu and swine flu events from 2005 and 2009 92 the ebola outbreak in west africa across 2014 and 2015 although not primarily driven by respiratory transmission has also triggered international and national level plans for dealing with communicable disease 93 powerful global health actors that for example include the world health organization 94 wellcome trust 95 world bank 96 and the bill  melinda gates foundation 97 have now developed action plans protocols policy documents and research programs that address some current needs and tentatively cover emerging and future priorities however we feel there is much they could still do in leading a conversation about the future of public health and how interventions and technology can drive both subtle and radical transformations in this particular landscape infections usually disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations such as children with severe malnutrition in resource-poor settings an arguably lower-profile aspect of the 2030 sustainable development goals within the no one left behind mantra is the concept of healthy ageing 98 with an increasingly ageing global population we hypothesize that managing newly-geriatric populations in low- and middle-income settings will result in requirements for entire new medical and public health specialties in countries where currently few people live in to their 70s or older an increasing number of older people presenting with numerous morbidities such as cardiovascular musculoskeletal complications and dementia will therefore not be able to be cared for in a family home and local equivalents of care homes will be set up the elderly institutionalized remain vulnerable to infection this will result in development of clinical practice and ethical and legal frameworks for patient management and research in vulnerable populations and these may best adopted from existing frameworks such as the mental capacity act in the uk and adapted to suit local needs and cultures 99 100 future public health preventive measures include more efficiently- targeted approaches to vaccination the concept of transmissible vaccines is being widely considered and initial theoretical research has suggested that even weakly transmissible vaccines could provide significant benefit in reductions of disease burden 101 102 the additional benefit of improved vaccination programs would be to slow the development of antimicrobial resistance 103 104 however the potential negative consequences on vulnerable immunocompromised individuals must be clearly considered public discussion concerning new vaccine programs has sometimes been politically charged 105 public health with reference to microbiology utilizes several streams of data all of which are subject to improvements whose combined information have the potential to be synergistic 1 identification and quantification of microbes their locals of growth metabolism evolution carriers and 2 mapping the physical parameters that contribute to microbial survival and dissemination 3 patient and epidemiological reporting 4 correlation indicators such as google searches new technologies will increase the temporal and spatial resolution of data collection and move closer to real time apprehension of the microbial environment higher resolution information will inspire architectural and social designs that aim to diminish detrimental human-pathogen encounters while enhancing those that may be beneficial personal and precision public health have the potential to greatly reduce the spread of infections and the burden of antibiotic resistance both directly by spotting antibiotic resistance genes earlier and indirectly by decreasing the overall rate of primary infection the displacement of antibiotic tolerant c difficile with microbiomes introduced via fecal transplants are already a clinical application of introducing health-promoting microbiomes 106 it remains to be seen if this is an isolated and specialized application or more hopefully a harbinger of a broader future the realization of precision public health will require new interdisciplinary collaborations inclusive of sensor engineers microbiologists both medical and environmental building engineers architects and bioethicists focused multi-disciplinary training programs in high-income settings can lead the way for significant knowledge and skill transfer into low- and middle-income settings fine grained spatial and temporal mapping of physical and biological parameters along with reduced lag between data gathering and interpretation will progress toward real time analysis transformative benefits in personal care via personal and precision medicine are widely touted 107 but we assert that personal and precision public health offer opportunities for impact at greater scale ethical issues that encompass work civil and human rights need to be considered right from the very start of planning around precision public health the public must have a say in these future public health initiatives retrospective public and community engagement can lead significant and harmful loss of trust in public health as demonstrated in the uk with the failed implementation of the caredata digital health program 108 and in denmark where unwarranted anti-vaccine messages about the hpv vaccine overwhelmed a limited health promotion campaign 109 in the event of infection with highly-infectious or serious pathogens people- no one can say yet how many- may be excluded from their chosen work travel or even confined against their will based only on their predicted and unintended likelihood of spreading disease it would be a new kind of sequence-based discrimination and the incriminating sequences would not even be their own on the other hand with appropriate intervention that may include confinement the spread of contagion might be greatly diminished in many circumstances with work and health of the entire group- especially the most immunologically vulnerable- greatly enhanced who could argue against increasing the safety of hospital workers and patients who could argue against greater microbiological safety and health for the crew of long term space flights who live at close quarters for months at a time 110 if there were clear evidence for wider public health benefit how could we not do this even in typhoid marys day early 1900s see table 1 asymptomatic carriers of the typhoid bacillus could be identified through individual stool samples present and foreseeable technologies make us all candidates for routine high resolution screening future approaches to sampling in precision public health will ideally be unobtrusive but consequences ie how the information is used are part and parcel of generalized changes to the practical as well as philosophical aspects of privacy individual rights and free will 111 that merit as much forethought with all the relevant stakeholders as the technology  significance of super spreader events in

sars emerged in guangdong province in southern china how and when did it emerge did the causative agent evolve in an animal species and jump to humans or perhaps first to other animal species or did the virus evolve within humans the genetic sequence of the virus has been obtained in several laboratories and phylogenetic analyses have shown that it is unlike other coronaviruses of animal and human origin indeed the virus has been tentatively placed in a new fourth genetic group 23 why is it so important to answer the question of how sars emerged most recently recognized novel emergent viruses have been zoonotic usually with a reservoir in wildlife 45 thus sars coronavirus if zoonotic may provide the basis for modeling and predicting the appearance of other potential zoonotic human pathogens more importantly the information may be crucial for control of sars if this disease is to be curtailed or eliminated by strict public health measures blocking further animal-to-human transmission will be critical only about half of the cases in guangdong are attributed to contact with a sars patient transmission from an unknown but persisting animal reservoir might explain this finding however a nonspecific case definition ie many cases might not actually be sars and limitations in contact-tracing capacity are other potential explanations finding a potential animal source is however a daunting task the province is famous for its wet markets where a bewildering variety of live fauna are offered for sale sometimes illegally for their medicinal properties or culinary potential the opportunity for contact not only with farmed animals but also with a variety of otherwise rare or uncommon wild animals is enormous more than one third of early cases with dates of onset

hypothesis-generating epidemiologic studies should be carried out immediately in china focusing on early cases of sars and cases in persons without known contact with infected persons these studies should also collect information from appropriately selected controls ie matched by categories such as community and age regarding exposures to animals of any kind in any setting including food preparation dietary habits pets and a variety of other activities and behaviors in the community plausible hypotheses generated by epidemiologic studies should be briskly followed by intensive focused laboratory studies where relevant including surveys of specific animal populations to identify sars-associated coronaviruses by culture and polymerase chain reaction pcr or to measure specific antibodies some virologic surveys have already been conducted among prevalent animal populations including those known to harbor other coronaviruses or other viruses transmissible to humans or wild animals handled and sold in the markets a variety of animals have been reported to harbor sars-associated coronavirus however whether these animals are transmitting virus or are recipients of virus transmission is not yet clear solutions will lie with identifying epidemiologic links which should guide targeted animal studies molecular epidemiologic and genetic studies can then be helpful in evaluating viruses isolated from animals and from humans since the earliest known cases were in guangdong province china has had more time than any other location to observe disease incidence over time evidence from guangdong provincial centers for disease control suggests that the disease incidence peaked in mid-february and declined weekly through may what were the reasons for the decline introduction of stringent infection-control measures in hospital settings undoubtedly resulted in reduced incidence in healthcare settings but would not likely have accounted for reductions in community transmission efforts have been made to reduce the interval between onset of illness and hospitalization minimizing the potential for community transmission this effort likely had substantial impact in reducing disease incidence as shown elsewhere 6 the initial hypothesis was that the virus attenuated after multiple generations of transmission this hypothesis now seems unlikely we note several other considerations were there a limited number of susceptible people within the population to begin with such a concept is possible if there had been earlier spread of a less virulent coronavirus providing some immunity to a proportion of the population if so whether this occurrence was unique to guangdong will be important to determine alternatively did the population develop widespread immunity to the causative agent itself this scenario would require a good deal of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic disease at this stage no reason exists to exclude the possibility of a much wider spectrum of disease than is currently appreciated since the spectrum of illness has not been fully evaluated another possibility is that a second agent might be required in addition to coronavirus to produce severe illness if this is the case the epidemiology like seasonality of the second agent perhaps a less recently emerged pathogen for which there is already fairly widespread immunity rather than coronavirus may actually be responsible for the decline of the incidence of sars in guangdong extensive seroprevalence studies will be helpful for sorting through these possibilities analyzing stored serum samples collected before the onset of this outbreak could be of immense value in evaluating the possibility of preexisting immunity some researchers have found human metapneumoviruses 7 and species of chlamydia in patients with sars but the importance of these findings is unclear systematic evaluation of specimens available from all cases severe cases and healthy controls in china regarding the presence of antibodies to coronavirus as well as hypothesized co-infecting agents should be done important clues may come from seroprevalence and other epidemiologic studies in children as in other affected countries children were disproportionately less affected by sars than adults carefully working through the bases for reduced incidence and severity may uncover cross-protecting infectious or immunizing agents or crucial host factors for protection when documenting the source of person-to-person transmission of sars has been possible a substantial proportion of cases have emanated from single persons so-called super-spreaders l while contact tracing is undoubtedly incomplete most infected patients have transmitted illness to few other people understanding the differentiating characteristics of persons who transmit especially patients who are able to transmit to several other people often after minimal contact may provide important clues for public health strategies focused on preventing transmission in addition better defining environmental settings or circumstances that facilitate high transmission rates would be helpful china is not unique in documenting super-spreaders the country could participate in multinational studies to define the characteristics of super-spreaders and their role in the epidemiology of sars of particular interest is the virus load of super-spreaders compared with those of other infected persons little is known about the importance of fecal-oral transmission or about the length of time that virus shedding occurs in the gastrointestinal tract virus shedding in feces has major implications for control strategies and for the possibility of continued carriage and shedding by clinically recovered patients china has the opportunity to explore the role of fecal spread in the transmission of sars the causative agent is a coronavirus 810 and the entire genome of several strains has been fully sequenced by many laboratories globally 2311 tests have been developed to detect coronavirus genetic sequences by pcr in addition tests to detect sars-associated coronavirus antibodies have been developed but the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are low especially early in the illness when public health and clinical needs are greatest a good test for sars would be important not only for diagnosis and management but also for investigating the origin of the disease and for defining its epidemiology if the causative agent can be isolated from stored specimens from the earliest group of patients from november 2002 to january 2003 how their genetic sequences compare with those from viruses isolated later from various parts of china and elsewhere and from animals from guangdong and guanxi provinces would be useful to know mutations may be important for a number of reasons they may affect transmissibility and virulence they may provide or frustrate therapeutic targets for new drugs and they may pose challenges for development of diagnostic tests and vaccines specimens from chinese patients provide the longest observation window with which mutational tendencies can be evaluated an analysis of 14 full-length sequences suggests that two genetic lineages might have arisen from guangdong one lineage is represented by the chain of transmission associated with the physician from guangzhou who traveled to hong kong special administrative region in february the other lineage is associated with isolates from hong kong guangzhou and beijing 11 if two genetic lineages arose in guangdong were there two separate transmission events from an animal host to humans or did the lineage diverge within humans specimens from early cases in guangdong may be helpful in addressing this question epidemiologic immunologic and microbiologic factors associated with severe outcome are not fully defined clearly though a principal determinant for poor outcome is advancing age as with other respiratory diseases age-related coexisting conditions reduce the capacity to compensate to conditions associated with severe disease understanding other specific factors that result in poor outcome will have value for optimizing therapeutic approaches experienced clinicians disagree about the value of early treatment with ribavirin and high-dose corticosteroids and some are reticent to ventilate patients because of high risk for transmission to healthcare workers associated with intubation more data are needed to help define the most effective treatment strategy particularly for areas with limited resources extraordinary clinical expertise exists among health professionals in guangdong province they have substantial experience with a variety of antivirals antibiotics alternative herbal medicines and corticosteroids and with using assisted ventilation in the treatment of patients with sars 12 while randomized clinical trials have not been conducted careful compilations of existing case series data would be helpful in evaluating the potential effectiveness of various management regimens the store of clinical data accumulated from treating hundreds of sars cases needs to be put to good use one priority is to investigate clinical epidemiologic and laboratory predictors of poor outcome such experience will supplement other recently published data from hong kong special administrative region 11315 and singapore 16 several questions remain unanswered do patients exposed to high viral doses for which a short incubation period may be a surrogate or to a co-infecting pathogen have poorer outcomes what is the impact of multiple exposures to sars-associated coronavirus like that which occurred among healthcare workers early in the epidemic do patients infected early in the transmission cycle perform more poorly than those infected during subsequent cycles of transmission seldom have intersections between politics economic development and public health been more graphically demonstrated while awaiting the development of effective prophylactic and therapeutic options many countries have had to muster substantial political will for quick and transparent steps to declare the presence of a lethal pathogen within their borders conduct surveillance and report the results use contact tracing quarantine and border control measures when needed and apply stringent infection control measures in healthcare settings providing the general public with timely and candid information about the magnitude of the problem the known risks and how persons can protect themselves has also been necessary these actions were necessary even when they appeared contrary to economic interests in the short run as has been shown in china delaying implementation can result in disastrous public health consequences extending beyond its borders in addition to damage to the economy and national image the work outlined here involves descriptive and epidemiologic inquiry fundamental to establishing an understanding of this new pathogen and disease while refined and esoteric research will likely also be conducted support must first be established for systematically addressing these basic questions and rapidly disseminating results through publication in international journals presentations at international meetings and in public communications in china in contrast with many other settings globally scientific inquiry and dissemination of results to the international community are subject to institutional interference the sars pandemic has shown that virulent pathogens are beholden to no political philosophy or edict only careful and rapid application of knowledge and reason through a variety of public health measures has been effective in minimizing the spread and severity of the sars epidemic more information and data generated from studies of the epidemic in china are needed immediately to save lives and to prevent fear and disease both in china itself and elsewhere in the world sars became a public health emergency for china where investment in health services has been given low priority for many years maintaining control in a country so large and diverse will be a major challenge for the months and perhaps years to come each of chinas mainland provinces including municipalities with equivalent status autonomous regions and special administrative regions is like a country within a country many are larger than most countries in europe some such as shanghai are wealthy and highly developed while others such as guangxi bordering guangdong and vietnam are poor and typical of developing countries given the potential for reemergence of sars in the future if sustained control measures are not in place in china the possibility of controlling the global threat posed by the disease until new technology ie an effective vaccine is available may be slight key strategies include effective disease surveillance and reporting with early detection and isolation hospital infection control during triage and treatment of cases and transparent open public communication about risk and disease magnitude china has recently begun to vigorously address the need for better surveillance accurate reporting and forthright public communication substantial epidemiologic clinical virologic and immunologic expertise and interest are available within china to address the fundamental questions international expertise is also available to provide guidance feedback and assistance when requested identifying the modest resources needed to implement the work should not be a barrier support from the government will be needed to carry out valid transparent studies and for permission to report the findings regardless of the conclusions sars provides a jarring reminder of the preparedness that is needed to respond to emerging and existing disease threats it highlights the need to reinvest in health in china and strengthen public health programs including surveillance systems and response capacity while disease incidence has abated in china and in other locations globally the disease may still represent an important threat in the future many of the solutions to solve the multifaceted puzzle of sars and to prevent future epidemics must come from china without solutions from that country the degree of difficulty for sustained control of the problem globally is raised still higher  the clinical and virological features of the first imported case causing mers-cov outbreak in south korea 2015 ji lee yeon you-jin kim eun chung hee dae-won kim ina jeong yeonjae kim mi-ran yun sung kim soon gayeon kim joon-sung joh   the largest outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov outside the middle east occurred in south korea in may 2015 the first confirmed case of a patient who recently visited endemic areas over the following 2 months 186 cases were confirmed including 36 deaths 1 of 24 imported cases of mers in countries outside the middle east only 4 cases involved at least one secondary transmission event and 4 transmitted cases excluding south korea 2 3 it is important to evaluate the cause of this significant outbreak in south korea and whether the clinical features of the first patient were different from those in patients in other countries the national medical center nmc seoul korea was designated as the primary mers response center mers countermeasure headquarters and treated patients with mers including the first patient we report the clinical course and laboratory findings of the first case of mers-cov in south korea to understand the unexpected spread of the outbreak unlike previous papers focused on epidemiology 4 we focused on detailed clinical progress and genetic analysis that have not been previously published history of potential exposure to mers-cov was elicited by direct interview with the patient and hisher family members clinical and laboratory findings were obtained from the medical records rna samples extracted from a sputum sample from the index patient on day 11 may 22 2015 were reverse transcribed to cdna followed by pcr with mers-cov-specific primer pairs with overlaps amplicons were pooled for library preparation and next generation sequencing was performed using the miseq sequencing system the genomic sequences of the virus were assembled using clc genomic workbench 801 and the obtained 29995-bp whole genome sequence was registered in genbank as mers-covkorknih001052015 accession no kt326819 all previously published 93 mers-cov complete genome sequences and the korean index case were aligned using muscle v3831 phylogenetic analyses were performed using raxml v8121 1000 bootstrap replicates with the gtr model of nucleotide substitution and -distributed rates among sites from the phylogenetic tree 8 representative sequences including each lineage and year were selected for further analysis the amino acid sequence identity of 10 open reading frames orf between index sequence and 8 reference sequences of mers-cov was determined using blast each 10 orf sequence was aligned using the muscle program and all amino acid changes for each orf sequences were analyzed a root-to-tip regression analysis was performed with path-o-gen software to investigate the temporal signal in the data httptreebioedacuksoftwarepathogen phylogeny without a molecular clock was inferred from the maximum likelihood method implemented in raxml and

 in phylogenetic analysis the korean strain was clustered in the lineage 5 of locally spreading 2015 riyadh strains but distinguished from riyadh with a bootstrap value of 99 fig 4 this result could be owing to the fact that the 2015 riyadh strains including riyadhkkuh078020150225 were the closest relatives and may be the origin of the korean strains
 to identify the genetic features separated from the 2015 riyadh strains we analyzed amino acid changes between the korean index genome and 8 isolates in representative lineage we found 104 amino acid alteration sites compared to the emc2012 strain the korean index case showed 42 amino acid differences whereas the closest riyadhkkuh078020150225 strain showed 13 amino acid inconsistencies fig 5 when we examined the 93 reference whole genomes we found previously unreported amino acid changing alteration sites in the orf1ab d977g g6896s and the receptor-binding domain rbd of s gene i529t in addition to these nonsynonymous alterations 8 unique synonymous alteration sites were identified in the orf1ab t7154 c9956t c10994t t11927c c18790a s t24632c c24722t and orf3 c25714t gene
 we showed that genomic change occurs in the mers-cov korean strains we further examined whether these evolution rates exhibit spatial and temporal patterns during outbreaks we plotted root-to-tip distances of the isolates against geographic location and isolation time fig 6 the root-to-tip method measures rates over the entire history of a lineage and is suitable for comparing evolution rates to long-term sequence traits we observed a strong and statistically significant phylogeographic correlation between mutation rate and isolation date recognizing the tendency that the root-to-tip distances through time were increased for example the isolates in the 20132014 year of mers-cov displaying shorter root-to-tip distances were in closer proximity to emc2012 than the 2015 korean and thailand isolates the regression line showing this tendency was marked as a dotted line and the previously reported sequences were closely fitted to line r2  086 the y values of the 2015 korean strains and closest riyadh strains of ksa were slightly higher than the regression line meaning that these strains had changed faster than the average strains however the distances from the regression line were on the range of other past mers-cov strains this suggested that the rate of evolution or adaptation of the korean strains to the host were not the considerably different and mers-cov had undergone gradual change the korean mers-covs showed some genetic differences compared to previous strains to explain the meaning of each nucleotide change and the influence on viral transmissibility or disease severity further studies are required
 like previous mers outbreaks the mers-cov infection in korea was hospital acquired transmission however the overwhelming extent arouse suspicion that there might be a distant feature at the molecular genetical clinical and epidemiological level it is postulated that the first case in south korea transmitted mers-cov to 28 secondary cases 48 there have been no reports of such a significant outbreak in countries outside the middle east experiencing importation of mers-cov 3 in the 2013 outbreak in saudi arabia one patient transmitted mers-cov to seven other persons raising concerns about a potential super-spreader 9 in the korean outbreak 5 patients including the first case were reported to be super-spreaders transmitting the virus to 153 out of 186 mers patients 1 what makes certain hosts become super-spreaders remains unclear host pathogen and environmental factors may be implicated in the mers outbreak 10 in the first case prolonged duration of exposure before diagnosis and proper isolation and frequent inter-hospital transfer may have contributed to the super-spreading event higher pathogen shedding may also have contributed to the spread because the patient developed severe pneumonia and the severe cough and high viral load could facilitate infection transmission additionally nosocomial transmission by healthcare workers or environmental factors such as inadequate ventilation could be responsible kim et al reported that the mers-cov was confirmed by rt-pcr of viral cultures of air samples and environmental surface swabs from hospital b suggesting the possibility of contact and airborne transmission 11 in line with previous results mers-cov contamination of environmental surfaces 12 and virus persistence in the air surrounding the infected camels or humans persisted for at least 24 h 12 13 the possibility of increased strain virulence was raised in the korean outbreak however there was no evidence of viral mutation capable of modifying the mode of transmission or virulence until now 1417 firstly the identified korean strains showed no specific evidence of viral adaptation to change infectivity or transmissibility the 2015 riyadh strains which are a recombinant from the emc2012 strain and jeddah-12013 were suggested as the ancestor of korean strains 18 several variation sites particularly in spike proteins have been identified but these variations including i529t firstly found in korean index patient showed that the affinity for the host receptor was reduced resulting in reduced entry efficiency 16 furthermore during infection in patients or in transmission chains no evidence of adaptive changes and of rapid changes in the evolutionary rate was found 15 here the complete genome of the index case was newly reported and analyzed the index patient stated that he had not contacted symptomatic persons camels or bats in the course of his business trip to riyadh on may 1 however a phylogenetic tree strongly suggested that the mers-cov was transmitted from the circulating riyadh strains many patients were infected with mers-cov in hospitals a b and c although no confirmed secondary cases of infection occurred in hospital d while the index patient remained in ed for 2 days for 4 and 5 h respectively before placement into isolation 19 this difference may be explained by various factors such as patient behavior and symptoms or degree of contact exposure many secondary cases occurred in hospital d at a later stage however these resulted from transmission by another patient 19 the patient manifested the most prevalent mers symptoms fever 98 chills 87 and cough 7283 but no gastrointestinal tract symptoms generally observed in over 20 of mers patients laboratory data were comparable to those of other mers patients including lymphopenia elevated liver enzymes and inflammatory markers transient progression of thrombocytopenia from d12 appeared to be caused by interferon and ribavirin 20 21 pneumonia progressed rapidly and ventilator support was required studies have shown that the clinical features of mers are similar to those of sars however mers progresses to respiratory failure much more rapidly specifically the fatality rate of mers is much higher and is likely to be associated with older age and comorbidities 22 in the absence of approved specific therapy clinical management of mers largely depends on supportive care and prevention of complications our patient also received supportive care such as o2 therapy mechanical ventilation inotropic support and antimicrobial therapy although there is no proven effective antiviral therapy against mers-cov in vitro data suggest that combined use of interferon and ribavirin reduces disease severity in a rhesus macaque model of mers 23 in a retrospective study of 20 patients with mers ribavirin and interferon-2a improved 14-day and 28-day survival by 70 and 28 respectively compared to an untreated group 24 however another study found that there were no survivors among 5 patients with mers receiving a combination therapy of interferon-2b and ribavirin the median time from admission to therapy for these patients was 19 range 1022 days suggesting that late administration of antiviral therapy may have contributed to the poor outcome 25 therefore timing antiviral therapy may be critical in our patient antiviral therapy was initiated on admission duration of treatment of the index case was more prolonged because of the development of secondary bacterial pneumonia multidrug-resistant pathogens such as multidrug-resistant a baumannii were persistently isolated from d27 previous studies have also reported nosocomial bacterial infections in patients with mers receiving invasive mechanical ventilation including infection with klebsiella pneumoniae staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter species 2628 high prevalence rates reaching 65 of nosocomial pneumonia during ards have been observed 29 30 it is unclear whether patients with ards are more susceptible to pneumonia or have more risk factors 31 considering the infection risk tracheostomy could not have been performed earlier in our case resulting in prolonged mechanical ventilation despite the severe clinical course our patient made a full recovery follow-up pulmonary function tests normal except for a slightly decreased dlco studies examining lung function outcome and longer-term consequences and sequels of mers survivors have not been reported until recently therefore further follow-up is needed in summary the first case of mers-cov infection had high transmissibility and a severe clinical course although the patient made a successful recovery specialized intensive care may be critical in the treatment of mers because patients often progress to ards requiring ventilatory support unlike mers cases imported from other countries our first case became a super-spreader because of the social practices in korea rather than variations of the virus the korean health care system is vulnerable to hospital-acquired infection and proper infection control measures are needed to prevent mers-cov transmission in the healthcare setting  connecting the dots of covid-19 transmissions in india roshan singh pranav singh kumar  witnessing its first case in late january 2020 india has seen a sharp rise in the number of positive cases of covid-19 34 statesut s of the country have been found to be affected by the pandemic to date we in this work study the progress of covid-19 pandemic in india we aim to create transmission network visualization s of covid-19 in india and perform analysis upon them using the transmission networks obtained we attempt to find the possible super spreader individual s and super spreader events sse responsible for the outbreak in their respective regions we discuss the potentials of network analysis in mitigating the further spread of the disease this is one of the initial studies of the outbreak in india and the first attempt to study the pandemic in the country from a transmission network perspective    the initial cases of covid-19 were reported in wuhan province china in late 2019 covid-19 is a viral disease in humans with the major symptomps of respiratory difficulties dry-cough and high fever originating from china the virus has spread over 210 countries causing 2000065 positive cases of infection and 126754 causalities worldwide as of 512 am gmt of 15th april 2020 1  on 11th february 2020 the world health organisation declared covid-19 as a global pandemic sars-cov-2 2 is the virus responsible for spread of the disease droplet transmission and direct contacts are the most common mode of the sars-cov-2 transmission in humans 3  precautionary measures such as social-distancing self isolation and lockdowns are being looked as the only effective strategy for mitigating the spread of the novel virus as no effective vaccine is available against it yet such measures aims to reduce social encounters or contacts to a minimum level hence decreasing the chances of virus contraction india the second most populous country in the world has seen a sudden rise in the number of covid-19 cases observing its first case on 30th january 2020 in a student returned from wuhan china the country has recorded a total of 9272 active cases and 353 deaths as of 15th april 2020 fig 1   a nation wide lockdown is being observed since 22nd march 2020 the lockdown was initially set for 21 days but was further extended to 3rd may 2020 4  public gathering and movement has been restricted to a minimum the disease has been reported to be in phase 2 local transmission yet with limited or localised community transmissions in some corners of the nation 5  local transmission of the disease occurs when a healthy person gets in contact with an infected ones or contaminated surfaces or surroundings efforts are being made to check the disease in phase 2 itself failing to check the disease in phase 2 will lead to phase 3 of the disease spread also called the community transmission checking spread in stage 3 is much challenging as the disease spreads in the population in ways that it becomes difficult to trace the point of contraction in this phase people having no travel history to outbreak effected countries nor having any direct contact with an infected patient are often diagnosed with the disease community transmission of the disease may have deadly consequences for the nation with a population of 13 billion as shown in fig 2  the developed economies such as the united states spain italy france and the united kingdom are now severely affected by the coronavirus and have experienced higher death rates as illustrated in fig 1  the number of covid-19 cases in india is on a steady rise however it will not stand far behind to the above mentioned countries if prompt and proper case finding contact tracing analysis not carried out although there is still not much evidence of community transmission of coronavirus in india according to the indian council for medical research icmr there is no guarantee that this will not happen community transmission if it begins can significantly affect the social cultural economic and healthcare infrastructure of different states of the country in this paper we study the evolution of covid-19 in india from the initials first we explain how covid-19 entered into india then we explain how and why the cases remained to grow we continue to describe the steps and preventive measures taken to address the pandemic we generate visualize and analyse transmission networks of the pandemic across 6 statesuts at last we discuss the observations and the potentials of applying network analysis in mitigating the further spread of the disease the place where outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was observed for the first time 6  it was provisionally named as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov then renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 7 and now as covid-19 the covid-19 outbreak first emerged at the end of 2019 december 2019 in wuhan city hubei province of china which is known as an epic centre of the covid-19 the first case of covid-19 in india was reported on january 30 2020 in the thrissur district of kerala the patient a 20-year-old female student at wuhan university returned to india from wuhan china for vacation thus the first case reported in india is from the imported transmission category after the test result came positive she was immediately placed in isolation at the general hospital of thrissur district and has now recovered from covid-19 after the first case reported at the end of january only two more cases were detected in kerala at the beginning of february 2020 and no other case was reported in the rest of the month all these three imported cases till february 2020 were medical students who traveled from wuhan china to kerala india as per the report 8 all these three have fully recovered from covid-19 as shown in fig 3  in march 2020 the covid-19 cases escalated in various states and were reported across all over the country by mid-march covid-19 had crossed 100 cases 110 as on march 15 and by the end of the month crossed 1500 marks 1619 as on march 31 most of these cases were of imported transmission category ie linked to a people who had a travel history to affected countries the outbreak of covid-19 in india was observed in april 2020 the confirmed cases reached to 7600 marks on april 10 2020 from 1635 confirmed cases on march 31 2020 in 10 days a total of 5965 more cases were recorded as per the report of icmr on april 10 2020 900 pm 9 the number of individual tested for covid-19 were 147034 and confirmed cases were 6872 as on april 10 2020 covid-19 cases have reached to 354 districts out of 727 districts in india religious gathering imported transmissions and local transmissions due to contact with already infected persons are the leading causes of coronavirus spread in india tablighi jamaat a religious congregation held from march 1-15 in delhis nizamuddin area has emerged as an epicenter for the covid-19 outbreak in india it is one of the main causes of the spread of the coronavirus in different parts of the country nearly 9000 missionaries may have attended the congregation 10 among those 1306 people are foreigners who are tablighi jamaat workers and their families that traveled from 40 foreign countries the rest others are from different states of india 11  tablighi jamaat participants were aggressively pursued following positive test results from six participants who returned from the event to the andaman and nicobar islands the island administration reported to delhi administration that several participants are the likely carriers of the covid-19 disease that they may not be aware of more detail of the incident is available here 12  as of 6 april there were 4067 confirmed covid-19 cases out of which 1445 were linked to tablighi jamaat in 17 indian states and union territories 12  as of april 11 2020 712 cases out of 1069 covid-19 cases confirmed in delhi are linked to this event which accounts for two-thirds of the total confirmed cases in delhi 13  as of april 10 2020 assam has 29 covid-19 positive cases out of which 28 had a travel history to tablighi jamaat in new delhi and one patient has linked to this even has died 14  as of april 10 2020 uttar pradesh has 433 covid-19 positive cases in a bulletin later the state government updated that 245 out of 433 are linked to the tablighi jamaat event as on april 11 2020 tamil nadu has reported 969 covid-19 positive cases most of which are linked to the single source of religious gathering there was another religious gathering on a sikh festival held in anandpur sahib from 10-12 march in punjab a preacher who had returned to punjab from germany via italy carried the covid-19 virus and attended the gathering in anandpur sahib later on 27 covid-19 positive cases were traced back to him 15  the preacher became the first victim of the coronavirus in punjab and fourth in the country there was a report that authorities in punjab have quarantined over 40000 residents in 20 villages in the state to contain the covid-19 spread which may be linked to the same preacher 16  state authorities busted many such religious gatherings in different parts of the country during the lockdown such as in delhi up west bengal assam bihar and many other states being in the initial stages  india had quite a lot of cases in imported case category significant number of nationals abroad such as nris students pilgrims working professionals migrant workers businessmen and others returned to the country during the covid-19 epidemic many of them have returned from certain high-risk countries punjab indias land of nris working overseas alone experienced a massive influx in march 2020 the punjab government rang the alarm on march 23 2020 by announcing the recent return of 94000 of these nris 17  most of them returned from covid-19 hotspots including the uk us spain and italy on march 24 2020 the cm of punjab informed that the state authorities had sent 30000 out of 94000 nris into isolation 18  fig 4 shows the number of international airline travelers by indian state in january 2020 after the initial outbreak due to imported transmissions india badly hit by a lot of local transmissions mainly amongst family members of imported cases and health workers such as doctors and nurses treating the patients and so on tablighi jamaat has been observed as one of the biggest contributors to local transmissions and many components remain to be identified as of april 10 2020 india has 27 imported cases and 73 cases of local transmissions  the sudden brust of outbreaks of the disease across india is mainly contributed by certain events such as congregation of nizamuddin markaz we call such events as super spreader eventssses also there exists a number of individuals who played a key role in transmitting the disease at a large scale these are the people who contracted the covid-19 infection either from an affected country or during a visit to the religious gathering and after heading back to home took part in a meeting workshop party at different locations and came in contact with others during their stay and travel instead of visiting to the hospital for check up and undergoing self-quarantine as shown in fig 5a  a total of 8356 covid-19 positive cases and 273 death cases have been reported as on april 12 2020 as illustrated in fig 5b  by the same time a total of 716 patients recovered for the covid-19 daily trend of these cases are visible in those plots from the curve of positive cases it is visible that the number of cases is increasing day by day which is alarming for a densely populated country in india fig 6b illustrate the date wise test samples and new tests conducted respectively from these figures it is evident that the country is continuously increasing the number of tests per day by upgrading its testing capabilities this is a good sign and one of the best measures to contain the spread of covid-19 in the country  the government of india goi has taken many proactive preventive and mitigating steps since the early beginning with the gradual tightening of international travel the issuance of public advisories the establishment of quarantine facilities contact tracing of people contracted with the virus and various social distancing initiatives government has temporarily suspended all metro rail and domestic air traffic services central and state governents has proactively imposed and extended lockdowns till may 3 2020 goi has urged ngos academic institutions industries psus research institutes and other organizations to manufacture and supply ppes masks testing kits ventilators and other specific equipment for emergency deployment both for patient care and safety of health workers government has also expedite the procurement process of these special equipment government has launched aarogya setu app to connect the health services with its citizen to fight covid-19 all state governments are strictly following the guidelines and working hard for contact tracing extensive testing identification of covid-19 hotspots sanitizing affected zones implementing social distancing norms sealing of districts and state boundaries to contain the spread quarantining patients designating hospitals and isolation wards for covid-19 patients mobilizing acute and icu surge capacity training to ensure availability of sufficient numbers of skilled and supervised health workers daily review of stocks of essential medicines and equipment developing it solutions to connect people for health services and live tracking etc as shown in fig 13  goi swift and strict measures to curb the coronavirus has been reflected in the stringency index on oxford covid-19 government response tracker oxcgrt 20  where country scores 100 as on april 1 2020 the tracker aims to compare the government responses to the coronavirus epidemic worldwide rigorously and consistently the oxcgrt collects information on various common policy responses by the government calculate the scores in terms of stringency of such measures and aggregates them into a common stringency index it collects publicly available information on 13 indicators of government response which includes policies such as closures of the schools workspaces public transports cancellation of public events border closure travel bans and other financial indicators the ministry of home affairs mha goi in its recent lockdown extension order till may 3 2020 has mentioned that following activities will remain prohibited all domestic and international air travel movement by trains with few exceptions for security and other crucial services buses for public transport metro rail services inter-district and inter-state movement except for medical reasons all educational training and coaching institutions all industrial and commercial activities hospitality services except permitted by guidelines of the order taxis and cab services all cinema halls malls shopping complex bars assembly halls and similar such places any gathering such as social political sports entertainment academic cultural religious and others the religious congregations are strictly prohibited and religious places must be closed the mha has issued additional guidelines for hotspots and containment zones transmission networks have been useful for understanding disease outbreaks and pathogen transmissions in a population such networks are widely considered for studying sexually transmitted infectionsstis such as hiv 21  viral diseases like mers 22 and foot-and-mouth disease in livestock transmission network analysis helps to identify potential hotspots super-spreader individuals or events of the disease a study 23 from 1997 finds out that the 20 of individuals in a population are responsible for 80 of the infections in this section we investigate covid-19 transmission in india using the connection structure among them opensource data made publicly available by covid19indiaorg 24 till 1240 am ist of 11th april 2020 was considered for the study data were collected using the provided api and were processed to derive the relational information transmission networks for each of the 6 statesut taken for the study were generated the symbolic notations followed in our transmission networks are defined in fig 9 we use the notation of c1 c2 so on to refer to different group of nodes or components in the network wherever required we analyze the derived covid-19 transmission networks in india based upon two centrality measures 1 degree centrality -in an undirected network a nodes degree is the number of edges incident on the node degree centrality is used to reveal the most prominent nodes in the network in our context the value for the degree of a node specifies the number of individuals to which one individual of the network is directly associated more an individual having direct relationships with other individuals more are its chances of spreading the disease if she is already infected also the vice versa -more the connections more the chances of acquiring the infection betweeness centrality -is being used to find out the pairs of nodes that can be connected through the shortest path betweeness value of a node specifies the number of nodes in the network that require a node as a junction to reach the other nodes in our context this is the number of infections that would have not happened if an infected individual was not there in the pathway to the newly infected ones in the network note all the nodes present in both types of centrality networks for each stateut in our study are homogeneous representing the patients along with their numerical ids to refer  bihar is the third populous indian state in the eastern part of the country the first case of covid-19 was detected on the 22nd of march 2020 in munger district of the state the patient was 38 years male who did return from qatar later he succumbed to death while undergoing treatment at all india institute of medical sciencesaiims patna however the epicenter of the outbreak in the state turned out to be in siwan district a person having recent travel history to oman did infect a total of 21 others a majority of infected being his family members like siwan many other districts in the state facing the crisis has the roots of someone having travel history to covid-19 affected foreign nations table 1 provides the details of the imported cases district wise for bihar the covid-19 transmission network in the state is shown in fig 10a fig 10b and fig 10c show the degree centrality and betweeness centrality network of covid-19 in bihar there were a total of 60 nodes with 23 connections in the centrality networks 417 of the nodes in the network were having connections to some other nodes in the network 513 of the nodes remained isolated the node with id 5937 can be seen to be highly central in both the networks this is the same person responsible for the outbreak in siwan  assam is one of the 8 north-eastern states of india and plays a crucial role in the economics of the other 7 states a total of 12 districts have been affected by the pandemic out of which cases from 11 districts has direct association with the sse nizamuddin markaz congregation the transmission network for the state can be seen in fig 11a  fig 11b describes the normalized centrality network of covid-19 in assam followed by the betweeness centrality network shown in fig 11c all the nodes in the network are having uniform centrality values for both the measures as no interconnection among them exists punjab witnessed its first case of covid-19 on 9th march 2020 the patient was a 48 years old male from amritsar having recent travel history to italy till the 11th of april 2020 a total of 17 districts were found to be affected in the state however out of 151 cases in the state 11 had direct associations with the ssenizamuddin markaz congregation table 2 provides the details of the imported cases district wise for the state a total of 5 major components can be observed in the transmission network diagram of the state a majority of the cases from shahid bhagat singh nagar in c2 of fig 12a is because of the local transmission from one of the foreign cases the second case of local transmission was observed in sas nagar where 7 persons working in the same bakery tested positive for covid-19 they are suspected to have acquired the virus from the owner of the bakery who did earlier tested positive for the virus fig 12b and fig 12c shows the degree and betweeness centrality network of punjab there were a total of 154 nodes with 43 connections in both the centrality networks 344 of the nodes in the network were having connections to some other nodes in the network 656 of the nodes remained isolated with no connection to others node 182 is found to be the most central nodes in both the networks 182 is responsible for the local transmission in c2 fig 13a  an imported case from italy did infect its relatives and friends and they in turn infected their friends fig 13b shows the degree centrality network whereas fig 13c shows the betweeness centrality in the state there were a total of 364 nodes with 57 connections in the centrality networks 153 of the nodes in the network were having connections to some other nodes in the network 847 of the nodes remained isolated nodes in the c6 can be seen to have dominated in terms of betweeness centrality details of imported cases in the state can be obtained from table 3   the transmission network of the disease is shown in fig 14a fig 14b and fig 14c depict the centrality networks for chandigarh node 172 is the most central in both the networks followed by 878 there were a total of 19 nodes with 9 connections in the centrality networks 631 of the nodes in the network were having connections to some other nodes in the network 369 of the nodes were isolated however node 225 is having significant value for betweeness centrality table 4 provides the statistics of the imported cases in the union territory canadadubaiuk karnataka recorded its first case on 9th march 2020 in a 42 years male employee who had a recent travel history to london since then the cases have spread to 17 districts a large number of local transmission of the virus was done by a person from mysuru who doesnt have any history of foreign visits in recent past but was in contact with the healthcare professionals the patient 689 in the network infected a total of 14 others fig 15a depicts the transmission network of the disease in the state whereas fig 15b and fig 15c depicts the respective centrality networks there were a total of 215 nodes with 43 connections in the centrality networks 344 of the nodes in the network were having connections to some other nodes in the network 656 of the nodes were isolated table 5 provides the details of the imported cases district wise for the state karnataka in this study we investigated the spread of the covid-19 pandemic in india and the countermeasures taken to control the spread to date transmission networks were used to understand the disease spread in the country a total of 6 indian statesuts were considered for the study two network centrality measures namely the degree centrality and the betweeness centrality were used to analyze the connections among the patients of covid-19 in each state we found nizamuddin markaz congregation to be a sse which significantly increased the number of cases in the country particularly the state of assam has all its cases directly or indirectly associated with the sse also we identified super spreader individuals throughout the states using the centrality measures such as oman returnee of siwanbihar infecting 21 others london returnee of mysurukarnataka the case of pathanamthittakerala people returning from italy family and friends component infections display higher inter-connectivity than other scenarios of disease transmission as seen in c6 of fig 13a  with the betweeness centrality we find while a patientindividual is directly associated with others it is not always the pathway to further infections in the network the node 172 in fig 14c exhibits much higher betweeness centrality in comparison to others in the network as it acts as the only pathway from node 225 to 226224 and 335 although 172 itself was an infected node with imported infection and did infected others with its direct associations however the scenario would have been different if any other node say 224 is infected thus in this setting the infection would have passed to others via 172 therefore finding such middle nodes or the individuals will help to eliminate further infections however such an objective will require the contact information of each patient available a network of contacts can be generated based upon the patient history and can be used in conjunction with the transmission network for mitigating large outbreaks in the region a limitation in this study lies in the data accuracy and completeness of the information the data source is based on data made available from both the official such as news bulletins released by the government both central and states as well as crowd-sourced from a group of volunteers the crowd-sourced data comes from sources such as twitter handles of health ministryboth central and states information released by these sources is much limited in detail this is one of the reasons of a significant number of isolated nodes present in our networks besides the limitation in the information the publically available data source used in the work is much acknowledged the results are meaningful and allow to map the spread of the disease across the districts of the indian states much detailed information about the patients is required to answer some of the crucial questions of the hour 1 is community transmission happening in india  2 who are the highly vulnerable individuals to be infected  3 which contacts of the infected persons should be prioritized in monitoring and treatment to stop the further spread   reconstruction of transmission pairs for novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in mainland china estimation of super-spreading events serial interval and hazard of infection background knowledge on the epidemiological features and transmission patterns of covid-19 is accumulating detailed line-list data with household settings can advance the understanding of covid-19 transmission dynamics methods a unique database with detailed demographic characteristics travel history social relationships and epidemiological timelines for 1407 transmission pairs that formed 643 transmission clusters in mainland china was reconstructed from 9120 covid-19 confirmed cases reported during january 15 - february 29 2020 statistical model fittings were used to identify the super-spreaders and estimate serial interval distributions age and gender-stratified hazard of infection were estimated for household versus non-household transmissions results there were 34 primary cases identified as super-spreaders with 5 super-spreading events occurred within households mean and standard deviation of serial intervals were estimated as 50 95 cri 44 55 and 52 95 cri 49 57 days for household transmissions and 52 95 cri 46 58 and 53 95 cri 49 57 days for non-household transmissions respectively hazard of being infected outside of households is higher for age between 18 and 64 years whereas hazard of being infected within households is higher for young and old people conclusions non-negligible frequency of super-spreading events short serial intervals and a higher risk of being infected outside of households for male people of working age indicate a significant barrier to the identification and management of covid-19 cases which requires enhanced non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate this pandemic xu xiao-ke  liu

propagation model f martnez-lvarez g asencio-corts j torres f d gutirrez-avils l melgar-garca r prez-chacn c rubio-escudero j riquelme c a troncoso  a novel bioinspired metaheuristic is proposed in this work simulating how the coronavirus spreads and infects healthy people from an initial individual the patient zero the coronavirus infects new patients at known rates creating new populations of infected people every individual can either die or infect and afterwards be sent to the recovered population relevant terms such as re-infection probability super-spreading rate or traveling rate are introduced in the model in order to simulate as accurately as possible the coronavirus activity the coronavirus optimization algorithm has two major advantages compared to other similar strategies first the input parameters are already set according to the disease statistics  corresponding author fmaralvupoes 1 arxiv200313633v2 csai 16 apr 2020 preventing researchers from initializing them with arbitrary values second the approach has the ability of ending after several iterations without setting this value either infected population initially grows at an exponential rate but after some iterations when considering social isolation measures and the high number recovered and dead people the number of infected people starts decreasing in subsequent iterations furthermore a parallel multi-virus version is proposed in which several coronavirus strains evolve over time and explore wider search space areas in less iterations finally the metaheuristic has been combined with deep learning models in order to find optimal hyperparameters during the training phase as application case the problem of electricity load time series forecasting has been addressed showing quite remarkable performance  the coronavirus covid-19 is a new respiratory virus firstly discovered in humans in december 2019 that has spread worldwide having been reported more than 1 million infected people so far much remains unknown about the virus including how many people may have very mild or asymptomatic infections and whether they can transmit the virus the precise dimensions of the outbreak are hard to know bioinspired models typically mimic behaviors from the nature and are known for their successful application in hybrid approaches to find parameters in machine learning model optimization viruses can infect people and these people can either die infect other people or simply get recovered after the disease vaccines and the immune defense system typically fight the disease and help to mitigate their effects while an individual is still infected this behavior is typically modeled by an sir model consisting of three kind of individuals s for the number of susceptible i for the number of infectious and r for the number of recovered metaheuristics must deal with huge search spaces even infinite for the continuous cases and must find suboptimal solutions in reasonable execution times the rapid prop-agation of the coronavirus along with its ability of infecting most of the countries in the world impressively fast has inspired the novel metaheuristic proposed in this work named coronavirus optimization algorithm cvoa a parallel version is also proposed in order to spread different coronavirus strains and achieve better results in less iterations the main cvoa advantages regarding other similar approaches can be summarized as follows 1 coronavirus statistics are known by the scientific community in this sense the rate of infection the mortality rate or the re-infection probability are already known that is cvoa is parametrized with actual values for rates and probabilities preventing the user to perform an additional study on the most suitable setup configuration 2 cvoa can stop the solutions exploration after several iterations with no need to be configured that is the number of infected people increases during the first iterations however after a certain number of iterations the number of infected people starts decreasing until reaching a void infected set of individuals 3 the coronavirus high spreading rate is useful for exploring promising regions more thoroughly intensification while the use of parallel strains ensures that all regions of the search space are evenly explored diversification 4  another relevant contribution of this work is the proposal of a new codification discrete and of dynamic length specifically designed for combining long short-term memory networks lstm with cvoa or any other metaheuristic as for the limitations of the current approach there is mainly one since there is no vaccine currently it has not been included in the procedure to reduce the number of individuals candidates to be infected this fact involves an exponential increase of the infected population in the first iterations and therefore an exponential increase of the execution time for such iterations this fact however is partially solved with the social isolation measures that simulate individuals that cannot be infected at a particular iteration a study case is included in this work to discuss the cvoa performance cvoa has been used to find the optimal values for the hyperparameters of a lstm architecture 17  which is widely used model for artificial recurrent neural network rnn in the field of deep learning 8  data from the spanish electricity consumption have been used to validate the accuracy the results achieved verge on 045 substantially outperforming other well-established methods such as random forest gradient-boost trees linear regression or deep learning optimized with other metaheuristics the code developed in phyton with a discrete codification is available in the supplementary material along with an academic version in java for a binary codification finally it is acknowledged the need of further study on the performance of wellknown functions 16  however given the relevance of coronavirus is acquiring throughout the world declared as pandemic by the world health organization and the remarkable results achieved when combined with deep learning it was wanted to share this work hoping it inspires future research in this direction the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses related and recent works the methodology proposed is introduced in section 3 section 4 proposes a discrete codification to hybridize deep learning models with cvoa and provides some illustrative cases a preliminary analysis on how populations are created and evolved over time is discussed in section 5 the results achieved are reported and discussed in section 6 finally the conclusions drawn and future work suggestions are included in section 7 there are many bioinspired metaheuristics to solve optimization problems although cvoa has been conceived to optimize any kind of problems this section focuses on optimization algorithms applied to hybridize deep learning models it is hard to find consensus among the researchers on which method should be applied to which problem and for this reason many optimization methods have been proposed during the last decade to improve deep learning models generally the criterion for selecting a method is its associated performance from a wide variety of perspectives low computation cost accuracy or even implementation difficulty can be accepted as one of these criteria the virus optimization algorithm voa was proposed by liang and cuevas-jurez in 2016 18 and later improved in 19  however as many other metaheuristics the results of its application are highly dependent on its initial configuration additionally it simulates generic viruses without adding individualized properties for particular viruses the results achieved indicate that its usefulness is beyond doubt one of the most extended metaheuristics used to improve deep learning parameters is genetic algorithms ga hence a lstm network optimized with ga can be found in 6  to evaluate the proposed hybrid approach the daily korea stock price index data were used outperforming the benchmark model in 2019 a network traffic prediction model based on lstm and ga was proposed in 5  the results were compared to pure lstm and arima reporting higher accuracy multi-agents systems have also been applied to optimize deep learning models the use of particle swarm optimization pso can be found in 20  the authors proposed a model based on kernel principal component analysis and back propagation neural network with pso for midterm power load forecasting the hybridization of deep learning models with pso was also explored in 13 but this time the authors applied the methodology with image classification purposes ants colony optimization aco models have also been used to hybridize deep learning thus desell et al 9 proposed an evolving deep recurrent neural networks using aco applied to the challenging task of predicting general aviation flight data the work in 12 introduced a method based on aco to optimize a lstm recurrent neural networks again the field of application was flight data records obtained from an airline containing flights that suffered from excessive vibration some papers exploring the cuckoo search cs properties have been published recently as well in 23  cs was used to find suitable heuristics for adjusting the hyper-parameters of another lstm network the authors claimed an accuracy superior to 96 for all the datasets examined nawi et al 22 proposed the use of cs to improve the training of rnn in order to achieve fast convergence and high accuracy results obtained outperformed those than other metaheuristics the use of the artificial bee colony abc optimization algorithm applied to lstm can also be found in the literature hence and optimized lstm with abc to forecast the bitcoin price was introduced in 26  the combination of abc and rnn was also proposed in 3 for traffic volume forecasting this time the results were compared to standard backpropagation models from the analysis of these works it can be concluded that there is an increasing interest in using metaheuristics in lstm models however not as many works as for artificial neural networks can be found in the literature and none of them based on a virus propagation model these two facts among others justify the application of cvoa to optimize lstm models this section introduces the cvoa methodology thus section 31 describes the steps for a single strain section 32 introduces the modifications added to use cvoa as a parallel version section 33 suggests how parameters must be set section 34 shows the cvoa pseudo codes and comments them step 1 generation of the initial population the initial population consists of one individual the so-called patient-zero p z as in the coronavirus epidemic it identifies the first human being infected step 2 disease propagation depending on the individual several cases are evaluated 1 some of the infected individuals die they die according to the coronavirus death rate p die such individuals can no longer infect new individuals 2 the individuals surviving the coronavirus will infect new individuals intensification two types of spreading are considered according to a given probability p su p ersp reader  ordinary spreaders infected individuals will infect new ones according to the coronavirus spreading rate sp readin g rat e  super-spreaders infected individuals will infect new ones according to the coronavirus superspreading rate su p ersp readin g rat e 3 there is another consideration since it is needed to ensure diversification both ordinary and super-spreaders individuals can travel and explore solutions quite dissimilar therefore individuals have a probability of traveling p t rav el thus allowing to propagate the disease to solutions that may be quite different t rav eler rat e in case of not being traveler new solutions will change according to an ordin ary rat e note that one individual can be both superspreader and traveler step 3 updating populations three populations are maintained and updated for each generation 1 dead population if any individual dies it is added to this population and can never be used again 2 recovered population after each iteration infected individuals after spreading the coronavirus according to the previous step are sent to the recovered population it is known that there is a reinfection probability hence an individual belonging to this population could be re-infected at any iteration provided that it meets the reinfection criterion p rein f ect ion  another situation must be considered since individuals can be isolated simulating they are implementing the social distancing measures for the sake of simplicity it is considered that an isolated individual is sent to the recovered population as well when meeting an isolation probability p isolat ion  iteration according the procedure described in the previous steps it is possible that repeated new infected individuals are created at each iteration and consequently it is recommended to remove such repeated individuals from this population before the next iteration starts running  it must be noted that it is very simple to use cvoa in a multi-virus version since it can be implemented as a population-based algorithm when considering the pandemic as a set of intelligent agents each of them evolving in parallel in contrast to trajectory-based metaheuristics population-based focuses on the diversification in the search space for this case a new variable must be defined strains which will determine the number of strains that will be launched in parallel each strain could simulate different regions in other words strains can be differently configured so that each of them intensifies with their own rates several considerations must be done for this case 1 every strain is run independently following the steps in the previous section a wise strategy should be followed to generate p zs for each strain for instance it is suggested the generation of orthogonal p zs or with high hamming distances that way a wider search space could be covered enhancing diversification 3 the interaction between the different strains is done by means of dead and recovered populations which must be shared by all the strains operations over these populations must be handled as concurrent updates 11  4  new infected populations on the contrary are different for each strain and no concurrent operations are required 5 this version may help to simulate different rates for different strains that way if there is any initial information about the search space some strains could be more focused on diversification and some others on intensification depending on the hardware resources and how busy they are every strain may evolve at different speeds this situation should not pose any problems since it is known that the pandemic evolves at different rates and starts at different time stamps depending on region of the world last another application can be found for this parallel version cvoa emulates an sir model and consequently any other global pandemic could be modeled by using the known rates of for instance the flu of 1918 or 1957 another coronavirus sars or mers hiv or ebola hypothetically parallel pandemics could be run with different rates since cvoa simulates the coronavirus disease propagation most of the rates propagation re-infection or mortality are already known this fact prevents the research from wasting time in selecting values for such rates and turns the cvoa into metaheuristic quite easy to execute however it must be noted that the current rates are not definitive yet and it is expected they will vary over time as the pandemic evolves maybe these values will not be stable until 2021 or even 2022 the suggested values have been retrieved from the world health organization 1 and are discussed below 1 p die an infected individual can die with a given probability currently this rate is set as almost 5 by the scientific community therefore p die  005 it is the probability that an individual spread the disease to a greater number of healthy individuals it is known that this situation affects to a 10 of the population therefore p su p ersp reader  01 after this condition is validated two situations can be found  ordin ary rat e if the infected individual is not a super-spreader then the infection rate also known as reproductive number r 0  is 25 it is suggested that this rate varies from 0 to 5  su p ersp reader rat e if the infected individual turns out to be super-spreader then heshe infects up to 15 healthy individuals on average it is suggested that this rate varies from 6 to 15 the current reported rate is 14 therefore p rein f ect ion  014 4 p isolat ion  this value is uncertain because countries are taking different measures for social isolation this parameter helps to reduce the exponential growth of the infected population after each iteration therefore a high value must be assigned to this probability it is suggested that p isolat ion  05 any place in the world and can infect healthy individuals it is known that almost a 10 of the population travel during a week simulated time for every iteration so p t rav el  01 6  p an dem ic du rat ion  this parameter simulates the duration of the pandemic since the estimated recovering time is one week each iteration simulates one week currently this data is unknown so this number can be adjusted to the size of the problem it is suggested that p an dem ic du rat ion  30 7  strains this parameter should be adjusted according to the size of the problem and the hardware availability and it is difficult to suggest a value suitable for all situations but a tentative initial value could be five in an attempt to simulate one different strain per continent therefore strains  5 another important decision that must be made is how to initialize every p z associated with the strains when just one strain is considered p z is suggested to be randomly initialized however with strains  1 the user should search for orthogonal p zs and to uniformly distribute them in the search space this strategy should help to cover bigger search spaces in less iterations and to evaluate individuals with maximal distances this section provides the pseudo code of the most relevant functions for the cvoa along with some comments to better understand them this is the main function and its pseudo code can be found in algorithm 1 once the new population is formed qll individuals are evaluated and if any of them

spreading and traveling rates this function also controls that the new infected individuals are not already in the dead list in such case this new infection is ignored or in the recovered list in such case the p rein f ect ion is applied to determine whether the individual is re-infected or if it remains in the recovered list additionally it considers that the new potential infected individual might be isolated which is controlled by p isolat ion  although the use of an extra list could be implemented it has been decided to treat these individuals as recovered therefore if an isolated individual is attempted to be infected it is added to the recovered list the effective generation of the new infected individuals must be carried in the function replicate whose pseudo code is not provided because it depends on the codification and the nature of the problem to be optimized this function must return a set of new infected individuals according to the aforementioned rates specific information on how this codification and replication is done for lstm models the pseudo code for the described procedure can be found in algorithm 3  this is an auxiliary function used to find the best fitness in a list of infected individuals its peudo code is shown in algorithm 5 if fitnessi  bestfitness then 6 bestfitness  fitnessi  the pz as it has been described previously is the individual of the first iteration in the cvoa algorithm following the hybridization proposed a random individual is created considering the codification defined above in first place a random value for the learning rate of the pz is generated specifically a number between 0 and 5 is generated randomly in a uniform distribution such limits are indicated in figure 1  according to the possible encoded values of the learning rate element the same process is carried out to produce a random value for the dropout element in such case a random number between 0 and 8 is generated in second place a random number of layers is generated for the element l of p z such number of layers is a random number between 2 and 11 note that the first layer is reserved for the input layer of the neural network as it has been discussed before in last place for each one of the l layers a random number of units is generated between 0 and 11 covering the possible encoded values for the number of units previously defined see figure 1  the infection procedure described here corresponds to the functionality of replicate introduced in the line 4 of the algorithm 3 this procedure takes an individual as input and returns an infected individual according to the following procedure the first step is to determine the element l of the infected individual that will be mutated the probability of such mutation occurs has been set to 1 3 so that every element has the same probability to mutate if the mutation occurs then the element l of the individual is modified according to the process described in section 44 if the element l the number of layers of the network changes then the elements encoding the different layers within the individual layer 1  layer l must be resized accordingly such resizing process is explained in section 43 the second step is to determine how many elements of the individual will be infected if the t rav eler rat e  0 then the number of infected elements is generated randomly from 0 to the length of the individual excluding the element l else the t rav eler rat e indicates itself the number of infected elements  when an individual is infected at the position of the element l the list of elements that encodes the number of units per layer layer 1  layer l must be resized accordingly in the case that the new number of layers after the infection is lower than its previous value then the last leftover elements are removed for instance if the initial individual is  the process carried out to change the value of a specific element of an individual is described in this section first a signed change amount c  2 1 1 2 is randomly determined using the following criteria a random real number p between 0 and 1 is generated using a uniform distribution if p  025 then the change amount will be c  2 else if p  05 then the change amount will be c  1 else if p  075 then the change amount will be c  1 else the change amount will be c  2 once the amount of change is determined the new value for the infected element is computed if its previous value is v  then the new value after the single position mutation will be v  v  c if the new value v exceeds the limits defined for the individual codification such value is set to the maximum or minimum allowed value accordingly this section provides an overview on how populations evolve over time and how the search space is explored to reach the optimum value for a given fitness function to conduct this experimentation a simple binary codification has been used the fitness function was f x  x  15 2 because to goal of this section is to evaluate the growth of the new infected populations and not to the find challenging optimum values this function reaches the minimum value at x  15 that is f 15  0 for this reason individuals with 10 20 30 40 and 50 bits have been tested tables 1-5 summarize the results achieved for each of these lengths respectively every experiment has been launched 50 times determining that on average the optimum value was found for 11 12 14 15 and 17 iterations respectively each table shows the results of an execution meeting this criterion table 6 summarizes the amount of search space explored on average before finding the optimum value for a small space of 2 10  1024 possible values the optimum one is reached after exploring 156250 valid solutions however this value acutely decreases as  this section reports the results achieved by hybridizing a deep learning model with cvoa gorithm section 62 describes the dataset used section 63 discusses the results achieved and includes some comparative methods the forecasting of future values fascinates the human being to be able to understand how certain variables evolve over time has many benefits in many fields electricity demand forecasting is not an exception since there is a real need for planning the amount to be generated or in some countries to be bought the use of machine learning to forecast such time series has been intensive during the last years 21  but with the development of deep learning models and in particular of lstm much research is being conducted in this application field 2  the time series considered in this study is related to the electricity consumption in spain from january 2007 to june 2016 the same as used in 24  it is a time series composed of 9 years and 6 months with a 10-minute sampling frequency resulting in 497832 measures as in the original paper the prediction horizon is 24 that is this is a multi-step strategy with h  24 the size of samples used for the prediction of these 24 values is 168 furthermore the dataset was split into 70 for the training set and 30 for the test set and in addition a 30 of the training set has also been selected for the validation set in order to find the optimal parameters the training set covers the period from january  this section reports the results obtained by hybridizing lstm with cvoa by means of the codification proposed in section 4 to forecast the spanish electricity dataset described in section 62 linear regression lr decision tree dt gradient-boosted trees gbt and random forest rf models have been used with a parametrization setups according to those studied in 15 14  a deep neural network optimized with a grid search dnn-gs according to 24 has also been applied another deep neural network but optimized with random search dnn-rs and smoothed with a low-pass filter dnn-rs-lp 25  has also been applied furthermore cvoa has been combined with dnn dnn-cvoa using the same codification as in lstm these results along with those of lstm and combinations with gs rs rs-lp and cvoa are summarized in table 7  expressed in terms of the mean absolute percentage error mape it can be observed that lstm-cvoa outperforms all evaluated methods which have showed particularly remarkable performance for this real-world dataset additionally dnn-cvoa outperforms all other dnn configurations which confirms the superiority of cvoa with reference to gs rs and rs-lp another relevant consideration that must be taken into account is that the compared methods generated 24 independent models each of them for every value forming h so it would expected that lstm-cvoa performance increases if independent models are generated for each of the values in h these results have been achieved with the individual 4 0 89 7 2 7 2 7 10 7 which decoded involves the following architecture parameters  learning rate 10e-04  dropout 0  number of layers 8  units per layer 250 200 75 200 75 200 275 200 finally figure 4 depicts the first five predicted days versus their actual values expressed in watts this work has introduced a novel bioinspired metaheuristic based on the coronavirus behavior on the one hand cvoa has two major advantages first its highly relation to the coronavirus spreading model prevents the authors to make any decision about the inputs values second it ends after a certain number of iterations due to the exchange of individuals between healthy and deadrecovered lists additionally a novel discrete additional experimentation must be conducted in order to assess its performance on standard f functions and find out the search space shapes in which it can be more effective some actions must be taken to reduce the size of the infected population after several iterations that grows exponentially in this sense a vaccine must be implemented this case would involve adding to the recovered list at a given v accin e rat e healthy individuals this rate will remain unknown until a vaccine is developed another suggested research line is using dynamic rates for instance the observation of the preliminary effects of the social isolation measures in countries like china italy or spain suggests that the in f ect rat e could be simulated as a poisson process but more time and country recoveries is required to confirm this trend finally for the multi-step forecasting problem analyzed it would be desirable to generate independent models for each of the values that form the prediction horizon h along with this paper an academic version in java for a binary codification is provided with a simple fitness function httpsgithubcomdatalabupocvoaacademic additionally the code in phyton for the deep learning approach is also provided with a more complex codification and the suggested implementation according to the pseudocode provided httpsgithubcomdatalabupocvoalstm  bayesian reconstruction of disease outbreaks by combining epidemiologic and genomic data thibaut jombart anne cori xavier didelot simon cauchemez christophe fraser neil ferguson mark tanaka m   statistical methods for analyzing detailed epidemiological data collected during infectious disease outbreaks have seen rapid development in recent years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 these methods probabilistically reconstruct likely transmission links between cases using data on the timing of symptoms and where available contact tracing data or other proximity information the resulting transmission trees allow estimation of the number of secondary infections generated by each case and thus of the transmission intensity characterized by the reproduction number r over time pathogen genetic sequence data provides valuable additional information on potential transmission links between cases in a disease outbreak particularly when reliable contact tracing data is not available indeed using sequence data alone to estimate transmission rates during epidemics is increasingly frequent 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 as genetic sequences can now be obtained nearly in real-time 19 20 this new source of information opens up exciting perspectives not only for understanding past outbreaks but also for unraveling the transmission routes of ongoing outbreaks and subsequently adapting public health responses integrated analysis of both epidemiological and sequence data clearly would maximize our ability to reconstruct transmission trees but there are methodological and computational challenges these challenges center on constructing and evaluating a unified likelihood for both the genetic and epidemiological data one of the first attempts at integrated analysis 21 used phylogenetic trees to constrain the set of transmission trees then explored by an epidemiological transmission tree inference algorithm an alternative approach 22 highlighted limitations of phylogenetic methods for reconstructing densely sampled outbreaks and proposed an alternative graph theoretic approach for reconstructing genetically parsimonious transmission trees ie trees implying the smallest number of genetic changes amongst the sampled isolates while simple and fast this method also has a number of limitations dates of infection are not inferred the probability of a given transmission event cannot be assessed and unobserved cases or multiple introductions of the disease cannot be detected substantive methodological developments have been made by ypma et al
23 and subsequently by morelli et al
24 both of which proposed unified likelihoods for genetic and epidemiological data to analyze livestock disease outbreaks avian influenza h7n7 23 and foot-and-mouth disease 24 however those methods require that the outbreak has a single introduction event and that all cases are observed which limits their applicability to restricted epidemic contexts here we introduce a novel and generic framework for the reconstruction of disease outbreaks based on pathogen genetic sequences and collection dates we use the distribution of the generation time ie time interval between a primary and a secondary infection 7 8 to define the epidemiological likelihood of a given transmission tree this is coupled with a simple model of sequence evolution defining the probability of the genetic changes observed between the pathogen genomes along a chain of transmission our model is embedded within a bayesian framework allowing estimation of dates of infections mutation rates separate introductions of the pathogen the presence of unobserved cases and the transmission tree estimate of the effective reproduction number over time rt can also be obtained as an improvement over previous approaches 23 24 our method does not require all cases to be observed or there to be a single introduction event which triggers an outbreak after evaluating the performance of our method using simulated outbreaks we illustrate our approach by analyzing the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak in singapore 10 11 25 our method is implemented in the package outbreaker for the r software 26 and represents the first widely available tool for the reconstruction and analysis of disease outbreaks from genomic data we analysed simulated outbreaks to assess the performance of our method under a variety of conditions including different basic reproduction numbers r0 sampling coverage rates of evolution and generation time distributions with our base scenario resembling an influenza-like illness table 1 the outbreak size varied from 10 to nearly 200 infections in a fixed population of 200 susceptible hosts plus imported cases with a median sample size of 110 quartile range 66132 fig s1 wherever applicable reported results refer to the marginal distributions transmission trees were overall very well reconstructed with 70 to 90 of true ancestries being recovered in most simulation settings fig 1 and table s1 in text s1 better results were achieved when the sampling coverage was high compare settings base to 75 50 and 25 of missing cases in the absence of genetic information the transmission tree was very difficult to infer setting no mutation differences in basic reproduction numbers settings low r and high r and in the shape of the generation time distribution settings short generation and long generation induced some variation in the proportions of successfully recovered ancestries although these remained satisfying in every case fig 1 and table s1 in text s1 dates of infections were inferred with accuracy in most settings fig s2 and table s1 in text s1 however this result was mostly driven by the shape of the generation time distribution with broader distributions leading to greater uncertainty in the dates of infection fig s2 while perfectly inferred in fully sampled outbreaks the number of generations between ancestor and descendents became ambiguous as the proportion of missing cases increases table s1 in text s1 mutation rates were also mostly well estimated table s1 in text s1 fig s3 albeit with a tendency to over-estimation this bias was stronger when sampling grew sparser settings with 75 and 50 missing cases and to a lesser extent when the number of imported cases grew large setting many imports detailed investigation of individual simulations suggested that misdetection of imported cases and increased numbers of erroneous ancestries may be responsible for over-estimating the mutation rates in these settings the inference of sampling coverage varied largely amongst different simulation settings table s1 in text s1 fig s4 well recovered in fully sampled outbreaks it was largely overestimated in sparse samples settings with 75 50 and 25 missing cases and slightly underestimated with longer generation time the detection of imported cases showed excellent specificity and good sensitivity pooling results across the simulated datasets examined with a majority of simulations exhibiting perfect results fig 2 however substantial variations were observed between simulation settings fig s5 table s1 in text s1 unsurprisingly detection of imported cases was more difficult when imported cases were more frequent and when a higher fraction of cases was unobserved with longer generation times the larger numbers of mutations accumulated between ancestors and descendents made the detection of genetic outliers and thus of imported cases nearly impossible fig s2 while our model does not explicitly estimate the effective reproduction number r ie the number of secondary cases per infected individual this quantity can easily be computed from the posterior trees our base simulations show that reliable estimates of r at an individual level can be obtained when genetic information is available fig 3 left in contrast such inference was impossible in the absence of genetic data fig 3 right to gain a better understanding of disease outbreak dynamics identifying systematic heterogeneity in r across cases is also essential to assess whether our approach could detect such heterogeneity we implemented two types of simulations in which there were systematic differences in infectivity between groups of hosts in a first set of simulations the host population was divided into two groups of equal sizes eg adults and children with low and high infectivity infectivity in one group was twice that of the other group with equal susceptibility in the second setting we included rare 5 super-spreaders who had the same susceptibility to infections as non super-spreaders but were 13-fold more infectious in both sets of simulations infectivity was fixed for each individual at the beginning of the simulations the classification of individuals into super-spreaders and regular spreaders was considered as known when comparing estimated reproduction numbers results showed that our method was able to recover contrasted infectivity between different groups fig 4 s6 7 8 9 in the simulations with equally-sized groups the overall distributions of r for each group were almost perfectly recovered fig 4 top panel while values of r at an individual level were also well estimated fig s6 importantly when ignoring the genetic information differences between groups were barely detectable fig 4 and s7 similar results were observed in simulations including super-spreaders fig 4 bottom panel in which estimates of r values at an individual level were excellent when using genetic information fig s8 and very poor without it fig s9 the reconstruction of average r values over time was not improved by the inclusion of genetic information fig s10 s11 which is unsurprising as this mainly depends on correctly inferring the dates of infections which was unaffected by the absence of genetic data fig s1 s2 we analyzed data collected during the beginning of a sars outbreak which took place in singapore in 2003 10 25 previous studies proposed different reconstructions of this outbreak based on indirect contact tracing information and genetic data and while all agreed on the necessity to combine these two streams of information a clear consensus on the initial transmission tree has not been reached 10 11 25 here we aimed to reconstruct the early stage of this outbreak using 13 full sars genomes collected from the putative index patient and primary and secondary cases and previously published estimates of the generation time distribution 27 fig s12 the genetic diversity amongst isolates was limited with less than 15 mutations separating any pair of genomes fig s13 for most cases transmission events could not be readily inferred from the phylogenetic tree fig s14 according to previous estimates of the mutation rate 25 we expect that most direct transmissions 99 will exhibit between 0 and 5 mutations using this result we performed a simple graph analysis to derive possible clusters of direct transmissions which suggested the existence of one main cluster of cases that may be linked directly the remaining 4 isolates falling into three groups fig s15 however this crude analysis only relied on genetic diversity and did not take into account information on the collection dates of the isolates or on the duration of the infectious period we used outbreaker to exploit all these data simultaneously results of the inferred likely scenarios fig 5 and 6 show that for half of the cases a well-supported ancestor can be identified from the data see also fig s16 these correspond to all of the first and second generations of infections sin2677 sin2679 sin2748 sin2774 and to the last sampled case sin850 ancestries of most cases were compatible with a single generation although one or two unobserved infections may have taken place between sin849 and sin850 fig s17 we found no evidence for separate index cases after sin2500 in agreement with contact tracing information 10 11 25 however the small number of cases may impair the detection of outliers and thus the identification of imported cases so that multiple introductions of the pathogen cannot be ruled out the most recent investigation of this outbreak suggested a dual introduction of the pathogen with a separate index case sin2679 nearly 20 days after the initial index case sin2500 10 11 25 this may be deemed surprising as this case is genetically close to some preceding cases fig s14 s15 here our results suggest that sin2679 would in fact be part of the second generation of infection and was infected by sin2748 fig 5 and 6 indeed while the collection dates of sin2748 and sin2679 are relatively close the generation time of sars fig s12 may have allowed for this transmission to occur closer examination of the patterns of mutations between sin2500 sin2748 and sin2679 bring further support to this scenario fig 6 data s3 indeed the four mutations separating sin2500 from sin2679 are the simple addition of the mutations accumulated on the chain of transmission from sin2500 to sin2748 position 26430 ag and from sin2748 to sin2679 18284 ca 19086 tc 23176 ct building on past work 23 24 we have presented a flexible analytical framework for the reconstruction of densely sampled outbreaks from epidemiological and sequence data we extended previous work by accounting for unobserved cases and proposing a new approach for identifying multiple introductions of the pathogens based on the detection of genetic outliers our method is also the first tool for outbreak reconstruction widely available as a free software the r package outbreaker and able to run on standard desktop computers the analysis of simulated data suggests that our approach will be applicable to a wide range of pathogens with various basic reproduction numbers generation time distributions and genetic diversity we have shown how our approach can be used to infer effective reproduction numbers at an individual level importantly this allows for detecting differences in infectivity of different groups of cases and for the identification of super-spreaders our results suggest that while epidemiological data may suffice for the estimation of mean aggregated quantities such as the mean effective reproduction number r genetic data are useful to tease individual heterogeneities apart as in other tree reconstruction methods 2 7 28 29 we did not explicitly model the population of susceptible individuals this is because information on individuals who were not infected during the outbreak the denominator data is quite often unavailable compared with case-only analyses availability of denominator data also makes it possible to estimate the force of infection and risk factors for infection 4 we note that our framework could easily be extended to model the uninfected population this could be done by modifying our likelihood so that the probability of the time of infection of a case would be based on an explicit model of the force of infection individuals not infected during the outbreak would also contribute to the epidemiological likelihood as is standard in such situations 4 integrating and validating these additional features in our approach will be the subject of future research our method relies on several assumptions which can be used to define the scope of its possible applications the most important element in this respect is the proportion of cases represented in the sampled data and thus often the scale of the epidemics considered our approach aims to reconstruct ancestries in closely related cases as such it should be most useful for detailed outbreak investigations while the reconstruction of transmission tree seems relatively robust to large proportions of unobserved cases up to 75 of missing cases fig 1 our method is clearly tailored to densely sampled outbreaks and not meant for the analysis of large-scale more sparsely sampled epidemics in such cases phylogenetic methods are preferred as they explicitly reconstruct unobserved common ancestors of the sampled pathogen genomes and can be used to infer if not the transmission tree the past dynamics of the disease 30 31 32 one of the novelties of our approach is the detection of imported cases which are identified as genetic outliers while this method should be useful to detect separate introductions of different pathogenic lineages in an epidemic it may be sensitive to other events prone to creating genetic outliers such as sequencing errors or recombination care should therefore be devoted to ensuring data quality and filtering out polymorphism due to recombination moreover the assumption that imported cases are genetically distinguishable from other cases may not always be true especially when multiple introductions take place from a closely related lineage such cases cannot be detected by genetic data only and would require other sources of information eg contact tracing to be considered in this respect an interesting feature of outbreaker is the ability to fix known imported cases as well as any other known transmissions before reconstructing the transmission tree another important point is that following a previous widely-used approach for the analysis of outbreaks 7 we assume the distributions of the generation time and of the time from infection to sample collection to be known in some situations such as outbreaks of new emerging pathogens accurate estimates of the generation time may not be readily available in this case a conservative approach should allow for a wide range of possible times to infection at the expense of increased uncertainty in the inferred ancestries as our method is numerically efficient for the analysis of small outbreaks we suggest testing different generation time distributions to assess the robustness of the results as a longer-term alternative our approach could be extended to include an explicit parameterization and estimation of the generation time distribution more fundamentally the use of a generation time distribution also implies that our method is less appropriate for diseases in which long periods of asymptomatic carriage are frequent for instance bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus can cause infections after months of asymptomatic colonization of the host but may equally cause outbreaks of cases linked by only a few days 12 33 in such cases the collection dates of isolates effectively carry less information about possible transmissions which would hamper our current approach however our model could be adapted to the analysis of carried pathogens by incorporating specific data on known exposures eg shared occupancy on a hospital ward 34 35 36 moreover carried pathogens are also more likely to cause multiple colonizations of the host resulting in several lineages coexisting within the same patient our model assumes that a single pathogen genome exists within each host and is therefore not designed to account for multiple infections a simple workaround would consist in duplicating cases of multiple infections into single infections assuming that multiple infections are made of independent single colonization events however this would not allow for disentangling multiple infections from mere within-host evolution of a single lineage a more satisfying approach would consist in modeling explicitly the evolution of isolates within host but this will likely result in a much more complex model and is beyond the remit of our current approach a major simplification made in our model that could be relaxed in future work is that we do not consider within host diversity of pathogens within-host diversity is particularly prominent in pathogens that infect a host for a long time relative to their within-host replication cycle eg hiv or hepatitis c virus pathogens that can be carried for a long time eg staphylococcus aureus pathogens where the infectious inoculum is large eg blood-transmitted hiv or super-infection is frequent eg streptococcus pneumoniae in hyper-endemic settings limited host diversity leads us to assume that genomes sampled from infectors are effectively ancestral to genomes sampled from secondary cases allowing us to equate phylogenetic and transmission trees this substantially reduces the complexity of the inferential problem and reduces by orders of magnitude the dimensionality of the space of linked augmented variables to be explored the assumption of no within-host diversity will likely be appropriate for acute infectious pathogens in outbreaks but will also be relatively appropriate for situations where there is a strong bottleneck on diversity upon transmission and limited opportunities for superinfection such as sexually transmitted hiv inclusion of within-host diversity in the model inference is an important but likely complex task though efficient approximations may be possible a related development will be the inclusion of multiple samples per individual used to sample cross-sectional and longitudinal genetic diversity within infected hosts another somewhat simpler extension would be the inclusion of a relaxed molecular clock which would allow accounting for heterogeneities in mutation rates amongst different pathogen lineages finally we wish to emphasize the importance of including all available prior information in the analysis because the estimates of parameters governing an outbreak are often correlated accurate knowledge of one can be used to refine the estimation of the others for instance specifying known transmission chains or imported cases will improve the estimation of the mutation rates as well as the overall reconstruction of the transmission tree conversely fixing the mutation rate to its true value or a good estimate thereof is likely to improve the detection of imported cases as currently implemented our method allows for fixing any parameter as well as individual ancestries which are used in the likelihood computations but not changed during the mcmc this feature should be especially useful for incorporating known transmission events or introductions of the pathogen into the population based for instance on clinical investigations and contact tracing information however results of contact tracing studies should always be considered cautiously and could be contradicted by the analysis of corresponding sequences as illustrated by the sars outbreak in singapore there are other promising avenues for incorporating various streams of information into our approach the likelihood of our model allows for additional plug-in terms for individual transmissions which could be used to model spatial dispersion processes as well as movement over a contact network therefore we hope that the present method will not only be applied widely but also motivate further developments for the investigation of infectious disease outbreaks we developed a discrete-time stochastic model for reconstructing likely transmission trees of an outbreak based on pathogen genetic sequences and their collection dates see notations summary in table 2 and figure s18 our model considers a single pathogen genome for each case we note  the genetic sequence of case  sampled at time  the function  computes the number of mutations between  and  while  computes the number of nucleotide positions which can be compared between the two sequences  is the distribution of the generation time defined as the time interval between the infection of an individual and his seeding of new secondary cases  is the distribution of the time interval between infection and collection of an isolate both  and  are assumed to be known and are not part of the estimated parameters augmented data are used to model the transmission process which is not observed directly 5 34 we denote  the index of the most recent sampled ancestor of case  and  the number of generations separating cases  and   for imported cases  is fixed to 0 the date of infection for case  is denoted  we use the simplest model of sequence evolution considering one single mutation rate  measured per site and per generation of infection unlike approaches based on strict molecular clocks eg 24 a generational clock models the accumulation of genetic diversity with new infections while overlooking within-host evolution 23 lastly the parameter  is the proportion of cases of the outbreak that have been sampled over the time span of the dataset assuming a constant reporting rate over time our model is embedded within a bayesian framework we denote y the observed data a the augmented data and  the model parameters the joint posterior distribution of parameters and augmented data is defined as1which is proportional to2where the first term is the likelihood of the data and augmented data and the second the joint prior distribution likelihood computations are described below priors and estimation procedures are described in supporting methods the likelihood is computed as a product of case-specific terms in which we assume that all cases are independent conditional on their ancestries3where  is the probability of the first collection date given the first infection date and  is a constant in the case of partially sampled transmission chains several cases could share some common unsampled ancestry and would thereby no longer be independent conditional on their most recent sampled ancestor it follows that in the general case eq 2 is not a true likelihood but a composite likelihood 37 used to approximate the likelihood 24 the general term of the pseudo-likelihood for case  is4which can be decomposed into5where  is a constant we refer to  as the genetic pseudo-likelihood and to  as the epidemiological pseudo-likelihood as in 22 mutations are modeled as features of the transmission events this is a direct corollary of the assumption of no within host diversity this approach has the advantage of being computationally very efficient as only the genetic distances between isolates need to be known to compute the pseudo-likelihood of a transmission event and all transmission events are independent the genetic pseudo-likelihood of case  is defined as the probability of observing the genetic differences between the sequence  and the ancestral sequence  with  and  being separated by  generations in practice if case  has not been sequenced we look for another ancestral sequence by moving up the transmission chain replacing  by the number of generations between the two compared sequences given the short timescale considered between pairs of sequences reverse mutations are considered negligible accordingly sites under strong selection such as immune epitopes or drug-resistance associated snps should be removed from the analyzed sequences assuming that all sites mutate independently and in the absence of reverse mutations the genetic pseudo-likelihood  is given by6 the epidemiological pseudo-likelihood  is computed as7the first term corresponds to the pseudo-likelihood of the collection date the second term is the probability of the infection date for  generations between the infection dates considered  where  is the convolution operator the last term is the probability of unobserved intermediate cases modeled with a negative binomial distribution  equivalent to a geometric distribution with parameter p indicating the probability of obtaining one success here sampling a case after  failures unobserved cases with a probability of success  imported cases are not explicitly included in the model but detected using a preliminary run of the model during which genetic outliers are identified and the corresponding cases classified as imported the ancestry of these cases is fixed as unknown in the second and final run we use a leave-one-out procedure for detecting cases with outlying genetic log-likelihood which has been used previously in a similar context 38 this approach defines the global influence  of case  considering genetic data only as8where  denotes the expectation of the corresponding terms approximated by the average over a number of samples 50 by default from the mcmc of the preliminary run large values of  reflect unlikely numbers of mutations and therefore a probable genetic outlier by default cases with a global influence greater than 5 times the average global influence are classified as outliers while this threshold is arbitrary it was determined empirically to have excellent specificity and appreciable sensitivity on a range of simulation settings see fig 2 because our model uses a mutation rate expressed per generation of infection estimated values cannot be readily compared to classical rates of evolution typically expressed per unit of time as a workaround we can re-estimate a classical mutation rate from the distribution of posterior trees the mutation rate can be inferred from one transmission event as the ratio of the number of mutations from ancestor to descendent and the amount of time separating the infection dates of these cases for each tree we compute the average mutation rate across all ancestries which provides one estimate of the mutation rate for each posterior sample this procedure is implemented in the function getmu in outbreaker our approach is implemented in the r package outbreaker version 11-0 freely available at httpcranr-projectorgwebpackagesoutbreakerindexhtml outbreaks

of new cases is drawn from a binomial distribution with  draws and a probability  infectors of a case infected at time ti are sampled from a multinomial distribution with probabilities10in addition to endogenous cases external cases are imported at a constant rate mutations are simulated using a single mutation rate all sites mutating independently pathogens of separate introductions of the disease including the index case are assumed to all coalesce to the same common ancestor ten generations ago we evaluated the overall performance of the method using a basic scenario and assessed the impact of different factors on the results by changing one aspect of the simulation at a time these factors included the shape of the generation time distribution from peaked to flat the basic reproduction number from 11 to 4 the mutation rates from 0 to 2 mutations on average per generation and genome the proportion of cases observed from 025 to 1 the rate at which external cases are imported from 0 to 02 and the proportion of sampled cases with dna sequences from 025 to 1 the different values for each element are summarized in table 2 for each setting 50 epidemics were simulated with 200 susceptible hosts and a minimum of 10 cases and analyzed using outbreaker with the default settings described in supporting information in addition two other types of simulation were used to test our approachs ability to detect heterogeneous infectivity amongst cases first we generated outbreaks where the host population was divided into two groups of equal sizes one being twice as infectious equivalent r0  3 as the other equivalent r0  15 second we simulated outbreaks with super-spreader dynamics were 5 cases were super-spreaders with an equivalent r0 of 20 while the rest of the population had an equivalent r0 of 15 in both cases 50 outbreaks with minimum sizes of 10 cases were simulated using a single pathogen introduction and 100 susceptible hosts and fully sampled outbreaks were analysed using outbreaker fixing  values to 1 generation and using defaults otherwise for the super-spreader simulations super-spreaders were identified first from the data and their reproduction number compared to that of the non super-spreaders for such comparisons effective reproduction numbers of the different groups were calculated based on cases during the whole outbreak thirteen previously published full sars genomes 10 25 data s1 were obtained from genbank and aligned using muscle 39 the resulting alignment contained 29731 columns 39 of which were polymorphic data s2 we used a generation time distribution modeled as a discretized gamma distribution with a mean of 84 days and a standard deviation of 38 days 27 using the function discrsi from the r package

ancestry of a given case was quantified using the entropy of the frequencies of the posterior ancestors with  different ancestors of posterior frequencies   the entropy is defined as11the entropy is 0

containment ofir reich guy shalev tom kalvari  to model covid-19 spread we use an seir agent-based model on a graph which takes into account several important real-life attributes of covid-19 super-spreaders realistic epidemiological parameters of the disease testing and quarantine policies we find that mass-testing is much less effective than testing the symptomatic and contact tracing and some blend of these with social distancing is required to achieve suppression we also find that the fat tail of the degree distribution matters a lot for epidemic growth and many standard models do not account for this additionally the average reproduction number for individuals equivalent in many models to r 0  is not an upper bound for the effective reproduction number r even with an expectation of less than one new case per person our model shows that exponential spread is possible the parameter which closely predicts growth rate is the ratio between 2nd to 1st moments of the degree distribution we provide mathematical arguments to argue that certain results of our simulations hold in more general settings we use a model of covid-19 spread an seir5 agent-based model on a graph2 which takes into account several important real-life attributes of covid-19  super-spreaders6 ie the fact that some people have many more connections than others are more likely to be infected and if infectious will infect many more people than the median we use a power-law degree distribution  realistic epidemiological parameters of the disease -doubling time when no action is taken  modeling covid-19 on a network super-spreaders testing and containment 2 -different infectiousness at each of these different stages -importantly we do not rely on estimates of r 0  which are very uncertain and depend on other assumptions 1 1 see popular article  testing and quarantine policies we provide simulation results and mathematical arguments to argue that these results hold more generally we draw conclusions both about graph structure and about testing  quarantine policies the main conclusions about graph structure are  the average reproduction number for individuals r equivalent in many models to r 0  is not an upper bound for the effective reproduction number r even with an expectation of less than one new case per person our model shows that exponential spread is possible this is because of super-spreaders -the fat tail of the degree distribution -who are more likely to get infected and when infectious infect many people  the degree distribution not just its mean matters a lot both for the epidemic growth rate and for the eventual outcome number of people infected many standard models neglect this sometimes implicitly using a model equivalent to constant degree or with degree distribution with a small standard deviation these models can produce systematic errors social distancing could be effective by lowering the mean degree which matters a lot but it could also be effective by limiting super-spreaders  a potentially highly cost-effective social distancing strategy might therefore be to limit super-spreaders eg by frequent testing by limiting their contagiousness or by reducing their number of contacts without changing the total number of contacts in the population  the parameter which closely predicts growth rate is the ratio of 2nd to 1st moments of the degree distribution where d is the degree of a random node if the average reproduction number for individuals is r we get  graph locality the fact that neighbors of a given node tend to be themselves connected could also be important but we dont model it yet other properties of the graph like large highly connected and sparsely connected subgraphs could also be important and arent modeled the main conclusions from testing  quarantine policy simulations are  any relaxation of lockdowns without other measures only resets the clock until the outbreak is critical  safely exiting lockdowns depends primarily on testing capacity and tracing capacity -tests per day swiftness of results and actions without those measures driving r below 1 exiting lockdown would cause re-emergence of the epidemic for limited testing capacity a more aggressive quarantine policy can serve as a substitute  better testing tracing  quarantine policies can create containment with far less social distancing if they are effective enoughgood coverage quick execution  without full lockdown mass testing of the general population to search for unknown infected individuals is mostly futile for containment since it would require near universal testing to be effective which is far beyond current capacity limited testing resources are much better spent testing the symptomatic and their contacts we use a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered seir model 5 for disease progression we use an agent-based model where each agent person is represented as a node in a graph and infection happens between contacts represented by graph edges 2 we also model testing and a quarantine group of those who test positive and contact tracing of their neighbors in the graph each node belongs to exactly one of the following groups figure 1  infected nodes can infect neighboring susceptible nodes -those who share an edge with them full animation at bitlyseir-graph-animation nodes

the degree distribution in log scale is in the figure on the right we define the average reproduction number r as the expected number of individuals infected by a single random person if that person is infectious and all others are susceptible more precisely the definition is  select a node in the graph at random uniformly so that each node has an equal probability of being selected  assume this node was infected so it becomes exposed infected then recovered but all other nodes are susceptible let r node be the expected number of its neighbors that it would infect until it recovers  r is the unweighted average of r node over all nodes r  r node  for example assume half of the nodes have degree 10 and half have degree 30 the disease lasts exactly 1 day and the daily probability of infecting a neighbor is 01 then r node  10  1  01  1 for half of the nodes and r node  30  1  01  3 for the other half so r  r node  13 2  2 the advantage of this definition is that it is unambiguous and can be calculated precisely from the properties of the graph and the epidemiological parameters this definition is very closely related to r 0  the only difference is the uniform selection of the initial node which is crucial as we shall see r is nearly proportional to the mean degree times the probability of infection for a homogeneous population where the degree of all nodes is constant as in many models we have r 0  r therefore r is the reproduction number effectively used in many models and definitions we will show it is systematically wrong as an approximation for r 0  for a specific

in the simulation vs r which can be calculated from the mean degree and the epidemiological parameters infection probability recovery time etc the daily growth rate of an epidemic is by what factor the number of infected people grows each day a growth rate of 2 means the number doubles each day a growth rate of 05 means it halves each day the growth rate can be easily derived from the doubling time for example in one simulation in this graph for   04 and r  085 we have a daily growth rate of 12 we plot a few examples of epidemic simulations all with r  05 the same mean degree and infection probability but different values of gamma the different gammas radically change the course of the epidemic gamma of 04 gives standard exponential growth until herd immunity gamma of 02 and 01 give a constant simmer which eventually dies out and gamma of 0 gives quick containment the fact that the degree distribution dramatically affects the epidemic growth rate and effective reproduction number is very important in practice since many models dont account for this fact we review a few families of models which do not model degree distribution  compartmental models which are not agent-based like sir models 5 where the model state is only the fraction of the population in each group implicitly assume that each infectious node causes the same number of infections and that each susceptible node is equally likely to be infected this amounts to assuming constant degree and no locality  branching process models make the same modeling choice equivalent to constant degree with no locality

do not necessarily account for the degree distribution they do however model locality very well a mathematical argument for r   2  2 1  r there is a simple argument for why in our case the effective reproduction number r before the epidemic peaks is typically greater than the average infection rate r recall our definition of r as the expected number of individuals infected by a single random person if that person is infectious and all others are susceptible this is a good approximation for the first step of infection but after the first step of infection individuals with larger degrees are more likely to have been infected since they are more likely to have interacted with an infectious individual this means after the first step the degree distribution of the infectious is not the same as the population distribution -it skews higher those higher degree individuals will then infect in expectation more than r individuals and so after the first step r will be greater than r an extreme and unrealistic case of this is a network with one central node and n-1 other nodes which are only connected to the central node lets take infection with probability 1 for simplicity in this case r  2 but the expected number of individuals infected in 2 steps is n-1 all other nodes and much more than r 2  which is the expected in two steps if r  r more precisely if the degree d in the population is distributed by pd  p 0 d then irrespective of the degree distribution of the infectious nodes in the first generation in the second generation it will be p 1 d  c  p 0 d  d by bayes theorem because a node with degree d is d times more likely to be connected to an infectious node than a node with degree 1 is 3 since these probabilities must sum up  this assumes independence between a nodes degree and its neighbors degrees or infectiousness status so we have suppose we start with one random infected node that node has expected degree ed and will infect r nodes in expectation by definition of r those infected nodes have a higher mean degree  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to

first step this will be proportional to degree  1 since the node in question was infected by some other node who can no longer be infected we neglect this to be even more precise one would have to consider the clustering coefficient  locality of the graph to know how many neighboring nodes were not yet infected our graph is not local so we do not address this this degree distribution of infected nodes will remain roughly the same for a few steps until susceptible high degree nodes are exhausted during that time each step each infected node will cause the infection of in expectation

1 of the degree distribution 5 5 as an aside we note that for a directed graph a very similar argument gives we now test that this holds in our model the daily growth rate is a linear function of r which relates to the time it takes the infected node to incubate infect and then recover so called the serial interval we therefore try predicting the growth rate rather than the not easily observed r on the right we see that our theoretic r with the moment ratio is a far better predictor of the growth rate than r that we tried before we see a robust power-law dependence manifested as a straight line in the log-log axes with slope 04 this holds for any non-local graph structure and a wide range of infection rates whereas using r 0  r as many models do is a far worse predictor  cc-by 40

posted may 5 2020 locality and clustering coefficient locality ie the tendency of nodes to cluster so that neighboring nodes share many of their neighbors is a realistic feature of human interactions and can be very important for epidemic spread as well locality means an infected node has fewer nodes to infect than their degree suggests since some of the nodes neighbors have likely already been infected by the same source which infected this node itself the extreme version of this is if every household is isolated where the epidemic can only spread within infected households and then die out we dont model this but getting a more realistic graph of human interactions can yield more conclusions 6  and this is an important 6 see this preprint avenue for future work note that even simulations which are very realistic and use real statistical data about schools work places etc still dont always model a fat tailed degree distribution so these are somewhat complementary approaches we dont have direct evidence of the true distribution of degrees or infectiousness in the population there is some arbitrariness in selecting the mean degree and the infection probability absent direct evidence in what follows we select gamma02 which makes the degree of the top 01 percentile 11000 nodes equal about 15 times the median degree we think this is a somewhat reasonable approximation of the true distribution we select the mean degree arbitrarily to be 20 and calibrate the infection probability accordingly to produce a doubling time of 31 days this is the real-life doubling time absent any action as observed for example in us death rates 7 7 we estimated the doubling time from total number of reported covid-19 deaths in the usa from march 4th to march 28th 2020 the number increased from 11 to 2220 deaths the source similar numbers were observed in other geographies where no significant interventions were implemented graph structure ie the network of who can infect whom has a decisive effect on the growth of epidemics specifically super-spreaders or the fat tail of the degree distribution matter a lot in addition to the mean degree the expected number of infections of a random individual r in many models equivalent to r 0  is not a good enough indicator of epidemic spread it is also obviously not a property of a virus itself since it depends on many other conditions such as social living  hygiene conditions we showed that the graph structure has a very large influence on the effective reproduction number r even when r stays constant because of dynamics of the epidemic spread it is therefore crucial to model the graph structure to reach the right conclusions about epidemic spread  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the

is mostly futile for containment in order to actually create containment it needs to be done at such a high rate that requires infeasible resources spending the same amount of tests on symptomatic patients and their contacts is much more efficient -testing just the symptomatic can create containment but only if its done with such speed and certainty that are not really feasible -tracing the contacts of those who tested positive and testing them is another important tool for containment and its effects might even be understated in our results due to certain abstractions in our model most of all lack of locality of the graph combined with testing the symptomatic it can achieve containment more easily -absent test kits such as in developing countries diagnosing by symptoms and then aggressively tracing contacts and quarantining them without testing can be a substitute for testing to compare different policies against each other we need to explain what the policies are and what outcomes we care about lets start with the outcomes the three main outcomes well track here are the following  share of the population eventually infected this is the proportion of individuals who are infected at some point before the epidemic is eradicated some fraction of this is the deaths so this is obviously important we term a share of fewer than 5 containment  cc-by 40 international license

quarantine days per person the total quarantine time experienced by all individuals throughout the epidemic divided by the total number of individuals in the population this gives the number of days the average person will spend in quarantine keep in mind that our simulations start with 01 of the population infected and 015 of the population exposed so outcomes should sometimes be scaled to the share of the population infected when the policy is implemented for example peak test rate our policies are divided into three main categories according to who is tested  mass testing -testing the general population a random subset of the general population that has not tested positive before is tested exposed or infected individuals who are tested test positive we parameterize this by the fraction of the population tested each day  test only the symptomatic patients and nobody else however not all of them are tested and not immediately we model this as a random subset of infected individuals being tested every day and found positive we parameterize by what fraction of the infected are tested per day or equivalently by the expected number of days between developing symptoms and being tested this could also be testing not with kits but by symptoms for example in developing countries  test  trace this is a complement to testing the symptomatic or the general population in which for those who test positive their contacts are also tested with some probability to find other exposed or infected individuals all the positives are quarantined we parameterize this by the share of contacts traced and tested we also briefly consider the case where contacts arent tested with test kits but instead all quarantined all of these policies can be combined with social distancing we now go over these policies and report the outcomes they produce  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 5 2020  how many tests of the general population would we have to perform every day in order to achieve containment well look at different fractions of the population tested every day 30 10 1 etc and graph main outcomes that result from each intensity of this policy to create containment we need to test 30 of the population every day if we only test 10 of the population every day we get 34 of the population infected -no containment blue bars of course the test rate is very high in both of these options theres a good argument for why its hard to achieve containment this way testing a random x of the population per day and quarantining the positives only reduces the growth rate of the epidemic by x a day since it eliminates x of the carriers if the epidemic grows faster than x a day as in our case this doesnt get the growth rate below 1 and does not achieve containment this is not to say mass testing is not effective at all just that it requires so many tests to be effective that these testing efforts are much better spent elsewhere other methods to detect carriers must be considered now we review policies of testing the symptomatic our parameter is the expected number of days between a patient developing symptoms becoming infected in our model and being tested on the right is a chart of the outcomes notice if it takes 02 days almost immediately to detect a symptomatic patient and those who tested positive are immediately quarantined we get about 2 of the population eventually infectedsubstantial but still containment in this case we need to test 01 of the population at the peak day if it takes 1 day to detect a symptomatic patient it will make 20 of the population get infected -no containment we would also need more tests at the peak in this case and require more quarantine time in other words quarantining all the infected immediately as they become infected before they infect anybody else can stop the spread but if it takes even one day on average to find and quarantine the symptomatic we get exponential growth this means even if all symptomatic patients self-isolate and stop infecting after one day of symptoms we would still not achieve suppression though it does slow down the doubling time significantly from 31 to 77 days not shown on the

covid-19 if these presymptomatic infections alone create an effective reproductive number r  1 testing the symptomatic will not create containment in our model they create r of almost 1 so that even only a minor additional delay in testing is enough to allow additional infections in the early infected period and push r above 1 something more is required quarantining the infected is useful for containment as weve seen a way to leverage this to find more infected and exposed individuals is to trace the contacts of the infected individual and to test them as well to see if they have already been infected this is called test  trace we implemented only one cycle of this 1 testing of infected  general population with some probability as before 2 for those who tested positive some fraction of their neighbors is traced and tested of those tested both infected and exposed test positive 3 quarantining all those who tested positive from steps 1 and 2 we did not model an additional steps of testing the neighbors of positives from step 2 their neighbors and so on suppose it takes 2 days on average to detect an infected individual the chart on the right shows how the fraction of contacts successfully traced changes our outcomes this has a large effect tracing all contacts of an infected individual who tests positive achieves containment with 3 of the population eventually infected tracing only 10 of the contacts rightmost bars does not achieve containment with 24 of the population eventually infected we think this actually understates the real life effect of test  trace our graph is not local at all so there are no clusters of infected nodes this means that neighbors of an infected node x which tested positive are only more likely to be exposed or infected themselves to the extent that they were infected by x they dont have any larger chance of having been infected by the same node which infected x in reality there is much clustering and so tracing can help detect these pockets of infections and be even more effective  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in

contacts traced and tested still mass-testing of just over 10 of the population daily is required for containment the peak test rate in this case is predictably very large almost identical to mass-testing without contact tracing again we see that there is not much point in mass testing if not enough test kits are available to test all contacts as in developing countries tracing might still be possible in this case instead of testing contacts a more aggressive policy of quarantining all of the traced contacts without testing them can achieve results which are at least as good at containment at the price of much more quarantine time in a sense testing is a substitute for more quarantine if there is slack test capacity where the constraint is just the cost of a single test and not the amount of tests performed per day testing can be a way to minimize quarantine time all of these analyses were done assuming there is no social distancing so absent any testing  quarantines the doubling time is 31 days but what if social distancing  hygiene push the infection rate down a bit we performed all of the same simulations with a lower infection probability about 23 of the original which gives a basic doubling time of about 5 days this does not correspond to lockdown but to some social distancing measures still in place say limiting large gatherings the policies relative effectiveness stays the same except that now slightly less action is required in conclusion there are a few tools at our disposal to decrease the effective reproduction number r below 1 and achieve containment  testing symptomatic individuals -helps a lot but not enough on its own the faster and more hermetic it is the more effective it is  contact tracing -helps a lot as well  social distancing

combinations are possible according to what is feasible and least costly our simulations suggest some social distancing short of lockdown testing of symptomatics and contact tracing are the way to go

past and are now recovered exit quarantine even if their 14 days arent up quarantined nodes who tested positive in the past and havent recovered stay in quarantine even if their 14 days are up quarantined individuals can neither infect nor be infected some proportion of infected nodes become recovered and are no longer infectious this has no memory so it creates an exponentially distributed recovery time some fraction of nodes are randomly selected to start as infected a slightly larger fraction are randomly selected to start as exposed their incubation times are drawn from the same gamma distribution of incubation time all other nodes start as susceptible no nodes start as recovered quarantined or tested positive the simulation makes several steps per day with step-wise probabilities calculated as the daily probabilities divided by the number of steps per day full parameter table is below  we typically run a simulation of the progression of the epidemic and collect aggregate stats at each simulation step total number of susceptible exposed infected recovered quarantined tests performed this creates several time series we then typically run 10 simulations with the same model parameters and average these time series to reduce noise see figure on the right we calculate our final outcome stats on this average time series there is some noise or initial condition dependence in the individual simulations which is typically smoothed out in the average our simulation outcomes can include the total number of nodes infected the peak test rate the total quarantine time the doubling time during the exponential spread and more the strengths of this model are  it models quarantines and contact tracing  cc-by 40 international license it is made available

able to model clustering and heterogeneity in r0  this model can be flexibly adapted to changing parameters or policies  this model is open source the limitations of this model are  many things are not modeled probabilistically which should be all neighbors are traced and quarantined quarantined individuals never infect or get infected tests come out positive for all exposed and infected  we do not model dynamic edges -nodes in contact stay in contact throughout  this is not the true graph form for human interactions it is simplified the real connection graph of people is more complex with strong locality but we do think it has a fat tailed degree distribution we are unsure of the precise realistic parameters of the power law distribution and results are sensitive to that parameters of the real-life graph with and without social distancing would be a valuable addition  the mean degree of nodes we selected is arbitrary but we calibrate the infection probability to give the correct doubling time so might correct that  we do not model asymptomatic patients directly however we capture them through the daily probability of recovery which was calculated to include them and the probability an infected node is detected which is not 1 so they are modeled as infected who recover quickly and arent tested this is an important avenue for future work since they might be very numerous 1  we do not model superspreading events gatherings etc and these could be important if they increase the average number of interactions and so infections or if they mix the graph a lot  we do not model false negative test results but these are equivalent to a smaller fraction of the population  infected  neighbors being tested so it is included in the probability of testing which in fact represents the probability of detection we also do not model false positive test results  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

sars-cov-2 had infected more than 85 000 people in all provincesregions of china and another 59 countriesregions across africa asia europe north america oceania and south america wikipedia 2020 because sars-cov-2 can transmit from human to human li et al 2020 the massive exodus of people before the chinese spring festival boosted the infection frequencies as predicted wu et al 2020b daily

2003
 as a member of subgenus sarbecovirus sars-cov-2 has been suggested to be of bat origin lu et al 2020b zhou et al 2020 and may have been transmitted to humans through non-bat intermediate mammals eg pangolins cyranoski 2020 lam et al 2020 wong et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b medical information for the first 41 infected patients in wuhan showed that 27 patients were linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market abbreviated as huanan market in the text below huang et al 2020 li et al 2020 which sold living wild mammals this suggests a high possibility that sars-cov-2 originated in the market then the infected people transmitted it to other people outside of the market however this conclusion has been challenged because the first identified infected person and 12 others had no link to the huanan market some researchers have therefore argued that the huanan market was not the original andor only source of sars-cov-2 transmission to humans cohen 2020 the market was closed on 01 january 2020 making it very difficult to identify the intermediate animal vectors of sars-cov-2 in the absence of information on potential intermediary reservoirs the origin and transmission pattern of sars-cov-2 are still unresolved wong et al 2020
 since the outbreak of covid-19 was first identified in wuhan in mid-december 2019 the first infected individuals identified in other provinces and regions of china and other countries during january 2020 have been assumed to have been infected in wuhan or through contact with people from wuhan chan et al 2020 holshue et al 2020 phan et al 2020 rothe et al 2020 in this study we used 93 genomes of sars-cov-2 from the gisaid epiflutm database shu  mccauley 2017 access date 12 february 2020 to decode the evolution and transmissions of sars-cov-2 in the first two months of its spread our aims were to 1 characterize genomic variations of sars-cov-2 2 infer the evolutionary relationships of the worldwide samples and 3 deduce the transmission history of sars-cov-2 within wuhan and out of wuhan to the world
 to decode the evolutionary history of sars-cov-2 we retrieved 96 complete genomes from gisaid supplementary table s1 access by 12 february 2020 shu  mccauley 2017 the genome epiisl402131 bat-ratg13-cov hereafter from gisaid was also included as the outgroup because it is the closest sister betacoronavirus available to sars-cov-2 zhou et al 2020 the 97 genome sequences were aligned using mafft katoh  standley 2013 then the alignment was manually checked using geneious biomatters new zealand in the alignment we found that epiisl404253 contains six ambiguous sites at variable positions and epiisl407079 and epiisl408978 have 175 n and 1476 n bases respectively so these three genomes were excluded in this study in addition four genomes epiisl407071 epiisl407894 epiisl407896 and epiisl409067 have their own private ambiguous sites which were conservatively replaced by the common nucleotide at that position in the alignment notably epiisl406592 h15 and epiisl406595 h17 had excessive amounts of private variable sites which were possibly affected by sequencing errors in the alignment the 5 untranslated region utr and 3 utr regions contain missing and ambiguous sites so these regions were excluded in the following analyses
 the alignment was then imported into dnasp rozas et al 2017 for haplotype analyses population size changes were estimated based on a constant population size hypothesis using dnasp in combination with neutrality tests tajimas d and fus fs we also used arlequin excoffier  lischer 2010 to test the sudden population expansion hypothesis and to calculate the expansion parameter tau  since the sudden population expansion was not rejected we used the formula t2u rogers  harpending 1992 to estimate the time since expansion in days in the formula u is the cumulative substitution rate per year for the genome sequence so we used the formula uk to calculate it where  is the substitution rate per site per year and k is the genome sequence length 29 358 bp for the coding sequence cds matrix the substitution rate was set as 092103 95 ci 033103146103 substitutionsiteyear based on the most recent estimation for sars-cov-2 rambaut 2020 to adjust the time we used a mean value of the expansion time calculated from the three substitution rates ie 033103 092103 and 146103 substitutionsiteyear in addition the expansion date was estimated based on the sampling date from hospitalized patients the estimated date should be later than the real date of massive human-to-human transmission events
 phylogenetic networks of the haplotype coding region matrix and 120 substitution sites of sars-cov-2 supplementary datasets were inferred using splitstree huson  bryant 2006 a median-joining network of haplotypes was generated by the network program bandelt et al 1999 2020 with the reported bat coronavirus bat-ratg13-cov zhou et al 2020 as the outgroup transversions were arbitrarily weighted three times as high as transitions hypervariable sites if number of mutations 5 were weighted as 1 and the other sites were weighted as 10 genetically sars-cov-2 and bat-ratg13-cov as well as sars-cov have been proposed as the same species gorbalenya et al 2020 and genome sequence identity between bat-ratg13-cov and sars-cov-2 was 962 we carefully used three datasets ie four core substitution sites 120 substitution sites and 1 235 substitution sites supplementary datasets to evaluate the relationship between bat-ratg13-cov and four associatedcentral haplotypes of sars-cov-2 h1 h3 h13 and h38 phylogenomic analyses of haplotypes were performed using iq-tree minh et al 2020 we conducted likelihood mapping and sh-like approximate likelihood ratio tests to assess the phylogenetic information and branch supports respectively
 genome size of sars-cov-2 varied from 29 782 bp to 29 903 bp the aligned matrix was 29 910 bp in length including 140 variable sites the cds regions contained 120 substitution sites supplementary figure s1 which were classified as 58 haplotypes supplementary table s2 nucleotide diversity pi was 015103002103 standard deviation sd hereafter haplotype diversity hd was 09530016 sd and variance of hd was 026103
 there were 120 substitution sites found in eight coding sequence cds regions of sars-cov-2 figure 1 supplementary table s2 including 79 transitions 6583 and 41 transversions 3417 a chi-squared test showed that the distribution of substitution sites across cds regions in the genome was even 21958 df9 p099 substitution sites occurring at the 1st to 3rd frame positions were 27 2555 44 400 and 49 4455 respectively the 120 substitution sites were associated with 119 codons including 79 non-synonymous 6583 and 40 synonymous 3361 substitutions forty non-synonymous substitutions 5063 changed the biochemical properties of the amino acid aa and are therefore potentially associated with virus adaptation the current samplings showed that the h1 haplotype has been found in 19 patients but most haplotypes were just sequenced once suggesting that the haplotype h1 was rapidly circulated at an early stage of human-to-human transmissions figure 2 supplementary table s1
 in comparisons with published genomes of sars-cov luk et al 2019 and mers-cov cotten et al 2013 genomic variations of sars-cov-2 are still low without evident recombination sitesregions rm2 p10 at this time according to the collection dates of the sequenced samples haplotypes h1 and h3 were found in two samples at intervals of more than 30 days and multiple samples over 20 days figure 2 supplementary table s1 although the incubation period can be over 24 days there was only one case of this out of 1 099 observations guan et al 2020 estimation of the substitution rates using 90 genomes of sars-cov-2 rambaut 2020 showed that the rate for sars-cov-2 was close to or lower than the rates for mers-cov cotten et al 2014 dudas et al 2018 and sars-cov zhao et al 2004 due to the mild symptoms and low mortality yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a the immune systems of the infected humans may provide a suitable environment for propagation of sars-cov-2 andersen et al 2020 sars-cov-2 is highly infectious yang et al 2020 and is able to infect humans not only through the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth but also use the mucous membranes in the eyes lu et al 2020a which may boost regional circulation and large-scale spread some large mutations may have occurred in wuhan or other regions but the strict quarantine policy over china since 23 january 2020 may have reduced the circulation and spreading of some mutants
 of the 93 genomes of sars-cov-2 39 4193 were from infected patients in 11 countries outside china and encoded 31 haplotypes hd09870009 sd pi016103001103 with 27 nationallyregionally private haplotypes the 54 genomes 5807 from china also encoded 31 haplotypes hd09060001 sd pi014103003103 a proportion z-test showed significant differences in haplotype diversity of samples between china and other countries 24024 df1 p005 the high haplotype diversity found in samples from other countries may be because the sampling dates were mostly after 22 january 2020 while those in china were before this date supplementary table s1 and figure s2 in addition the low level of radiation exposure on long-distance international flights bottollier-depois et al 2000 may have accelerated mutation rates of sars-cov-2 shibai et al 2017
 we used a variety of parameters to estimate the population dynamics of sars-cov-2 constant population size of sars-cov-2 was rejected ramos-onsins and rozass r20025 p0001 raggednessr0011 p005 using dnasp rozas et al 2017 also see supplementary figure s3 while both fus test fs67681964 p0001 and tajimasd test d2701 p0001 indicated that the population size of sars-cov-2 was rapidly increasing mismatch distribution analysis using arlequin excoffier  lischer 2010 strongly supported that the population of sars-cov-2 underwent sudden expansion 2887 sum of squared deviation ssd0541103 p088 harpendings raggedness index r0010 p088 the calculated expansion was 2872 days 95 confident interval 12295436 days ago of the 93 genomes the latest one was sampled on 03 february 2020 so the estimated expansion date was on 06 january 2020 95 ci 11 december 201922 january 2020 which may be related to the new year holiday before 06 january 2020 129 patients were identified as sars-cov-2 infected through field investigations li et al 2020 of 22 genomes 1705 of 129 patients sequenced before 06 january 2020 in wuhan china 13 haplotypes 2241 of 58 haplotypes were recovered which were h1 and its derived descendant haplotypes and h3 figures 2 and 3a coincidentally the china cdc chinese center for disease control and prevention started to activate a level-2 emergency response on 06 january 2020 li et al 2020 the china cdcs emergency response greatly reduced public activities and travel and might have reduced the local circulation and large-scale spread in the following weeks of january
 furthermore mismatch distribution analysis of the 22 genomes before 06 january 2020 also showed a sudden population expansion of sars-cov-2 at an earlier stage of transmission 2818 ssd0010 p041 r0046 p057 tajimas d2241 p0001 fusfs7834 p0001 this earlier population expansion time was estimated at 2838 days 95 ci 12005436 days before 05 january 2020 which was the latest sampling date of the 22 genomes this earlier expansion date was thus estimated to have occurred on 08 december 2019 95 ci 13 november 201926 december 2019 when there was only one infected patient officially reported huang et al 2020 li et al 2020 this suggests that sars-cov-2 might have already circulated widely among humans in wuhan before december 2019 probably beginning in mid to late november rambaut 2020
 phylogenetic networks showed that the 58 haplotypes were clustered into two main clades figure 4 clade i included 19 haplotypes and clade ii included 39 haplotypes the outgroup bat-ratg13-cov was connected to clade i supposed to be an ancestral clade for clade ii the long branches of h15 and h17 correspond to an excessive amount of mutations which are possibly affected by sequencing errors but this is still to be determined three different datasets were used to infer evolutionary networks which consistently supported h13 and h38 as the potentially ancestral haplotypes ie the outgroup bat-ratg13-cov could connect to both h13 and h38 or h38 alone or through a medium vector mv1 an intermediate host or the first infected humans connected to both h13 and h38 by single mutations at positions 18067 s synonymous substitution andor 29102 s referring to the numbering of the alignment length 29 910 bp figure 5 five main groups can be recognized in the network using the dataset of 120 substitution sites figure 3a the h1 h3 and h13 were three core haplotypes so that groups ac were recognized using them as the central ie ancestral super-spreader haplotypes groups d and e were recognized based on two new super-spreader haplotypes h56 and a medium vector mv2 which was a hypothesized often ancestral haplotype not sampled in the current samples these two groups can be also treated as subgroups of group c moreover the sh-like approximate likelihood ratio test further enhanced the phylogenetic relationship retrieved from 58 haplotypes that either h13 or h38 with h45 appeared in the basal lineages supplementary figure s4 although it was difficult to distinguish which one h13 or h38 originated earlier supplementary figure s5
 in the network four satellite haplotypes and h35 connected to h13 group a and nine satellite haplotypes and h38h45 and h50 connected to h3 group b the connections between the h3 and h1 are two mutations at positions 8789 s and 28151 ns non-synonymous substitution figure 5 the latter mutation changed both residues and the biochemical properties of the aa this biochemical change may be associated with the infectivity of sars-cov-2 the h1 haplotype the most abundant included 19 samples while 26 satellite haplotypes and h40h43 and h47 haplotypes are directly derived from h1 group c moreover five haplotypes of group d and four haplotypes of group e were also derived from h1
 phylogenetic networks showed that bat-ratg13-cov was nested with group b in clade i and clade ii tends to be derived from clade i ie h1 and its descendant haplotypes were new mutants from an ancestral haplotype in clade i the rooted network suggested two potential evolutionary paths of available haplotypes that can be from h13 through h3 to h1 and h38 or from h38 through h3 to h1 and h13 figure 3c both scenarios suggested that h3 might be the ancestral haplotype of h1 h13 was only recovered from five shenzhen guangdong province samples including patient 2 of the familial cluster chan et al 2020 two derived haplotypes were also only found in shenzhen of guangdong province h14 from the grandson of patient 2 and the other three haplotypes were found in three samples from japan and one sample from arizona in the united states figure 3 according to an epidemiological study the shenzhen family could have been infected during their visit to wuhan chan et al 2020 this suggests that h13 might have originated from wuhan genetically haplotypes of group a have links to only wuhan haplotype h3 only epiisl406801 it is possible that h13 was newly derived from h3 figure 3c and did not spread in wuhan or that three repatriated japanese might be infected by an unknown source of h13 in wuhan china or somewhere else the asahi shimbun 2020 or that no samples have been sequenced yet h38 has three genomes from the same patient supplementary table s1 who was the first identified infected patient in the united states holshue et al 2020 this patient might have been infected while visiting his family in wuhan china or was infected in some other place the original source of h38 can be explained as that of h13 which can be also derived from h3 figure 3c and the derived h45 was from a chongqing patient who was reported as working in wuhan and had no link to the huanan market
 the h3 haplotype has only one sample from wuhan which was not linked to the huanan market lu et al 2020b and the other samples in this group were from outside of wuhan figure 3a noteworthily all the samples from the market belonged to h1 or its derived haplotypes h2 h8-h12 see figure 2 and supplementary table s1 indicating that there were circulated infections within the market in the short term other researchers have argued that the source of the coronavirus in the market should be imported from elsewhere or at least it should be not the single source of sars-cov-2 cohen 2020 in this study evolutionary relationships indicated that h1 and its descendant haplotypes from the market should be derived from h3 figures 3 4 h3 mutated to the h1 by two substitutions and none of the currently available market samples encoded h3 suggesting that h3 might have originated and spread outside of the market before an early stage of population expansion the non-synonymous mutation from h3 to h1 might have enhanced the infectiousness of sars-cov-2 and a functional characterization should be performed to confirm this speculation it is possible that sars-cov-2 in the market had been transmitted from other places figure 3d or at least that the market did not host the original source of sars-cov-2 cohen 2020 as the first identified infected patients had no link to the market huang et al 2020 it is possible that infected humans transmitted the h1 haplotype of sars-cov-2 to workers or sellers in the market after which it rapidly circulated there due to its special surroundings the crowded market boosted sars-cov-2 transmissions to buyers and spread it to the whole city in early december 2019 corresponding to the estimated population expansion time due to insufficient sampling from wuhan in the currently available samples it is not clear whether h3 never appeared in the market or h1 was quickly derived from h3 to adapt in the market
 of the 54 genomes from patients in china chongqing 3 samples guangdong 18 hubei 22 taiwan 2 and zhejiang 4 have more than two samples and the other five provinces have one sample hubei wuhan samples dated from 24 december 2019 to 05 january 2020 encoded 13 haplotypes belonging to groups c h1 and 11 satellite haplotypes and b only h3 these relationships indicated a rapid transmission and circulation of sars-cov-2 in wuhan at an early stage of human-to-human transmissions h1 no satellite haplotypes and h3 are the ancestors of haplotypes outside of wuhanhubei because most of early confirmed patients might have history in wuhan or hubei eighteen guangdong samples collected from 1023 january 2020 encoded 15 haplotypes belonging to groups a c and e showing that there were multiple sources imported into guangdong three haplotypes h14 h15 and h17 may have evolved locally indicating that human-to-human transmissions happened when sars-cov-2 initially spread to shenzhen in guangdong province chan et al 2020 two samples from taiwan province china encoded h3 and h24 in groups b and d respectively and three samples from chongqing encoded h1 h40 and h45 in groups b and c respectively there were two sources imported into these two provinces four zhejiang samples encoded h1 and h24 in group c which might be only imported from the source of the h1 haplotype
 the samples outside china encoded 31 haplotypes belonging to groups ae of these 27 haplotypes are private by regional samplings only two samples from thailand were the h1 haplotype one each from australia and belgium were the h3 haplotype one from the united states was the h19 haplotype and one from singapore was the h40 haplotype twelve samples encoding 10 haplotypes were from patients in five countries in asia six haplotypes linked to h1 and two each linked to h3 and h1 respectively indicating the 12 patients were infected by different sources human-to-human transmissions may have happened from patients with h53 to h52 haplotypes in tokyo japan five australian samples encoding six haplotypes in groups b c and d were from patients of three states patients with h3 h25 and h26 and with h55 were in groups b and c respectively and human-to-human transmission might have happened from the patients with h25 to h26 who were in a same tour group in queensland aap reporters 2020 the connection between the patients with h56 and h27 is not clear one possibility is that there was an intermediary spreader with h56 who also transmitted sars-cov-2 to other patients in france the united states and taiwan province of china eight european samples encoding seven haplotypes were from patients in four countries the patients in england were reported as a household transmission from h28 to h29 lillie et al 2020 the patients in france may have been infected by three different sources ie h44 was linked to h1 h43 might link to h40 in chongqing singapore or somewhere else and h30 might link to an intermediary spreader with h56 of the 13 genomes from the united states three were from the same patient in washington encoding the same haplotype h38 while the other ten samples encoded eight haplotypes covering all five groups figure 3a b so the sources of infections are complicated there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission in the united states from these 11 cases to clarify the exact origins of these haplotypes outside china we need more epidemiological investigative efforts and more sars-cov-2 genomic data from patients at the early stage of transmissions
 epidemiological study of sars-cov-2 using traditional approaches is very difficult because it was not identified as a new coronavirus until 29 december and some infected people with mild symptoms or without symptoms heymann  shindo 2020 rothe et al 2020 wu  mcgoogan 2020 may have been overlooked in late november and early december evolutionary analyses suggested that the source of the h1 haplotype in the huanan market was imported from elsewhere as has been suggested by other researchers cohen 2020 the rooted network suggested that h13 and h38 should be ancestral haplotypes that connected to the outgroup bat-ratg13-cov through a hypothesized intermediate haplotype figure 5 the most common ancestral haplotype was missed because the currently available samples do not include the first identified infected patient and other patients from early december and because of the relatively high mutation rate of the viral genome if there are any frozen samples from those patients it would be worth doing genomic sequencing for phyloepidemiologic study to help to locate the birthplace of sars-cov-2 meanwhile we expect that the h13 and h38 haplotypes might be found in some samples from infected patients in wuhan or in other places across the world if more samples are sequenced in future this will be very helpful in the search for the original sources of sars-cov-2 because both h13 and h38 tend to be ancestral haplotypes
 the evolutionary network of haplotypes can be used to recover the directions of human-to-human transmissions at the local scale and spread at the larger scale the central haplotype can be considered as the super-spreader haplotype and the tip haplotype is the most recent descendant similar to the definition and use of mtdna haplogroups in tracing human demographic history yao et al 2002 the transmission direction can be identified using the connection information of tips and branches for example the confirmed patients from the huanan market shared the common ancestral haplotype h1 indicating they might be infected from a common source who may have been a super-spreader in the market this approach has recovered potentially specific directions of human-to-human transmission in the shenzhen family h13  h14 the queensland tour group h25  h26 the england family h28  h29 and the japanese h53  h52 it is possible that some infections could link to wuhan or hubei directly or indirectly because the patients claimed connections to wuhan or hubei but for some of them it is not clear exactly where they were infected we suspect that there were super-spreaders mediating the spread of sars-cov-2 at the early stage of transmissions
 our findings showed that sars-cov-2 has not had legitimate recombination thus the haplotype-based phyloepidemiologic analyses provide a powerful way to understand the evolution of sars-cov-2 at the very early stage of transmission when reverse mutations and illegitimate recombination are rare in our analysis recombination is rejected but the outgroup bat-ratg13-cov is relatively highly diverged from sars-cov-2 haplotypes which may affect the phyloepidemiologic analyses based on the estimated mutation rate of current sars-cov-2 viruses the reverse mutations should be 6103 092103092103 per site per year29 358 sites212 year with a neglectable influence on our result but our observations leave one important question why are ancestral haplotypes like h13 and h38 less frequent than h1 it is highly possible that h1 acquired adaptive mutations such as ns of site 28151 from h3 or h13 andor h38 evolved in an independent circulation after they jumped into intermediate hosts or directly transmitted to humans which should be investigated in future studies if more early genome datasets are available the exact original sources of h13 and h38 will stay as unsolved mysteries if the early stage samples were not preserved
 an early version of our manuscript was posted at chinaxiv doi 101207420200200033 on 19 february 2020 since then there have been many news stories stemming from our manuscript with a biased interpretation of the results this is beyond our expectation during the review of this manuscript there were some reports of analyses of sars-cov-2 genomic variations based on a larger sample size eg forster et al 2020 tang et al 2020 which showed a similar phylogenetic pattern as we present here we expect more data-mining of the increasing number of sars-cov-2 genomes will provide updated insights into the origin and transmission of this virus

the germplasm bank of wild species kunming institute of botany chinese academy of sciences  preparing for the next wave of covid-19 resilience in the face of a spreading pandemic gerald steiner lukas zenk eva schernhammer   the multi-dimensional corollaries of covid-19 comprise effects on health and wellbeing as well as economic financial political legal institutional sociocultural technological and ecological consequences within societal systems 1 a sufficient understanding of such highly interlinked system influences and uncertainties requires broad interdisciplinary cooperation and a systems science approach as a common platform for knowledge integration and discourse between disciplines ie interdisciplinarity as well as the involvement of citizens and relevant experts from practice ie transdisciplinarity covid-19 painfully demonstrates that societies decision makers and scientists lack 1 a comprehensive understanding of the complexity of viral outbreaks and their impact on society 2 effective intervention portfolios and 3 a global crisis and resilience policy in order to develop appropriate measures and thereby enhance societal resilience as a crucial first step we highlight the necessary understanding and develop initial scenarios regarding covid-19 immunity as one key benchmark for a possible intervention portfolio building on the authors combined expertise and integrated knowledge in systems science network science and epidemiology while immersed in the first wave of the covid-19 pandemic much uncertainty surrounding the behavior of this pathogen remains a few guiding principles can help define and better understand the severity and uncertainties of any epidemic outbreak the 1 basic reproduction number r0 2 lethality associated with the pathogen eg the case fatality rate measured as the proportion of infected persons who die from the infection 3 the duration of its incubation period eg the time between exposure to the infectious agent and the appearance of first symptoms and 4 the number of individuals immune to the pathogen in a given population the basic reproduction number r0 provides a sense of the speed at which a disease spreads ie its contagiousness if one person on average infects just one other person r0  1 if one person infects on average two other persons r0  2 and so forth any r0  1 has the potential to lead to an outbreak as the number of cases is prone to increase for covid-19 r0 is currently assumed to fall between 1535 23 covid-19s r0 contrasts with the r0 of for example measles 120 4 the flu 1222 5 or ebola 20 6 this brings us to the second guiding principle to appraise the severity of an outbreak the lethality of a given pathogen for example while the high r0 of measles implies that many people will become infected its mortality eg case fatality rate is low 02 in contrast to ebola which has a much smaller r0 and hence is less contagious but which is far deadlier mortality rate 220880 for covid-19 projections from china 7 with some variation 8 indicate a 23 case fatality rate third the incubation period of covid-19 median 51 days spanning up to 156 days 9 is unfavorable compared to that of 12 days for the flu fourth because covid-19 is new the virus can potentially spread unchecked in a global population with essentially 100 susceptibility eg due to no source of prior immunity together these factors implicate covid-19 as a serious global threat mitigating factors that could slow the spread of transmission and lower the r0 include the availability of measures to control the disease eg vaccines or the level of immunity acquired in a population of note the proportion of susceptible in the population has implications for the r0 the term effective reproduction number er0 factors population susceptibility into the estimation of the number of new individuals that an infected person can infect er0 can readily be estimated using the formula er0  r0x where x is the fraction of the host population that is susceptible for example if r0 for measles is 12 where half of the population is immune the er0 for measles is 12  05  6 a single case of measles would produce an average of 6 not 12 new secondary cases conversely the herd immunity threshold r0  1r0 is the proportion of a population that must be immune in order for an infectious disease to reach r0  1 and thus stopping its spread for covid-19 to reach r0  1 with a conservatively estimated r0 of 15 33 of the population must be immune and if r0  35 at least 71 of a given population must be immune for the infection to stop spreading additional influencing factors include eg environmental factors population density cultural norms health status or average population age experience from previous outbreaks suggests another important phenomenon for the derivation of r0 the super-spreaders 1011 limited evidence is available to address how these super-spreaders could be identified to include them in and thus refine predictive models 101213 several super-spreader factors have been suggested to define their infectivity including host factors eg their immune system or behavior pathogen factors eg virulence and environmental factors eg crowding 10 from a social network perspective individuals are embedded in diverse social interactions 14 which evolve over time and can be simulated in network scenarios in the context of viral spreads the most crucial social interaction is the physical contact of people and its impact on the probability of viral transmission 15 in this regard health care providers including hospitals or care facilities are central health care professionals hcps of whom up to 20 are said to be infected with covid-19 16 can be considered super-spreaders 1718 they have close physical contact with a high number of persons degree centrality particularly with other highly-connected hcps eigenvector centrality as well asimportantlywith patients in poor health in a setting where physical distancing is not feasible moreover they are often required to continue working during outbreaks which increases the risk of infection and downstream consequences in the following we show two scenarios of social networks in the context of health care providers at the beginning of the viral spread and over time with increasing immunization see figure 1 in the first scenario we focus on an entire organization in the second on a small department for each scenario we distinguish between two conditions under condition a hcps can be infected by the virus eg because they have not acquired immunity yet or were not otherwise well protected under condition b hcps cannot be infected or infect others eg due to previous infection vaccinationwhich does not exist for covid-19 so farandor taking appropriate protective measures such as using personal protective equipment ppe in scenario 1 ego networks we assume that various people are at a health care provider eg a hospital including hcps eg doctors nurses caregivers and non-hcps eg patients visitors hospital staff etc as a starting point time step  0 one hcp was infected with covid-19 in each of the following time steps time steps 15 eg weeks an hcp infects as a super-spreader 8 other persons 4 hcps and 4 non-hcps and a non-hcp infects 3 other non-hcps hypothetical r0  3 for covid-19 in scenario 1a a total of 265 persons were ultimately infected by the first hcp after only three time steps including 85 hcps the number of deaths is not considered in this model without the here-assumed system boundary of a 3-step ego network the beginning exponential growth of the virus would further increase in scenario 1b the virus is blocked by the immune hcps and cannot spread in a similar manner in total only 53 persons were infected including the first infected hcp in scenario 2 core periphery networks we further illustrate the power of immunity in hcps focusing on a small department within a given healthcare provider eg an intensive care unit including hcps only doctors and nurses and non-hcps only patients in this scenario hcps are connected to other hcps and patients patients are separated from each other and are only connected to hcps due to the physical proximity we assume that the virus will spread through the direct contacts in scenario 2a hcps are not immune or immunized and all 20 persons are infected after three time steps in scenario 2b we assume that all hcps with the exception of the first infected hcp are immune the infected hcp infects initially 4 patients but no other hcps as illustrated even in the next time steps no more persons are additionally infected and by the subsequent step all persons have either acquired immunity or have not become infected as demonstrated in our simplified network scenarios immunized or otherwise well-protected super-spreaders can be critical for effective local and possibly in the case of pandemic spread global health care reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr and antibody tests would enable the identification of infected hcps and those who acquired immunity to either 1 rapidly quarantine them thus preventing the infection and quarantine of a large number of additional hcps as well as patients or 2 help reintegrate them into epidemic hotspots where they can now safely contribute to the health care system as one measure within a comprehensive intervention portfolio immune hcps could serve as a virus task force without borders to help minimize the infection of additional super-spreaders eg susceptible hcps and thereby ward off the pandemic spread in other regions where they are needed see figure 2 in our network scenarios we oversimplify real-world problems and the complexity of social interactions for example we do not include weighted interactions probabilities of transmissions or event-based interactions over time and solid empirical data for covid-19 are lacking to enable a precise parameterization of the models however they represent a first attempt for inter- and transdisciplinary explorations of network analytical social interactions in vulnerable subsystems such as health care providers in the future more in-depth systemic analyses with empirical data collected over time are needed ultimately such analyses could inform sophisticated resilience management which is urgently needed to improve societys capacity to cope with similar threats in the future clearly in our interconnected world it will become more difficult to stop pathogens at national borders cooperation is more important than ever to tackle future societal challenges in an inter- and transdisciplinary manner by integrating the various capacities and adaptability of local regional and international societal systems to absorb and recover from major adverse events such resilience management extends far beyond current risk management 120  relationship between perception and anxiety about covid-19 infection and risk behaviors for spreading infection a national survey in japan akihiro shiina tomihisa niitsu osamu kobori keita idemoto tasuku hashimoto tsuyoshi sasaki yoshito igarashi eiji shimizu michiko nakazato kenji hashimoto masaomi iyo   a novel species of corona virus was identified as a cause of lethal pneumonia in december 2019 in china this virus rapidly expanded all over world in response to this deteriorating situation the world health organization who declared a pandemic state on march 11 2020 citizens in many countries are still facing the risk of serious diseases caused by the corona virus covid-19 the development of strategies for preventing the spread of this virus is needed according to the who 2020b covid-19 virus is transmitted during close contact through respiratory droplets such as coughing and by fomites therefore to limit virus transmission the who 2020b continues to recommend performing frequent hand hygiene using respiratory protection regularly cleaning and disinfecting surfaces maintaining physical distances and avoiding people with fever or respiratory symptoms the authorities have asked citizens to engage in several strategies as follows at the individual level frequent hand-washing is recommended facial protection eg a surgical mask and the use of disinfectant eg alcohol-based are also suggested in addition risky behaviors such as going to crowded spaces or traveling to endemic areas should be highly discouraged despite these efforts several cities have been locked down business insider 2020 in japan yuriko koike the tokyo governor has repeatedly called on residents to avoid going out on weekday evenings and on weekends since march 25 2020 reuters 2020 facing uncertain situations can increase peoples anxiety levels especially when there is potential risk for mortality this may lead to both healthy and vulnerable individuals engaging in protective behaviors shigemura et al 2020 cao et al reported that approximately one-fourth of college students demonstrated at least mild anxiety because of the covid-19 outbreak cao et al 2020 it is expected that fear of covid-19 will have a major impact on public mental health torales et al 2020 jones and salath 2009 reported that engagement in protective behaviors varies from person to person and may be affected by several factors eg self-reported anxiety over the epidemic recent studies have suggested the existence of super spreaders as the dominant source of the transmission of the novel corona virus li et al 2020 it is hypothesized that some super spreaders unintentionally carry the virus from place to place because of their hyper-activity kamel et al 2020 estimation of the potential risk-proportion in the community and understanding their cognitive and behavioral characteristics may help in developing epidemic control strategies however to our knowledge no report has investigated the proportion and characteristics of people who show risk behaviors including super spreaders we hypothesized that individuals with low levels of understanding and anxiety about the infection would not to exercise protective behaviors and therefore may be potential super spreaders clarifying the proportion of these super spreaders in the community and the sources of information they use regarding covid-19 infection will help in the development of strategies eg how to modify these behaviors to prevent further expansion of the epidemic on the basis of the research questions above we conducted a web-based cross-sectional study to clarify citizens perceptions and behaviors in the current covid-19 risk situation we asked cross marketing inc to recruit 4000 people participants had to have been a monitor of cross marketing inc at the beginning of the survey people who had been infected by covid-19 people whose relative was an employee of our institution and people who worked in a marketing industry were excluded cross marketing inc sent an invitation email to potential candidates of the survey people who were willing to participate spontaneously visited the website to answer the questionnaire with first-in-first-served basis completers were rewarded with cashable coupons duplicated answers were blocked by checking unique id of each participant see the appendix in which we disclosed the condition of this survey according to checklist for reporting results of internet e-surveys cherries we adopted the questions used in a previous report jones and salath 2009 but included new questions about anxiety levels regarding symptomatic aggravation and virus transmission to others in addition to the demographic information the questionnaire included several items covering the level of fear and anxiety about covid-19-related issues frequency of media exposure trust in each media source and frequency of anti-infection behaviors participants rated on scales from 1 nonenever to 9 extremelystrongest for the items regarding the knowledge about the symptoms preventive methods management and consulting services when infected the level of fear and anxiety and the frequency of anti-infection behaviors items regarding the frequency of media exposure and degree of trust in each media source were rated on scales from 1 almost nonenot at all to 5 verygreatly participants health anxiety depression and general anxiety were assessed by the japanese versions of the short health anxiety inventory shai yamauchi et al 2009 patient health questionnaire-9 phq-9 muramastu et al 2007 and generalized anxiety disorder-7 gad-7 muramatsu et al 2009 this study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of chiba university graduate school of medicine and the ethics committee of the international university of health and welfare before implementation participants were informed that their participation was voluntary we did not gather any personal information about the responders participants were rewarded according to the regulations of cross marketing inc the data analysis was conducted using spss for windows version 24 ibm corp armonk ny united states this study was conducted with a management grant provided by the ministry of education culture sport science and technology mecsst to chiba university graduate school of medicine and the japan society for the promotion of science jsps kakenhi grants to tn no jp19k08066 the mecsst and jsps had no role or control on the execution of this study between march 27 and 28 2020 a total of 4000 participants stratified by age 20s 30s 40s 50s over 60 years and gender 400 in each group took part in this study participants demographic data are presented in table 1
 citizens in all 47 prefectures in japan participated in this survey occupations of the participants were various approximately 10 of the participants were engaged in educationhealthcare only 1 or less had some family members or acquaintances who were infected by covid-19 prior to the statistical analyses we excluded invalid answers from the analysis because there might be some participants who took non-serious answers considering that participating in this survey would be rewarded we excluded the data of whom answered 1 on all 30 items of the main questions as a result 19 048 participants were excluded the remaining 3981 participants were subjected to the analysis the main findings from the results were as follows first 528 participants 133 had a low understanding of covid-19 ie rated 1 on the nine-point likert scale similarly 404 101 reported no anxiety of being infected in total 468 participants 117 were unconcerned about the risk they would transmit covid-19 to others and 430108 participants showed no worry about developing a serious condition if they were infected in addition 321 81 participants were not at all anxious about spreading infection fig 1
 the spearmans correlation coefficients of the knowledge of covid-19 to anxiety about being infected with covid-19 anxiety about infecting someone with covid-19 anxiety about severity when infected with covid-19 and anxiety about the spread of covid-19 infection were 0458 0438 0423 and 0488 respectively p  0001 for all we examined the difference of perception and anxiety between age groups over 60 y o group was more likely to understand covid-19 anova p  0001 they were also more anxious about worsening physical status when they got infected anova p  0001 similarly they were more anxious about the spread of covid-19 infection anova p  0001 on the other hand there were no statistically significant difference between age groups regarding the anxiety about being infected or infecting someone with covid-19 these results are shown in fig 2
 on the other hand participants who had someone infected by covid-19 understood more about covid-19 t-test p  005 as well participants whose occupation category was educationhealthcare understood more about covid-19 t-test p  0001 at the time of the survey hokkaido was the most affected prefecture where 318 per thousand were reported to be infected by covid-19 while iwate yamagata toyama tottori and shimane prefecture had experienced no cases we examined the difference between regions in citizens understanding of covid-19 we employed a correlation analysis to evaluate the association between the mean score of knowledge of covid-19 of the participants living in each prefecture and the number per capita of the reported patients infected by covid-19 as a result however there was no specific relationship found pearsons correlation  -02 p  0283 the dominant source of information about covid-19 was tv followed by online news and official announcements by the government in contrast radio and counseling by a specialist were rarely used regarding the credibility of each information source participants were likely to distrust social network services and also placed little trust in other information sources fig 3
 regarding the frequency of precautionary behaviors reported by participants most of the participants frequently washed their hands but 81 20 rated this item 1 or 2 on a scale from 1 not at all to 9 many times finally 168 participants 42 rated 1 or 2 on a scale from 1 never to 9 avoid greatly for the item avoiding crowded places fig 4
 the mean shai total score was 146 standard deviation sd  97 in addition the mean phq-9 total score was 51 sd  59 and the mean gad-7 total score was 34 sd  47 we conducted secondary analyses to clarify the characteristics of people who were not concerned about covid-19 we divided the participants into three groups according to their answer of the knowledge of covid-19 by their rating 1  3 low 4  6 mid and 7  9 high and compared their scores with those of other groups compared to other participants the low understanding group used any information sources listed in the questionnaire less frequently with the difference being statistically significant anova p  0001 in addition they tended not to trust information from any media organizations or individuals compared with other participants anova p  0001 most importantly they were significantly less likely to exercise protective behaviors than other participants anova p  0001 other than avoiding work or school compared to the mid understanding group anova with games howell correction p  0625 these results are shown in fig 5
 compared with other groups the low understanding group was less anxious about their own health as suggested by the difference in shai total scores 133 vs 145 vs 159 anova p  0001 in phq-9 total score there was also statistical significance between groups 56 vs 51 vs 46 anova p  0001 but there were no statistically significant differences between the three groups in gad-7 scores 349 vs 340 vs 325 anova p  0499 additionally we used a linear regression analysis with stepwise method to clarify the factors associated with the perception of covid-19 we set the degree of knowledge of covid-19 as the dependent variable age period educational history kinds of anxiety about covid-19 frequency of using and credibility of information sources and several protecting behaviors were set as independent variables the result is shown in table 2
 each kind of anxiety and sensitiveness to some information sources were associated with the level of knowledge of covid-19 also participants with deep knowledge of covid-19 were likely to wash hands frequently we conducted a nation-wide online survey involving 4000 citizens to investigate their understanding anxiety protective behaviors and access to information regarding covid-19 during march 27 and 28 2020 at the time of this investigation the spread of covid-19 in japan was limited to several areas but after a few days the number of the infected cases nationwide had begun to rise steeply we also evaluated participants levels of distress and functional impairment with the phq-9 their perceptions of health anxiety with the shai and their general anxiety with the gad-7 a previous study on the spread of infection suggested that media reports about the epidemic affected anxiety levels which in turn mediated protective behaviors jones and salath 2009 from the perspective of risk behavior for the spread of covid-19 we focused on participants who reported low understanding and anxiety regarding virus infection and found that they accounted for about 10 of all participants among these participants which were relatively young but included in all age groups we observed significantly higher proportions that reported adopting little protective behavior and rarely accessing with low levels of trust information sources compared with other participants furthermore this group showed a significantly lower level of health anxiety than the other participants although there were no differences in the levels of general anxiety between groups in contrast positive association between the degree of knowledge of covid-19 and anxiety about covid-19 related issues suggests the benefit for being anxious for precautionary behaviors though the relationship between them is complex wirtz 2019 positive association between the degree of understanding of covid-19 and washing hands suggests that proper knowledge is essential for people to motivate proper positive precautionary behaviors the fact personal protective equipment was being exhausted at the time of survey may explain why wearing a mask and using disinfectants were not associated with the degree of knowledge of covid-19 in the linear regression analysis the present findings showed the cycle of some citizens cognitive and behavioral profile in reference to health anxiety as a juxtaposed model rachman 2012 they were less likely to access news sources even if they were informed about the risks associated with covid-19 they tended not to trust information sources therefore they were less likely to worry about their health as suggested by the difference in the shai scores between the groups it may be that the lack of accurate information prevented these participants from being concerned about covid-19 due to lack of knowledge and anxiety they did not adopt precautionary behaviors such as hand washing and failed to recognize risks for infection or transmission in addition no experience of actually getting ill following risky behaviors may make this group more reckless furthermore even if such people were actually infected they may not modify their behaviors because 80 of carriers are asymptomatic or only show mild symptoms as noted by the who 2020a this is the first report on the estimation of the potential risk-proportion in the community and the related cognitive and behavioral characteristics if our hypothesis is correct enlightening individuals with low understanding properly is important to prevent further expansion of covid-19 infection our findings suggest that lack of accurate knowledge regarding the danger of covid-19 may be responsible for inappropriate behaviors education and information are necessary to modify risky behaviors in this context however they are less likely to access information sources therefore we have to fill this information gap using any means official and unofficial for protection against the pandemic there may be several limitations in this study this survey was conducted in the last weekend of march 2020 just before japan encountered explosive rising numbers of covid-19 infection in march 28 there were only 1452 patients of covid-19 reported but one week after it became doubled nipponcom 2020 the variation of the level of understanding in the community might have changed over the epidemic furthermore it is uncertain whether our results are applicable to countries other than japan our findings that older adult and highly educated groups were more anxious about covid-19 were consistent with a previous survey conducted in china qiu et al 2020 we are planning to conduct similar surveys in other regions moreover as this study was a web-based survey participants were limited to internet users in addition as we used convenience sampling the sample might have been biased to those who were willing to answer the questionnaire also some items of the questionnaire were introduced by us without any preceding studies their reliability and validity might be limited in japan some surveys similar to ours have also been conducted the reasons are unknown but cross marketing inc 2020 reported that only 3 of participants rated 1 very low concern on a seven-point likert scale regarding concern about covid-19 as the criteria and condition of participation and the content of the questionnaire in that survey differed from ours it is not possible to directly compare these results our results did not identify any super spreaders themselves but the possibility of them how many people of the participants are actually spreading the virus is uncertain but we anticipate it is certain that they include some non-symptomatic carriers according to the who report 2020a also we focused on their anxiety and behavioral characteristics as elements to identify potential super spreaders in this study reckless behaviors are also suggested to be highly associated with several biological factors isles 2019 but we have not examined any biomarkers of the participants further studies are needed to link our results to previous findings to clarify the role of biological factors in the pandemic situation even considering these limitations we believe our results are informative and worthy of consideration in policy making as soon as possible to control the current pandemic situation it should be emphasized that a considerable percentage of citizens can take risk behaviors without anxiety of infection continuous notification and enlightenment are indispensable for mitigating the risk of spreading virus for most nations we also should pay attention to awareness of social distance protective behaviors in public health modify the perception of infections potential risk behaviors of super spreaders this study was conducted with a management grant provided by the ministry of education culture sport science and technology mecsst to chiba university graduate school of medicine and the japan society for the promotion of science jsps kakenhi grants to tn no jp19k08066 the mecsst and jsps had no role or control on the execution of this study we have no conflict of interests regarding this study  eat pray work a meta-analysis of covid-19 transmission risk in common activities of work and leisure meher prakash k  background when the lockdowns are relaxed the responsibility of mitigating the covid-19 spread shifts from the governments to the individuals to know how to conduct one-self it is important for everyone to know the risks of transmission during the quotidian activitiesmeetings meals etc from individuals who are known to them and looking healthy methods the detailed case-studies corresponding to 425 infections upon point-exposures over a specified duration are curated the data from the case studies is summarized and reorganized to reflect different situations from the daily life a meta-analysis of the attack rates of transmission and the number of infections per infected person are performed results the attack rates are very high in family dinners 667 488-808 compared to sit-down dinners with lesser mixing among people eating at different tables 157 121-201 both lasting a couple of hours in an open workspace office floor organized in a twohalf structure with shared elevators and restrooms and the employees speaking continuously the average attack rate over the course of a few days was much higher in one half 787 703-853 than the one for the entire floor 435 370-501 inferred data suggests that the transmission in elevators and trains may be lower under the conditions of using masks in most of the instances we studied the infected individuals spreading 3544 and even super-spreading 36 were mostly without symptoms of coughing sneezing or a fever conclusions although the basic reproduction number r0 is around 30 the number of infections caused including the super-spreading events seem to be limited by the number of personal interactions in a group and their proximity by acknowledging the risks in daily life from healthy-looking persons one may be able to organize their interactions better to reduce the chances of spreading or super-spreading infections  for the past few months many individuals felt at war with the government as if the policies for covid-19 mitigation did not concern them with an intent to restart the economies the mitigation measures are being relaxed despite the fears of a second wave as the individual desire to go back to normal life grows stronger the responsibility of mitigating shifts from the government to the individuals although the epidemiologists underscore that one should embrace the new-normal most of the community neither understands nor appreciates what it is in the past months since the breakout of the covid-19 pandemic everyone has been hearing two things very regularly a very high number of global infections which is more than 5 million at this stage and that one should practice social distancing to mitigate these effects 1  at times one also hears positive reports about containment from the epidemiologists that the r0 the basic reproduction number that signifies how many new infections can be caused by an infected person is reducing due to social distancing measures among all these average descriptors and predictive models one does not have a feeling for how the infections spread and how high the chance of covid-19 transmission is since there is no vaccine in sight no slowing down of covid-19 infections in hot countries one has to acknowledge the nature of the disease and its transmission and learn to live the new-normal the transmission risks in person-to-person interactions have been graded by the centers for disease control and have served as general guidelines 2 living in a same household as an intimate partner of a covid-19 positive patient high risk being within 6 feet or around 2 meters from a symptomatic laboratory-confirmed person medium risk being in the same indoor environments including classrooms hospital waiting rooms for a prolonged period with no close contact low risk as one tries to translate these recommendations and apply them to their own daily lives clearly visiting wet markets with live animals or patients hospitalized with respiratory illnesses indicate the highest level of risk but barring those exceptional situations how much risk of covid-19 transmission lies in common activities one performs a question that sounds pessimistic in the first pass if an acquaintance is not sneezing or coughing is there a risk in meeting with them in close proximity even if one person is infected at a party if r0 of covid-19 is around 3 3 is there a chance of more than 3 new infections some of the studies attempted to perform an overall assessment of primary and secondary attack rates 4 or classify the total number of infections by profession 5  which is very different from the goal we wish to accomplish about the chance of transmitting infections during different daily activities answering these questions requires in a way to redesign daily interactions requires a detailed investigation of the circumstances and activities under which covid-19 spreads the information pertaining to the spread and containment of covid-19 infections is usually available at three levels of granularity societal level the total number of infections in a state or a country has been a commonly reported metric as countries risked overwhelming of health care resources there have been several recommendations for the containment of the infections using lockdowns 6  epidemiological data 7 where the exponential growth reduced in intensity to a subexponential growth confirmed the efficacy of lockdowns more interestingly a detailed townwide testing of the entire village of vo italy 8 on multiple occasions following a lockdown clearly demonstrated that if the individuals are isolated new infections outside households can be stopped honing in one level finer one hears about an incident or a person that triggered a series of infections dubbed as a cluster for example a cluster of around 5000 infections arose in multiple transmission generations from an infected person attending a church in south korea as the first wave of the pandemic in south korea comes to an end this cluster still accounts for more than 45 of the overall infections a few contact tracing studies provide a closer look into the contacts such whether it happened during a meal at a church or in a household 4 or have detailed the number of infections at different workplaces 5  however much of the information publicly known information is available at a topological level in the language of graph theory meaning person a infected person b after a contact the contact could mean a continuous exposure such as two people living together in the same household known as the familial clusters or a point-exposure which signifies a specific interaction instance over a well-defined of time spent together individual level at the extremely detailed level many scientific studies focused on the individual case records of the patient-0 or the index-patient -to understand instances of local transmission or to summarize presenting their clinical and virological characteristics 9 as well as to compare the mutations clearly individual case-studies are the very personal and educational our goal in this work is to gain insights from the handful of documented transmission events among the 5 million infections to assist in assuming a sense of individual responsibility or help modelling efforts however compiling and analysing the infection transmission records is not easy as many do not know where they contracted the infections from because there are too many infections in town or because their transmitter was asymptomatic 10 and others who know how they contracted the infection may consider it a violation of their privacy to disclose it in early days of covid-19 infections many countries investigated and even published the detailed of records that attempted to understand whether the cases were imported from abroad or were a result of a local transmission in countries such as south-korea or singapore which have performed extensive contact tracing and detailed transmission chains are constructed however the publicly available transmission accounts still date back to the early days of infections along with some recent accounts of super-spreading individuals or events we consolidate the information that is publicly available to weigh the risks of transmission in daily life a literature search was performed in google medrxiv and web of science using the key words index patient case patient patient-0 covid-19 sars-cov-2 the search was further refined with a special emphasis on articles published in cdc lancet nejm in the instances itaewon cluster birthday parties in pasadena and connecticut where the articles were in news media rather than the scientific articles the data was substantiated using press releases from the governments and alternative sources the data was included into our analysis if a detailed case history with a point source of infection and a well-defined duration of exposure could be identified detailed case studies from the countries where contact tracing was employed singapore and south korea were used as well if within the selected articles if the details of the quality of the interaction or the duration of the stay together were not described or cannot be inferred they were excluded this applied to exclusion of articles as well as exclusion of some cases within the selected articles from which household transmission cases were excluded indirect transmissions either through unknown contacts and asymptomatic individuals or possibly through fomites 11 and aersols 12  where a clear interaction between individuals could not be identified were also excluded in a sense a hospital is a high risk environment at least two index cases in our curated data contracted the infection while visiting their respective relatives in hospitals 13 14  at the same time no secondary infections were caused by a patient in 53 bed ward to any of the 71 staff and 49 patient contacts seven staff and 10 patients considered close contacts 15  the possible reasons in this case are that the patient had been symptomatic for about a week before the hospitalization and hence has a lower infectiousness 16 17 or the patient remained in oxygenation for 185 out of 35 hour stay in the ward and other contacts had used varying levels of personal protective equipment 15  data on the infections in hospitals is thus scarce and hard to interpret unless it is extremely detailed and is not analysed in this work which focuses on everyday activities several cases which in a sense seem obvious cases of high transmission risk but carry few recorded details were excluded -travel to wuhan of a family of 6 of which 2 spent overnight at a wuhan hospital treating one of their relatives for febrile pneumonia 13 a person contracting the infection while visiting a hospitalized family member in wuhan and eventually transmitting it to her husband with whom she shared meals and bed for many days and the 119 34 medium to high risk contacts that the couple had but they neither resulted positive nor are described in detail 14  there have been many journalistic accounts of the spread of infections in italy at a soccer match but the number of infections to start with the chances of other sources of infections and the time when a majority started showing symptoms could not be identified and hence excluded from the study cruise ships and war ships on the other hand present a well-defined duration of isolation from the land although very long and present an interesting case and are treated separately case history summaries the curated data from different articles 18-31 is summarized supplementary information as 20 situations where possible the original labelling used for defining the patients patient 0 patient 1  or patient a11 a21  has been preserved in order to making the retracing of the accounts in the original articles easy the case summary situations were further subdivided for classification into different types of instances of these 20 situations 418 infections occurred on 32 instances and caused by 44 infected individuals were identified these instances or the infections do not include the data from the cruiseships which was analysed separately the separate instances from these casesummaries reflecting the different activities one is likely to perform were gathered and analysed in the supplementary tables 1 to 8 a final summary of the attack rates inferred from these supplementary tables is presented in table 1  among all the 44 individuals spreading the infections in these 32 instances only 8 individuals had mild symptoms and contributed to about 113 of the 418 infections the case studies where we could identify a point-exposure to an infected person on a specific occasion and for a well-defined duration center around meals meetings and singing events either for recreation or religion the attack rates are defined as the fraction of susceptible individuals who after coming in contact with the infected individuals also got infected the susceptible individuals are the ones that are truly likely to come in contact such as people working in the same floor or eating at the same table rather than individuals in other floors of a building which is poorly connected the detailed transmission risks for each scenario are given are categorized under 4 broad headswork place interactions activities of leisure family events and related to mobility  table 1  each of these categories has several events with high-risk of transmission short private meetings lasting 1 hour in a work place have a very high transmission rate 727 436-980 comparable to working together on the same open floor where there is sufficient movement of people 787 ci 703-853 practicing singing in a group for around 2 hours along with a high mixing interactions in the group had a very high transmission rate 869 ci762-932 whereas singing and gathering in very large groups with close interactions with neighbors and otherwise not much mixing such as in prayer services resulted in 1-7 infections by several index-patients traveling in a car with a family member by talking has a very high risk 100 ci20-100 while traveling in metro trains with masks and possibly no talking has the lowest risk 0 in quick summary whenever a high quality of person to person interaction is possible the chance of spreading infection is much higher than 60 none of these results go against the standard recommendations of social distancing however they clarify the nature and duration of the interactions and quantify the transmission rates in pandemics it is always important to understand how the superspreaders can be identified and stopped 32  among the data analysed if one gathers the number of infections caused by different people in a given instance the median of these numbers results to be 25 supplementary table 9  as expected from the basic reproduction rate r0 of covid-19 3  with this validation we examine the curated data for the superspreaders super-spreaders is a qualitative term and in this work we consider anyone spreading more than 3 r0 infections as a super spreader among the 44 individuals who caused infections six super-spreaders could be identified which curiously fall in two groups -a infections on multiple occasions -patient 31 in south korea who infected 7 at the church s12a and 10 others in different occasions and different days s12b patient a11 who attended the funeral in chicago who caused 3 infections at the funeral s18a and 7 others at the birthday party 3 days later s18b b infections on a single occasion -6 in the alpine vacation s10 51 infections caused at the choir in washington s14 36 infections caused at the dinner in safra jurong s6 and 94 infections caused by the two attended 5 night clubs s17b the index patients at the funeral in chicago the dinner at safra jurong and choir in washington had mild respiratory symptoms and in the other three cases did not have any symptoms when they infected others in general various estimates suggest that the infectiousness drops significantly once the symptoms develop 16 17  however there may be exceptions and an individual may continue to spread infection on multiple days at the same time any person with a common level of infectiousness and without symptoms can become a super-spreader by having very close interactions with many people or actively mixing in large congregations there was also a situation of a teacher who attended one of the itaewon nightclubs s17c in discussion and spread infection to at least 15 individuals including 6 students however the detailed interactions are not known and hence not analyzed by taking a look at the super-spreading events in the curated data it is clear that number of infections caused in an instance is limited by the number of people one directly interacts with in close proximity underscoring the possibility that anyone can become a super-spreader if sufficient care is not exercised this rationale is also the microscopic equivalent which moots the arguments that use per-capita infections across the countries to compare not the overall well-being but rather the rates of infections whether it is the spread of infections among the individuals in a gathering or in a country what matter is the number of susceptible people that are truly likely to come in contact with the infected individuals and the quality of those interactions role of physical separation within the data we analysed one clearly sees the mixing of the people coming closer together has a strong influence on the spread of infections much in line with the general social distancing recommendations consider the difference in the attack rate between the family dinners 667 ci488-808 and birthday parties which can be imagined to be more personal with stronger physical interactions compared to the sit-down dinners where the people move around much lesser 157 ci121-201  table 1 transmission in transports and possible role of talking the only known instance of a family member driving together and passing on the infection s4a clearly shows that proximity in a closed environment and possible talking play an important role there could be many reasons behind it such as loud talking or singing which can emit aerosols 33 comparable in amount to coughing as was seen in the spread of tuberculosis 34 and assist the spread of covid-19 35  but such analysis is out of the scope of this work the present work focused on the known case histories of people interacting with others either at home or at work and one common theme among all these interactions is talking even more than any documented evidences of physical contact through hand-shakes thus by construction the data chosen does not have situations where people did not talk however two pieces of data are worth inferring from the study on the south korean call center although the elevators were shared by individuals from all floors the infections that spread over a few days were confined mainly to floor number 11 s2a s2e secondly the call center in south korea is close to two major metro stations and many employees use these services there was a chance that the infections could have spread to people sharing the metro services which is not an easy to track data however the first infection in the call center was reported on march 8 and the total number of infections from seoul in the march 7-march 14 is 139 which leaves at most 42 infections outside the 97 infections related to the call center cluster given the numbers of thousands of susceptible people that will be exposed in the metro trains to a significant fraction considered to be roughly 05x97 for the sake of this discussion 42 infections even if they were all assigned to the call center cluster still suggests a very low attack rate thus the attack rate in the elevators and the metro trains may be considered almost negligible under the conditions the south koreans usually travel with masks symptomatic versus asymptomatic infectees an infrared scan of temperature was commonly used to quickly screen for covid-19 patients however in many occasions safra jurong dinner in singapore s6 night club cluster in south korea s17 there is documented  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 24 2020  evidence that every visitor was asked the mandatory questions about their travel history and their temperature was checked and yet infections spread in the data we analysed only on 6 instances index patients showed mild symptoms compared to 38 instances where the index patient did not show any symptoms of cough sneezing or fever until a few days later as noted earlier even among the super-spreaders 2 were symptomatic and 4 asymptomatic  which is an important warning against underestimating the risks from seemingly healthy individuals this argument which aligns with the estimation that 44-68 of infections are passed on in the pre-symptomatic phase 16 17  cruises time spent on a cruise or a ship partly qualifies for our eligibility criteria -the vacation is long and lasts a few weeks and not a common activity that fits naturally into the daily activities however during this long stay on board there are no new sources of infection as it is completely isolated from the coast and the infections continue to spread starting with a mostly unknown number of index patients regardless since the data from three different different ships 2 of defense and 1 of vacation was available s20 we analysed it over all the attack rate in the few weeks is 281 273-290 which is surprisingly much lower than the infection rate in most of the personal interactions we studied in this work the passengersstaff may have been segregated in different decks which may have slowed the infection rate unique instances among the data analysed there are several other daily situations which are very unique one would like to have more studies such as infection spread in a working space which is not a call center and hence did not involve too much talking transmission or lack of it when driving together in a car with and without talking the spread of infections in a class room setting etc although there are reported instances of teacher in itaewon cluster who spread infections to 15 including of his students s17c and dancing event at the dinner where the lion dance troupe clothed in costumes with no new infections s3d more detailed information is required to evaluate the risks in these situations in conclusion by curating and categorizing the data according to the daily activities we could quantify the risk of transmission in these different settings these transmission risks when attending meetings dinners with healthy-looking infected individuals are surprisingly high in a sensitive phase when the responsibility of covid-19 mitigation shifts from the governments to the individuals the analysis underscores the need not to lower the guard as a healthy looking normal infected individual can turn out to be a super-spreader if she makes sufficient contacts with large number of individuals in one event  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it

releases mention that 94 infections are caused during may 2-3 among the club-goers in addition to more than 90 secondary infections we infer that most if not all of these 94 primary cases may be attributable to the couple of friends the reasons being that they visited they were in 2 and visited 5 different heavily crowded places which already is likely to create sufficient new infections the chance that others who were infected on may 2 early hours became infectious and visited the clubs again on may 3 early hours makes it less likely that the 94 infections were caused by individuals

2020   testing for covid-19 willful ignorance or selfless behavior linda thunstrm madison ashworth jason shogren f stephen newbold david finnoff   covid-19 rapidly developed into a pandemic and by 26 march 2020 the usa had the highest reported number of infected people in the world a general message from public health experts is that effective control of the spread of covid-19 requires widespread medical testing who 2020 the testing will serve to determine whether people are infected or not and ideally also if they have been infected and have reached immunity status three reasons motivate widespread testing first if a person learns that they are infected they can take appropriate measures to reduce the probability of infecting others such as the recommended 14-day self-isolation harvard medical school 2020 second the data provided by widespread testing will better inform the need for the current social distancing policies eg sheltering at home avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people keeping at least 6 feet away from other people and temporarily closing schools universities daycare centers major sports leagues cultural events and public spaces stock 2020 third testing provides data about the asymptomatic rate in the usa the share of infected people who show no or very mild symptoms and insight into how close americans are to developing herd immunity to covid-19 this information is useful in order to determine when and where it makes sense to relax these costly social distancing measures while the usa has increased its capacity to conduct more testing around 18 of the population had been tested by 30 april 2020 covid tracking project 2020 the effectiveness of testing in controlling covid-19 depends largely on how the tests are conducted the ideal scenario is to test everyone but that is infeasible a second-best scenario is random sample testing stock 2020 but for random testing to be effective all sampled people would either need to voluntarily agree to be tested which is unlikely as we explain or be forced to do so which is illegal in the usa the third-best and first-best feasible strategy is voluntary random testing this strategy however could lead to a systematic selection bias  we will only test those individuals who prefer to learn their health status regarding covid-19 a significant fraction of people might not want to know these individuals might find that their private costs outweigh any social benefits from not infecting others this implies that they might want to avoid testing if their private costs include above-average opportunity costs of social interactions then individuals who decline to be tested may also be disproportionately likely to become super-spreaders to understand why this might happen consider the ongoing literature on willful ignorance of health information also called strategic ignorance while standard economic theory suggests people never ignore information that enables them to adjust behavior stigler 1961 many new studies find that people willfully ignore medical diagnoses even when such knowledge would enable them to adjust behavior to better accommodate their health condition sharot  sunstein 2020 for example we see willful ignorance in many people at risk for breast cancer thompson et al 2002 alzheimers disease cutler  hodgson 2003 hiv hightow et al 2003 and huntingtons disease oster et al 2013 the study by ganguly and tasoff 2017 is particularly relevant they observe people will avoid a costless test for herpes  a disease for which there is currently no cure but for which information is useful in that it helps adjust behavior people have also been found to willfully ignore health risk information such as calories in food thunstrm et al 2016 woolley  risen 2018 sunstein 2019 thunstrm 2019 nordstrm et al 2020 willful ignorance of health outcomes is likely to arise when people are torn between what they think they should do and what they want to do thunstrm 2016 woolley  risen 2018 or when ignorance allows them to form optimal expectations downplay the probability of a bad health outcome oster et al 2013 nordstrm et al 2020 for instance a person may think she should eat healthy but want to indulge in ice-creamshe might then choose to avoid learning about the exact amount of calories in the ice-cream in order to avoid either her inner pressure to reduce the ice-cream consumption or the guilt from consuming it despite being aware of the calorie content in this paper we explore self-selection in covid-19 testing in the usa we examine if people willfully avoid getting tested for covid-19 and if so what individual or household characteristics and circumstances are associated with testing avoidance given that random voluntary testing is not yet available in the usa there are no observational data to rely on for our analysis we therefore design a hypothetical randomized controlled trial rct we recruit a nationally representative sample of 1000 participants the study entails two treatments across which we vary information about the potential emotional cost of testing before asking if participants would agree or disagree to a financially costless covid-19 test in the baseline treatment we inform participants that if they are found to be infected they are urged to self-isolate at home for 14 days in the high-cost treatment we tell participants that those who test positive are strongly urged to self-isolate which may be in a self-quarantine site away from home we assume the test itself is costless and that the only cost incurred from a covid-19 test is the recommended self-isolation for 14 days should the test come back positive if people are concerned only with their private benefits and costs from taking a covid-19 test those with large private benefits and low private costs from knowing that they are infected will be the most likely to get tested private benefits are significant for people at elevated risk for severe health consequences if they contract the virus or with family members at higher risk while private costs are low for those who generally live a solitary life professionally and in private we expect elderly and those who have  or have a family member that has  pre-existing conditions to be more willing to test furthermore we expect those at the lowest risk of losing out financially eg risk to labor income or health care costs or emotionally from self-isolating ie if they are introverts who attach a low value to social interactions to be the most willing to get tested for covid-19 in contrast if people are concerned only with social benefits and costs we would expect those most at risk of exposing others to be the most likely to get tested eg potential super-spreaders ie people with jobs that entail mixing with other people people living in urban areas young people and people who are extroverts and attach a high value to social interactions people with the potential to be super-spreaders might be torn about learning whether they are infected by covid-19 both private costs and social benefits from being urged to self-isolate for the next 14 days harvard medical school 2020 might be high for this group and so influence their testing decision in opposite directions for example consider the behavior of an extrovert who values social interactions highly if unsure of being infected the extrovert behaves just as if she is not infected eg as found for huntingtons disease by oster et al 2013 self-isolation means this person needs to give up highly valued social interactions  a factor that might deter them from a voluntary test for covid-19 at the same time their self-isolation provides particularly meaningful private and social health benefits from reduction in exposure to and spread of the disease these benefits to learning whether they are infected might encourage them to voluntarily test it is an open question if the benefits outweigh the costs causing the extrovert to take a costless covid-19 test similarly imagine a store clerk who risks losing income if self-isolating for 14 days the potential private loss of income would deter them from testing while the social benefits from reducing disease spread would encourage taking the test again the decision to test becomes an open question previous studies show that willful ignorance arises when prosocial behavior is privately costly dana et al 2007 conrads  irlenbusch 2013 onwezen  van der weele 2016 gigerenzer  garcia-retamero 2017 grossman  van der weele 2017 in this study we find that around 70 of people want to take a costless covid-19 test as might be expected people who worry more about their health are particularly likely to want to take the test we also find that those most likely to want to take the test are those most likely to spread the virus if unaware of their infection including young people and extroverts with a preference for socializing extroverts might also be at the highest risk for being infected but even when we control for personal risks amount of social interactions and worry about own health we find they are more willing to test the ability to afford to self-isolate for 14 days does not seem to affect the willingness to test our results suggest that there is a significant amount of selflessness in the decision to test people appear to be highly concerned about the social benefits from testing for covid-19 and little concerned about private costs in addition we do not find the expected treatment effect of our experimental manipulation of the private cost to testing ie the location of self-isolation at home or in a facility away from home does not seem to matter to the testing decision our expectation was that willful ignorance would be higher if self-isolation might take place away from home since we assume self-isolation away from home is perceived as more costly one interpretation of the lack of expected treatment effect is that it lends further support to the idea that private costs play a negligible role in the decision to test for covid-19 our results matter because they underscore the value of widespread covid-19 testing even if such testing cannot be done randomly our findings suggest that widely available and costless voluntary testing will target rather than scare off those most likely to be super-spreaders to test peoples willingness to take a financially costless covid-19 test we designed a hypothetical field experiment the experiment is a rct with a between-subjects design consisting of two treatments in the first treatment treatment baseline participants were told they would be urged to self-isolate at home if having tested positive in the second treatment treatment high cost they were told they might be urged to self-isolate at a special site away from home participants n  1000 were recruited by the research firm qualtrics and the sample was required to be nationally representative along the dimensions of gender age education race income and residential region east west north or south while the recruitment costs from qualtrics are higher than when recruiting from amazon mechanical turk or turk prime qualtrics continuously quality checks participants which enabled us to avoid many issues that may otherwise contaminate online panels eg see chandler  paolacci 2017 sharpe wessling et al 2017 participants received standard qualtrics compensation to participate in a survey the sequence of the experimental study was as follows
step 1 all participants were asked screening questions at the front end of the survey about their gender age education race income and region in order to ensure the sample met us national quotas for those characteristicsstep 2 participants were asked whether they had already been tested for the covid-19 if yes they were asked why they got tested the outcome of the test how many days prior to survey participation they had taken the test and if the test was costly if no they were randomized into one of the two treatments and asked about their willingness to take a test specifically if in treatment baseline they received the following information
currently us authorities are working to test more people for the coronavirus legislators are urging people who test positive ie are found to be infected by the virus to self-isolate at home for 14 daysif in treatment high cost they were instead told
currently us authorities are working to test more people for the coronavirus legislators are urging people who test positive ie are found to be infected by the virus to self-isolate for 14 days some states have started building self-quarantine sites  sites where people who have the virus would be isolated for 14 days if people stay at those sites it is easier to ensure they comply with the guidelines to self-isolatethereafter participants in both treatments were asked
if you were given the opportunity to take a coronavirus test for free within the next 3 days would you take the test default alternatives to get or not get information have been shown to affect observed choices of ignorance grossman 2014 to avoid nudging participants toward any particular answer there was no default alternative participants needed to choose either yes i would take the test or no i would not take the test step 3 all participants were asked about their current level of social distancing how many people outside their household they had been within 6 feet of in the last 3 days how many gatherings with more than 10 people they had participated in and self-assessed level of compliance with social distancing they were also asked whether they supported the public recommendations for social distancing in general step 4 participants were asked questions about factors that might affect the perceived cost of a positive covid-19 test implying social isolation for 14 days as well as the perceived benefits from being able to make behavioral adjustments they were asked about their job situation job security and possibility of the main income provider in the household taking sick leave risk factors for contracting the virus eg living in a urban area working in a health care facility working in a grocery store or pharmacy risk factors for self or any children for suffering severe health consequences if contracting the virus eg underlying health conditions that increases the risk such as cancer obesity diabetes etc level of extraversion francis et al 1992 and social lifestyle step 5 participants were asked about religious belonging religiosity political affiliation and social and fiscal conservatism everett 2013 the full survey can be found in the online supplementary material of our total sample 103 participants stated that they had already been tested while 897 stated that they had not already been tested we asked those who had been tested for the primary reason they had taken the covid-19 test table 1 shows their answers as expected given the current prevailing strategy in the usa of focusing the limited testing on people who are symptomatic most people got tested because they themselves showed symptoms almost 55 or because someone close to them either showed symptoms or was diagnosed with covid-19 around 35 summary statistics for the 103 participants who had been tested before participating in our study are shown in the online supplementary material
 our analysis focuses on the 897 participants who stated that they had not been tested for covid-19 due to a coding error in the survey at the beginning of the data collection seven participants did not respond to the question on whether they were a business owner employed or unemployed we dropped these seven participants from our analysis and we were left with 890 observations table 2 presents the summary statistics for these participants unless otherwise stated all of the remaining analysis focuses on the results for this group of participants
 table 2 shows that 53 of participants who had not yet been tested for covid-19 are female the variable age describes a participants age in years and the mean age in our sample is 47 years the variable high-risk age is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if a person is aged 65 years or older table 2 shows that 16 of our participants are aged 65 years or older the variable rural area takes a value 1 if participants stated that they live in a rural area and 0 if they live in an urban area table 2 shows that 35 of our participants live in a rural area the variables emotional tolerance and financial tolerance are dummy variables that take the value 1 if the participant answered that the maximum time from the time of taking the survey heshe would be able to emotionally or financially sustain social distancing was 14 days or longer given the 14-day recommended time to self-isolate if you test positive for covid-19 these variables take the value 0 if their stated maximum time was 13 days or less table 2 shows that 84 of participants stated that they can afford to continue their current level of social distancing for 14 days or more while 87 stated that they can emotionally tolerate another 14 days or more of their current level of social distancing the variable lifestyle impact  healthy is an index that measures the extent to which social distancing has changed participants behavior in a healthier direction participants were assigned a value 1 for each of the following if they stated that social distancing had a increased consumption of vegetables b decreased in-between-meals snacking excluding fruits and vegetables c increased time spent in green spaces d increased time spent doing strenuous or e moderate exercising and f reduced stress this variable could take a value between 0 and 6 where higher values represent healthier changes the variable lifestyle impact  unhealthy is an index that measures the extent to which social distancing has changed behavior in an unhealthy direction participants were assigned a value 1 for each of the following if they stated that social distancing had a decreased consumption of vegetables b increased in-between-meals snacking excluding fruits and vegetables c decreased time spent in green spaces d decreased time spent doing strenuous or e moderate exercising and f increased stress this variable could also take a value between 0 and 6 where higher values represent a higher number of unhealthy changes the summary statistics in table 2 suggest that social distancing has led to more unhealthy behavior than it has healthy behavior as implied by the lower mean value of lifestyle impact  healthy we note however that these variables are crude measures of the lifestyle impact from social distancing where each change is given equal weight although some changes might have a more important health effect than others1 the variable business impact takes a value 1 if a participant is a business owner whose business has experienced negative impacts due to covid-19 such as their operation losing income going out of business or being at risk of going out of business the variable employer impact takes a value 1 if a participant is an employee and hisher employer has experienced a negative impact due to covid-19 such as their employer losing income or being at risk for going out of business if they had experienced pay cuts reduced working hours or were on unpaid leave as a result of the virus2
table 2 shows that of participants who are business owners or where until a month ago n  89 64 had experienced a negative impact on their business from covid-19 of participants who are employees or were until a month ago n  477 57 had experienced a negative impact on their job security payment or employer revenues the variable social distant compliant  6 feet measures how many people a participant has been close to in the last 3 days participants could state none 1 person 23 people 45 people 69 people 1015 people 1625 people 2650 people or more than 50 people we assigned participants the midpoint of the range they picked for those in the highest range 50 and more we assumed the same size interval as the second to highest interval ie we assumed an endpoint of the last interval equal to 75 people table 2 shows that the average number of people that participants had been close to during the last 3 days besides their household members was 576 although not reported in the table 2 the median was 25 the variable social distant compliant  groups measures how many times during the last 3 days a participant has been in a room with 10 or more people participants could state a value anywhere between zero and 5 or more times the median of this variable is 0 table 2 shows that participants on average had been in a room with 10 or more people around 05 times during the last 3 days the variable self health risk measures the sum of 10 underlying health conditions that would put the participant at higher risk for developing severe health consequences if becoming infected with covid-19 these health conditions include chronic respiratory conditions heart disease neurological conditions diabetes and obesity cdc 2020 the variable child health risk measures the same sum of underlying health conditions for a child in the household the variable worry about own health is based on the stated extent to which participants worry about their own health due to covid-19 where the value 0 indicates not at all and the value 3 indicates a lot the dummy variable insurance takes a value 1 if a participant states that heshe has private health insurance or is covered by medicare or medicaid and 0 if the participant stated not having any coverage table 2 shows that 69 of participants have insurance or medicare or medicaid coverage the dummy variables republican democrat and other political party take a value 1 if a participant identifies as republican democrat or neither and 0 otherwise about 34 of participants identify as republican 43 as democrat and 23 as other the variable extrovert is based on the extraversion scale developed by francis et al 1992 and includes participants answers to questions such as are you a talkative person and can you easily get some life into a rather dull party in addition to the extraversion scale we also asked participants to indicate their level of agreement with statements about their general social lifestyle such as my social life is very important to me and in my spare time my favorite thing to do is to spend time with friends if the participant answered yes to three or more of these questions they were assigned a 1 for the extrovert dummy variable the answers to these statements were however highly correlated with the extraversion scale so they were excluded from our analysis because they provided little or no additional information when we pool participants from both treatments who had not been tested prior to participating in our study n  897 we find that 69 of participants would be willing to take a costless covid-19 test3 we find no difference in shares of participants willing to test across treatments pearson 2 1619 p  0203 suggesting that the location of self-isolation at home or in a facility away from home in the event the test comes back positive is not an important determinant of peoples willingness to test for covid-19 not only is the treatment effect small it is also of the unexpected sign  the share of people willing to test if self-isolation would happen at home is smaller 67 than the share of people willing to test if self-isolation might happen at a facility away from home 71 if anything people might be slightly more inclined to test if a positive result could lead to isolation away from home potentially due to this also signaling the greater severity of the covid-19 situation but the size of the effect is too small for us to detect with our sample size we have ruled out that this absence of identifiable average effect masks any potentially rational heterogeneity in the population ie we have explored whether there exists a treatment effect for subgroups of the population such as those with children higher-quality homes as measured by income or health anxiety as measured by underlying health conditions one interpretation of the absence of treatment effect is that people assign little weight to the personal cost associated with the location of self-isolating when they decide on whether to take a covid-19 test we pool participants from both treatments and examine the determinants of willingness to test we estimate a probit model table 3 shows the resulting average marginal effects
 concerns about own health are captured by the variable worry about own health the results in table 3 imply that the more a person worries about their health due to covid-19 the more likely they are to take a test the inclusion of this variable in our model also renders the coefficient for the variable that measures underlying health conditions ie self health risk small and statistically insignificant if worry about own health is excluded from the regression self health risk has the expected positive and statistically significant effect on willingness to test we do not find that people with children who have underlying health conditions are more likely to take the test perhaps due to the expectation that people of young age are less affected this result remains robust if we recode the variable child health risk into a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if any child in the household has one or more underlying health conditions variables that affect a persons financial situation do not seem to matter to the willingness to take a covid-19 test in particular we do not find an effect from business impact or employer impact we examine the robustness of these findings to alternative measures of business and employer impact first we instead include the multitude of variables underlying business impact and employer impact in the regression model see footnote 2 but we do not find an effect from any of those variables that is close to statistically significant at even the 10 level furthermore we do not find an effect on willingness to test from financial tolerance second we recode the variables such that they range from little impact to severe impact ranging from if a business owner or employee has experienced no adverse effects from covid-19 to one or multiple effects again we find no statistically significant effects from these variables on the willingness to test taken together these results suggest that people do not consider their own private costs from a positive test when deciding on taking a covid-19 test similarly we find no effect on the willingness to test from emotional tolerance implying that the private emotional cost from social isolation in the event of a positive test might not affect the decision to take a covid-19 test we find that healthy younger people are more likely to take a test than healthy older people as implied by the negative parameter estimate for high-risk age this age effect is consistent with findings in other studies that observe older people avoid health-related information more than younger people thunstrm et al 2016 gigerenzer  garcia-retamero 2017 while this result could imply that older people are more likely to be willfully ignorant it is also in line with the idea that those with more social interactions younger people are more likely to get tested studies find that people below 60 years old have more social contacts and therefore are more likely to transmit infectious diseases mossong et al 2008 furthermore we find that those who have met more people during the last 3 days are more willing to take the test as suggested by the negative parameter estimate for social distance compliant  6 feet furthermore the potential super-spreaders  the extroverts  are more likely by 8 to take a test compared to the introverts taken together this suggests that social benefits weight heavily in peoples decisions to test those most at risk to spread covid-19 are the most willing to get tested we find that republicans are 13 less likely than democrats to get tested we speculate that this might be due to different information sources and because the risks of covid-19 might be portrayed differently in liberal and conservative popular and social media we examined the robustness of this result by including a conservatism scale everett 2013 in the probit regression and the result remains the same people who are more conservative are less likely to want to take a covid-19 test the conservatism scale is however not included in the final model given its high correlation with the political dummy variables finally we find that people with health insurance or coverage from medicare or medicaid are around 8 more likely to take the test this result might suggest that people who lack health care coverage use willful ignorance as a means to reduce anxiety about how to deal with a diagnosis this would be in line with previous studies that suggest willful ignorance of health diagnoses may be motivated by the drive to reduce anxiety about the future eg oster et al 2013 our results are robust to the inclusion of other explanatory variables such as race education income and profession with high exposure to infected people health care worker store clerk etc but these variables lack explanatory power or are highly correlated with other explanatory variables included in table 3 the tests conducted prior to participating in our study were neither randomly offered to people so far testing for covid-19 in the usa has been primarily of individuals who showed symptoms nor costless 52 of those who had tested prior to participating in our study stated the tests were financially costly and 60 said testing was time consuming the value of data on observed testing is limited when it comes to helping us understand whether people might purposefully ignore such tests while acknowledging that we still compare our identified determinants of testing in table 3 to the determinants of having taken a test before participating in our study see online supplementary material while the levels of statistical significance vary all coefficients are of the same sign as those in table 3 except for four variables having taken a test before participating in our study seems to be positively affected by having spent more time in groups with 10 or more people ie social distance compliant  groups as well as by a child having underlying health conditions ie child health risk employer impact has a weakly statistically significant positive effect on testing prior to participating in our study while it is not statistically significant in table 3 insurance is not a statistically significant determinant of having been tested prior to participating in our study while it does have an effect in table 3 widespread testing is one of the most important actions that us governments at any level can undertake to help slow down the spread of covid-19 given budget and testing supply constraints it is likely that random but voluntary testing will be the most effective policy we design a survey to examine the risks from self-selection into taking a covid-19 test overall we observe that around 70 of people would agree to a costless covid-19 test we find that people who are more worried about their own health due to covid-19 are more likely to test as are young healthy people relative to older healthy people ability to afford self-isolation for 14 days does not seem to affect the decision to test furthermore people who worry more about their health and people with health insurance or health coverage through medicare or medicaid are more likely to take the test as are people identifying as democrats compared to republicans contrary to our expectation we also find that potential super-spreaders are more likely than other individuals to agree to a costless covid-19 it could be that extroverts are more willing than expected to take a covid-19 test because their private cost of doing so is unusually low due to the broadly implemented social distancing at the time of data collection for this study if extroverts are already relatively isolated ie due to a stay-at-home order and mandated closures by the state governor of public spaces such as gyms restaurants and bars the personal cost of testing might be low furthermore extroverts might be more likely to get infected if they socialize more which could be a selfish motivation to get tested however we control for the current level of compliance with social distancing which should address both of these private motivations for increased probability of testing and we find that people who comply more are less motivated to take the test we also control for their worry about own health due to covid-19 even so the positive effect on willingness to test from being an extrovert persists we therefore conclude that the positive effect of being an extrovert on willingness to test for covid-19 is likely due to social health benefits weighing more heavily in their decision than their private costs from potential self-isolation for 14 days should the test come back positive the importance of the prosocial motive in determining covid-19 testing is consistent with the results of the study by jordan et al 2020 who find that prosocial messages are more effective than self-interested messages in promoting behavior that prevent the spread of covid-19 eg hand washing hand shaking hugging our results suggest that the risks of adverse selection in terms of failing to target the people most likely to spread the virus in testing for covid-19 might be fairly low this underscores the value of widespread testing even if it cannot be truly random and the importance of making such testing available nationwide in the usa as soon as possible an important shortcoming of our analysis is that it builds on hypothetical survey data it is well documented that survey answers may be affected by a hypothetical bias meaning that people answer one way in a survey and behave in a different way when faced with real incentivized decisions this risk pertains to our study as well and the hypothetical bias might be particularly pronounced if the choice to test for covid-19 is regarded as prosocial several studies suggest that a hypothetical bias is particularly likely when measuring prosocial behavior  people often exaggerate the extent to which they engage in such behavior eg murphy et al 2005 vossler et al 2012 jacquemet et al 2013 furthermore it is possible that personal costs to the testing decision are less salient in a hypothetical context once testing is more widespread in the usa it will be important to examine who actually chooses to get tested and the extent to which they deviate from the general population that said hypothetical and incentivized behavior generally correlate such that an analysis like ours can provide important insights into the potential pitfalls of voluntary testing prior to the actual testing this is useful information to have on hand when designing an efficient and cost-effective testing strategy  comparison of transmissibility of coronavirus between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients reanalysis of the ningbo covid-19 data

lena tendeng diaraf seck  this work is a trial in which we propose sir model and machine learning tools to analyze the coronavirus pandemic in the real world based on the public data from 3 we estimate main key pandemic parameters and make predictions on the inflection point and possible ending time for the real world and specifically for senegal the coronavirus disease 2019 by world health organization rapidly spread out in the whole china and then in the whole world under optimistic estimation the pandemic in some countries will end soon while for most part of countries in the world us italy etc the hit of anti-pandemic will be no later than the end of april  the pandemic of covid-19 was firstly reported in wuhan in december 2019 and then quickly spread out international wide see figure 1  since some decades ago mathematical community and specialists in computer sciences investigate biological questions to propose models describing subjects such as diseases physiological phenomena one of these models are formulated with the help of differential equations sir models reaction diffusions equations etc while others use computer sciences see 20 13 8 7 5  in this work for the mathematical modeling part we are going to use the sir model without demography because the lifespan of the disease which is an influenza disease will be very short compared to the lifespan of humans even if the flu lasted 2 years which would be exceptional 2 years do not represent much compared to the average longevity of a man similarly for this work was completed with the support of the

seriously affected humanity did not last long h1n1 for example even if this new virus hitherto seriously defies science our aims are first to collect carefully the pandemic data from the 3  eg httpswwwtableaucomcovid-19-coronavirus-data-resources from january 21 2020 to april 02 2020 in the second step we propose two technics a sir model and machine learning tools to analyze the coronavirus pandemic in the worldwide the article is organized as follows in the section 2 we present some auxiliary results of the sir model model estimation of parameters and the machine learning technics for forecasting followed by the simulations and results in section 3 finally in the section 4 we present conclusions and perspectives in this work we use the classical kermack-mckendrick sir model to describe the transmission of the covid-19 virus pandemic 9 10  the sir model is a compartmental model for modeling how a disease spreads through a population its an acronym for susceptible infected recovered the total population is assumed to be constant and divided into three classes in this model naturel death and birth rate are not considered because the outstanding period of the disease is much shorter than the lifetime of the  s is the number of individuals susceptible to be infected at time t  i is the number of both asymtotimatic and symptomatic infected individuals at time t  r is the number of recovered persons at time t  the parameters  and  are the transmission rate through exposure of the disease and the rate of recovering fore more details about sir see 22  parameters identification methods fall into two broad categories parametric and non-parametric the aim of non-parametric methods is to determine models by direct technics without establishing a class of models a priori they are called nonparametric because they do not involve a vector of parameters to be sought to represent the model parametric methods are based on model structures chosen a priori and parameterized in this case the goal is to find a vector of parameters  which will make it possible to obtain a model representing the behavior as close as possible to the real system the search for the best model becomes a problem of estimating  parameter identification belongs to the topic of inverse problems 11 19 21  it is widely studied and there is an abundant literature but the subject is still interesting and there are still open problems there are numerous approaches for the estimation of parameters in this paper we shall give a brief overview and quote the least square method for details and the discovery of other methods see for instance 21  if we look at the problem in general first we have data y i  i  1  n where each y i was measured at a specific t i point on the other hand we have a model ie a function f depending on time on the one hand and on the other hand a set of parameters that will be noted p  p 1  p 2   p k  it is assumed that the amount scalar or vector that is tracked is described by qt  f t p 1  p 2   p k  that is noted by f t p  we do not know the value of p j  j  1  k but with measurement errors we must have the relationship and then that y i is the measure of qt i  the idea is therefore to look for all the values p 1  p 2   p k  which in a sense makes the differences y i  f t i  p  as close as possible to 0 for all i  1  n simultaneously one natural method is the least square one by setting to be minimized on a subset s of r k  this set may be open of closed even it is quite possible to study cases where euclidean metric is replace by a riemannian one usually noted g remark 21 to estimate parameters it is possible to use the observer theory by first ensuring that the model is well observable and identifiable first let us remind that the minimization problems in the previous section are very classical in the cases we shall consider that is why we do not emphasize on the theoretical aspects for the sir model it is also classical to have existence and uniqueness whenever convenient cauchy data are considered the cauchy lipschitz theorem ensure existence and uniqueness of local solution and even the recovery theorem is equivalent to cauchy lipschitz theorem machine learning technics for forecasting is a branch of computer science where algorithms learn from data algorithms can include artificial neural networks deep learning association rules decision trees reinforcement learning and bayesian networks 1 2 12  forecasting involves taking models fit on historical data and using them to predict future observations we use this technic for the covid-19 prediction in the real world we use prophet 15 18  a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly weekly and daily seasonality plus holiday effects it works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend and typically handles outliers well for the average method the forecasts of all future values are equal to the average or mean of the historical data if we let the historical data be denoted by y 1   y t  then we can write the forecasts a y t ht   y 1  y 2    y t t the notation t ht is a short-hand for the estimate of y t h based on the data y 1   y t  a prediction interval gives an interval within which we expect y t to lie with a specified probability for example assuming that the forecast errors are normally distributed a 95 prediction interval for the h-step forecast i where  h is an estimate of the standard deviation of the h-step forecast distribution we perform one week ahead forecast with prophet with 97 prediction intervals multiplier217 here no tweaking of seasonality-related parameters and additional regressors are performed for the data preparation when we are forecasting at country level for small values senegal for example it is possible for forecasts to become negative to counter this we round negative values to zero in this section we present the simulations of sir model and the forecating technic for the prediction of the pandemic the numerical tests were performed by using the python with panda 16  the numerical experiments were executed on a computer intelr core-i7 cpu 260ghz 240gb of ram under unix system as cited in the introduction the simulations are carried out from data in 3 httpswwwtableaucomcovid-19-coronavirus-data-resources from january 21 2020 to april 02 2020 according to this daily reports we first analyse and make some data preprocessing before simulations the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths cases are illustrated in figure 3 and figure 4 curve and histogram  we use the sir model simulations for the senegal case study for the initial values well use normalized population values for our s 0  r 0  etc so if we assume we have 10k people in our population and we begin with four exposed person and the remaining susceptible we have n  10k a sample for the contact rate  and the mean recovery rate  we have   025 and   130 in 1days susceptible people in blue curve remain constant after the day 20 there is a rapid decrease in the blue curve which show the fast transmission of covid-19 infected people in red line appear right after day 20 where the red curve and blue curve cross at about day 40 is the first day where more people are in the infected compartement than the susceptible one the peak of infected people is reached at day 40 approximately with 6000 infected persons

confirmed cases in the near future april 07 2020 under optimistic estimation the pandemic in some countries like china will end soon within few weeks while for most part of countries in the world italy iran and senegal the hit of anti-pandemic will be no later than the end of april we can summarize our basic predictions as follows for the worldwide and by country  for the worldwide see figure 6 and figure 7  overall except in a period the validation data show a well agreement with our forecast and all fall into the 97 confidence interval shaded area we see the number of cases is almost equal to our predictions showing each country of the whole world must take strict measures to stop the pandemic at april 07 2020 we may obtain  1 million 200000 confirmed cases see table 1   for china see figure 8  based on optimistic estimation the pandemic of covid-19 would soon be ended within few weeks in china  for italy see figure 9  and iran see figure 10  the success of antipandemic will be no later than the middle of avril the situation in italy and iran are still very severe we expect it will end up at the beginning of may  for senegal see figure 11  we dont have enough data because the first case appear in the beginning of march and we are delighted to see cases are lower than our predictions showing the nation wide anti-pandemic measures in senegal come into play remark 31 in figure 6 to 11 the dots color black are the real data the blue line is the shaded area represents the confidence interval 97 finally due to the inclusion of suspected cases with clinical diagnosis into confirmed cases quarantined cases we can see severe situation in some cities which requires much closer attention  in this article we propose the generalized sir model and forecasting machine learning to analysis the coronavirus pandemic covid-19  the authors think that the part of identification could be deepen indeed one way should be to to consider in general the identification of systems it is the operation of determining the dynamic model of a process system from input  output measurements knowledge of the dynamic model is necessary for the design and implementation of an efficient regulatory system in other words the identification of a real dynamical system called object is to characterize another system called model starting from the experimental knowledge of the inputs and outputs so as to obtain an identity of behavior in practice the purpose of identification is generally to determine the conduct model which can be used to simulate control or regulate a process this model can be physical in the sense of analog or digital simulator and reduced model or an abstract model mathematical model ie system of algebraic or differential equations ode or pde finally note that some addressed questions in parameter identification are the recognizing of sets domains curves etc finally note that some addressed questions in parameter identification are the recognition of sets domains curves etc and a final remark is the identification of geodesics in almost every epidemic there is a phenomenon of super-propagation super spreader-when a person transmits an infection to a large number of people and super spreader phenomena may appear the role of super-spreaders it is the fact noticed by erds 4  that in a random graph there is always a small number of very connected people through which almost all geodesics pass how could it be possible to identify these facts in this pandemic the stochastic aspect would be very interesting because we are not even sure to have for the case of senegal all the data in addition there are infected people who do not develop the disease and spread it the case of some children as it seems not to mention the case of asymptomatics that are not monitored and are the cause of community transmission there is also the probability of touching an infected object too much hazard in the transmission of the disease let us propose among many possibilities the following stochastic sir model  s is the number of individuals susceptible to be infected at time t  i is the number of both asymtotimatic and symptomatic infected individuals at time t  r is the number of recovered persons at time t  the parameters  and  are the transmission rate through exposure of the disease and the rate of recovering   1 and  2 are volatility rates that may depend on the time t the suspects and the infected w 1 and w 2 are classical brownian motions for this model the complete theoretical study could be an interesting part such as existence and uniqueness results and qualitative properties let us quote for the readers that there is a cauchy lipschitz theorem for 41 see for example 6  remark 41 we would like to underline that the case of senegal must be deepen in the sense that there are not yet enough data and it should be better to look for getting more data and even consider a stochastic model to take into account the difficulties that can be met in the information system to collect enough data  forecasting covid-19 outbreak progression in italian regions a model based on neural network training from chinese data cosimo distante igor pereira gadelha luiz garcia gonalves m prisco piscitelli alessandro miani  background epidemiological figures of covid-19 epidemic in italy are worse than those observed in china methods we modeled the covid-19 outbreak in italian regions vs lombardy to assess the epidemics progression and predict peaks of new daily infections and total cases by learning from the entire chinese epidemiological dynamics we trained an artificial neural network model a modified autoencoder with covid-19 chinese data to forecast epidemic curve of the different italian regions and use the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed seir compartment model to predict the spreading and peaks we have estimated the basic reproduction number r 0  -which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection -both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period and also by using a day by day assessment based on single observations results the expected peak of seir model for new daily cases was at the end of march at national level the peak of overall positive cases is expected by april 11 th in southern italian regions a couple of days after that of lombardy and northern regions according to our model total confirmed cases in all italy regions could reach 160000 cases by april 30 th and stabilize at a plateau conclusions training neural networks on chinese data and use the knowledge to forecast italian spreading of covid-19 has resulted in a good fit measured with the mean average precision between official italian data and the forecast  according to the italian national institute of health iss at the date of april 8 th in italy there were about 140000 people positive to the 2019-ncov including deceased patients since the beginning of epidemic 95262 currently positive and 26491 healed 7 about 53 of cases are males median age 62 years old detailed epidemiological figures are provided by the italian national institute of health iss and tell us that men represent the majority of cases in people aged 0-9 and 50-79 range 52-63 while in the younger age groups 0-19 as well as between 80 and 89 years old males and females are equally represented among people who tested positive for covid-19 women accounted for 70 of cases 90 years old and about 55 between 20 and 39 years of age but men represented also the vast majority of deceased people in all the age groups up to 89 years old range 57-79 7 regional figures are available up to april 8 th and show that about 30 n28545 of currently positive people still live in lombardy 56 if considering the overall cases confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic followed by emilia romagna 137 of currently positive people piedmont 115 veneto n107 tuscany 58 marche 37 lazio n36 liguria and trentino alto adige 34 campania and apulia 3 sicily 2 friuli venezia giulia and abruzzo 15 and less than 1 in umbria sardinia calabria val daosta basilicata and molise 7 a total of 28485 symptomatic people were hospitalized at the same date of april 8 th with the exception of lazio n196 campania n97 and apulia n90 all the other regions of central and southern italy at the moment have less than 65 patients admitted to the icus of their regional healthcare systems 7 on april 8 th  total deaths were 17669 at national level 65 from march 30 th to april 8 th  with in val daosta and less than 50 in the other four regions figure 1  7 lethality rates seems to increase with age and it is higher in males 0 from 0 to 29 and 1 between 30 and 49 years of age 23 in the age group 50-59 1 in women and 35 in men 84 from 60 to 69 years old   the correct prediction of new daily cases at this time of italian covid-19 outbreak requires the correct estimation of the peak including the unknown remaining part of the epidemiological curve where this later can be predicted ahead by using a deep convolutional auto-encoder therefore we applied a modified auto-encoder mae for a time-series forecast in order to predict the evolution of daily cases for each of the 21 regions of italy 15 the model was trained with the data from the chinese regions which provides complete data in the sense that they already went through the peak number of daily cases and managed to suppress the epidemic by social distancing measures although such measures implemented by the chinese government may be impossible to implement in other countries or may not be as effective as it was in china the data generated by their experience going through the epidemic can be used to derive data-oriented models to predict the epidemic dynamic behavior in other countries the forecast of new daily cases has been used to correctly estimate the single peaks but also to obtain better spreading predictions from seir model we modeled spreading of covid-19 using chinese data and used the model  the data provided by the dataset regards the total number of cases confirmed up to date however to use the daily cases we differentiate the data of each region with regards to each day in order to train our model we used the data from 31 provincescities of mainland china and the three other regions hong kong macau and taiwan in total data from 34 regions were used and  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a

possible end the epidemic therefore we use the output of the prediction of step i-th as an input to the prediction of t i1-th repeating such a recursive procedure multiple times gives us a multiple-step ahead forecastin in this way we divided the forecast procedures into two phases the first phase regards the time in which the real data is available for this phase we compute only t one-step-ahead forecasting the second phase regards the time in which there is no real data availab hence we compute multiple-step-ahead forecasting in general the second phase starts on the last day available data we have chosen to train the modified auto-encoder by using several data and several latent variable  the model trained with data from the provinces of china with z4 presented optimal results t following results presented at this section are obtained with the optimal model we also evaluate the performance of our model by analyzing how close it predicts the next samp in the first phase of the forecasting procedure that is when real data is available figure 4a depicts the daily cases and figure 4b depicts the cumulative cases of covid-19 for t lombardy region from figure 4a  we can verify that the model is following the real data on the one-ste ahead forecasting and figure 4b indicates a plausible trend in the multiple-step-ahead forecasting  the basic reproduction number r0 is an indicator that resumes the average number of people that can infected by a person who has already acquired the infection r 0 is a metric of how contagious is t disease and its correct estimation is extremely important for epidemiologists especially when facing ne diseases like covid-19 r 0 can be computed in different ways in our models we have estimated t basic reproduction number r 0  both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a month periodand also by using day by day assessment based on single observations 1  this stu makes use of the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed seir compartment model 4 to predict t spreading of the pandemic in italy our efforts could be helpfulin the adoption of all the possib preventive measures and to study of the epidemics progression across southern regions as opposed to t national trend this metric can be biased by the optimal estimation of the basic reproductive number pronounced r-nought it must be said that r 0 is important if correlated with weather conditions and th reproductive index is reduced as the air temperature and relative humidity increase 5 according to t formula

medrxiv preprint r 0 is an average value but it can be also computed day by day to monitor the transmission of the infection being an average value it can be skewed by super-spreader events a super-spreader is an infected individual who infects an unexpectedly large number of people in italy this event can be also generated not necessarily by an individual but from the perturbation of a susceptible population as it happened in apulia and sicily with uncontrolled large group of people coming from outbreak areas for a super spreader individual such events are not necessarily a bad sign because they can indicate that fewer people are perpetuating an epidemic super-spreaders may also be easier to identify and contain since their symptoms are likely to be more severe in short r 0 is a moving target tracking every case and the transmission of a disease is extremely difficult so the estimation of r 0 is a complex and challengingissue estimates often change as new data becomes available in 10 a review of 12 studies on the reproduction number for a time period covered from 1 january 2020 to 7 february 2020was analysed for covid-19 from china and overseas the work found that the r 0 estimates ranges from14 to 649 12 11 passing through 14 of 408 in mainland china the review in 10 pointed out a mean of 328 a median of 279 and interquartile range iqr of 116 which is considerably higher than the who estimate at 195 also in 18 the r 0 for 2019-ncov is reported in the range 14 55  these estimates of r 0 depend on the estimation method used as well as the validity of the underlying assumptions in a beginning stage due to a small amount of data and short time onset these estimates can be biased and in a longer period converges to the who estimate the initial estimates result in a reproduction number for covid-19 higher than sars coronavirus where this last it is reported to range between 2 and 5 if we define the yt as the number of infected people with

east respiratory syndrome coronavirus xuejuan shen jamal sabir s david irwin m yongyi shen   in the lancet infectious diseases kayvon modjarrad and colleagues1 reported results of the first in-human clinical trial of the gls-5300 vaccine candidate against middle east respiratory syndrome merscoronavirus the vaccine induced both humoral and cellular mers coronavirus-specific immune responses these data suggest that gls-5300 has potential value in protecting humans from mers coronavirus infections however who should be vaccinated epidemiological surveys2 concluded that camel contacts health-care workers and patient household contacts are high-risk groups therefore they should be the target groups for the vaccine however there are many infection cases for which the source of infection could not be identified the unpredictability of these infections makes it hard to prevent human infections through vaccination for postexposure prophylaxis for zoonotic disease prevention and control one-sided disease prevention either human or animal is often inefficient severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is a successful precedent for containment of emerging coronaviruses based on elimination of the primary reservoir although the pathogens of sars and mers are both coronaviruses two major factors lead to different control results first although the number of human sars cases is greater than for mers most were due to a so-called super-spreader strain by contrast all clades of mers coronavirus are shared by camels and humans indicating that mers coronavirus can easily spill-over from camels to infect humans3 second palm civet the intermediate amplifying host of sars coronavirus is an exotic animal that could easily be controlled by banning wild animal trading however the intermediate host of mers coronavirus dromedary camel is an important livestock for the middle east with key roles in transportation food and fabric wool thus it is impossible to eliminate all camels to control this disease in camels two possibilities exist mass slaughtering of infected animals or vaccination unfortunately serological surveys showed a very high prevalence up to 100 of mers coronavirus-neutralising antibodies in dromedary camels4 therefore it seems impossible to eliminate this disease by mass slaughtering of positive animals vaccination of camels seems to be the only choice but no licensed vaccine for camels is currently available although several vaccines are in development5 additionally gls-5300 has been reported to also be immunogenic in camels6 camels are not used routinely in research and for most laboratories it would be hard to attain enough animals and work with them moreover they are too big to study in most biosafety facilities these limitations restrict vaccination tests in camels it is increasingly recognised that a one health approach is needed for effective investigation prevention and control of emerging zoonotic diseases in the context of emerging zoonoses human and veterinary medicines must work together the eradication of mers coronavirus in dromedary camels is the primary condition for the control of this disease in the arabian peninsula if the virus continues to circulate in camels it might attain new mutations that enable human-to-human transmission resulting in the generation of super-spreader strains a comprehensive mers prevention and control effort should focus not only on a human vaccine but also on camel vaccination  mers transmission and risk factors a systematic review ji-eun park soyoung jung aeran kim ji-eun park   middle east respiratory syndrome mers was first reported in 2012 in saudi arabia 1 although most patients are linked to the arabian peninsula geographically mers has been detected in many other parts of the world 2 a large mers cluster was also observed in 2015 in south korea 3 mers causes sporadic infection and intrafamilial and healthcare-associated infection its symptoms can vary from asymptomatic infection to death despite the infections association with high mortality specified antiviral therapy is lacking especially for patients with concomitant diseases 2 many previous studies have assessed the risks of mers such as factors dictating severity or an infection risk yet the indices they present vary for example the case fatality rate was found to be 259 in the middle east area but 204 in south korea 4 the incubation period was reported to be 6837 days in south korea 4 5 but 55 in a study using data from multiple areas 6 and 52 in saudi arabia 7 accurate assessment of the risk of mers is essential for predicting and preventing infection a systematic review of the risk of mers as covered in previous studies is potentially helpful for predicting this spread and its future impact this study aimed at reviewing the risk of mers focusing on indices related to infectivity and severity we searched international pubmed sciencedirect cochrane and korean databases dbpia kiss using the term mers or middle east respiratory syndrome encompassing articles published after 2000 the search process was conducted in october 2017 we also manually searched the reference lists of the included studies human studies were included while animal studies and reviews were excluded only articles in english or korean were included even if a study collected data on humans such as collecting specimens from religious pilgrims it was excluded if there were no mers patients in the study sample additionally case studies including fewer than 20 mers patients were excluded as they were considered as having insufficient mers patient numbers and representative information the included studies were classified as epidemiologic studies and those covering risk factors of mers in the epidemiologic category indices related to the risk of mers were divided into two categories related to infectivity and related to severity the index related to infectivity included the reproduction number r attack rate incubation period serial interval and days from onset to confirmation the index related to severity included the case fatality rate cfr days from onset to hospitalization days from onset to discharge days from onset to death and days from hospitalization to death in the risk factor category factors related to infection transmission severity and mortality of mers were analysed even if the included studies investigated factors that were related to mortality when they did not analyse risk factors of severity or mortality using appropriate statistical methods eg regression analysis cox proportional hazards model or only compared prevalence factors we excluded them from the risk factor category in all categories we extracted the study period number of participants and geographical region where the data were collected using a data extraction form confirmed after pilot assessment r value representing the reproduction number indicates the average number of secondary cases generated by infectious individuals thirteen studies reported r value of mers four studies that used data from multiple areas had r  10 6 810 studies using saudi arabia or middle east area data reported r  1 at 045098 1114 though one reported 1939 15 studies using south korea data showed higher values at 25809 1619 in the early stage and  1 in the later period 20 or with control intervention 19 a total of eight studies reported the attack rate four reported the overall or secondary attack rate and the other four reported the attack rate of specific participant groups two studies conducted in saudi arabia showed 042 21 and 4 22 secondary attack rates studies in south korea showed secondary attack rates of 37 in one study 23 and 143158 in another 24 two studies reported the attack rate among healthcare workers hcws one study in south korea reported a mers incidence of 15 among hcws 20 and another study using multiple area data reported a 134135 infection rate among hcws 8 the attack rate among hospital patients was 4 in one study 5 and 22 in the early and 1 in the later period in another 16 the incubation period is the period between infection and appearance of signs of a disease a total of 12 studies reported the incubation period of mers nine used data from south korea and showed a 678 day incubation period 35 2328 one study using data from saudi arabia reported a 52 day incubation period 7 and another using data from multiple areas reported a 55 day incubation period 6 sha et al compared the incubation periods between the middle east area and south korea and reported 455 and 6 days respectively 29 the serial interval of an infectious disease represents the duration between symptom onset of a primary case and of its secondary cases two studies used south korea data reporting serial intervals of mers of 126 and 146 days respectively 24 26 among five studies reporting days from onset to confirmation three studies used data from south korea one study analysing all south korea cases reported 5 days from onset to confirmation 3 park et al reported 65 days for all cases 9 for second generation and 4 for third generation 28 one study from taiwan reported 6 days for hcws and 10 for non-hcws 30 a study from saudi arabia reported 4 days from onset to confirmation 31 sha et al compared the data from middle east and south korea areas and reported 48 and 45 days respectively 29 two studies from saudi arabia reported days from onset to hospitalization one reported 295 days 32 and the other reported 53 days 33 twenty-six studies reported on mers-related mortality ten reported the mortality rate in south korea as 145478 3 4 2326 28 29 34 35 one of which including all mers patients in south korea reported a mortality rate of 204 27 ten studies analysing data from saudi arabia reported higher mortality rates of 22692 7 12 22 3133 3639 although others reported mortality rates 10 40 and 199 21 a taiwanese study reported a mortality rate of 356 30 studies using data from multiple areas reported mortality rates ranging from 266 29 to 594 9 41 three studies reported days from mers onset to discharge sha et al reported 14 days in the middle east area and 17 in south korea 29 one study from saudi arabia reported 17 days 36 and another in south korea reported 20 3 two korean studies reported similar periods of 1113 days from onset to death 11125 in park et al 24 and 13 in ki et al 3 although one study from saudi arabia reported longer than 17 days from onset to death 36 sha et al comparing data between the middle east and south korea reported similar periods of 115 and 11 days respectively 29 one taiwanese study also reported a similar period of 1213 days 30 two studies reported a similar length of hospitalization 15 33 and 152 days 19 two studies reported on the risk factors of mers infection alraddadi et al 42 analysed the effect of non-human contact including travel history animal-related exposure food exposure health condition and behaviour and reported direct dromedary exposure diabetes or heart disease and smoking as risk factors of mers infection another study reported older age outbreak week and nationality as risk factors 43 three studies analysed factors associated with spreaders non-isolated in-hospital days hospitalization or emergency room visits before isolation deceased patients and clinical symptoms including fever chest x-ray abnormality in more than three lung zones and the cycle threshold value were related to spreaders 34 44 45 four studies reported risk factors of mers severity the included studies showed that the prnt50 and cd4 t cell response 46 as well as a high mers virus load 47 were associated with the severity of mers additionally male sex older age concomitant disease including hypertension and symptoms including fever thrombocytopenia lymphopenia and low albumin concentration were related to mers severity or secondary disease 4749 fifteen studies reported risk factors of mortality in mers patients older age 4 25 32 4955 and comorbidity 29 5052 54 including diabetes 32 55 chronic kidney disease 32 respiratory disease 4 55 pneumonia 56 cardiac disease and cancer 53 were the most prevalent in the included studies male sex was reported as a risk factor in one study 56 smoking 32 56 and location of acquisition 51 53 were also reported while one study noted that hcw as a profession was associated with mortality 53 non-hcws were reported to be related to mortality in two other studies 50 51 additionally a shorter incubation period 25 56 longer duration of symptoms 32 more days from onset to confirmation 29 later epidemic period 52 and longer hospitalized days 29 were reported as mortality risk factors symptoms at diagnosis including abnormal renal function 56 respiratory symptoms 56 gastrointestinal symptoms 32 lower blood pressure 32 55 and leucocytosis 55 56 were also found to be associated with mortality in mers patients severity of illness 50 51 such as need for vasopressors 57 chest radiographic score 58 health condition 59 use of mechanical ventilation 55 and occurrence of dyspnoea 55 were also found to increase the mortality risk the characteristics of mers differ between south korea and the middle east area the r value of mers was reported to be below 1 in the middle east area except in one study 15 but was from 2581 in south korea 1519 although studies using data from the middle east area reported 0424 secondary attack rates studies in south korea reported 46 secondary attack rates for patients or hospital visitors 5 and 37158 for the overall attack rate 23 24 the mers incubation period was reported to be 4552 days in the middle east area 7 29 but this period was found to be slightly longer in south korea 35 2328 the severity of mers also differed between the middle east area and south korea mortality of mers patients was found to be 204 in south korea based on a report including all cases 27 but most studies from saudi arabia reported higher rates from 22 to 692 7 22 33 3739 days from onset to confirmation were similar 48 days in the middle east area 29 31 and 465 days in south korea 3 28 29 days from onset to discharge were slightly longer in south korea 1417 days in the middle east area 29 36 and 1720 days in south korea 3 29 table 3 the transmissibility and severity of mers were different by outbreak countries especially between the middle east area and south korea the virus host and environmental factors may be the causes of the mers outbreak-related differences between the two regions from the standpoint of viral factors there was a mutation of the mers coronavirus mers-cov in the south korea outbreak kim et al 60 reported a point mutation in the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein in mers-cov and another study showed that mers-cov in south korea had higher genetic variability and mutation rates 61 individual characteristics can also affect mers transmission as previous studies showed there is an association between older age and mers infection 43 severity 48 and mortality 4 50 and the population structure may be related to transmission and severity additionally individuals aware of mers were found to be more likely to practice preventive behaviour 62 which differed by demographic characteristics 63 64 the transmission environment may also contribute to the difference while many mers cases were contracted through exposure to camels in saudi arabia 42 the south korea outbreak involved multiple generations of secondary infections caused by intra-hospital and hospital-to-hospital transmission 3 65 strategies considering various factors are therefore needed to assess the impact of mers and to better control its spread although several studies have reported the overall r value 9 10 14 19 others have shown that this value this can be variable based on the generation or a control intervention 11 16 19 especially in the south korea epidemic the r value was particularly high in the early stage or first generation at 44254 though it later decreased to 014039 16 19 further studies should consider and analyse the variation of the r value depending on the period or control intervention while earlier studies on infectious diseases assumed a homogeneous infection ability of a population recent studies have shown the existence of so-called super spreaders individuals with a high potential to infect others in many infectious diseases including ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 66 the role of the super spreader is also important in the spread of mers in south korea 832 of mers patients were associated with five super-spreading events 27 stein et al 67 asserted that super spreaders were related with the host pathogen and environmental factors and wong et al 66 reported that individual behaviours could also contribute to disease spread there are variations in the mortality and attack rates among studies using south korea data for example park et al 24 reported a 478 mers mortality while reports from the korean ministry of health and welfare showed 204 mers mortality this disparity may in part be due to small sample sizes park et al 24 included only 23 patients because the study was conducted in an early phase of a mers outbreak we excluded studies that included cases with  20 subjects which were mostly case series to reduce those types of biases the present review found that older age and concomitant disease were risk factors of mers infection and mortality these results are consistent with a recent systematic review that reported older age male and an underlying medical condition as predictors of death related to mers 68 therefore these factors should be prioritized in protection and treatment procedures one limitation of this study was the possibility of subject duplication especially in south korea the korean government publishes mers reports that include all patients the epidemiologic index in other studies might be biased since they included partial korean patients and were analysed in the middle of an outbreak however we included those studies because they showed the characteristics of mers in different situations and different stages we did not conduct a meta-analysis because of the small number of studies for each index which might be another limitation of this study although this study reviewed the risk factors of mers and their impact assessing the effect size of each risk factor is important more studies investigating the effect of risk factors on mers need to be constantly conducted most studies on the transmissibility and severity of mers have originated from saudi arabia and south korea even though the r0 value in south korea was higher than that in saudi arabia mortality was higher in saudi arabia the most common factors behind mers infection and mortality were older age and concomitant disease future studies should consider the risk of mers based on the outbreak region and patient characteristics the results of the present study are valuable for informing further studies and health policy in preparation for mers outbreaks  introducing the outbreak threshold in epidemiology matthew hartfield samuel alizon  when a pathogen is rare  in a host population there is a chance that it will die out because of stochastic effects instead of causing a major epidemic yet no criteria exist to determine when the pathogen increases to a risky level from which it has a large chance of dying out to when a major outbreak is almost certain we introduce such an outbreak threshold t 0  and find that for large and homogeneous host populations in which the pathogen has a reproductive ratio r 0  on the order of 1 logr 0  infected individuals are needed to prevent stochastic fade-out during the early stages of an epidemic we also show how this threshold scales with higher heterogeneity and r 0 in the host population these results have implications for controlling emerging and re-emerging pathogens with the constant risk of pathogens emerging 1  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or avian influenza virus in humans foot-and-mouth disease virus in cattle in the united kingdom 2  or various plant pathogens 3  it is imperative to understand how novel strains gain their initial foothold at the onset of an epidemic despite this importance it has seldom been addressed how many infected individuals are needed to declare that an outbreak is occurring that is when the pathogen can go extinct due to stochastic effects to when it infects a high enough number of hosts such that the outbreak size increases in a deterministic manner  figure 1a  generally the presence of a single infected individual is not sufficient to be classified as an outbreak so how many infected individuals need to be present to cause this deterministic increase understanding at what point this change arises is key in preventing and controlling nascent outbreaks as they are detected as well as determining the best course of action for prevention or treatment the classic prediction for pathogen outbreak is that the pathogens reproductive ratio r 0  the number of secondary infections caused by an infected host in a susceptible population has to exceed one 4 5  this criterion only strictly holds in deterministic infinite population models in finite populations there is still a chance that the infection will go extinct by chance rather than sustain itself 4 5 6  existing studies usually consider random drift affecting outbreaks in the context of estimating how large a host population needs to be to sustain an epidemic the critical community size 4 7 8  calculating the outbreak probability in general 9 10 11 12  or ascertaining whether a sustained increase in cases over an area has occurred 13  here we discuss the fundamental question of how many infected individuals are needed to almost guarantee that a pathogen will cause an outbreak as opposed to the population size needed to maintain an epidemic once it has appeared critical community size see also box 1 we find that only a small number of infected individuals are often needed to ensure that an epidemic will spread we introduce the concept of the outbreak threshold denoted t 0  which we define as the number of infected individuals needed for the disease to spread in an approximately deterministic manner t 0 can be given by simple equations indeed if the host population is homogeneous that is where there is no individual variability in reproductive rates and large enough so that depletion of the pool of susceptible hosts is negligible then the probability of pathogen extinction if i infected hosts are present is 1r 0  i  6  details in material s1 in text s1 by solving this equation in the limit of extinction probability going to zero we find that on the order of 1logr 0  infected hosts are needed for an outbreak to be likely black thick curve in figure 1b  a result that reflects similar theory from population genetics 14 15 16  note that this result only holds in a finite population as an outbreak in a fully susceptible infinite population is certain if r 0 1 4  see also material s1 in text s1 this basic result can be modified to consider more realistic or precise cases and t 0 can be scaled up if an exact outbreak risk is desired for example for the pathogen extinction probability to be less than 1 there needs to be at least 5 logr 0  infected individuals more generally the pathogen extinction probability is lower than a given threshold c if there are at least 2logclogr 0  infected individuals furthermore if only a proportion p1 of all infected individuals are detected then the outbreak threshold order is p logr 0  also if there exists a time-lag t between an infection occurring and its report then the order of t 0 is e 2tb-d  logr 0  where b is the infection transmission rate and 1d the mean duration of the infectious period material s1 in text s1 finally we can estimate how long it would take on average for the threshold to be reached and find that if the depletion in susceptible hosts is negligible this duration is on the order of 1b-d material s1 in text s1 so far we have only considered homogenous outbreaks where on average each individual has the same pathogen transmission rate in reality there will be a large variance among individual transmission rates especially if super-spreaders are present 17  this population heterogeneity can either be deterministic due to differences in immune history among hosts or differences in host behavior or stochastic due to sudden environmental or social changes spatial structure can also act as a form of heterogeneity if each region or infected individual is subject to different transmission rates or degree of contact with other individuals 18  in such heterogeneous host populations the number of secondary cases an infected individual engenders is jointly captured by r 0 and a dispersion parameter k see box 2 this dispersion parameter controls the degree of variation in individual transmission rates while fixing the average r 0  the consequence of this model is that the majority of infected hosts tend to cause few secondary infections while the minority behave as super-spreaders causing many secondary infections host population heterogeneity obtained with lower values of k increases the probability that an outbreak will go extinct as the pathogen can only really spread via one of the dwindling super-spreading individuals in this heterogeneous case we can find accurate values of t 0 numerically as shown in figure 1b  if r 0 is close to 1 host heterogeneity k does not really matter t 0 tends to be high however if the pathogen has a high r 0 and thus spreads well then host heterogeneity strongly affects t 0  additionally we find that the heterogeneous threshold simply scales as a function of k and r 0 2 see box 2 as an example if k  016 as estimated for sars infections 11  the number of infected individuals needed to guarantee an outbreak increases 4-fold compared to a homogeneous population material s3 in text s1 the outbreak threshold t 0 of an epidemic which we define as the number of infected hosts above which there is very likely to be a major outbreak can be estimated using simple formulae currently to declare that an outbreak has occurred studies choose an arbitrary low or high threshold depending for instance on whether they are monitoring disease outbreaks or modeling probabilities of emergence we show that the outbreak threshold can be defined without resorting to an arbitrary cutoff of course the generality of this definition has a cost which is that the corresponding value of t 0 is only an order of magnitude 22  b outbreak threshold in a homogeneous black thick line or in a heterogeneous population for increasing r 0  the threshold was calculated following the method described by lloyd-smith et al 11 and is shown for different values of k the dispersion parameter of the offspring distribution as obtained from data on previous epidemics 11  if the threshold lies below one this means that around only one infected individual is needed to give a high outbreak probability n the critical community size ccs is defined as the total population size of susceptible and infected individuals or others needed to sustain an outbreak once it has appeared this idea was classically applied to determining what towns were most likely to maintain measles epidemics 7  so that there would always be some infected individuals present unless intervention measures were taken n the outbreak threshold t 0  has a similar definition to the css but is instead for use at the onset of an outbreak rather than once it has appeared it measures how many infected individuals not the total population size are needed to ensure that an outbreak is very unlikely to go extinct by drift note that the outbreak can still go extinct in the long term even if t 0 is exceeded if there are not enough susceptible individuals present to carry the infection afterwards modifications are needed to set a specific cutoff value or to capture host heterogeneity in transmission or incomplete sampling these results are valid if there are enough susceptible individuals present to maintain an epidemic in the initial stages as assumed in most studies on emergence 6 11 12 13  otherwise the pathogen may die out before the outbreak threshold is reached box 3 and material s2 in text s1 yet the key message generally holds that while the number of infections lies below the threshold there is a strong chance that the pathogen will vanish without causing a major outbreak from a biological viewpoint unless r 0 is close to one these thresholds tend to be small on the order of 5 to 20 individuals this contrasts with estimates of the critical community size which tend to lie in the hundreds of thousands of susceptible individuals 3 7 8  therefore while only a small infected population is needed to trigger a full-scale epidemic a much larger pool of individuals are required to maintain an epidemic once it appears and prevent it from fading out this makes sense since there tends to be more susceptible hosts early on in the outbreak than late on estimates of r 0 and k from previous outbreaks can be used to infer the approximate size of this threshold to determine whether a handful or hundreds of infected individuals are needed for an outbreak to establish itself box 4 outlines two case studies smallpox in england and sars in singapore estimates of t 0 for these and how knowledge of the threshold could have aided their control these examples highlight how the simplicity and rigorousness of the definition of t 0 opens a wide range of applications as it can be readily applied to specific situations in order to determine the most adequate policies to prevent pathogen outbreaks text s1 pdf file containing the following material s1 full derivations of outbreak threshold formulae for a homogeneous outbreak material s2 calculations of limitations due to small host population sizes material s3 finding solutions for outbreak threshold formulae for heterogeneous outbreaks pdf text s2 same as text s1 but in mathematica format zip in a heterogeneous host population see the main text for the bases of this heterogeneity it has been shown that the number of secondary infections generated per infected individual can be well described by a negative binomial distribution with mean r 0 and dispersion parameter k 11  the dispersion parameter determines the level of variation in the number of secondary infections if k  1 we have a homogeneous outbreak but heterogeneity increases as k drops below 1 that is it enlarges the proportion of infected individuals that are either super-spreaders or dead-ends those that do not transmit the pathogen lloyd-smith et al 11 showed how to estimate r 0 and k from previous epidemics through applying a maximum-likelihood model to individual transmission data although in this case it is not possible to find a strict analytical form for the outbreak threshold progress can be made if we measure the ratio of the heterogeneous and homogeneous thresholds this function yields values that are independent of a strict cutoff probability material s3 in text s1 by investigating this ratio we first found that for a fixed r 0  a function of order 1k fitted the numerical solutions very well by measuring these curves for different r 0 values we further found that a function of order 1r 0 2 provided a good fit to the coefficients by fitting a function of order 1kr 0 2 to the numerical data using leastsquares regression in mathematica 80 19  we obtained the following adjusted form for the outbreak threshold t 0 in a heterogeneous population as in the homogeneous case t 0 only provides us with an order of magnitude and it can be multiplied by 2logc to find the number of infected hosts required for there to be a probability of outbreak equal to 1-c a sensitivity analysis shows that equation 1 tends to be more strongly affected by changes in r 0 than in k material s3 in text s1 the basic result for the homogeneous population t 0 1logr 0  assumes that during the time to pathogen outbreak there are always enough susceptible individuals available to transmit to so r 0 remains approximately constant during emergence this assumption can be violated if r 0 is close to 1 or if the population size is small more precisely if the maximum outbreak size in a susceptible-infected-recovered sir epidemic which is given by is less than 1logr 0  then the threshold cannot be reached since this maximum is dependent on the population size outbreaks in smaller populations are less likely to reach the outbreak threshold for example if n  10000 then r 0 needs to exceed 106 for 1logr 0  to be reached this increases to 134 if n decreases to 100 further details are in material s2 in text s1 a smallpox outbreak variola minor was initiated in birmingham united kingdom in 1966 due to laboratory release we calculate a threshold such that the chance of extinction is less than 01 which means that t 0 is equal to 7 times equation 1 with an estimated r 0 of 16 and dispersion parameter k  065 11  t 0 is approximately equal to 9 infections the transmission chain for this outbreak is now well-known 20  due to prior eradication of smallpox in the united kingdom the pathogen was not recognised until around the 45 th case was detected by which point a full-scale epidemic was underway a second laboratory outbreak arose in 1978 but the initial case as well as a single secondary case was quickly isolated preventing a larger spread of the pathogen given the fairly low t 0 for the previous epidemic early containment was probably essential in preventing a larger outbreak the sars outbreak in singapore in 2003 is an example of an outbreak with known super-spreaders 21  with an estimated initial r 0 of 163 and a low k of 016 11  t 0 is estimated to be around 27 infections the first cases were observed in late february with patients being admitted for pneumonia strict control measures were invoked from march 22 nd onwards including home quarantining of those exposed to sars patients and closing down of a market where a sars outbreak was observed by this date 57 cases were detected although it is unclear how many of those cases were still ongoing on the date this point is important as it is the infected population size that determines t 0  overall very early measures were necessary to successfully prevent a smallpox outbreak due to its rapid spread in theory it should have been easier to contain the sars outbreak as its threshold is three times greater than that for smallpox due to higher host heterogeneity k however the first reported infected individual was a super-spreader who infected at least 21 others this reflects that in heterogeneous outbreaks although the emergence probability is lower the disease spread is faster compared to homogeneous infections once it does appear 11  quick containment of the outbreak was difficult to achieve since sars was not immediately recognised as well as the fact that the incubation period is around 5 days by which point it had easily caused more secondary cases however in subsequent outbreaks super-spreaders might not be infected early on allowing more time to contain the spread for newly-arising outbreaks t 0 can be applied in several ways if the epidemic initially spreads slowly then r 0 and t 0 can be measured directly alternatively estimates of t 0 can be calculated from previous outbreaks as outlined above in both cases knowing what infected population size is needed to guarantee emergence can help to assess how critical a situation is more generally due to the difficulty in detecting real-world outbreaks that go extinct very quickly experimental methods might be useful in determining to what extent different levels of t 0 capture the likelihood of full epidemic emergence  covid-19 facts cultural considerations and risk of stigmatization debra bruns pettit nina kraguljac vanessa thomas bruns r   cov infections are not unusual around the world these infections are commonly associated with human coronaviruses 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 cov has the potential to mutate in animals and become transmittable to humans when this occurs it creates a new human coronavirus this is the case for the covid-19 sars-cov and mers-cov cdc 2020 the novel coronavirus 2019 covid-19 was first recognized and reported in wuhan hubei province china on december 31 2019 world health organization who 2020 on january 30 2020 the who announced covid-19 as the sixth public health emergency

finally on march 11th 2020 the who designated the outbreak a pandemic ren et al 2020 examined clinical data and bronchoalveolar specimens from five patients experiencing severe pneumonia related to covid-19 admitted to the hospital between december 18 and december 29 2020 in wuhan hubei providence china chest radiography showed diffuse opacities and consolidation in all patients one patient death was recorded a new unidentified beta cov strain was observed in the five patients the strain isolated was 79 nucleotide identifiable with the sars and 51 identifiable with mers the covid-19 is most closely related to a sars like cov found in bats covid-19 is spread by human-to-human transmission via one on one contact or respiratory droplets the median incubation time appears to be 4 to 5 days but the ability to transmit the disease may extend to 14 days symptoms range from mild to severe and consist of cough shortness of breath and fever patients who screened positive for pneumonia associated with covid-19 experienced high fever and persistent coughing huang et al 2020 the symptoms closely resemble common symptoms of the influenza virus and clinicians can easily assume symptoms to be influenza for more serious cases ct computed tomography scans of the chest commonly demonstrate bilateral peripheral ill-defined and ground-glass opacities shi et al 2020 one us case of covid-19 pneumonia appeared to respond positively to remdesivir china has developed clinical trials studying the effect of remdesivir on covid-19 patients huang et al 2020 super-spreaders are individuals who infect disproportionately more susceptible contacts most individuals infected with covid-19 may infect few or no people stein 2011 the individual may or may know they are positive for the infection some may spread the disease by refusal for screening with the belief they are not infected or from fear of a positive screening result transmission can occur through travel public outings and family contacts before knowing the infection status super-spreaders may increase exposure to and burden of disease the recent mers-cov outbreak in korea in 2015 demonstrated how the effects of super-spreaders can affect the rates of transmission and create multiple secondary cases kim et al 2018 this appears to be an issue with covid-19 the cdc in korea have attributed a sudden jump in covid-19 cases to patient 31 who participated in a public gathering shin  cha 2020 scientists have urged their country to prepare for super-spreader potential ebrahim  memish 2020 patients should be properly educated and understand personal risk and personal methods to prevent infection if diagnosed with covid-19 patients should understand the need for self-quarantine or social distancing measures to restrict when and where people can gather to stop or slow the spread of infectious disease and other procedures to prevent transmission to others important lessons can be learned from previous outbreaks during the outbreak of ebola in west africa in 2014-2016 the overall mortality unrelated to the virus increased because of a saturated health care system and death of health care workers elston et al 2016 underscoring the importance of enhanced support for health care infrastructures and effective procedures for protecting health care workers from infection anderson et al 2020 during infectious disease outbreaks organizational support has been deemed a key factor to protect the general and mental health for health care workers and supervisors should be proactive in ensuring that staff members are supportive of colleagues who are quarantined brooks et al 2020 this is especially important because quarantine can have lasting effects on health care workers in past events after quarantine measures were lifted many people were found to engage in avoidance behaviors in health care workers quarantine was associated with avoidance behaviors such as minimizing direct contact with patients and not reporting to work brooks et al 2020 furthermore quarantine carries a greater risk of posttraumatic stress in hospital employees even 3 years later wu 2009 the chinese governments effort to investigate and contain the outbreak has been acknowledged by the who as the most ambitious agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history at the time the who was notified of the outbreak only 27 cases had occurred within the following week the virus was identified marking a significant improvement in the response time compared with the 2000-2003 sars outbreak wu  mcgoogan 2020 the timing of the outbreak prior to chinas lunar new year holiday is an important cultural factor to consider several billion planned person-trips by planes trains and buses would mean close contacts over long time intervals and across long distances after the holiday which caused the government to act swiftly authorities focused on traditional public health outbreak response tactics including isolation quarantine social distancing and community containment all lunar new year celebrations were cancelled and the city of wuhan was isolated this isolation was later extended to the whole hubei providence the chinese spring festival holiday period was extended and school openings were postponed to assist in the fight against disease more than 8000 physicians and nurses from other provinces and cities were deployed to assist with management of this crisis the chinese government has initiated at least 13 research programs as an emergency measure to study covid-19 wang  zhang 2020 the outbreak in italy shocked european political leaders who initially were slower to implement public health measures the lancet 2020 the emergency medical services of metropolitan milan instituted a covid-19 response team with the charge of tracking the outbreak without burdening ordinary emergency medical service activities the team was tasked with handling of patient flow to local hospitals transfer of patients to specialized facilities and management of emergency room overcrowding and designed a procedural algorithm for the detection of suspected cases spina et al 2020 approximately 2 weeks after the virus first appeared italy became the first european country to announce nationwide travel limits affecting approximately 60 million people in an effort to halt the spread of the coronavirus outbreak this measure follows the cancellation of the last 2 days of the famed venice carnival nationwide closing of schools and universities cancelling of sports events and outdoor gatherings and a 6 pm curfew on bars covid-19 presents different challenges to low-income middle-income and high-income countries large outbreaks could easily overwhelm health systems in low- and middle-income countries and many countries in sub-saharan africa latin america and the middle east are thought to be ill prepared for this pandemic the lancet 2020 covid-19 has affected travel for populations across the globe travel allows for greater transmission of disease as seen with covid-19 but the inability to travel affects access to health care access to employment and ability to connect socially frequent air travelers disproportionately travel more than other ground or the occasional air travelers the public health effect is seen as these travelers socially interact with other frequent travelers in common spaces such as hotels and airports these patterns can increase the incidence and prevalence of infectious diseases including high-contagion respiratory illnesses hollingsworth et al 2007 simulated cases from sars-like and influenza-like epidemics in a population for which a small number air travel more frequently than others who also travel by air the results showed that the frequent travelers increased the international transmission of epidemics only if they were infected before the illness became an epidemic and if the outbreak did not spread quickly with regard to public health population health and modes of transportation it is important to understand all potential exposures and risk for exposures popular methods of travel include airway waterway railway and roadway us department of transportation 2018 roadway accounts for the highest number of travelers both short and long distance and has multiple venues such as vehicle bus and taxi millions of people travel in communal settings such as buses and trains where the risk of being exposed to covid-19 is present however decreasing the risk of covid-19 to these groups has not been addressed at the same level as air travel airway is the most popular mode of travel for distances greater than 1000 miles and international travel for both the business traveler and for personal pleasure airway travel also affects the greatest number of travelers and has been an effective yet detrimental method of disease transmission from country to country as a method of prevention many countries are restricting entry or denying access to persons traveling from affected areas although this is an effective method of controlling an outbreak it can also negatively affect those seeking care or traveling to care for a sick family member and places a burden on individuals of low-income countries who travel to higher income countries for work as commonly seen in asia and europe qatar has restricted entry from 18 nations in varying ways from connections traveling through to mandating quarantine once an individual arrives italy recently announced a lockdown on travel with all passengers entering and departing the country by air to be checked for travel exemption status these measures have a rippling effect within the regions from facility closures countrywide to prison uprisings qatar airways 2020 according to di donato et al 2020 the italian government is preparing measures to support workers and firms across the country with the hope of preventing lasting damage to the supply side of the italian economy and permanent employment losses p 7 president trump issued a wide sweeping travel ban on march 12 2020 the restrictions apply only to people who are not us

rates of covid-19 in 2007 the who released who interim protocol rapid operations to contain the initial emergence of pandemic influenza because of the impact of global travel trade to include health care restrictions are not recommended by who once the global spread of disease is present mateus et al 2014 countries affected by the h1n1 influenza virus in 2009 instituted travel restrictions but the approach was questioned and not considered effective bajardi et al 2011 in 2018 airlines flew more than 43 billion passengers this equates to more than 11 million people daily industry trade groups are estimating an impact between 63 billion and 113 billion in worldwide airline revenue this year the prospect of cancelled flights lost sales and service reductions is an example of how the economy is and will be negatively affected gelles  chokshi 2020 the economic impact due in large part to the worldwide scare of covid-19 will affect marginalized groups disproportionately and be a barrier to health care for many people public response is closely correlated to the amount of media coverage present for any event when a health event or crisis is reported on tv radio or social media misinformation can arise and lead to panic anxiety and mental health issues the 2016 zika event is an example of how media can affect health information and behaviors among the public chan 2018 studied the changes in the perceptions of community risk and how the population viewed protective behaviors researchers found that social media affected attitudes of risk perception while legacy media tv radio affected perceptions of protective behaviors the less educated population appeared to experience greater impact from the media in attempting to understand health information health care providers should consider the potential impact of media coverage on patient behaviors health education and care seeking when a health risk is present the complexity and impact of culture on health is widely known and accepted when considering new diseases epidemics and pandemics we must consider culture perceptions and ways they may affect how symptoms are recognized access to care treatment provided and fear of stigmatization cross-cultural studies support that each specific culture has its own beliefs related to particular explanations for health and sickness kahissay et al 2017 workneh et al 2018 public health interventions should assess cultural beliefs and assumptions napier et al 2014 these interventions should be addressed at the local level to encourage education and participation and ensure the interventions are culturally appropriate for the community shaikh  hatcher 2005 it is important to assess the role of culture and avoid correlating disease with questionable cultural causations this may lead to blaming specific populations for their high prevalence rate or stigmatizing of certain groups sovran 2013 infectious disease epidemics have been associated with stigmatization of specific ethnic groups for example the 1892 outbreaks of typhus and cholera were traced to russian jewish immigrants from eastern europe resulting in stigmatization and discrimination of this group similarly the chinatown community was stigmatized due to an outbreak of the bubonic plaque which was attributed to rats transported on a ship from hong kong and the 1993 outbreak of hantavirus in the united states was initially referred to as a navajo disease leading to discrimination and stigmatization of native americans in the region person et al 2004 stigmatization is real and can negatively affect populations of people in seeking and accessing care and also in general public response patients who believe or perceive they are stigmatized against may delay seeking care others become afraid of those believed to be sick entire populations may be prejudiced against and in some cases stigmatization has led to violence against individuals and groups public health interventions should mitigate stigma while caring for individuals families and communities perry  donini-lenhoff 2010 addressing stigma and discrimination targeted toward individuals affected by covid-19 and groups at higher risks is a priority for public health and health care providers because of stigmatization and the fear of being labeled as someone who carries an infectious disease many at risk populations may not seek care until symptoms are unmanageable or may not seek care at all during the 2003 sars outbreak worldwide discrimination against asian populations was prevalent person et al 2004 and affected care seeking behaviors and mental health of many people of asian descent researchers in asia studied the effects of stigma associated with hivaids tb and sars they determinedmore efforts should be placed in strategically changing the attributions made by the public towards infectious diseases in so doing the public would develop more acceptable attitudes towards the diseases and the affected individuals    for preventive programs of infectious diseases to be effective their associated stigma must be actively addressed mak et al 2006 p 1921 public health efforts to mitigate provide surveillance and educate the public should also meet the needs of specifically affected populations person et al 2004 researchers were careful in naming this virus as to prevent any stigma we had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location an animal an individual or a group of people and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease said tedros adhanom ghebreyesus the director general of the who who 2020 scientists and public health officials must assess the response to the names of diseases as well as using words such as epidemic words can create stigma against geographic regions and specific populations and result biases and panic in 2015 the who established criteria for naming diseases this may seem like a trivial issue to some but disease names really do matter to the people who are directly affected said keiji fukuda 
weve seen certain disease names provoke a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities create unjustified barriers to travel commerce and trade and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals this can have serious consequences for peoples lives and livelihoods who 2015
 the permanent name of any novel human disease is determined by the international classification of diseases and is managed by the who stigma has been a major theme throughout the literature on infectious disease outbreaks and specifically surrounding quarantine measures quarantined individuals are more likely to report stigmatization and social rejection including avoidance withdrawing social invitations and making critical comments suggesting stigma may specifically be surrounding people who are quarantined brooks et al 2020 during the ebola epidemic in liberia it was found that stigma could lead to disenfranchisement of minority groups as those under quarantine were often from different ethnic groups religions or tribes and perceived as dangerous pellecchia et al 2015 data on covid-19 from china south korea italy and iran suggest that the mortality increases significantly with age and those with underlying comorbidities targeted social distancing for these groups could be an effective way to reduce morbidity and mortality anderson et al 2020 but could inadvertently increase stigma for affected populations as health care providers we must be aware of the potential for stigmatization of populations affected by covid-2019 as well as the potential psychological consequences of prolonged quarantine not only on the general population but health care workers as well furthermore it is important to consider the real economic impact related to lost workdays due to quarantine and social isolation efforts as well as travel restrictions that may negatively affect access to care and ability to pay for care efforts geared toward general education about the disease and the rationale for quarantine and public health information provided to the general public can reduce stigmatization media reporting is a powerful tool to influence public opinion and has contributed to stigmatization in prior outbreaks brooks et al 2020 as stated by the cdc 2020 this situation is constantly changing and we are continuing to learn more about the virus disease pathology and tertiary effects the cases of covid-19 will continue to rise and the virus will be sustainable for future infections timely and appropriate public health interventions along with proper screening treatment and follow-up for affected individuals and close contacts can reduce the number of infections serious illness and deaths for successful management of the epidemic effective screening and treatment of covid-19 in infected patients health care providers should focus public health efforts at culturally appropriate methods of education prevention treatment and follow-up  the transmission and diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease covid19 a chinese perspective yu han hailan yang   patient 1 a 56yearold male from zhejiang china was diagnosed with covid19 on february 4 he had no history of exposure to outbreak areas or symptomatic people according to a video from the district public security department on the morning of january 23 this patient and another confirmed patient were present at the same stall for 15 seconds at a vegetable market where both of them did not wear masks

 patients 2 and 3 a husband and wife couple from zhejiang china were also confirmed to have the disease on january 25 and 27 similar to patient 1 the couple had no history of epidemiological contact according to a video from the district public security department on the afternoon of january 22 patient 2 and a confirmed individual were at the same clinic for 50 seconds where both of them did not wear masks
5

 sarscov2 possesses powerful pathogenicity and transmissibility being more infectious than sarscov and merscov
6
 encountering a confirmed patient and being close for 15 or 50 seconds is not the only route of infection though it is the most likely route in the above two cases moreover being infected within a very short exposure time is possible in the absence of masks
7
 the powerful infectivity of sarscov2 may be explained by the latest findings reported by wrapp d et al
8
 which showed that the sarscov2 s binds to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors with a higher affinity than sarscov s another underlying reason was reported by zou l et al
9
 in that the shedding pattern of viral nucleic acid in patients infected with sarscov2 is similar to that in patients with influenza and appears to be different from that in patients infected with sarscov sarscov2 often causes cluster transmission especially within family clusters in some cities cases involving cluster transmission accounted for 50 to 80 of all confirmed cases of covid19
10
 humantohuman transmission of sarscov and merscov occurred mainly through nosocomial transmission and transmission between family members only occurred in 13 to 21 of mers cases and 22 to 39 of sars cases
11

 sarscov2 can be transmitted by droplets and contact a study in south korea showed that many environmental surfaces of patients with mers were contaminated by merscov and virus rna was detected from environmental surfaces within 5 days after the last positive pcr of patients respiratory samples
12
 guangzhou cdc also found sarscov2 in the house of a confirmed patient
13
 which serves as evidence of contact transmission moreover live viruses have been found in the feces of patients with covid19
14
 however the fecaloral transmission of the virus has not been shown studies have shown that sarscov may be detected in the feces of most sars patients
15
 and the virus within feces could survive at room temperature for at least 1 to 2 days
16
 it is possible but infrequent for sarscov to spread via the fecaloral route
17
 in patients with mers feces and urine samples also yielded viral rna
18
 given the evidence of fecal contamination of sarscov and merscov as well as their ability to survive in feces it is possible that sarscov2 may also be transmitted through the fecaloral route
19
 additionally in regard to the expression of ace2 in the intestine and kidney sarscov2 may infect these tissues and enter the feces allowing its potential spread via fecaloral route
20

 
the lancet also reminded doctors not to ignore sarscov2 transmission via ocular surfaces as infected droplets and bodily fluids may easily contaminate the human conjunctival epithelium
21
 guangfa wang a member of the national health commission of the peoples republic of china nhc expert panel on pneumonia was exposed to a fever clinic in wuhan with only his eyes unprotected he then demonstrated symptoms of conjunctivitis in his left lower eyelid 2 days before the onset of covid19
22

 on february 19 the nhc published the 6th edition of guideline on diagnosis and treatment of covid19 the 6th guideline for covid19
23
 this document asserted that the transmission of sarscov2 mainly occurs via large droplets and contact additionally the virus may spread in an unventilated environment with high levels of viral aerosols in addition researchers claimed the spread of sarscov2 could be characterized by superspreading events
24
 however there is no evidence of superspreading events in any medical institution that treats patients suffering from covid19
6
 and a study in south korea showed that for transmission of merscov nonisolated inhospital days was the only factor which tended to be higher in superspreaders than usualspreaders
25
 therefore whether there are superspreaders or not early isolation is necessary to reduce the size of the outbreak of sarscov2 over the past few days asymptomatic patients were found in many chinese cities table 1 outlines its summary on january 24 the lancet reported a familial cluster of sarscov2 infection five family members with a travel history to wuhan were confirmed to have covid19 after returning to shenzhen with their asymptomatic child presenting with no fever respiratory tract symptoms or diarrhoea but had groundglass lung opacities seen on radiography
26
 subsequently asymptomatic patients were discovered in many chinese cities with most of them having an epidemiological history asymptomatic infections may occur due to weakened immune responses and subclinical manifestations or because the virus is waiting for opportunities to reproduce and invade to understand its mechanism requires additional investigation of asymptomatic patients as well as blood tests pointing to signs of an immune response which can help detect asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases
27
 a study showed that during the outbreak of sarscov of all exposed health care workers 75 were asymptomatic sarspositive cases asymptomatic sars was associated with lower sars antibody titers and a higher use of masks compared to that of pneumonic sars
28
 another study showed that of 255 patients with laboratoryconfirmed merscov a total of 64 patients 251 were reported to be asymptomatic however 33 52 of the 64 patients were interviewed with 26 79 of them having reported at least one respiratory symptom
29
 this phenomenon indicates whether asymptomatic patients were actually infected without showing symptoms whether asymptomatic people can transmit sarscov2 to others is unclear the 6th guide for covid19 noted that asymptomatic patients may serve as a source of infection an article in nejm first reported a german to be confirmed with covid19 after contact with an asymptomatic chinese patient
30
 however it turned out that the chinese patient had a fever in germany and took antipyretics a recent study in nejm reported that a viral load detected in an asymptomatic patient was similar to that detected in symptomatic patients indicating the potential for transmission in asymptomatic patients
9
 table 1 indicates that these asymptomatic patients may infect others or develop symptoms later but the number of patients involved is small we remind readers to take this into account when interpreting the research results and conclusions as some of the above observations may be accidental another uncertainty is whether those who are asymptomatic can cause largescale infections a study in south korea showed that during the mers outbreak in korea an asymptomatic patient with mers was discovered and none of the 82 persons exposed to that patient without protection was infected
31
 most of the asymptomatic patients had close contact with confirmed patients hence they may be isolated in a timely manner when tracking close contacts moreover the number of asymptomatic patients was very small according to epidemiological data in mainland china only 12 of patients with covid19 are asymptomatic
6
 due to the above reasons such patients will generally not cause largescale transmissions of sarscov2
32

 patient 11 an infant born at the wuhan childrens hospital on february 2 was delivered by a mother who was confirmed to have covid19 the cord blood and placental tissue were collected immediately and tested negative for sarscov2 but nasopharyngeal swab samples collected 36 hours after birth were positive
33

 sarscov2 is a novel virus and shares a 790 nucleotide identity with the sequence of sarscov and a 518 identity with that of merscov
34
 therefore the risk of vertical transmission of covid19 may be similar to sarscov and merscov a study in hong kong investigated 12 pregnant women with sars and showed that all five newborn infants were negative for sars especially three of which who were delivered in the acute stage of maternal sars infection and faced serious risks of perinatal infection
35
 another article reported a pregnant woman with mers in which all laboratory results related to merscov in the newborn were negative as well as that of the cord blood and placenta
36

 infants may certainly be infected by covid19 however the latest research in jama reported nine infants under 1 year of age suffering from covid19 the youngest of which is only 56 days old
37
 currently no evidence exists that shows sarscov2 may be transmitted in the uterus
38
 here the newborn infant was negative for the disease in both cord blood and placenta but lacked pharyngeal swab specimens at birth the swabs positive for sarscov2 were collected 36 hours following the birth therefore the possibility of transmission by droplets and contact cannot be ignored recently the lancet reported nine pregnant women confirmed with covid19
39
 who all delivered by cesarean section neonatal throat swabs amniotic fluid cord blood and breastmilk samples from six of these patients were collected and all samples tested negative for sarscov2 this indicates that the risk of vertical transmission of sarscov2 is limited as no presence of virus particles in the products of conception or in the infants existed however limited by a small sample size more investigation and evidence is required to confirm this conclusion patient 12 a male from wuhan china was admitted to the beijing sinojapanese friendship hospital for severe influenza a on january 30 he had oropharyngeal swabs done with realtime rtpcr three times before admission where all tested negative for sarscov2 but positive for influenza a virus after admission he used an invasive ventilator to assist in his ventilation and was confirmed to be positive for sarscov2 via alveolar lavage test on february 5 a total of 23 staff were quarantined for 14 days as a result
40

 this case involves the diagnosis of covid19 in specific cases the diagnostic criteria of infectious diseases should be extended to prevent epidemics in the middle of january when the nhc visited wuhan patients with covid19 had been defined by historical criteria a a history of exposure to the southern china seafood market b symptoms of fever and c the full genome of the virus from respiratory or serum specimens were identical to sarscov2 sequences
41
 the diagnostic criteria were strict as only a few people are able to sequence the entire viral genome which resulted in many patients having diseases unable to receive a diagnosis
41
 therefore although primary hospitals noticed humantohuman virus transmissions evidence was still unclear because only 41 cases were confirmed in wuhan between january 5 and january 15
42
 which directly led to the delay of epidemic control until january 17 experts analyzed the epidemiological data of infected pneumonia cases and found that some cases had no history of exposure to the seafood market they adopted an optimized sarscov2 nucleic acid detection kit rtpcr to test specimens of patients with unexplained pneumonia and confirmed 17 covid19 cases after reconsidering the diagnostic criteria
43
 therefore the number of confirmed cases began to increase dramatically each day and the chinese government began to fight against sarscov2 
the 5th edition of guideline on diagnosis and treatment of covid19 the 5th guideline for covid19 published by nhc
44
 shows that patients satisfying the following criteria are considered to have covid19 a epidemiological history and b clinical features of i fever andor respiratory tract symptoms ii radiographic evidence iii low or normal whitecell count or low lymphocyte count in the early period patients possessing an epidemiological history consistent with any two clinical features are diagnosed as suspected cases suspected cases are confirmed using any of the following pathogenic detection criteria a positive for sarscov2 via respiratory or serum specimens examined with realtime rtpcr or b the full genome sequences of the virus from respiratory or serum specimens were identical to sarscov2 sequences nonetheless the pcr results for sarscov2 are related to the quality of the examined kit as well as to the novel coronaviruss characteristics sampling location sampling volume transportation and storage as well as laboratory test conditions and personnel operation sarscov2 interacts with the ace2 receptor a cellsurface protein mainly found on lung alveolar epithelial cells
45
 the alveolar lavage test is the best way to confirm sarscov2 however the detection of alveolar lavage fluid is mostly used in severe patients using an invasive ventilator sputum is considered the second choice though the coughs of many patients with covid19 are unproductive
46
 therefore pharyngeal swabs are the most common sampling method however they may occasionally cause missed diagnoses for smaller levels of sarscov2 residing in the pharynx in addition pcr detection takes up a lot of time hampering the control of infectious diseases therefore the revised version of the 5th edition added clinical confirmed standards for the hubei province
47
 here suspected cases are defined as patients having an epidemiological history with i and iii clinical features clinically confirmed cases are defined as suspected cases with ii as noted in table 2 after the revised diagnostic criteria was adopted the number of covid19 cases in hubei province increased by 14 840 on february 12 compared to february 11 data taken from the nhc after most patients were diagnosed the 6th guideline for covid19

23
 published by the nhc on february 19 canceled the diagnostic differences between hubei and other provinces at the same time patients without a clear epidemiological history were able to be diagnosed as suspected cases according to the three clinical characteristics mentioned above sarscov2 possesses powerful pathogenicity and transmissibility and deserves attention from all countries across the world it can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients but vertical transmission from mother to child remains to be confirmed clinical features epidemiological history and pathogen detection are important in the diagnosis of covid19 where making an accurate diagnosis in time is necessary to control the outbreak to solve any uncertainties regarding sarscov2 additional investigations concerning

medrxiv preprint  using modelling to disentangle the relative contributions of zoonotic and anthroponotic transmission the case of lassa fever giovanni lo iacono andrew cunningham a elisabeth fichet-calvet robert garry f donald grant s sheik khan humarr melissa leach lina moses m john schieffelin s jeffrey shaffer g colleen webb t james wood l anita mcelroy k   diseases at the animal-human interface are in general subjected to different modes of cross-species transmission animal-to-animal animal-to-human human-to-human and even human-to-animal estimating the relative contribution of each is of fundamental importance for the planning and implementation of appropriate infection control and preventive measures this can be an extremely difficult task if humans and animals share the same physical space andor if experimentation eg to quantify the probability of animal-to-animal transmission is subjected to serious limitations this is the case of lassa fever lf a rodent-borne disease endemic in west africa despite its clear zoonotic origin there are strong arguments listed below to hypothesize that a significant proportion of the burden of lf in humans arises from human-to-human transmission the aim of this work is to test whether or not patterns in the epidemic curve describing the cases of lf observed in sierra leone 1 are compatible with patterns observed in chains of pure human-to-human transmission recorded in nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks 2 3 lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease caused by lassa fever virus lasv an enveloped rna virus of the arenaviridae the disease was first recognized in the village of lassa nigeria in 1969 which caused the death of two missionary-nurses and the grave illness of a third 4 however cases consistent with lf from the eastern part of sierra leone can be traced back to 
5 since the identification of lasv human-to-human transmission has been documented in several nosocomial outbreaks eg
2 3 and also 6 for a review leading to an initial perception that the virus was both highly contagious and virulent 4 this resulted in stringent requirements for containment of the patients 7 soon after its zoonotic origin was recognized and mastomys natalensis one of the most common african rodents was identified as the reservoir of the virus 8 the risk of nosocomial transmission was shown to be dramatically reduced by using simple barrier nursing method 7 911 suggesting that the risk of human-to-human transmission might be negligible these findings support an apparent modern-day consensus that in the epidemiology of the disease human-to-human transmission plays a less important role compared to zoonotic transmission accordingly it has been suggested that patients with lf in non-endemic countries should not be confined to biosafety level 4 containment 10 and patient containment guidelines issued by the centers for disease control cdc and the uk department of health and social security in the past have been amended to be less restrictive see 11 12 also 13 and its previous versions this narrative concerning the relative importance of human-to-human transmission for lasv however requires re-evaluation as there are important indications of human-to-human transmission more precisely one of the early nosocomial outbreaks in jos nigeria see 2 fig 1 and also the supporting information s2 text was triggered by an index case that transmitted to possibly  others in the hospital with no indication of iatrogenic transfer further cases of extra-hospital transmission within a single family five from the same family     and  who likely initiated the chain were reported here and throughout we refer to this chain as an extra-nosocomial chain haas et al
14 investigated secondary transmission after an imported case of lf into europe and found that one of  contacts that were tested serologically a physician who examined the patient on day  of illness had become infected the authors concluded that during the initial phase of symptomatic lf the risk of transmission is low but it may increase with progression of disease and increasing viral excretion emond et al
15 described a case of lf in the uk in which the virus was isolated from urine  days after the acute phase had ended despite not being detected earlier the virus may also be found in pharyngeal secretions for  weeks after the onset of clinical signs 16 in an experimental model stephenson et al
17 showed the ability to infect guinea pigs and cynomolgus monkeys with lasv via the respiratory route and peters et al
18 demonstrated fatal lasv transmission to monkeys through being held in the same room for  days with inoculated rodents sagripanti et al
19 in a dark room at ambient laboratory temperatures controlled between  and  and  relative humidity showed that the time required for a  reduction in viral load of lasv in glass containers was  hours and was  days for a  relative humidity also kernis et al
20 identified that risk factors for positive seroconversion to lasv included either having received a medical injection or having lived with someone displaying a haemorrhage in the previous twelve months no factors related to contact with rodents were identified similarly mccormick et al
21 reported a lack of correlation between human lasv-specific igg prevalence and either the level of domestic infestation by mastomys or the presence of lasv infection in mastomys these observations taken together suggest that a significant if perhaps variable proportion of the burden of lf might be associated with human-to-human transmission estimating the contribution of human-to-human transmission of lasv and related patterns of transmission eg existence of super-spreaders is of fundamental importance when considering risk assessment and control of lf and related diseases such as the one caused by the arenavirus lujo virus 22 not least because lf is one of the more common haemorrhagic fevers exported from endemic areas 2328 in addition perceiving lf as essentially a zoonotic disease only acquired from rodents with little or no infection arising from human beings may have prevented investigations of the role if any of human-to-rodent transmission ie spillback in the epidemiology of lf understanding routes of transmission and the proportion of lf cases resulting from human-to-human transmission is critical for developing and prioritizing effective prevention and control interventions especially in the presence of large variation among subjects in their capability of infecting the current ebola outbreak has emphasised further the need for targeted biosecure measures which distinguish managing hemorrhagic fever cases and outbreaks from preventing spillover from reservoirs this issue has not previously been fully addressed for lassa fever traditional approaches such as cluster analysis to distinguish human-to-human transmission from pure zoonotic transmission cannot be employed here due to the potential of clustering of infection in households from common exposure to infected rodents in addition to clustering arising from infected people we overcome this problem by adapting other approaches 29 30 and using data from nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks and hospitalized patients in kenema governmental hospital kgh sierra leone 1 we use these data to provide an estimation of the contribution of human-to-human transmission to the lassa fever occurrence in endemic areas and to provide a more-robust assessment of the risk of secondary spread from index cases the tulane university institutional review board and the sierra leone ethics committee approved the research 1 patients either approached kgh directly or were referred to the kgh lassa ward from regional health centers or the hospitals general ward on the basis of suspicion of lf all adult subjects provided written informed consent for the analysis and publication of anonymized laboratory and clinical data a parent or guardian of any child participant provided written informed consent on their behalf all data were anonymized prior to analysis like kenema in sierra leone jos and zorzor are at the heart of the nigerian and liberian endemic areas of lf occurrence and as in sierra leone it is assumed that lasv has been circulating in these areas historically 5 31 32 this is supported by molecular evidence that the nigerian lasv strain is ancestral to the sierra leonean one 33 in addition although studies in human prevalence of antibodies to lasv exhibit variation amongst regions eg low values in coastal areas in general human seroprevalence appears to be similar in nigeria and in the mano river region guinea sierra leone liberia 20 3440 furthermore in recent decades infection control has focused essentially in minimizing nosocomial transmission albeit with partial success 4143 in particular a study by tobin et al
42 revealed a general lack of knowledge of barrier nursing among health workers in rural areas this problem is expected to be even more persistent among non-professionals suggesting that control measures have not significantly changed since lf was discovered hence despite these data sets being collected at quite different points in time health-care practices have not changed meaningfully over this time period finally the joszorzor outbreaks were exceptionally severe disease outbreaks therefore by analyzing only hospitalized patients in kgh we ensured that we are comparing equivalent situations these considerations justify the choice of comparing the data from kgh with the extra-nosocomial outbreak that occurred in jos while the appropriateness of comparing the kgh data with the nosocomial cases in the jos outbreak is one of the hypothesis being tested in the current work we analyzed the data from two nosocomial lf outbreaks jos nigeria in 1970  cases 2 and zorzor liberia in 1972  cases 3 in the jos outbreak extra hospital infections with no contact with the index case were observed a single family     and  with the three children   and  who never visited the ward these appear to be human-to-human chains sampling and testing of rodents near the homes of lf patients in jos as well as in the larger geographic area showed no evidence of lasv in rodents 2 further supporting human-to-human transmission maintaining these epidemics further details of the two outbreaks and the full networks of contacts are presented in the supporting information s2 text in contrast with many emerging zoonoses the reported incidence of lf in people is high in endemic areas as reflected in data from kgh in sierra leone 1 fig 2 thus allowing a more robust analysis of the transmission dynamics kgh is the only health facility in sierra leone where people can be diagnosed and treated for suspected lf the hospital facilities include an isolation ward specifically for lf patients with a highly trained clinical staff equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment kgh records provide hospitalized patient data day of admission day of discharge etc for suspected and confirmed cases of lf divided by age gender ethnic group location and other factors 1 we used data abstracted from patient medical charts and lf diagnostic tests for  suspected lassa cases presenting to the kgh lassa ward from  of april  to the  of january  among these subjects  fig 2 were confirmed as lf cases ie either subjects with acute infection tested positive lf using an antigen-based elisa approach or with recent lf tested positive to igm antibodies 1 these data correspond to the most accurate and complete set of patient records available at kgh april  was chosen as the lower endpoint for our study sample due to significant improvements in data quality these improvements are largely attributed to several nih-funded research projects to develop and improve the diagnostic tests for lf improvements in clinical data quality can be attributed to more comprehensive questionnaire forms and increased community outreach and surveillance activities we calculated the effective reproduction number based on the observed dates of onset of symptoms start and duration of exposure to the index cases and start and duration of exposure to all other cases this information was directly obtained from the literature 2 3 which provided detailed descriptions of the network of contacts fig 1 and s1 table in s2 text inspired by the work of wallinga and teunis 29 the relative likelihood  that case  has been infected by case  was calculated as1here  is the time of exposure of case  to case  while case  is infectious ie the interval  is given by the intersection  where  is the infectious period of case  calculated as the difference between the time  when the symptoms end either because the patient recovers or dies and the time  when the symptoms begin  is the duration of exposure of case  to case  provided by the literature 2 3 it is important to note that  and thus  is explicitly time-dependent fig 1d the index  represents all possible cases within a nosocomial outbreak important underlying assumptions are each event can independently start a new chain of human-to-human transmission beginning of infectiousness coincides with the onset of symptoms and infections occur with equal probability at any time during the interval  accordingly the sum  over all cases  represents the individual effective reproduction number for case  at the time  when the case arises if multiple cases are observed at the same time  then  is averaged appropriately to increase the sample size and improve the estimation the duration of the symptoms of lf and the period spent at the hospital associated with each patient were randomly rearranged among the  cases fig 1c then the ensemble average individual effective reproduction number was calculated based on  of these permutations the network of contacts was kept the same the identical approach was used to calculate the effective reproduction number  for the extra-nosocomial situation with the network of contacts restricted to the family     and  who presumably initiated the chain we use the notation  and  to indicate the set of all individual effective reproduction numbers for the nosocomial and extra-nosocomial cases respectively while the total effective reproduction numbers  and  represent the corresponding average number of cases during the entire outbreak ie
 and  respectively to adjust for the different duration expected in different outbreaks we calculate a daily mean effective reproduction number as  and  where  and  are the typical duration of the nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks the correctness of the approach was corroborated by performing the same analysis but by imposing that each case is exposed only to the index case for the situation in jos the individual reproduction numbers were zero for all cases except for  which results in  ie the only cases exposed to  and marked with a thin red line in fig 1 the distribution of the quantity  is interpreted as the distribution of the generation time ie the time between a primary case and a secondary case and it is presented in figs 3c and 3d see also figures s2 s3 s4 and s5 in s2 text following the approach of wallinga and teunis see 29 30 and their appendix for validation of the procedure the relative likelihood that case  has been infected by case  given their difference in time of symptom onset  approximated here as the difference in time of admission to hospital is then the likelihood that case  has been infected by case  normalized by the likelihood that case  has been infected by any other case 
2where  is the distribution for the generation interval and it is assumed to be the empirical distribution obtained from the nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks shown in figs 3c and 3d the effective reproduction number for case  is the sum over all cases  weighted by the relative likelihood that case  has been infected by case 
3
 this quantity depends on the time  when case  occurs the set of all  cases are obtained by the epidemic curve describing the daily number of reported cases by date of symptom onset fig 2  is the total number of reported cases underlying this calculation is the assumption that the spread of the disease occurs through human-to-human transmission only however a substantial proportion of cases  is expected to be due to zoonotic transmission ie only through contacts with the rodent population which can be considered as cases that have contracted infection from outside the population these therefore cannot be regarded as secondary-tertiary etc cases although they can initiate a human-to-human chain under these circumstances the effective reproduction number in equation 3 must be calculated by removing these  imported cases ie
4
 the set of all individual effective reproduction numbers is indicated by  while  is the total effective reproduction number ie
 where to simplify the notation we dropped the dependency on  this value represents the average number of cases during the entire epidemic compatible with the particular generation time as above we averaged to obtain the daily mean effective reproduction number  where  is the duration of the epidemics the calculations were carried out by using the r package r0 provided by obadia and co-authors 30 44 we compared two published outbreaks to illustrate the likely bounds of human to human transmission initially we assumed that the extent of human-to-human transmission in nosocomial outbreaks in jos and zorzor 2 3 represent the general situation in an endemic area alternatively we rejected this assumption and considered only the out of hospital human-to-human transmission in jos five from the same family     and  who initiated the chain as being representative of the general endemic situation we estimated the generation number and the mean nosocomial reproduction numbers for these two alternatives by imposing equality with the mean nosocomial reproduction numbers either  or  we inferred the proportion  to allow comparison with the effective reproduction number for the kenema data which by definition is based only on outbreaks where the primary case is assumed to be among those reported 29 the index patients  and  from the jos and zorzor outbreaks were assumed to be secondary cases to unreported human cases on the grounds of realism and also computational economy the epidemic curve from kgh fig 2 is assumed to be a collection of multiple chains of mean duration  rather than a 2-year long un-interrupted epidemic the starting times of each human-to-human chain were randomly chosen within the  year period of the kgh epidemic curve similarly as humans and rodents share the same physical space cross-species transmission can occur at any time thus the  imported cases were randomly chosen from the network of contacts for each value of  the ensemble sample of the simulations was  
figs 3a and 3b show the effective reproduction number for each patient for the two nosocomial outbreaks respectively as expected the largest values are associated with the index case  and  for the jos and zorzor outbreaks respectively in several cases however the effective reproduction number  particularly important is case  in the jos outbreak with an effective reproduction number  who most likely initiated extra-nosocomial transmission in her family 
fig 4 shows the total effective reproduction number  and its daily mean  for the cases in kgh vs the estimated proportion  of cases due to human-to-human transmission the shaded grey area covers the range between  and  percentiles arising from the  simulations for each value of  the predictions were then compared with the total effective reproduction number or with the equivalent daily mean in the nosocomial outbreaks  or  based on the full network of cases and with the extra-nosocomial cases in jos alone  or  for the full network of cases the mean nosocomial reproduction number was higher than the mean kgh one implying that the severe hospital outbreaks ought to be seen as exceptional circumstances in contrast the daily mean effective reproduction number arising from the jos extra-hospital cases due only to human-to-human transmission was entirely compatible with the daily mean kgh effective reproduction number if we allow a proportion of cases to be due to human-to-human transmission  based on the  and  percentiles in the predictions for the reproduction number  the lower and upper estimates for the proportion of human-to-human transmission are  and  respectively super-spreaders are individuals who can infect a disproportionately large pool of susceptibles 45 here super-spreading events are identified and quantified by analyzing how the effective reproduction number is distributed the distribution of the individual effective reproduction numbers for the jos and zorzor outbreaks based on the  permutations of the duration of illness is shown in fig 5a although  of the predictions for individual  there is a fat tailed distribution with extreme values of  similar patterns are observed for kgh cases for the individual effective reproduction number  as shown in fig 5b and 5c the distribution of the individual and total effective reproduction numbers  and  appears to have a fat-tailed distribution especially for larger values of  a simple approach to evaluate the risk of super-spreaders is to invoke the so-called 2080 rule whereby  of cases cause  of transmission see 45 46 to this end for different values of the contribution of human-to-human transmission  we calculated i the proportion of cases when  fig 6a and ii its proportional impact given by the expected relative number of secondary cases generated by this proportion see fig 6b for further explanations the maximum  in the simulations was also recorded for a contribution of human-to-human transmission in the region of  only  of realizations gave  but they are on average responsible for  of secondary cases with a maximum  in an extreme situation when the disease is transmitted only by humans  of cases are responsible for the  of secondary cases with a maximum  up to  which resembles the 2080 rule more sophisticated ways to assess the risk of super-spreaders are presented in the s2 text in particular we fitted the distribution for the individual effective reproduction number  from kgh with an exponential and a log-normal distribution the observed kgh distribution is fatter than the corresponding exponential fit although not as heavy as the log-normal furthermore we fitted two standard discrete distributions the poisson representative of thin-tailed distributions and the negative-binomial representative of fat-tailed distributions with the distribution for the integer part as we are considering discrete distributions of  ie the average number of cases during the entire epidemic as can be seen the last distribution is better fitted by a negative-binomial distribution especially for the tail s6 figure in s2 text different values for the typical duration of a human-to-human chain  were explored as expected the longer the duration  the larger the availability of susceptibles and the higher the effective reproduction number however when the effective reproduction number is rescaled by the duration of the epidemics ie the daily mean effective reproduction number  all the predictions are similar this can be seen by comparing the plots  in figs 4b  days 4d  days and s1 figure in s2 text  days based on this invariance we can infer the proportion  irrespective of the choice of the mean duration  provided that we know the typical duration of the nosocomial and extra-nosocomial chains  and  for the nosocomial case a reasonable choice is  days which is the average duration of nosocomial outbreaks observed in jos and zorzor hospitals  and  days respectively the last days correspond to when the last person developed symptoms for the extra-nosocomial chains the choice is less clear as the member of the family were already in contact with the index case  before she developed symptoms and shedding of the virus could happen any time before symptom onset therefore we made a conservative choice of  days which corresponds to the maximum duration of the jos outbreak here the last day corresponds to when case  recovered any shorter choice of the duration  will result in a larger value of the proportion  for instance if the typical duration of the outbreak is  days ie including while  was at the hospital we found that  instead of  while the estimates based on the intersection with the -percentile and -percentile were  and  respectively rather than  and  which reinforces the key message of this current work that a significant proportion of cases of lf arises from human-to-human transmission the robustness of the approach was tested by considering different distributions for the generation time we considered i the distribution of generation time arising from the entire network ii the distribution arising from the particular subset of the data corresponding to the extra-nosocomial cases     and  iii a gamma distribution with the same empirical mean and variance iv the empirical distribution by removing part of the tail v a stretched distribution by multiplying the empirical generation times by a factor  to allow for a longer shedding of the virus and vi a shrunk distribution by multiplying the empirical generation times by a factor  in general each of these methods had limited effects on the predictions see s2 figure in s2 text s3 figure in s2 text s4 figure in s2 text and s5 figure in s2 text the current model is based on the assumption that the distribution of the generation times observed in the extra-nosocomial outbreak is representative of the generation times in the sierra leonean situations this is probably reasonable but public health measures may impact on this in the future the predictions are based on the assumption of uniform mixing ie each case from kgh is potentially in contact with each other case although this is a reasonable assumption considering the large human mobility in sierra leone for livelihoods work and trade social visits and events 54 it will overestimate  in addition there is likely to be incomplete reporting which will underestimate  although the two factors might compensate for each other if kgh could reduce reporting bias and increase information on network contacts it would be highly beneficial to studies such as this especially as human mobility and overcrowding has been associated with an amplification of lf 31 this represents a further area where participatory modelingethnographic research is much needed to gather information on actual patterns of mobility and social networking and hence potential contact patterns other methods are possible for example cluster-based inference of the reproduction number see eg
55 56 is a promising approach in the current context kernis et al
20 provided detailed information on prevalence and risk factors of lassa eg history of collecting cutting and eating rats stratified by age in addition the age distribution from kgh is also available these data could be combined together to build a matrix of transmission rates among age-groups as done in 55 56 and between rodents and each age-group with values based on the findings of kernis et al
20 for the kgh data the difference in time of onset of symptoms was approximated here with the difference in time of visitreferral to the hospital following disease onset this assumption can be an important source of error as patterns of health seeking behavior might vary largely among the sierra leonean population for example a particular group of the population might favor traditional medicine and approach institutional health care only at a late stage of the disease patients from rural areas might be subjected to further delay due to poor infrastructure health seeking behavior is perhaps one the most fruitful areas where participatory modeling and ethnographic research have been successfully employed and should be considered in the present context the estimations here are based on the assumption that probability of cross-species transmission occurs at random throughout outbreaks although these events are expected to be strongly driven by a multitude of interacting causes including ecological eg seasonality in the abundance of the reservoir epidemiological eg seasonality in the prevalence of the pathogen genetic variation eg broad set of pathogen life histories and socio-economic eg the practice of burning the fields after harvesting affecting the ecology and dispersal patterns of m natalensis factors the estimation of the proportion of human-to-human transmission was based on the assumption that the typical duration of a chain of transmission is equal to the duration of the extra-nosocomial outbreak as this information was only approximately known we made the prudent choice that the duration of the extra-nosocomial outbreak was the entire extent of the outbreak in jos which was the maximum value from the data available this led to a conservative estimation of  despite some inevitable inaccuracies all of our alternativeadditional tests confirm that a significant proportion in the region of  or greater of the burden of lf is due to human-to-human transmission the basis of our work is that to the best of our knowledge the nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks in jos and zorzor were instances of pure human-to-human chains this is a message too important to be neglected despite some improvement in the implementation of barrier nursing in hospital structures there is no evidence that in the last decades prophylactic measures have significantly changed in ordinary situations as in households and villages and this issue has been abundantly clear during the current ebola outbreak in west africa it is therefore reasonable that chains of human-to-human transmission like the extra-nosocomial outbreak that occurred in jos more than 40 years ago are much more common than expected this study highlights the need for integrated one health approaches to model zoonoses more effectively in order to better-inform disease control and prevention zoonoses remain a neglected group of diseases under-prioritised in national and international health systems  clinical and transmission characteristics of covid-19 -a retrospective study of 25 cases from a single thoracic surgery department yang-kai li shu peng le-qun li qi wang wei ping ni zhang xiang-ning fu  the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 imposes a major challenge in managing patients undergoing surgical operation in this study we analyzed clinical and transmission features of 25 cases of covid-19 from a single thoracic department including 13 patients and 12 health care staff there were 13 males and 12 females the median age of the patients was 61 range 51 to 69 years the median age of the health care staff was 35 range 22 to 51 years by the end of follow-up date mar 3 2020 there were 16 non-severe cases 64 and 9 severe cases 36 5 cases were dead 20 nineteen 76 of the infected cases were confirmed by sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test the rest were clinically diagnosed as suspected covid-19 cases and 19 76 of the infected cases had positive exposure history we found that copd was significantly associated with severity and death p0040 and p0038 respectively and chest operation was significantly associated with death for covid-19 patients p0039 a potential super spreader may be the source of the transmission before the implementation of quarantine and comprehensive protection it was concluded that covid-19 is associated with poor prognosis for patients undergoing thoracic operation especially for those with copd implementation of comprehensive protective measures is important to control nosocomial infection  since corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 emerged in wuhan in december 2019 sars-cov-2 has infected more than 80 000 people with a large number of deaths across 60 countries worldwide people of all ages are susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection confirmed transmission routes include airborne and close contact fecal-oral route and aerosol transmission could not be excluded 1  hospital outbreaks of sars-cov-2 infection occurred in the early phase of epidemic when the disease was not recognized and before quarantine measures were implemented patients admitted in thoracic surgery department undergoing operation are commonly presented with pulmonary infections before or after thoracic operations in the early phase of epidemic the differential diagnosis between covid-19 and infections caused by other pathogens is not well recognized thus it is even more difficult to identify sars-cov2 infected patients and to take appropriate protective measures to prevent nosocomial infection in this study we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and transmission history of 25 cases of covid-19 in our department we explore the impact of sars-cov-2 infection on the prognosis of patients undergoing thoracic operation and transmission routes of coronavirus in thoracic surgery ward 205 patients admitted to the department of thoracic surgery of tongji hospital affiliated to tongji medical college of huazhong university of science and technology between january 1 2020 and february 20 2020 no new patients were admitted after february 20 2020 and 148 health care staff of thoracic surgery department were collected and retrospectively analyzed epidemiological investigation laboratory results ct imaging and sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test results were collected and a total of 25 cases including 13 hospitalized patients and 12 health care staff were included in the covid-19 study this study was approved by the medical ethics committee of tongji hospital affiliated to tongji medical college of huazhong university of science and technology tj-irb20200307 clinical medical records and telephone questionnaire were used to approach the clinical characteristics for all covid-19 cases temperature and ct imaging changes of all cases were analyzed and sars-cov-2 nucleic acid tests for suspected infected cases were further performed all infected health care staff had filled in questionnaires with time of exposure to covid-19 cases personal protective measures and clinical symptoms all covid-19 cases were followed up until mar 3 2020 and the statistical clinical characteristics included gender age basic diseases smoking history epidemic history surgery history surgical methods postoperative fever laboratory examination results during treatment sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test results ct imaging and the status at the last follow-up date according to the evidence of infection exposure history and pathway of moving beds in the wards the most likely time and route of infection were evaluated and speculated according to the diagnosis and treatment guideline of covid-19 version 70 from the national health commission of the peoples republic of china 1  there were four stages for covid-19 as follows 1 mild stage the clinical symptoms were mild and no signs of pneumonia were found on imaging 2 common stage fever respiratory tract and other symptoms imaging findings of pneumonia 3 severe stage 1 of the following criteria existed a shortness of breath respiratory rate 30 timesmin b in resting state oxygen saturation is less than 93 c pao 2  fio 2 300 mmhg ct imaging showed significant lesion progression 50 within 24 to 48 h 4 critical stage one of the following occurred a respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation b shock c complicated with other organ failure requiring icu care data analysis was performed using sas 92 software quantitative data were expressed as meansd and independent students t test was used for inter-group comparison the qualitative data were expressed as the number of cases percentage and the comparison between groups was conducted by fishers exact test the difference between the comparison groups was considered statistically significant if p005 total 25 cases of covid-19 were enrolled in the study among them 19 cases 76 were confirmed covid-19 by positive sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test and 6 cases 24 were considered as suspected covid-19 as diagnosed by clinical manifestations exposure history and ct examination thirteen 52 were hospitalized patients and 12 48 were health care staff the clinical characteristics of patients and staff were shown in table 1 several clinical features including gender age smoking history and copd showed significant difference between patients and health care staff the laboratory tests from patients and health care staff were shown in table 1 there were significant differences in white blood cell wbc count  9510 9 l ldh level d-d dimer level transaminase level and electrolyte disorder condition between those two groups p0001 p0005 p0015 p0005 and p0005 respectively all the cases received chest ct exams to evaluate the severity imaging findings of covid-19 patients are shown in fig 1  mild case presented single or multiple ground glass opacity ggo mainly in the dorsal or periphery part of the lung most common cases showed local or bilateral patchy shadowing with or without interstitial abnormalities in severe cases ct imaging showed rapidly increased size and density of lesions and diffused damage covered both lungs with air bronchogram and interstitial abnormalities white lung could been seen in severe or critical cases which predicted very poor prognosis all confirmed sars-cov-2 infected cases were under quarantine and received treatment by the end of the follow-up date mar 3 2020 there were 9 cases 36 of severe type and 5 deaths 20 all the dead cases were from hospitalized postoperative patient group there was significant difference in vital status between postoperative patients and health care staff p0039 and age and copd were significantly associated with disease severity p0041 and p0040 respectively and death p0015 and p0038 respectively for covid-19 patients among all covid-19 cases 19 76 cases had traceable positive exposure history including 8 patients with a spatiotemporal correlation of close contact adjacent bed and 11 health care staff the average days of exposure to the onset of fever temperature  373c was 5947 days for patient group and 3919 days for health care staff group and no significant difference was found between them p0220 nineteen of those infected cases had positive results for sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test four out of 19 cases had no traceable exposure history according to the exposure history nosocomial infection transmission routes are shown in fig 2a  we found a potential preoperative sars-cov-2 carriers patient 01 patient 01 had a localized ground glass change on ct scan on january 3 2020  fig 1c  but he had no fever until the first day after operation two days later his ct scan showed severe infection in both lungs and rapidly progressive legion  fig 1c  patient 01 died five days after the operation during the hospitalization of patient 01 8 health care staff had positive exposure with him and fever occurred within 3 to 8 days after exposure six of them were confirmed sars-cov-2 infection additionally 5 post-operational patients had positive exposure with patient 01 fever occurred within 2 to 10 days after exposure and all of them had positive results for sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test as a result total 11 cases with a positive exposure with patient 01 were diagnosed as sars-cov-2 infection  fig 2b  according to the report of chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc 2  by february 11 2020 there were 44 672 patients diagnosed as covid-19 the severe type accounted for 191 and the mortality rate was 23 in our department severe type accounted for 538 713 and the morality rate was 308 413 which was significantly higher than the reported results meanwhile 154 213 of the infected health care staff were in severe stage slightly lower than the reported result the age smoking history and comorbidities could all contribute to the different outcome of covid-19 between patients and health care staff in our study we found that chest operation was significantly associated with death in coivd-19 patients and copd is significantly associated with severe covid-19 and death operation would lead to lung function impairment and decreased immunity these results indicate that sars-cov-2 infection is severe after thoracic operations and could lead to a poor outcome liu et al found that crp ldh and lymphocyte count may be predictors of the severity of lung injury 3  however there is no significant correlation between the laboratory results and the severity of covid-19 jiang et al reported that pct was increased in covid-19 patients undergoing thoracic surgery 4  in our study an increase of pct was not observed in covid-19 patients the discrepancy may be explained by small sample size covid-19 is mainly manifested as fever accompanied by cough fatigue muscular soreness chest depression shortness of breath diarrhea and other symptoms 1  postoperative patients may also have fever cough and chest condition which should be differentiate from covid-19 postoperative infection is mainly due to insufficient drainage and mostly caused by bacteria commonly occurring 3 to 7 days after operation accompanied with cough with sputum elevated wbc count while most covid-19 patients had normal or reduced wbc count and lower lymphocyte count early chest ct of covid-19 shows localized ground glass shadows and interstitial changes which are mainly in the dorsal or periphery part of the lung 5  furthermore multiple infiltrating shadows and lung consolidation can be seen in both lungs pleural effusion is rare in severe cases 6 7  some early covid-19 may present as single or multiple ggo-like changes which needs to be identified from lung cancer 8  some mild covid-19 may progress to severe stage within a few days and repeated chest ct is necessary sars-cov-2 is highly infectious and is susceptible to all populations respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main transmission routes and aerosol transmission is also possible 1  infected patient is the main source of transmission even in asymptomatic stage thoracic surgery requires patients to do respiratory function exercise after operation including productive cough cough training will produce a large a 38-years-old man a small patch of mixed ggo was first observed in his right upper lobe then the lesion was markedly progressed in the extent and density january 30 2020 and 12 days later the lesion was completely absorbed after treatment february 11 2020 b 30-yearsold man the initial chest ct showed single ggo in his right lower lobe january 23 2020 and the first followup ct demonstrated multiple ggos and extensive consolidations in the bilateral lower lobes meanwhile the patient had normal body temperature without dyspnea february 2 2020 after supportive treatments most of lesions were markedly absorbed but the rt-pcr test of sars-cov-2 was still positive february 14 2020 c 63-year-old man a patch of pure ggo and subpleural interstitial changes were observed before the operation january 3 2020 multiple patches were found 2 days after the operation january 19 2020 and the disease was rapidly progressed appearing as multiple ggos with crazy-paving sign and consolidations january 21 2020 d 56-year-old woman chest ct was normal before the surgery january 15 2020 multiple patches of consolidations and ggos were found in bilateral lungs february 7 2020 indicating a disease progression chest x-ray showed white lung february 24 2020 before death amount of droplets and aerosols to the surrounding space which can increase efficacy of exposure to et al 9 found that sputum was an important source of transmission therefore covid-19 patients are highly contagious in department of thoracic surgery tuite et al 10 found that the average basic infection number r0 of sars-cov-2 was 23 on january 24 2020 and the effective infection number re was reduced to 15 after effective protective measures were taken on february 3 2020 therefore effective protective measures can reduce r0 however with daily standard protection equipment health care staff are highly susceptible to covid-19 11  we suggest thoracic surgeons should delay the selective operation and confine operation and strictly grasp the indications of emergency operation during the outbreak asymptomatic patients should be concerned and routine blood test chest ct and sars-cov-2 nucleic acid examination should be performed before emergency surgery super spreader indicates patient potentially transmits infection to more than 10 people to our knowledge no super spreader has been reported in china yet retrospective analysis of 25 cases of covid-19 in our department revealed 11 sars-cov-2 infected cases with traceable exposure history with patient 01 patient 01 was a 63-year-old smoking male with lung cancer who had copd the preoperative evaluation of lung function is sufficient for lobectomy before the operation was performed his ct image showed a patch opacity in the right lung and interstitial abnormalities in both lungs the early signs of covid-19 he was misdiagnosed before operation eleven confirmed covid-19 cases occurred after the operation date of patient 01 most likely due to aerosol and droplets generated from his cough due to insufficient preparation inappropriate protective measures were implemented at the beginning of outbreak and caused a large number of infection among hospitalized patients and health care staff unfortunately patient 01 had rapid progression and died from respiratory failure 5 days after operation he was considered as a super spreader in the outbreak of sars-cov-2 infection in our department in summary sars-cov-2 is highly contagious hospitalized patients and health care staff in the epidemic are at high risk of infection patients infected with covid-19 in perioperative period have high risk of death therefore implementing comprehensive protective measures such as quarantine and disinfection are essential to control nosocomial infection  middle east respiratory syndrome mers in asia lessons gleaned from the south korean outbreak poh lim lian   the first case of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov was reported in 20121 over the past 3 years sporadic travel-associated importations occurred to countries in europe north africa and asia and cases continued to smoulder in saudi arabia2 but the risk assessment by most experts was that mers-cov was a low risk for causing a pandemic34 with a reproductive number ro estimated at close to 10 by some experts mers-cov was considered unlikely to propagate enough to cause a large outbreak5 however before 2014 a similar argument could have been made for the likelihood of a large outbreak of ebolain over four decades ebola had never caused more than several hundred cases at worst it appears that the disclaimer made for financial investments applies equally well to emerging infectionspast experience is no guarantee of future performance on 4 may 2015 a 68-year-old korean man returned from travel in the middle east he became symptomatic on 11 may and sought medical attention on 12 may he was admitted and discharged then re-admitted at a second hospital where the diagnosis of mers-cov infection was confirmed on 20 may6 in the week before diagnosis this index case was not suspected to have mers-cov and therefore his caregivers did not use appropriate isolation precautions and personal protective equipment as a result of this critical lapse south korea experienced a large outbreak and is now the country with the second largest number of mers-cov cases in the world after saudi arabia as of 23 july 2015 this outbreak stands at 186 cases with 36 deaths and a case fatality rate of 197 south korea appears to be on track to declare the outbreak over by august 2015 after completing two incubation periods without new cases over 16 000 individuals had to be quarantined for potential exposure and over 30 healthcare facilities had to undergo investigations for possible mers-cov transmission this outbreak caused considerable anxiety in asia because one of the second generation cases travelled to china guangzhou and hong kong requiring strenuous contact tracing efforts of fellow airplane passengers and others exposed to the patient as a result countries around the region issued travel warnings stepped up screening efforts and activated thermal scanners for incoming passengers from south korea this outbreak took a substantial toll on south korea economically and politically in addition to the human impact the question still remains why did this mers-cov outbreak occur in south korea when the preceding 3 years had seen multiple other importations that did not result in an outbreak even in less developed countries a who team led by dr keiji fukuda was dispatched to investigate this outbreak8 initial concerns about viral mutation resulting in a more transmissible pathogen were not borne out by viral sequencing data the concept of super-spreaders was again mooted for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars veterans watching this outbreak unfold a sense of dj vu prevailed these events reinforced five key observations and learning points box 1 with over a billion individuals travelling annually the risk of emerging infections crossing borders is a reality that needs to be managed with calibrated sensible approaches south koreas experience illustrates the ongoing need for a high level of vigilance to control emerging infections for which no preventive vaccines or proven specific therapies are available classical outbreak control measures are still requiredtransmission can be terminated by isolating infectious cases and quarantining exposed individuals during the incubation period suspect cases must be cared for with appropriate precautions in order to protect hospital staff visitors and other patients all of whom would inadvertently become vectors for spread if infected super-spreaders are a myth rather than a mystery it is more appropriate to speak of super-spreading incidents which occur because an individual is not suspected to have infection the number of secondary cases increases proportionate to the duration that an individual remains out of isolation after symptoms develop medical procedures that aerosolise viral particles further increase the likelihood of super-spreading incidents decisive action is required to stop outbreaks the 20142015 ebola outbreak in west africa demonstrates what can happen if rapid coordinated action is not taken early enough and has resulted in calls for a global health emergency workforce this role is currently filled by who and the global outbreak alert and response network goarn but they need more resources to strengthen outbreak response and build capacity this outbreak also underscores one other critical component to managing outbreakscommunications at the speed of trust unlike sars in 2003 mers is occurring in a different milieu in 2015 social media must be reckoned with clear consistent and accurate communications becomes ever more important to maintain credibility for governments and health authorities9 south koreas early decision to withhold the names of mers-affected hospitals caused more anxiety loss of confidence and proved ultimately futile in the aftermath of south koreas outbreak preparedness efforts in asia were ramped up in many countries in asia in singapore health advisories for travellers to and from korea and border screening with thermal scanners were implemented along with the usual circulars to all healthcare facilities and doctors to increase vigilance for travel-related importations tan tock seng hospital and the communicable disease centre are the designated facilities in singapore for outbreak management including ebola mers-cov and avian influenza over the past 3 years our hospital has evaluated over 300 patients who either walked in themselves or were referred by a doctor for possible mers-cov infection our emergency department doctors balance the risk of missing a case with the challenges of admitting reluctant patients to isolation rooms which are a finite resource for front-line clinicians without the luxury of hindsight knowledge of the case definitions pneumonia plus travel exposure is balanced by awareness that the spectrum of disease includes mild infection clinical presentations may evolve and upper respiratory samples may not detect infection especially early in the course of illness10 what happened in south korea could happen in any country in asiaour task is to stop the outbreak before it happens these emerging infection outbreaks reinforce the need to stay vigilant and to invest in capacity building to detect and respond quickly to outbreaks with effective decisive actions global health security requires this commitment from every country because

woolliams a a doeschl-wilson   host genetic diversity affects infectious disease risk and impact keeling 1999 doeschl-wilson et al 2011 heritable genetic variation in susceptibility ie an individuals propensity of becoming infected when exposed to infectious material is ubiquitous and many genetic selection schemes in livestock and plants target reduction in host susceptibility heringstad et al 2000 kover and schaal 2002 bishop et al 2010 houston et al 2010 dos santos et al 2016 banos et al 2017 a second host trait affecting disease spread and severity that has been considered in epidemiology is the hosts infectivity read and taylor 2001 geenen et al 2004 keeling and danon 2009 brooks-pollock et al 2015 which refers to the ability of an individual once infected to transmit infection in livestock breeding individual variation in infectivity has not yet been exploited for disease control individual variation in host infectivity has been observed in cases of super-spreaders where a small fraction of highly infectious individuals generates disproportionally many new infections those have been described through the pareto principle where 20 of infected individuals are responsible for 80 of transmission events woolhouse et al 1997 lloyd-smith et al 2005 super-spreading has been observed on a phenotypic level and is often attributed to social behaviour or heterogeneous contact structure for example in measles paunio et al 1998 sars and ebola shen et al 2004 wong et al 2015 in humans in salmonella typhimurium infection in mice gopinath et al 2014 and in rna-virus infections in bird species jankowski et al 2013 the existence of super-spreaders has also been inferred in epidemiological models for bovine tuberculosis in cattle ohare et al 2014 super-spreading has often been attributed to characteristics of the pathogens rather than the hosts for example in escherichia coli infection in cattle chase-topping et al 2008 however emerging evidence suggests that infectivity and super-spreading may be also partly controlled by host genetics geenen et al 2004 doeschl-wilson et al 2011 2018 lyall et al 2011 raszek et al 2016 anacleto et al 2018 those findings imply that individuals can evolve different disease response types affecting disease spread and offer new opportunities for genetic disease control that go beyond the reduction of disease susceptibility doeschl-wilson et al 2018 tsairidou et al 2018b by using individual genetic risk estimates for infectivity it may be possible to prevent or mitigate epidemics in livestock populations through reducing the presence of super-spreaders epidemiological simulation models have shown that removal of super-spreaders would be an effective means for reducing epidemic severity lloyd-smith et al 2005 however identification of highly infectious individuals prior to or during the early stages of epidemics is extremely difficult in practice hence such models can realistically only predict the impact of removing super-spreaders as reactive disease control in contrast genetic disease control schemes are pro-active ie preventive as individuals can be selected based on genotypic information that can be collected at any stage ie without the need of being exposed to infectious material however such genetic selection programmes usually operate on longer time-scales over generations of selection compared to those usually considered in epidemiological models in epidemiology the impact of realistic long-term pro-active genetic disease control either alone or in combination with other control strategies has rarely been assessed the epidemiological benefits of genetic selection for reduced infectivity are thus currently unknown until recently estimating host genetic effects for infectivity from epidemiological data was not possible as standard genetic evaluation tools routinely used in livestock industry do not fully capture genetic variance in infectivity lipschutz-powell et al 2012a 2012b anche et al 2015 both susceptibility and infectivity are expressed through interactions between infected and non-infected individuals and when subject to heritable variation represent indirect genetic effects ige lipschutz-powell et al 2012a anche et al 2015 baud et al 2017 for iges the phenotype of an individual depends on its own genetics and on the genetics of other individuals in the same contact-group in other words for infectious diseases an individuals infection status depends on its own genetic susceptibility and the genetic infectivity of its infected group-mates which also depends on their genetic susceptibility hence infectivity is not directly observable and on a phenotypic level is confounded with susceptibility as both affect the infection status of group-members thus infectivity and susceptibility are latent traits that need to be inferred through available often incomplete epidemic data conventional ige models that have proved adequate for production traits bergsma et al 2008 bouwman et al 2010 fail to capture the dynamic non-linear nature of disease processes lipschutz-powell et al 2013 anche et al 2015 biemans et al 2017 however recent breakthroughs in statistical inference methods can now provide reliable estimates of genetic effects for both infectivity and susceptibility from inferred infection times without requiring direct observation of an infectivity phenotype pooley 2014 anacleto et al 2015 anche et al 2015 biemans et al 2017 this implies that one can select directly on the traits that drive the epidemiology rather than on the observed infection status with the necessary methodology developed it is timely and relevant to consider the potential benefits arising from adding infectivity as a new disease phenotype into genetic analyses in the context of livestock production the question arises whether incorporating this additional phenotype would make a sufficiently valuable contribution to current breeding schemes in other words what is the expected impact of additionally selecting for lower infectivity on future disease prevalence and possibility of disease eradication genetic variation in iges has been shown to affect the magnitude andor direction of response to selection in breeding schemes bijma et al 2007 ellen et al 2007 bergsma et al 2008 bijma and wade 2008 degrd and olesen 2011 and it has been suggested that exploiting iges in animal breeding can substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in the trait of interest degrd et al 2011 anche et al 2014b sae-lim and bijma 2016 however the benefits of genetic selection for both reduced susceptibility and infectivity on practical epidemiological field measures such as disease prevalence and duration of epidemics that are commonly used for assessing economic losses and guide the development of effective often multi-faceted disease control strategies are currently not known this is because the relationship between host genetic susceptibility infectivity and the practical field outcomes of epidemics is non-linear this non-linearity arises from the equations underlying the dynamic progression of epidemics over time so that for example a small change in susceptibility and infectivity can result in changing the expectation whether an epidemic will occur or not doeschl-wilson et al 2011 therefore the practical impact of combining both susceptibility and infectivity in selection schemes in one or more generations cannot be estimated by standard index theory which assumes linearity and additional epidemiological approaches are needed to model the dynamic non-linear epidemic processes a key epidemiological measure for assessing the impact of disease interventions on epidemic risk and infection incidence is the basic reproductive ratio r0 ie the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual in a completely susceptible population diekmann et al 1990 r0 has a threshold value of one which determines whether a disease outbreak can occur when r0 is smaller than one the epidemic will die out whereas when r0 is greater than one major outbreaks can arise diekmann et al 1990 lipschutz-powell et al 2012a suggested that selection on breeding values for direct and indirect effects reduces r0 while anche et al 2014a theoretically demonstrated for single gene models that heritable variation in both host susceptibility and infectivity contribute to and can be utilised for reducing r0 the aim of this proof-of-concept study was to develop a quantitative modelling framework that predicts the benefits of genetic selection for reduced infectivity in addition to reduced susceptibility on epidemic risk and severity and how these depend on the genetic variance selection accuracy and intensity for this purpose a geneticepidemiological model was developed to combine classical quantitative genetics theory with epidemiological prediction specifically polygenic genetic variation in susceptibility and infectivity was incorporated in a stochastic epidemiological susceptible-infected-recovered sir model to simulate epidemics in large livestock populations undergoing artificial genetic selection for lower susceptibility and infectivity over several generations the resulting model was then used to assess the efficacy of diverse genetic selection schemes targeting host susceptibility and infectivity in preventing disease outbreaks and reducing disease prevalence in the initial population true breeding values for offspring i were calculated from eqs 3 and 4 sire and dam true breeding values were distributed as documentclass12ptminimal

susceptibility and infectivity trait values where the sum was over all group mates of individual j that were infected at time t anacleto et al 2015 the above equation for the infection rate demonstrates that reduction in individual susceptibility or infectivity reduces individuals infection rates and hence the incidence of infection in the population according to this formulation

of the density-dependent force of infection t  it where it is the number of infected individuals at time t keeling and rohani 2008 recovery events were assumed to follow an exponential distribution with equal recovery rate  for all individuals table 1 simulations of the epidemics comprised calculations of inter-event times corresponding event types and individual experiencing the transition to the next sir compartment those were performed using gillespies direct algorithm gillespie 1977 as outlined in more detail in lipschutz-powell et al 2012a anacleto et al 2015 sir profiles that show proportions of susceptible infected and recovered individuals during the course of the epidemics were produced to qualitatively assess the changes in the profiles of the generated epidemics due to selection the generated profiles over generations were compared between different selection schemes including either susceptibility alone or both susceptibility and infectivity epidemic risk was assessed over subsequent generations of selection through the basic reproductive ratio r0 and through the proportion of epidemics that occurred firstly estimates of changes in the basic reproductive ratio r0 over generations of selection were obtained through stochastic simulations in those epidemics were simulated following the sir model as described in the section within-group epidemic transmission model incorporating genetic variation in susceptibility and infectivity but with the difference that in each group only the index case was allowed to infect other susceptible individuals this produced a simulated r0 for every group summary r0 values per generation were obtained by calculating the mean and the median of the simulated r0 values across groups for each generation although the mean r0 is more in line with the classical definition of r0 eg diekmann et al 1990 the distribution of r0 values over groups was skewed due to the random allocation of individuals with different skewed susceptibility and infectivity values into groups hence the median over groups of the simulated r0 values termed herein realised r0 was used as a more appropriate summary statistic in the present analysis finally the overall mean of the summary r0 statistic per generation with standard errors were calculated over 50 replicates the overall trends of decline over generations of selection for the mean r0 were similar to those for the median supplementary information 1 secondly the mean proportion of epidemics that occurred ie the proportion of epidemics where the index case generated secondary cases was calculated for each generation this allowed to explore how often epidemics with r0  1 occur presented values are the means with standard errors over 50 replicates for the groups where epidemics occurred ie where the index cases generated secondary cases epidemic severity was assessed over subsequent generations of selection through the proportion of infected animals and through the epidemic duration firstly the mean proportion of infected individuals was calculated across the groups with at least one secondary case means and standard errors were obtained over 50 replicates after excluding replicates where all groups had only the index case infected secondly the epidemic duration was calculated for each group as the time-point when there were no remaining infected individuals in the group the 33 and 66 percentiles of the duration of epidemics in the base generation after excluding groups where no epidemics occurred were used to classify epidemics as short medium and long the changes in the mean proportions of no short medium and long epidemics with standard errors were assessed over generations parameters were chosen to represent population structures and routine genetic evaluations realistic for the livestock industry and disease epidemics that may emerge within livestock production systems so that both assumed and predicted values were realistic for those systems as follows genetic variance in susceptibility and infectivity is a driving parameter for the genetic gain that can be achieved in those traits from selection furthermore genetic variance in susceptibility and infectivity affects epidemic risk and severity through its effect on the infection rate see section within-group epidemic transmission model incorporating genetic variation in susceptibility and infectivity hence driving the resulting r0 see section epidemic risk therefore different levels of genetic and environmental variation were simulated such that the resulting r0 values represented mild and severe epidemics respectively see section epidemic risk documentclass12ptminimal

				begindocumentsigma ag2  sigma af2  02enddocumentag2af202 genetic variances simulated results for genetic variance of 02 are shown in supplementary information 2 response to genetic selection in susceptibility and infectivity generated a profile of decline in the mean population susceptibility and infectivity over generations which was faster within earlier generations as expected from selection using the assumed parameter values see supplementary information 3 in the base generation before selection the mean realised r0 over replicates was 764 when assuming a genetic variance of 05 and 199 for a genetic variance of 02 over generations realised r0 declined due to genetic selection the selection scheme combining susceptibility and infectivity considerably reduced the number of generations required until realised r0 was 1 ie until disease eradication compared to selection on susceptibility alone fig 3 specifically for the genetic variance of 05 selection on susceptibility required seven generations to bring the realised r0 from 764 to a value below 1 fig 3 in contrast combined selection with the same selection intensities and accuracies for susceptibility and infectivity required three generations to bring the realised r0 below 1 fig 3 selecting on infectivity alone produced similar changes in epidemic risk as selecting on susceptibility alone fig3 for example both 50 selection on susceptibility alone or 50 selection on infectivity alone reduced the realised r0 below 1 after seven generations of selection fig3 for lower genetic variance of 02 resulting in lower realised r0 in the base generation fewer generations were generally required until disease eradication although the actual rate of decline in r0 was lower compared to that corresponding to larger genetic variance for genetic variance of 02 there was a one-generation difference between selection schemes considering susceptibility or infectivity alone and combined selection including infectivity fig 3 when applying less stringent selection intensity for infectivity 80 selection for infectivity corresponding to removing only designated super-spreaders and for the genetic variance of 05 selection on both susceptibility and infectivity with selection accuracies of 07 required four generations to reduce the realised r0 below 1 compared to three generations required with higher selection intensity the biggest difference was observed for selection on infectivity alone which with only 80 selection required 15 generations to reduce the realised r0 below 1 fig 3 even with this less stringent selection scheme for infectivity incorporating infectivity in addition to susceptibility achieved disease eradication within four generations compared to seven generations required for selection on susceptibility alone fig 3 the change in epidemic risk due to selection was also assessed by examining the proportion of groups that resulted in an epidemic with at least one secondary case generated by the index case in the base generation for genetic variance of 05 on average 72 of groups had at least one secondary case fig 4 after seven generations of combined selection for susceptibility and infectivity the proportion of epidemics occurring was reduced by at least 50 while selection on susceptibility alone required 13 generations to achieve the same outcome fig 4 it required 15 generations of combined selection to reduce epidemic risk below 5 whereas with selection only on susceptibility or only on infectivity it was not possible to achieve this result within the 20 generation duration of the selection scheme even with lower selection accuracies for infectivity eg 02 a significant reduction of disease risk was achieved with combined selection fig 4 similar patterns were observed for the genetic variance of 02 where combined selection with accuracy of 07 for both susceptibility and infectivity generated a significantly greater reduction in the proportion of epidemics occurring compared to selection on susceptibility alone fig 4 in the epidemics that occurred genetic selection also produced a non-linear reduction in the proportion of infected individuals such that the greatest benefit was observed within the first few generations fig 5 for genetic variance of 05 after three generations of combined selection for susceptibility and infectivity with accuracies of 07 for both traits the average proportion of infected individuals was reduced by at least 50 it required six generations of selection on susceptibility alone or on infectivity alone to reduce this proportion by the same amount even when selection accuracy for infectivity was low eg 02 there was a significant improvement with combined selection compared to selection on susceptibility or on infectivity alone fig 5 for smaller genetic variance of 02 the average proportion of infected individuals was lower and differences between selection scenarios with respect to different selection accuracies were less pronounced fig 5 nevertheless two generations of combined selection were sufficient for reducing the proportion of infected individuals by at least 50 while selection on susceptibility alone or infectivity alone required five generations selection reduced the duration of epidemics with no long epidemics observed after 10 generations of combined selection notably selection on susceptibility alone required 20 generations to achieve the same outcome table 2 similar trends were observed in results for the genetic variance of 02 and those are shown in supplementary information 4 susceptibility to infectious diseases in livestock has commonly been found to be a complex polygenic trait for example in bovine mastitis heringstad et al 2000 and bovine tuberculosis bermingham et al 2014b tsairidou et al 2014 in sea lice infection in atlantic salmon tsai et al 2016 and in nematode infections kemper et al 2011 riggio et al 2013 and footrot mucha et al 2015 in sheep hence here latent susceptibility and infectivity were modelled as quantitative traits assuming polygenic genetic variation in the present study selection was modelled on the latent objective traits ie susceptibility and infectivity rather than indicator traits based on disease phenotypes selection on these latent traits has the benefit that they directly affect individual infection rates and hence disease incidence in the population eq 5 uncertainty in the traits was accounted for by simulating a range of selection accuracies the selection methodology followed in this study is in line with independent culling levels selection tallis 1962 vinson 1971 which is commonly practiced in cattle and sheep breeding and is effective in excluding animals with particularly poor ebv for a trait of interest independent culling may not be the optimum method and is less efficient than a linear index when the selection goal is a linear combination of the traits although this is not the case here in the present study a genetic correlation of zero was assumed between susceptibility and infectivity while the impact of such correlations was explored in supplementary information 5 one might expect a positive phenotypic correlation between susceptibility and infectivity due to the dependency of expressing infectivity upon being susceptible and infected however that does not imply the sign and magnitude of the underlying genetic correlation rauw et al 1998 a strong positive genetic correlation would indicate that susceptibility to infection and infectivity are controlled by the same set of genes however to the best of the authors knowledge there is no evidence suggesting that whether an individual becomes infected is regulated by the same genetic pathways as those controlling the transmission of infection therefore susceptibility and infectivity should be considered as two genetically separable traits as expected with a favourable genetic correlation between susceptibility and infectivity combining these traits generated a smaller additional benefit compared to selecting only on susceptibility supplementary information 5 fig s5 left panel this is due to the indirect correlated response arising in infectivity even when selection is on susceptibility alone a positive correlation implies that individuals with lower susceptibility also tend to have lower infectivity and selection against these individuals accelerates reduction in disease risk and prevalence conversely when susceptibility and infectivity were antagonistically correlated there was a substantial delay in the progress achieved by the selection scheme considering only susceptibility however considering both susceptibility and infectivity in the selection scheme helped alleviate this delay supplementary information 5 fig s5 right panel such adverse correlations have been previously observed for example between milk yield and fertility traits in dairy cattle wall et al 2003 or in cases of competition over resource allocation rauw et al 1998 read and taylor 2001 therefore particularly in the case of an unfavourable genetic correlation between susceptibility and infectivity estimating effects for both these traits can be crucial to avoid an undesirable increase in infectivity which could counteract or even outweigh the benefits of selection for reduced susceptibility compartmental susceptible-infected-recovered models have been commonly used to represent the spread of a large class of infections with prolonged immunity anderson and may 1992 and the model presented here directly applies to many microparasite infections this modelling approach can be extended to macroparasite infections by additionally modelling the infection severity and reproduction cycle of the parasite within the host bishop and stear 1999 doeschl-wilson et al 2008 this model can also be extended to represent infections featuring more compartments eg a latency compartment or to accommodate genetic variation in more traits in addition to susceptibility and infectivity that may also affect the transmission dynamics nevertheless the benefits arising from combined selection on susceptibility and infectivity would still be expected to be substantial a further effect observed from the sir profiles was that although after generations of selection epidemics were generally fewer and milder in some replicates they were prolonged ending at a later time-point compared to epidemics in the base generation in epidemiology it is known that epidemics with lower average transmission coefficient are less severe but can often be prolonged keeling and rohani 2008 here the same effect was generated by the change in the infection rate over generations due to selection reducing susceptibility and infectivity response to genetic selection for indirect genetic effects such as infectivity has been shown to depend on the size of the epidemiological groups bijma 2010a degrd and olesen 2011 anacleto et al 2015 group size is an important factor in planning livestock management practices to optimise disease control and in designing disease challenge experiments as shown in supplementary information 6 combined selection incorporating both susceptibility and infectivity performs better than selection on susceptibility alone even for a smaller group size however the infectivity of early infected individuals eg the randomly chosen index case in our simulations has a larger influence on disease spread in smaller groups and thus on the response to selection achieved some studies have suggested that for indirect genetic effects within-group and between-group genetic covariance ie relatedness can increase response to selection bijma 2010a degrd and olesen 2011 anche et al 2014a the widespread use of artificial insemination in farmed animal allows popular sires to have a large number of offspring within and across farms as a consequence benefits in practice may be higher than for the random allocation assumed here the observed response to selection may also be influenced in practice by the reduction of selection accuracy as disease prevalence declines and by potential changes in the covariance between susceptibility and infectivity that may emerge over generations such effects can be minimised by the use of genomic data and large training datasets to reduce the role of phenotypes and maintain the statistical power over generations by employing classic genetic disease control strategies which only target reduced host susceptibility to disease it may not be possible to tackle within a reasonable time-scale diseases with large r0 and diseases with no or very small genetic variance in host susceptibility in diseases with r0 much larger than one selection on susceptibility alone might not be sufficient to reduce r0 and achieve disease eradication within a reasonable number of generations for a breeding scheme mackenzie and bishop 2001 bishop et al 2010 similarly the genetic gain achieved would not be of practical value if there was very limited genetic variation in susceptibility available for selection however the results of this study reveal that when subject to heritable variation infectivity could complement susceptibility to accelerate progress in selection schemes or could be an alternative disease-related target-trait for genetic disease control infectivity as an indirect genetic effect is likely to have been under weaker natural selection pressure compared to direct genetic effects therefore there might be more genetic variation in infectivity available for artificial selection compared to susceptibility bijma 2010b infection incidence is expected to evolve also due to natural selection and not only due to artificial selection as considered here the framework of this study could help to investigate the role of evolution in changing genetic variances and covariances in susceptibility and infectivity which drive evolution in disease dynamics evolutionary studies have long recognised that the risk of infection has different components elderd et al 2008 namely a the risk of infection given exposure which encompasses variation in host susceptibility and b the risk of exposure which encompasses variation in host infectivity furthermore the breeders equation used in this study to calculate response to selection in host susceptibility and infectivity over successive generations is commonly used in animal breeding to predict response to artificial selection however in studies considering natural selection it has been previously suggested that the traits of interest might be correlated with other components which may have not been explicitly accounted for but which may also affect variation in fitness and this may have an impact on the response to selection as predicted by the breeders equation morrissey et al 2010 for example the present simulations do not consider co-evolution between the host and the pathogen which likely affects infection risk cooperation or competition between individuals sharing the same social environment also evolve through natural or artificial selection and that affects the variance in the target traits marjanovic et al 2018 in evolutionary biology terms selection for lower infectivity may enhance cooperation between the focal individual and its social partners to avoid or survive infection and hence affect variation in infectivity for example in plants selection for less competitive phenotypes has led to more uniform crops austin et al 1980 denison et al 2003 the benefits from selection considering infectivity in addition to susceptibility can be particularly strong in the presence of genetic super-spreaders which would not be captured by selection for susceptibility alone unless this trait is strongly correlated with infectivity using genetic information ie infectivity breeding values super-spreaders could be identified hence eliminating a major source of infection for other animals in zoonotic diseases such as bovine tuberculosis or diseases where environmental contamination influences the risk of infection such as footrot and nematode infestations in sheep removing super-spreaders would reduce the shedding of pathogens to wildlife disease vectors or into the environment doeschl-wilson et al 2011 tsairidou et al 2018a in conclusion host infectivity in addition to susceptibility was found to constitute an important trait to target in future genetic and genomic selection schemes to reduce the impact of epidemics in livestock populations more efficiently combined selection for reduced susceptibility and infectivity generated a greater reduction in epidemic risk severity and duration and with beneficial outcomes of selection emerging earlier compared to selection targeting susceptibility alone advances in genomic technologies and novel statistical methods make it now feasible to determine genetic effects for novel traits that have a substantial impact on infectious disease prevalence but are difficult to measure such as host infectivity therefore genetic variation in infectivity and its potential benefits for genetic evaluations should be further investigated the framework proposed here helps predict the impact of artificial selection on future disease dynamics and can facilitate investigation of the role of evolution  understanding of covid19 based on current evidence pengfei sun xiaosheng lu chao xu wenjuan sun bo pan   sarscov2 is a coronavirus and belongs to the coronavirus cluster covid19 is the third known zoonotic coronavirus disease after sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers sarscov and merscov also belong to the coronavirus cluster
3
 zhu et al
4
 confirmed that sarscov2 was a new coronavirus belonging to the subgenus botulinum of coronaviridae according to the current data
5
 the early covid19 cases were related to the huanan seafood market and the possibility of humantohuman transmissions could not be ruled out the who report claimed that the sarscov2 could be detected in the environmental samples collected from the seafood market but it has not yet been determined if a specific animal species carries the sarscov2 a study by ji et al
6
 showed that the sarscov2 was a chimeric virus between a bat coronavirus and a coronavirus of unknown origin by comparing with other animals they found that snakes are the most likely wildlife repository for the sarscov2
6
 the research by benvenuto et al
7
 showed that the sarscov2 was only closely related to the coronavirus isolated from chinese chrysanthemumheaded bats in 2015 their research supported the theory that the transmission chain started from bats to humans chan et al
8
 and hui et al
9
 confirmed that sarscov2 was a new coronavirus closely related to the bat sarscov recently zhou et al
10
 and wu et al
11
 found that the sequence homology between sarscov2 and sarscov was 795 they also found that the sarscov2 had high homology with bat coronaviruses therefore the current evidence strongly supports that the sarscov2 was derived from bats although the intermediate hosts of sarscov2 remain to be determined a study by wang et al
12
 showed that from january 10 to 24 2020 the number of people diagnosed with the sarscov2 infection in china increased by 314 times on 23 february 2020 the number of people diagnosed with covid19 in china was 1879 times of that on 10 january 2020 they estimated the case fatality rate of covid19 to be 284 based on their patient pool the authors also found that the ratio of male to female deaths was 3251 the median age of death was 75 years the median time from the first symptom to death was 14 days and the median time from early symptoms to death in people aged 70 or older 115 days was shorter than that in people under 70 years old 20 days these findings suggest the disease may progress faster in the elderly than in the young a study by li et al
5
 showed the median age of 425 patients infected with sarscov2 was 59 years of which 56 were males the average incubation period was 52 days and almost half of the adult patients were 60 years old or older in the early stages the number of infected patients doubled every 74 days the transmission rate of individual infected patients was 22 although 55 of the earliest sarscov2infected patients related to the huanan seafood market the number of unrelated cases have increased exponentially since late december 2019 huang et al
13
 showed among the 41 patients with sarscov2 infections in their study 73 of the patients were male and 32 of the patients had underlying diseases including diabetes eight patients hypertension six patients and cardiovascular disease six patients the median age was 49 years out of the 41 patients 27 patients were associated with the huanan seafood market the case fatality rate among the sarscov2infected patients in this study was 15 a study by wu et al
14
 estimated the transmission rate of individual infected patients to be 03 the case fatality rate among the sarscov2infected patients in this study was 14 zhao et al
15
 found that angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 was the receptor for sarscov2 in the normal human lung ace2 is expressed on type i and ii alveolar epithelial cells among them 83 of the type ii alveolar cells have ace2 expression men had a higher ace2 level in their alveolar cells than women asians have a higher level of ace2 expression in their alveolar cells than the white and african american populations the binding of sarscov2 on ace2 causes an elevated expression of ace2 which can lead to damages on alveolar cells damages to alveolar cells can in turn trigger a series of systemic reactions and even death they also confirmed that asian males are more susceptible to sarscov2 infection wrapp et al
16
 found that the receptorbinding ability of sarscov2 is 10 to 20 times stronger than that of sarscov huang et al
13
 found that 98 of the patients in their study had fevers of which 78 had a temperature higher than 38c they reported that 76 of the patients had coughs 44 of patients experienced fatigue and muscle pain and 55 of patients had dyspnea a small number of patients also developed expectoration 28 headaches 8 hemoptysis 5 and diarrhea 3 laboratory tests found that 25 of infected patients had leukopenia and 63 had lymphocytopenia the level of aspartate aminotransferase was elevated in 37 of the patients myocarditis was diagnosed in 12 of the patients and the level of hypersensitive troponin i was significantly increased in these patients abnormalities in chest computed tomography ct images were found in 100 of the patients grinding glasslike and consolidation areas were found in 98 of the infected patients bilateral lungs zhu et al
4
 reported three cases of covid19 patient 1 was a 49yearold female with a fever body temperature 37 to 38c and had coughs accompanied by chest discomfort four days after the onset of the disease her coughs and chest discomfort aggravated but her fever subsided patient 2 a 61yearold male also developed fevers and coughs at the initial stage of the disease respiratory distress appeared 7 days after the onset of symptoms and worsened within the next 2 days he was treated with mechanical ventilation patient 3 was a 32yearold male whose symptoms were not described in the article patients 1 and 3 recovered and were discharged from hospital after treatment but patient 2 died after 20 days of treatment guan et al
17
 reported 1099 cases of 2019ncov infection they found that fevers 879 and coughs 677 were the most common symptoms diarrhea 37 and vomiting 50 were rare abnormalities in chest ct images were found in 96 of the sarscov2infected patients and lymphopenia was observed in 821 of them as of 23 february 2020 no covid19 vaccine has been successfully developed at present the treatments of patients with sarscov2 infection are mainly symptomatic treatments the study by huang et al
13
 reported that the most common complications in patients with 2019ncov infection were acute respiratory distress syndrome followed by anemia acute heart injuries and secondary infections therefore empirical antibiotics antiviral therapy oseltamivir and systemic corticosteroids were often used for treatments patients with intractable hypoxemia were given invasive mechanical ventilation holshue et al
18
 used remdesivir in the treatment of patients with sarscov2 infection and achieved good results lu
19
 postulated that in addition to antiviral interferers and antibiotics neuraminidase inhibitors rna synthesis inhibitors and chinese traditional medicine could also be used in the treatment of covid19 nevertheless the efficacy of these drugs still needs to be verified by clinical trials in the absence of effective treatments the best way to deal with the sarscov2 epidemic is to control the sources of infection strategies include early diagnoses reporting isolation and supportive treatments timely release of epidemic information and maintenance of social orders for individuals protective measures including improving personal hygiene wearing medical masks adequate rest and keeping rooms well ventilated can effectively prevent sarscov2 infection
17

 regarding the case fatality and transmission rates among patients with sarscov2 infection the findings from various studies were different the studies of wang et al
12
 showed that the case fatality rate was 284 according to huang et al
13
 the number was 15 the study by wu et al
14
 estimated that the case fatality rate was 14 in the study by zhu et al
4
 the number was 33 guan et al

 showed that the transmission rate was 22 per patient wu et al
14
 estimated that the transmission rate was 03 per patient yang et al
20
 reported that the transmission rate was 377 we think that the transmission rate of 22 per patient seems to be more in line with the current situation
2
 different sample sizes and possible viral variations may have contributed to the differences between the studies studies with a larger sample size may give a better estimation of the case fatality rate and transmission rate of the covid19 we know that the other two major zoonotic coronavirus diseases sars and mers which caused widespread transmission have case fatality rates of 96 and 35 respectively
9
 according to the official chinese data the case fatality rate among the sarscov2infected patients was much lower than that of sars and mers
2

 in response to the covid19 epidemic we believe that the focus of future studies will still be on the development of covid19 vaccines and effective drugs to treat covid19 these studies will help further reduce the case fatality and transmission rates among sarscov2infected patients moreover superspreaders were reported during the sars and mers epidemics
21
 although the transmission rate for sarscov2 patents is about 22 at present the number of cases inside and outside wuhan is increasing rapidly with the progress of diagnostic technology potential superspreaders may be discovered in the future in the prevention of the spread of sarscov2 asymptomatic spreaders also need to be focused

final version  covid-19 super-spreaders definitional quandaries and implications uncertainty around the role super-spreaders play in the transmission and escalation of infectious disease is compounded by its broad and vague definition it is a term that has been much used in relation to covid-19 particularly in social media on its widest definition it refers to a propensity to infect a larger than average number of people given the biological behavioural and environmental variables relevant to infectivity this might be pertinent to almost any infected individual who is not physically isolated from others nor is the term confined to individuals with a propensity to spread infectious disease it can potentially be used to describe events policies or settings this article explores the use of the term and considers circumstances in which the wide definition can be problematic one problem is that it can lead to undeserved apportionment of moral blame to alleged super-spreaders another is that it can detract from scientific investigation of the heterogeneity of covid-19 transmission the author calls for a clearer epidemiological definition cave emma airflow analysis of pyeongtaek st marys hospital during hospitalization of the first middle east respiratory syndrome patient in korea seongmin jo jinkwan hong sang-eun lee moran ki bo choi youl minki sung   middle east respiratory syndrome mers was first reported in saudi arabia in 2012 and is a severe respiratory disease that causes fever cough and respiratory disturbance as in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 12 the reported cases of mers infection increased in the middle east in may 2014 and since then there has been a growing concern about mers infection 3 in may 2015 the first case of mers infection was reported in korea the patient had contracted the disease while visiting the arabian peninsula and had returned to korea thereby spreading mers in korea 4 according to the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc the region with the highest number of infected cases outside the arabian peninsula is korea 5 mers spread in korea from may 2015 to july 2015 in less than two months 186 people were infected and 38 people died the korea cdc reported that mers rapidly spread over a short period because of hospital infection according to epidemiological findings 876 of the infected patients were infected in the hospital 6 similarly in the mers cases reported in jeddah in 2014 infection was found to spread in the hospital through super-spreading events 7 the mers events in korea and jeddah indicate that mers infection can gradually increase when a dense population is confined to relatively small spaces such as hospitals the index patient was admitted to a ward on the eighth floor of pyeongtaek st marys hospital on 1517 may 2015 with fever and muscle pain 8 in addition to the index patient 30 people 15 inpatients 13 family members and 2 nurses were infected on the eighth floor of the hospital 9 to confirm the cause of the infection of secondary patients at the hospital an epidemiological investigation of the infection transmission route was conducted the investigation results showed that 23 of the infected patients did not come in close contact with other infected patients 10 similar to sars mers is known to be an infection caused by close contact 11 however the infection of a secondary patient with no close contact with the index patient does not support the claim that mers is spread only through close contact therefore the possibility of other infection transmission routes of mers such as air transmission is being studied 1213 in the case of sars the airflow in the prince of wales hospital was analysed where the first sars-infected patient was hospitalized the results showed that the pattern of the infection of the secondary patient was similar to the indoor airflow pattern 14 when sars was reported in toronto canada a field experiment was performed to determine the infection transmission route and the results indicated that sars could possibly be an opportunistic airborne infection 15 a new risk calculation method was applied to confirm the spatial risk distribution of sars and the results showed that sars was more likely to be transmitted through the air 16 according to oh et als review 17 on mers to prevent the recirculation of pathogen-bearing droplets the air changes per hour ach should be over 6 and to prevent a high concentration of infectious droplets proper ventilation is mandatory however the index patient was admitted to a ward with no supply and exhaust vent the ward was originally a seven-person ward and was separated into two two-person wards in the process of separating the wards vents were installed in only one of the wards because of this construction lapse the index patients ward was not mechanically ventilated and only natural ventilation was provided through the window it is possible that the droplets produced by coughing and sneezing by the index patient accumulated in the ward at a high concentration due to lack of ventilation mers bacteria are known to survive for up to 72 h on plastic or steel surfaces at a room temperature of 20c and a humidity of 40 18 and droplets are known to shrink their size during the evaporation process 1920 a person who infects more than five people is called a super-spreader and the index patient was also surveyed as a super-spreader 21 the results of previous studies indicate that the droplets from the index patient who was a super-spreader can partially evaporate and become small particles such as droplet nuclei and then spread to the adjacent wards through airflow 142223 sars is known to cause super-spreading events through super-spreaders 2425 considering that the first mers-infected patient in korea was a super-spreader and that the ward in which the index patient was hospitalized was not properly ventilated it is necessary to review the possibility of distant propagation through airflow the purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of distant propagation through the airflow on the eighth floor of pyeongtaek st marys hospital where the index patient was hospitalized computational fluid dynamics cfd was used to simulate the situation during the period of the index patients hospitalization and observe the possibility of propagation through airflow pyeongtaek st marys hospital is a nine-storey building completely built in february 2015 the medical department is located from the first floor to the third floor and the ward department is located from the fourth floor to the ninth floor the eighth floor where the index patient was hospitalized is divided into a maternity ward department which consists of a one-person ward and a general ward department which consists of a two-person ward and seven-person ward figure 1 the room air conditioner and radiator installed in each ward control the cooling and heating of the ward the ventilation of the ward is controlled by a sensible heat exchanger installed in groups of two to six wards air handling unit was not installed awning windows are present in each ward and can be opened or closed by the patient in the corridor ventilation is not provided and only a ceiling-type air conditioner is installed the air conditioner and ventilation system of each ward can be controlled individually so the occupant can freely manipulate them according to interviews with patients who were present during the index patients hospitalization they used the air conditioner according to their needs however most of them did not recognize the ventilation devices making it difficult to determine whether the air conditioner and ventilation system were in operation in the case of ward 8104 the index patient stated that the air conditioner was not in use except for approximately half a day and that the window was kept open for ventilation
 the maximum airflow rate was designed as 200 cubic metres per hour cmh for a one-person ward 250 cmh for a two-person ward and 500 cmh for a seven-person ward and the ach was approximately 5 however the actual air supply and exhaust airflow rates during the period of admission of the index patient were not confirmed because of the adjustment of the ventilation system between the closure 29 may 2015 and reopening 6 july 2015 of the hospital kim et al 26 analysed the epidemiological features of the index patient and secondary patient at pyeongtaek st marys hospital according to this study the index patient was admitted to the two-person ward ward 8104 from 15 may to 17 may 2015 due to fever and coughing symptoms figure 2 shows the patients visiting family members and nurses who were infected on the eighth floor in ward 8104 one patient using the same room and three visiting family members were infected in the adjoining and close-distance wards to ward 8104 ie wards 8103 and 8105 one patient was infected infected patients were also confirmed in distant wards at least one infected case occurred in all east-facing wards ward 8109 had the highest number of confirmed infected cases with four patients and three visiting family members being infected absolute confirmation of close contact between the index patient secondary patient visiting family members and nurse was impossible
 sung et al 22 performed a diffusion experiment using aerosol and tracer gas on 8 may 2015 when the hospital was shut down he confirmed the possibility of diffusion of infectious bacteria through the indoor airflow however because of the limitations of the field experiment a detailed analysis was not carried out therefore this study reproduced and analysed the phenomenon observed by sung et al we used cfd to analyse the indoor airflow and passive tracer diffusion path on the eighth floor where the index patient was hospitalized the eighth-floor ward can be naturally ventilated through the windows so it was necessary to check the outdoor and indoor airflow conditions therefore the facade and the eighth floor of pyeongtaek st marys hospital were modelled and simulated to observe both outdoor and indoor airflow conditions pyeongtaek st marys hospital is tilted approximately 5 eastward from the north direction a survey of the surrounding terrain conditions figure 3 indicates that a housing area is located towards the south a factory area towards the northeast and rice paddies towards the west and north no high-rise buildings with over five storeys are present within 500 m however a relatively high four-storey building is located approximately 40 m to the west of the hospital so the building was included in the simulation domain
 cfd analysis was performed using star-ccm a commercial simulation program the size of the domain used in the analysis was modelled to be 420  525  180 m figure 4 there was sufficient space between the building and analysis domain to allow the airflow to fully develop and hence obtain reliable analysis results 27 the analytical mesh was a trimmer mesh and the prism layer mesh was applied to the wall mesh independence test was performed and compared with coarse 3 million medium 6 million and fine mesh size 9 million for prediction accuracy of the cfd simulation results 28 outdoor velocity data were extracted at the front of the hospital figure 4a at constant height of 1 m and indoor velocity data were extracted from window height figure 4b realizable k turbulence model 2930 was used as the turbulence model as a boundary condition the airflow was set in the windward direction according to the wind speed profile and it was set to escape to the leeward direction due to pressure formation 31 the side and top parts of the domain were set to be symmetrical figure 5 shows the wind speed and direction when the index patient was hospitalized ie from noon on 15 may 2015 to the morning of 17 may 2015 wind data at the height of 10 m were obtained from the nearest weather observatory located 36 km away from the hospital the cfd cases were selected according to the dominant wind directions ie west west-southwest winds the average wind speed at the height of 10 m was 240 m s1 for the west wind and 262 m s1 for the west-southwest wind

 wind blowing from outside the building is affected by the terrain of the surface and blockage of the building the wind speed is lower at low height and the wind speed increases with the distance from the surface to employ these conditions in the cfd analysis the wind speed at the height of 0180 m was calculated using the exponential law 32 based on the average wind speed at the height of 10 m blowing from each direction to determine the roughness of the earths surface the roughness value  should be selected this value was chosen to be 022 for regions where houses with a height of 35 m are concentrated or regions where middle-class buildings are scattered according to the korea building code 33 for indoor conditions both the maternity and general ward departments were included in the cfd domain to observe the passive tracer diffusion on the eighth floor when the passive tracer was generated in ward 8104 as shown in figure 6 50 windows were placed on the front 36 windows on the rear and six windows on the side like the actual eighth floor of the hospital according to the interviews with patients and medical staffs most of the windows were open for ventilation in the daytime during the outbreak because outdoor temperature was moderate therefore awning windows were opened at the angle of 30 as shown in figure 6 the air supply and exhaust vents of each room were modelled by reflecting the shapes of the actual air supply and exhaust vents installed in the hospital the bathroom was not modelled and only the door undercut exhaust was modelled for analysis efficiency the design airflow rate was used for the supply and exhaust air vents and bathroom exhaust
 the passive tracer was released from the mouth of a lying patient model the model was set to exhale 5 l of passive tracer per minute which is considered to be the average respiration rate of a person droplets from a patient evaporate and can rapidly turn into small particles in this study the airborne infectious particles were considered as gas-phase substances refer to the previous studies 3438 the cfd analysis cases table 1 are based on the two wind directions west west-southwest in case 1 mechanical ventilation system is not operated only in ward 8104 which represents the actual situation when the index patient was hospitalized case 1t represents non-isothermal simulation in case 2 all the ventilation systems are not in operation in case 3 mechanical ventilation systems are operated in all the wards to observe improved the airflow and passive tracer concentration reduction
 the average outside temperature in pyeongtaek district was 178c at the time of the index patient admission so air conditioning was not required and the survey results indicated that the air conditioner in ward 8104 was not operated most of the time therefore in the simulation air conditioning was not considered in addition due to the characteristics of the hospital building where family members visit wards from time to time medical staff frequently shift duties and the heat generation value of rooms change with time specifying accurate heat generation value was impossible however non-isothermal simulation should be considered and compared with isothermal simulation thereby average outdoor temperature of 178c and heat generation values for patient and nurse were applied to the floor and ceiling light was applied to the ceiling for one case casew-1t and was compared to isothermal simulation casew-1 results as shown in figure 7 the maximum difference of outdoor air velocity between coarse medium and fine meshes in range of 0180 and 030 m where building is located were both 015 m s1 which was not significantly large however maximum difference of indoor velocity of the three meshes showed a difference coarse mesh and fine showed a maximum velocity difference of 01 m s1 and medium mesh and fine mesh showed 006 m s1 difference therefore medium mesh with 6 million cell was considered independent and was selected for the simulation
 figure 8 shows the pressure distribution at the height of the patients mouth on the eighth floor in the case of the wind blowing from the west when the wind direction was more perpendicular to the surface of the building a positive pressure greater than 3 pa was formed that was higher than that formed when the wind direction was less perpendicular to the building surface positive pressure was also formed on the west-southwest outer surface of the building and a relatively high positive pressure greater than 4 pa was observed in the angular part of the centre of the west side of the building when the wind was blowing from the west-southwest direction high positive pressure greater than 3 pa was created on the west-southwest outer surface of the building and the highest positive pressure greater than 4 pa was formed in the west angular part of the building which is similar to the case in which the wind was blowing from the west in all the cases in the side part of the building a negative pressure was formed and a vortex was generated making the airflow separate and reattach to the side of the building
 in the case of the west wind air mainly flowed through front a window to rear a windows in the case of the west-southwest wind compared to the west wind the airflow through the front a window decreased and the airflow through the front b window increased the air mainly flowed in through front b and flowed out through the side windows and rear a windows figure 9 shows the results of the indoor passive tracer distribution the analysis results for the west wind airflow indicated that the outdoor air mainly flowed in through the west-facing windows and flowed out through the rear windows the passive tracer from the lying patients mouth in ward 8104 mainly spread to wards 8111 and 8112 in the case of the west-southwest wind compared to the west wind the air mainly flowed in through west-southwest windows and flowed out through the side and rear windows the passive tracer spread to ward 8109 8110 and some portion spread to adjacent ward 8105
 figure 10 shows the volume-averaged concentration of the passive tracer in residential area which is 018 m in each room in all the cases no contaminants were detected in the maternity ward department where no mers infection cases were reported among all the wards index patient ward 8104 had the highest concentration of the passive tracer in all the cases it is difficult to directly relate the reported infected cases with the concentration of the passive tracer in wards because the wind does not continuously blow in one direction however in case wsw-1 which represents the actual situation when the index patient was hospitalized and the wind was blowing from the west-southwest ward 8109 where the highest infected cases were reported showed the highest concentration in the case of ward 8107 where four infected cases were reported the highest passive tracer concentration was only 002 compared to ward 8014 100 however in a situation where the west or west-southwest wind was blowing and the east wind was blown after the passive tracer was spread the passive tracer could re-spread to the west-facing wards
 the concentration in each ward is shown in table 2 and the highest concentration in ward 8104 case w-2 is considered to be 100 in case w-1 where the wind was blowing from the west relatively high concentration was observed in ward 8111 107 and 8112 114 both wards had three infected cases comparing with case w-1t which is non-isothermal simulation concentration difference of ward 8014 was not significant however wards 8111 and 8112 showed 364 and 247 lower concentration this is due to buoyancy effect which forms upper air movement the concentration is extracted at the occupied zone 018 m in case wsw-1 the highest concentration was observed in ward 8109 369 where most of infected cases were reported in cases w-2 and wsw-2 where all ventilation system was not in operation higher passive tracer concentration was observed in every contaminant-detected ward compared with other cases in cases w-3 and wsw-3 which represented the full operation of mechanical ventilation conditions the concentrations in ward 8104 were 490 454 lower than those of cases w-1 and wsw-1 respectively in case w-3 the reduction rate of the concentration in ward 8104 was relatively low compared to case wsw-3 this is because the direct airflow from the west-facing window to the corridor was disturbed by the air supplied from the supply vent which was located near the window and the patient it is known that the supply of fresh air dilutes pollutants but in the case of typical conditions where the window is near the source mechanical ventilation can counterbalance the reduction in pollutants
 the ach was calculated by using the concentration of the passive tracer in the ward with the passive tracer generation rate in cases w-1 w-2 and w-3 the ach was 215 211 and 226 respectively no significant increase in the ach was observed by operating mechanical ventilation in ward 8104 in cases wsw-1 wsw-2 and wsw-3 ach was 310 269 and 400 respectively ach increased by approximately 6 when machine ventilation was operated in ward 8104 in case wsw most of the air flowed through the side opening of the awning window to ward 8104 therefore the air from outside did not disturb the airflow from the supply vent and more volume of air was passing through the windows compared to case w in case w air mostly flowed through the under part of the awning window and less air volume of air was passing through the window due to window shape and disturbed air flow from the supply vent the purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of distant propagation of droplets through airflow using cfd analysis on the eighth floor of pyeongtaek st marys hospital where the index patient was admitted the wind speed profile was obtained and analysed based on the average wind speed values of the west west-southwest and east winds which were the dominant wind directions during the period in which the index patient was hospitalized on the first day of hospitalization of the index patient 15 may 2015 the wind was mainly blowing from the west-southwest as shown in figure 11a except from 2200 to 2230 in the first day the wind was relatively weak with a maximum wind speed of 34 m s1 and an average wind speed of 17 m s1 as shown in figure 11b on 16 may east winds were blowing from 500 to 730 and there was a possibility that the passive tracer that spread because of the west-southwest wind might re-spread to the west-facing wards because of the east wind as shown in figure 11a winds were continually blowing from the west southwest and west until 2000 maximum wind speed was 55 m s1 and the average wind speed was 22 m s1 as shown in figure 11b on the following day 16 may the west and east winds randomly blew from 2100 to 300 east wind blew with an average wind speed of 12 m s1 and a maximum wind speed of 21 m s1 the passive tracer that spread because of the west-southwest wind on the previous day could have re-spread to the other wards before the patient was discharged
 the passive tracer concentration in each room was analysed in terms of the door-to-door distance between wards the passive tracer was detected in wards 8109 and 8112 which were 178 m apart from ward 8104 and in ward 8110 which was approximately 30 m away from ward 8104 the passive tracer concentration in ward 8109 showed the highest concentration when the west-southwest wind was blowing indicating that mers would have infected other patients through the airflow in this study cases were simulated with steady state which cannot implement change of wind direction and speed time to time however one transient simulation was conducted with case w-1 to observe passive tracer spreading time to employ realistic emission characteristics passive tracer was set to exhale for 05 s with amount of 12 l from patients mouth which is considered to be one coughing time and air mass 3941 the passive tracer was first observed in nurse station with time of 100 s and had peak concentration at 330 s in ward 8111 which had the highest concentration in steady simulation passive tracer was observed in 230 s and the peak concentration was at 580 s in ward 8110 which is the most distant ward from 8104 passive tracer was observed at 520 s and has peak concentration at 880 s the transient simulation result tells us that in a situation when all the windows and doors are opened the passive tracer can reach 30 m distant ward in 520 s just with one coughing scenario sars is known to spread by close contact however li et al 14 suggested that it could possibly be an airborne infection li et al confirmed the diffusion of contaminants through mechanical ventilation systems in the ward using cfd in li et als study the contaminant concentration was higher than that in the present study this is attributed to the different indoor environment parameters such as air recirculation in the mechanical ventilation systems and the simulation domain size the passive tracer concentration shown in this study might be low however this does not mean that the risk of infection is also low the concept of using passive contaminant to identify airflow rather than using particles might be different from each other however virus can be attached to various particle sizes and tracking of all size of particles using cfd needs extremely time-consuming process small size particles are more likely to travel with airflow in the case of previous studies on sars 1423 indoor and outdoor airflow was analysed using passive contaminant to identify the dispersion of sars virus based on the assumption that the droplets exhaled from the infected patient are evaporated very quickly and get small enough to flow like airflow in this study we adopted the concept of using passive contaminant for computing efficiency the first infected mers patient was admitted to a hospital ward that had no supply or exhaust vents indicating that the testing adjusting and balancing tab of the ventilation system was not properly carried out after the construction of the building especially in the case of hospitals it is essential to perform tab after construction for infection control furthermore it is necessary to carry out periodic tab according to previous studies 3842 natural ventilation can be used for infection control however in hospitals with a central corridor such as pyeongtaek st marys hospital there is a risk of infection being spread because of natural ventilation for infection control the central corridor structure should be avoided in hospitals in the design stage and if the central corridor structure is used in hospitals natural ventilation should be avoided and sufficient mechanical ventilation should be provided the purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of mers propagation through airflow on the eighth floor of pyeongtaek st marys hospital where the index patient was hospitalized the cfd analysis results can be summarized as follows
 the wind data obtained for the hospitalization period of the index patient showed that the west and west-southwest winds were dominant therefore the air dominantly flowed in through the west and west-southwest sides of the hospital the passive tracer generated by the index patient in ward 8104 which is located on the west side of the building spread towards the east-facing wards through the airflow ward 8109 showed the highest passive tracer concentration when the west-southwest wind was blowing and mechanical ventilation was not operated which represented the actual environmental situation during the index patients hospitalization the most reported mers cases were also in ward 8109 which indicates that mers possibly spread through the airflow real-time changes in the wind direction and wind speed were not considered in this study however the analysis of the wind direction and speed results showed that the passive tracer which spread to the east-facing wards because of the west and west-southwest winds could re-spread to the west-facing wards through the east windthe study results do not imply that the infection pathway of mers is airborne however mers can be infected through the airflow in specific environmental situations such as cases with inadequate ventilation of wards cases where natural ventilation is used in central corridor structures and cases where the patient is a super-spreader  unlinking super-linkers the topology of epidemic response covid-19 a key characteristic of the spread of infectious diseases is their ability to use efficient transmission paths within contact graphs this enables the pathogen to maximise infection rates and spread within a target population in this work we devise techniques to localise infections and decrease infection rates based on a principled analysis of disease transmission paths within human-contact networks proximity graphs experimental results of disease spreading shows that that at low visibility rates contact tracing slows disease spreading however to stop disease spreading contact tracing requires both significant visibility at least 60 into the proximity graph and the ability to place half of the population under isolation we find that pro-actively isolating super-links -- key proximity encounters -- has significant benefits targeted isolation of a fourth of the population based on 35 visibility into the proximity graph prevents an epidemic outbreak it turns out that isolating super-spreaders is more effective than contact tracing and testing but less effective than targeting super-links we highlight the important role of topology in epidemic outbreaks we argue that proactive innoculation of a population by disabling super-links and super-spreaders may have an important complimentary role alongside contact tracing and testing as part of a sophisticated public-health response to epidemic outbreaks nagaraja shishir title modelling suggests blood group incompatibility may substantially reduce sars-cov-2 short title abo incompatibility and sars-cov-2   several recent published studies and preprints have suggested that the prevalence of covid-19 31 disease varies by blood type with type a being relatively susceptible and type o being less 32 susceptible 1 2 3 4 5  puzzlingly however there is no difference in the severity of disease with the 33 case fatality ratio cfr and the probability of progressing to intensive care appearing independent 34 of blood type this discrepancy between incidence and severity data has led some authors to 35 challenge the aforementioned findings 6  although not remarked on to date in the majority of 36 these studies type ab appears even more susceptible than type a thus the relative risk of infection 37 is ab  a  b  o with type a and type b alleles functioning codominantly to increase risk this 38 is immediately reminiscent of the rules governing blood transfusion compatibility 39 here i investigate the behaviour of abo-interference a model of epidemic spread in which 40 the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the causal 41 agent of covid-19 is dependent on the abo blood type compatibility between an infected 42 individual and the susceptible people they encounter mechanistically this models a scenario in 43 which infectious virions acquire the glycosylation pattern and hence the abo antigen status of their 44 current host this in turn allows shed virions to be rejected by incompatible recipients blocking 45 the initial infective step this immediately explains the lack of correlation with disease severity 46 since once an infection is established virions produced within the new host are necessarily self-47 compatible and able to spread freely between cells 48 the plausibility of this hypothesis has already been established by work on hiv 7 8  and was 49 also previously proposed for the 2003 epidemic of sars 9-10 for measles 11  and indeed for 50 enveloped viruses in general 12 13  sars-cov-2 has an outer lipid membrane containing spike 51 membrane and envelope s m and e proteins all of which are exposed to immune recognition and 52 any or all of which may be glycosylated structural studies show that s is heavily glycosylated 53 including fucosylated glycans that may potentially bear abo determinants 14 15  the 54 glycosylation status of the m and e proteins has not yet been characterised nor the glycosylation 55  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted

experimental work using pseudotyped virus suggests that 56 transmission of the closely related sars virus can be blocked by anti-a antibodies when virus 57 particles are grown in an a-expressing cell line 10  this study also showed via modelling that 58 abo-interference can reduce the progress of an epidemic dependent on the magnitude of the block 59 to transmission and the local population structure however despite the mechanistic plausibility of 60 this hypothesis and the preliminary data from the sars epidemic there has as yet been no detailed 61 modelling exploring the implications of abo-interference for the relative susceptibility of 66 the simplest of all epidemic models assumes a homogeneously mixing population divided into 67 susceptible infectious and recovered groups or compartments this yields three variables s i and 68 r which respectively represent the proportion of the population with each status such a model is 69 completely described by two parameters  and  representing the rate constants for infection and 70 recovery respectively the duration of the infectious period d is given by 1   all simulations 71 presented here are based on d 7 days and none of the results presented are sensitive to this 72 parameter r0 is given by the product  and represents the basic reproduction number ie the 73 mean number of individuals infected by an infectious individual during their illness in a completely 74 susceptible population 16  to this i add a further parameter  0    100 representing the 75 relative probability of cross-type infection thus each of the s i and r compartments is split into 76 four sub-compartments sa sb sab so and so forth representing in this case the susceptible 77 individuals with each of the four blood types whereas in a

and on the 83 blood type distributions in both s and i in this paper i use rmax to indicate the maximal possible 84 value of rt this will be observed when the population is fully susceptible and   100 or when 85 all infected individuals are type o and thus transmission is unimpeded the a population and also propagates to ab since aab is a permissible vector of transmission if the index case is type b or ab the epidemic never becomes established since there are too few 93 compatible susceptible individuals to sustain transmission if the index case is type o epidemics 94 occur within all four

will behave 122 similarly to one seeded by type o index cases as shown in whenever infection is present among individuals with all four blood types ie there is at least 134 one type o index case or   0 the blood type distribution among infected people rapidly 135 converges upon a new equilibrium that is significantly skewed relative to the initial population 136 distribution this equilibration process causes rt to also settle on an equilibrium value during the 137 early stages of the epidemic hereafter called rsteady this is a rapid process with rt reaching 138 rsteady within a few serial intervals in these simulations this equates to 01 of the population 139 being infected therefore in real-world epidemics subject to abo-interference estimates of r0 140 based on population statistics

different underlying blood type frequencies and relative risk ratios in each country for the 180 italian and spanish study data was also provided for area-matched control data from blood donors 4

in hotspots is much higher 19  and infected individuals will by 184 definition originate preferentially from these hotspots in these areas the epidemic may have 185 progressed beyond the steady state region of the epidemic curve reducing the degree of blood type 186 skewing among the infected population and partially masking the effects of abo-interference on 187 virus transmission in this case in order to generate the observed changes in blood type frequency 188 then the degree of abo-interference must be even more pronounced ie the estimate of 40 is a 189 maximum bound and the true frequency of cross-type transmission may be even lower secondly 190 the sir model assumes that population mixing and opportunities for transmission are independent 191 of blood type this is unlikely to be the case since blood relatives living together are both more 192 likely to infect each other and more likely to share a blood type this effect will also tend to mask 193  cc-by-nc 40 international license

in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted july 14 2020 the model presented here shows that if abo-interference is the cause of the widely observed 272 bias in sars-cov-2 infection rates among different blood types then abo incompatibility 273 reduces sars-cov-2 transmission by at least 60 and potentially more this implies that the 274 apparent r0 for most of the largest epidemics around the world has already been suppressed by at 275 least 25 and that rmax is likely to be substantially higher than the actually-measured rsteady however it is key to appreciate that no blood type is necessarily high-or low-risk rather the nature surface glycans eg lewis and p antigens behave similarly this will further magnify the 292 differences between super-spreaders and super-recipients paradoxically however although in this model both disease vulnerability and infectiousness 294 vary substantially between different blood types it is important not to simplistically

a standard sir model of infection divides the population into three compartments susceptible infectious recovered representing the proportion of individuals in the population with each status and thus s  i  r  1 these compartments are linked by three differential equations the parameters  and  represent the rate constants for infection and recovery and their reciprocals 1   and 1   represent the average time required for one infectious individual to transmit to one susceptible individual and the average duration of the infectious period the product    represents the basic reproductive number r0 the parameter  represents the rate constant for loss of immunity and thus transfer from the r compartment back to s its reciprocal 1   represents the average duration of immunity following recovery here i extend this model by splitting each of s i and r into four subcompartments representing the four abo blood group phenotypes these are then linked by a set of twelve equations these equations were implemented as a microsoft excel spreadsheet available from url to add in this model r0 is not a well-defined quantity since even in a fully susceptible population the current effective r value denoted rt depends on  and on the blood type distributions in both s and i in this paper i use rmax to indicate the product    ie the r0 that would be observed in the absence of any abo-interference this is thus the maximal possible value of rt and would be observed if   100 or if all infected individuals are type o for the work presented here all epidemics were initiated by transferring 11000000 of the population from s to i at time t0 this for example represents an initial importation of 9 infected index cases into a city the size of london varying these boundary conditions from 110000 to 1100000000 has no effect other than accelerating or retarding the initial progress of the epidemic not shown except where otherwise specified in the main text all index cases 4 were assumed to be of blood group o for the main text immunity was assumed to be permanent and thus   0 the case where   0 and immunity wanes over time is considered below the effect of waning immunity for a virus subject to abo-interference when immunity is allowed to wane over time and the duration of immunity 1   is substantially longer than the duration of infection 1   then population spread of the virus can resume once the population level of immunity falls below the herd immunity threshold over time this leads to damped oscillatory behaviour with recurrent pulses of infection converging on a final steady state in this final steady state by definition rt  1 ie there is steady sustained transmission with levels neither growing nor shrinking figure s1  the relative risk to non-o blood groups is less pronounced during this final steady state compared to the initial quasisteady state during the early phase of pandemic spread but remains non-zero in the final steady state with waning immunity and recurrent infection the relative risk is best interpreted as a difference in the frequency of infection eg if type a has a relative risk of 11 compared to type o it means type a individuals are 10 more likely to suffer an infection within any given time period the final population disease burden ie the final value of i depends on the duration of immunity with a shorter immune duration leading to a higher final prevalence intriguingly while the initial quasi-steady state is independent of rmax see main text for details the final steady state does depend on rmax when rmax is high the final relative risk for all blood groups is close to unity when rmax is low then the final relative risk for all blood groups is similar to that seen in the initial steady state intuitively this follows from the fact that for a highly contagious disease with a high rmax everyone will become infected as soon as their 5 immunity wears off irrespective of blood type for a less contagious disease with a low rmax then there is more scope for differential susceptibility to play a part in how frequently individuals become infected for seasonal coronaviruses if these are subject to abo-interference this means similar results should be observed for these as for sars-cov-2 it would therefore be interesting to determine whether non-o blood groups are indeed more likely to suffer more frequent repeat coronavirus infections more speculatively given the emerging evidence that covid-19 is a multisystemic infection with particular impact on clotting pathways 1 could it be possible that the endemic coronaviruses may also have some effect on the likelihood of thrombosis this could potentially explain the widely-observed phenomenon that type o individuals are on average slightly less likely to suffer from thrombosis and clotting-related myocardial infarction this has been hitherto ascribed to an effect of abo blood group on von willebrand factor levels but the causal link between the two remains obscure 2  quantify the role of superspreaders -opinion leaders- on covid-19 information propagation in the chinese sina-microblog fulian yin xinyu xia nan song lingyao zhu jianhong wu floriana gargiulo   in the absence of effective treatment and vaccine the control of the novel coronavirus covid-19 in china was achieved by an unprecedented massive non-medical public health interventions involving gradually improved rapid diagnostics contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation these interventions induced significant interruption of social-economic activities and therefore their successful implementation by a large population clearly indicated the effective propagation of public health information through social media evidence shows the substantial role played by the social media superspreadersthe opinion leaders to get the message out to the community for example on january 20th of 2020 nanshan zhong an academician of the chinese academy of engineering personally confirmed the occurrence of the human-to-human transmission of the covid-19 1 his confirmation forwarded by opinion leaders and followed by their fans changed the perception of the public about the risk of this emerging infectious disease in a very short period time right before the traditional chinese new year a lesson learnt in this painful chinese experience is the early and timely warning of a public health risk and an experience gained from initial success of containing the disease is the resilience of the citizens which is informed by accurate public health messaging it is important to examine how opinion leaders have influenced public opinion and information propagation in social media in order to design effective communication strategies for the on-going battle against covid-19 and future pandemic outbreaks our focus here is to develop an appropriate model framework that can be used to analyze the influence of opinion leaders in different stages of single relevant information propagation with short duration periods during a public health emergency event like covid-19 this kind of model framework incorporating the involvement of opinion leaders in different stages of an event is lacking in the literature to our best knowledge considering there exists susceptible users opinion leaders and normal forwarding users in social media and these kinds of users may impact public opinion here we propose an opinion-leader susceptible-forwarding-immune ol-sfi dynamics model based on the forwarding quantity generated by opinion leaders and normal users in different stages of a hot topic dissemination through online social media during the covid-19 outbreak in china we address this stage-specific involvement of opinion leaders by considering the different contact rates and forwarding probabilities with different stages and by analyzing the propagation mechanism with the participation of opinion leaders at different times there have been intensive studies on opinion leaders focusing on opinion leaders identification 24 opinion leaders characteristics 5 6 and the role of opinion leaders 7 8 we found limited studies on the influence of opinion leaders on information propagation which is important for the dissemination of public opinions to impact public health policy implementation during an emergency situation in the field of information dynamics specially the propagation of rumor infectious disease epidemiological models have been used these include for example the susceptible-infected si model 9 10 the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered seir model 11 12 the susceptible-infected-recovered sir model 13 14 and the susceptible-infected-susceptible sis 15 model in these formulations information propagation was analyzed by stratifying users into three classes heard rumor ignorants actively spreading rumor spreaders and no longer spreading rumor stiflers 16 in mass media platforms with the development of network technology several researchers introduced important factors into basic models in order to make the simulation process more closely fit the actual situations in 2015 zhang et al 17 studied the cumulative effects of memory on rumor spreading by using the data set of chinese sina-microblog and proposed a rumor spreading model which examined how the memory affected rate changes over time in artificial network and a real social network zhang et al 18 developed the dynamic 8-state ignorance-carrier-spreader-advocate-removal icsar rumor propagation model to study the mechanism of rumor propagation and then analyzed eight influencing factors including information attraction objective identification of rumors subjective identification of people the degree of trust of information media spread probability reinforcement coefficient block value and expert effects wang et al 19 proposed a novel susceptible-infected-removed sir model by introducing the trust mechanism and investigated the critical threshold and the final size of the rumor spreading which greatly reduced the maximum rumor influence liu et al 20 introduced a modified rumor spreading model called sire which compared to the traditional rumor spreading model had included the stiflers broadcasting effect and social intimacy degree between people hu et al 21 made an assumption that there were three attitudes towards rumors among people based on that assumption then established a susceptible-hesitating-affected-resistant shar model which considered individuals different attitudes towards rumor spreading su et al 22 proposed an improved model entitled microblog-susceptible-infected-removed mb-sir for information propagation by explicitly considering the users incomplete reading behavior and tested the effectiveness of the model using real data from sina-microblog which was more accurate in describing the information propagation in the microblog cheng et al 23 established a stochastic epidemic model considering that individual whether or not was infected by the neighbor spreader greatly depended on the trustiness of ties between them however studies mentioned above fail to take into account the great role of opinion leaders in information dissemination in comparison a few other studies incorporated opinion leader into traditional dynamics models liu et al 24 realized that messages were passed on from one user to another and numerous individuals were influenced by a relatively small portion of users as also known as super-spreaders and then proposed a dynamics model to characterize the super-spreading phenomenon with considering the timeliness of the influence of super-spreaders in tweet information propagation in their study it was suggested that super-spreaders can produce a great impact when they first entered the event however they might stop being highly influential because they were not interested in this event after a while their interest in this event revived so they rejoined it and then they turned into normal infectious users who no longer had the same influence as before traced back to a period when studying epidemic propagation was popular and scholars noticed networks about system of epidemiological relevance presented a heterogeneous topology 25 indeed the existence of super-spreaders showing heterogeneity in epidemic had been investigated long ago in 1980 in the area of epidemic kemper 26 studied sir model and sis model of epidemic for one population with superspreaders considering the constant degree by which superspreaders transmission rates exceeded average rates throughout the process then 27 noticed the core members of gonorrhea who can also be called superspreaders were few in number but had strong infectivity so they set different parameters between core group and noncore group during the whole infectious period to reflect the otherness of two groups and two sets of parameters did not change with the process these studies on superspreaders can effectively give strategies to control the epidemic when the state of dynamic system will not be changed by superspreaders however different from effects superspreaders over epidemics in aforementioned pieces of literature in social networks with the participation of different opinion leaders at distinct times the information propagation environment will change successively so that the state of dynamic system will be changed therefore creating a model with piecewise dynamics is important and necessary in this paper we consider the average contact rate and forwarding probability of the propagation in a population at different stages when some opinion leaders enter the discussion of public health emergencies by distinguishing between the contributions of opinion leaders and normal users to information propagation and analyzing the public opinion propagation mechanism with the participation of opinion leaders about covid-19 we are able to quantify the influence of opinion leaders in information dissemination fig 1 demonstrates the information propagation involving the involvement of several opinion leaders a young girl in the epicenter wuhanchina posted a message seeking for help to find ways to speed up the treatment for her family at first this weibo was forwarded by some enthusiastic normal users shown in dark blue persons but the forwarding quantity was very limited and increased slowly until some opinion leaders in the light bluegreenorange color who were followed by large crowds started to forward the weibo leading to surging forwarding quantity and finally received attention by the public health agency and patients were hospitalized examples provided in subsequent sections contribute further illustrations with specific forwarding quantities different from the spread of rumors and other traditional hot events much information about the epidemic needs more attention such as the help message shown in fig 1 however the exposure rate of normal users is limited if only a small fan groups involved making their information difficult to arouse public concern with the continuous development of the epidemic there is a high level of demand that opinion leaders participate in spreading the information for getting more public attention as the forwarding is an important way of information propagation in this paper we build the opinion-leader susceptible-forwarding-immune ol-sfi dynamics model with considering the distinction between the influence of opinion leaders and normal users the propagation dynamics model based on the forwarding quantity of covid-19 constructed in this paper is shown in fig 2 here we only pay attention to the accessible population in the process of one information propagation and consider the different influence caused by the forwarding of opinion leaders and normal users respectively the experimental dataset includes three kinds of cumulative forwarding quantities at different times the number of fans of superspreaders and different times for superspreaders to participate in the information and our method of data collection accords with the terms and conditions of chinese sina-microblog api we make an assumption that all users n remain unchanged which could be contacted in the course of information propagation are in a closed environment and only focus on the forwarding behavior of individuals each individual user may be in one of four states at any given time the susceptible state s the forwarding state influenced by opinion leaders fl the forwarding state influenced by normal users fn and the immune state i with the participation of different opinion leaders the communication environment will change successively one important distinction between the traditional opinion leader dynamics models and our ol-sfi model is the piecewise characteristic of different parameters through the participation of opinion leaders at the same time our model emphasizes the role of opinion leaders by distinguishing the differences in the contact rates and forwarding probabilities of opinion leaders and normal users considering the number of opinion leaders is less than normal users in the process of propagation about covid-19 in chinese sina-microblog and the identification criterion of opinion leaders is that they have more than 1000 fans 28 the piecewise function of the number of opinion leaders at each stage can be expressed as
ft00tt1m1t1tt2m2t2tt3mntnttn11
where t  0 t1 denotes the first stage without the participation of opinion leaders t  t1 t2 t  t2 t3  t  tn tn1 denote the stages with different opinion leaders and m1 m2  mn represent the number of opinion leaders at each stage correspondingly at each stage susceptible users can contact one information forwarded by an opinion leader with an average exposure rate lt and forward it with the forwarding probability plt or contact one information forwarded by a normal user with an average exposure rate nt and forward it with the forwarding probability pnt these parameters are also in the form of piecewise functions

in addition forwarding users influenced by opinion leaders and normal users can become immune users who are inactive to the information when they out of the active forwarding period with the piecewise average inactive rate lt and nt

it1pltltstft1pntntstfltfntltfltntfnt8
where   ddt is the derivative with respect to t in the above dynamics model we mainly focus on the impact of opinion leaders on forwarding quantity in the dynamic system the main reason is opinion leaders as a special group belong to forwarding users and have a very small number which themselves have a slight impact on cumulative forwarding quantity but have the special ability which can extremely prompt information propagation in a real sense to drive more people to participate in forwarding behavior and become forwarding users meanwhile we do not consider the dynamic process in which the activity of opinion leaders attenuates into the immune state because opinion leaders have a longer influence period of to covid-19 but the outbreak duration of information related to covid-19 is usually shorter in the model we distinguish between forwarding behaviors influenced by opinion leaders and forwarding behaviors influenced by normal users which can be interpreted as follow opinion leaders since an active opinion leader who forward the information will contact an average number of ltn users per time and the probability that a user who has contacted the information is a susceptible user is stn among which pltltst will choose to forward the information and 1  pltltst will be insensitive to the information so they will not forward it hence the average number of new forwarding users influenced by opinion leaders and direct immune users are pltltstft and 1  pltltstft respectively after a while the forwarding users will be out of an active forwarding period so that lose the ability to influence susceptible users and the number of inactive immune users will be ltflt per time normal users similarly the average number of new forwarding users influenced by normal users and direct immune users are pntntstflt  fnt and 1  pntntstflt  fnt respectively and after a while the number of inactive immune users will be ntfnt per time considering the whole propagation influenced by opinion leaders and normal users we pay attention to the cumulative number of their forwarding users we have

represent the cumulative forwarding population affected by opinion leaders and normal users respectively in particular we pay more attention to the total number of cumulative forwarding populations for the entire information expressed as

because ft  clt  cnt and we focus on the final size of the summative cumulative forwarding population climtct public opinion reproduction ratio o since the number of opinion leaders in each period is different and their influence is different we define the reproduction ot to describe the outbreak of public opinion at each time t we use the calculation method of basic reproduction number on the spreading of the epidemic in 29 and rewrite our model as follows

is used in our calculation where clk and cnk denote the actual cumulative forwarding populations affected by opinion leaders and normal users here k  0 1 2  is the sampling time the number of cumulative forwarding users and fans of users can be collected through the chinese sina-microblogs application programming interface api tables 1 and 2 list part of the original dataset shown in fig 1 for an actual event from 1310 on february 8 2020 to 630 on february 9 2020 which lasts about 17 hours from the beginning of the event to the end table 1 gives the cumulative forwarding population cl influenced by ten opinion leaders respectively and the cumulative forwarding population cn influenced by normal users at each time it can be intuitively seen that ten opinion leaders entered the information propagation at different points in time and especially five opinion leaders forwarded this information in an intensive time then some opinion leaders forwarded successively especially table 1 shows the phenomenon that cumulative forwarding population of normal users is indirectly influenced by the participation of opinion leaders to some extent that is some users will forward the information of normal users after opinion leaders let more users know this event and table 2 shows the number of opinion leaders with more than 1000 fans which corresponds to the criterion of opinion leaders meanwhile shows the number of the final forwarding population of each opinion leader fig 3a shows the trend of two kinds of cumulative forwarding population cl and cn and the summative cumulative forwarding population c combining cl and cn in table 1 it can be explicitly found that when opinion leaders appeared the number of summative cumulative forwarding population increased sharply compared to the previous uptrend due to the extensive and powerful influence of these opinion leaders the number of summative cumulative forwarding population jumped from the initial small scale to the last big scale fig 3b shows the trend of the cumulative forwarding population influenced by each opinion leader and all opinion leaders in table 1 according to the process of opinion leaders joining the dissemination of public opinion we divide this information dissemination process into eight stages the first stage is the non-opinion leader stage that is no opinion leader participates in the process of public opinion propagation from 0 minutes to 60 minutes the second stage is the multiple opinion leaders joining stage since opinion leaders participate in the dissemination process intensively in this stage in this paper we will not analyze this participation stage in detail in the third stage from 130 minutes to 180 minutes a total of 5 opinion leaders joined the public opinion dissemination process the next fourth stage the fifth stage and the sixth stage are the single opinion leader joining stage that is only one opinion leader joins each stage in the seventh stage from 410 minutes to 740 minutes two opinion leaders join the public opinion dissemination process at the same time finally the eighth stage is from 740 minutes to 1040 minutes as the trend of this stage is stable so that we do not analyze it in this paper fig 4 shows the structure of the forwarding network of this information posted by an original post owner and forwarded by normal users and opinion leaders the length of lines between original post owner and opinion leaders represents the time when opinion leaders participate in the spread of the information which means the earlier they participate the shorter the line will be and this rule also applies between opinion leaders and normal forwarding users influenced by opinion leaders meanwhile it can be seen that aggregative forwarding behavior is very common between opinion leaders and normal forwarding users influenced by opinion leaders so that several small circles with the same color of opinion leaders can be concentrated in this figure it is obvious that opinion leaders have the ability to greatly affect the attitudes and behaviors of other users resulting in thousands of users participation in the dissemination of public opinion opinion leaders greatly promote the outbreak of public opinion and bring this original information to the trend of widespread dissemination as shown in fig 5 we perform a piecewise data fitting on the real data in table 1 where the blue star denotes the actual cumulative number of forwarding users affected by normal users the red star denotes the actual cumulative number of forwarding users affected by opinion leaders the blue line and the red line denote the estimated cumulative number of forwarding users affected by normal users and opinion leaders respectively fig 5a is the first non-opinion leader stage it is a traditional sfi 30 propagation process from fig 5b to 5f they are the stable opinion leader participation stages and in each stage our ol-sfi model all achieves accurate estimation table 3 gives the parameter results of the data fitting at each stage we can see that with the addition of opinion leaders the initial value of the susceptible users s0 is constantly increasing for their large number of fans but the parameters lnplpnl and n change irregularly the average contact rate l and n are determined by the structure of the network the forwarding probability pl and pn are affected by the users interest in this information and average rate l and n reflect the inactive character of users with the participation of new opinion leaders the normal users who forward opinion leaders information will affect their normal fans forwarding behavior later hence both instantaneous forwarding population fl influenced by opinion leaders and fn influenced by nomal users are changed at each stage table 2 shows the number of fans is not necessarily proportional to the final forwarding population of opinion leaders which confirms the irregular feature mentioned above the final forwarding population caused by an opinion leader with a larger number of fans may not be greater since the final forwarding population has a relationship with the vivacious level of fans personal interest in the topic and is also related to the time when the opinion leaders join in that is the situation of communication is different resulting in changes of parameters lnplpnl and n at each stage which validates the conclusions we have given above o is the public opinion reproduction ratio which is a function of time t as mentioned in section 3 representing the transmission capacity at each time when a new opinion leader joins the public opinion propagation process new susceptible users will be brought at the same time due to the participation of new susceptible users the network structure changes and individual characteristics in the network also change resulting in changes in parameters such as the average exposure rate l and n but overall the addition of opinion leaders will cause an increase in the public opinion reproduction ratio o as shown in table 4 and promote the spread of public opinion we aimed to quantify the role of superspreaders -opinion leaders- on covid-19 information propagation in the chinese sina-microblog fig 6 shows the trend of the cumulative forwarding population with the participation of opinion leaders where the orange line denotes the cumulative forwarding population with the original post owner and the remaining different color lines denote the different cumulative forwarding population after the participation of different opinion leaders from some perspectives it can be seen that the increase in the cumulative forwarding population caused by different opinion leaders varies among them opinion leader 7 has the greatest effect in promoting the development of public opinion which is related to the reasons we analyzed above such as the colossal number of fans the interest in the topic and so on as a whole it can be seen that before the opinion leaders join the public opinion outbreaks slowly with the addition of the first five opinion leaders the cumulative forwarding population begins to increase and public opinion breaks out when the curve is nearly flat the participation of new opinion leaders continues to increase the cumulative forwarding amount that is the addition of the opinion leaders gradually promote the dissemination to further analyze the different parameters responsible for the ol-sfi model we use the partial rank correlation coefficients prccs 31based on 1000 samples for various input parameters against the threshold condition to evaluate the sensitivity according to the histogram and scatter diagram of r01 dependence when the correlation is positive it means that with the increase of the value of the parameter the corresponding index value will increase on the contrary when the correlation is negative the index will decrease as the parameter decreases fig 7 shows the final size of the cumulative forwarding population is strongly positively affected by forwarding probabilities pl pn and the initial susceptible users s0 here the average forwarding probability affected by opinion leaders pl and the initial susceptible users s0 are all influenced by new susceptible users introduced by opinion leaders which also confirmed the conclusion before fig 8a8d show the excursion span of the value about the four single parameters in each subfigure is illustrated with an equal interval gradient involving the rank from high to low pl pn l n are four parameters that could best reflect the different influence between opinion leaders and normal users on public opinion they often play a significant part in determining the coverage of public opinion directly therefore if we want to acquire further conclusion it is necessary to establish a control group of flt fnt as well as clt cnt when these four parameters change independently which is regarded as our further analysis in order to discover the effect on information propagation caused by the crowds with distinct characteristics and make the different rates more evident between two kinds of population on the public opinion development as shown in fig 8a8d the excursion span of the value about the four single parameters in each subfigure is illustrated with an equal interval gradient involving the rank from high to low according to the overall parameters estimation results we also set the default values of each one considered as pl  013 pn  018 l  0005 and n  8  106 for instance in fig 8a only pl changes and the remaining three parameters are all fixed at their default values the other subfigures are similar to fig 8a it can be intuitively seen that instantaneous forwarding quantity and the cumulative forwarding quantity show a stronger sensitivity to l and n compared to the forwarding probability these two parameters fluctuate only in a very limited range however they would cause a drastic change in fl fn and cl cn so we can draw the following conclusions with an overview of fig 8
the larger values pl and l have the higher peak the instantaneous forwarding quantity can reach with this condition the final size of the cumulative forwarding population will also be in a stable state in advance in addition there is no doubt that the public opinion will break out faster with the increase of pl and lthe forwarding probability pl of opinion leaders has a positive effect on the trend about instantaneous forwarding quantity flt and cumulative forwarding quantity clt on the contrary the forwarding probability of normal users pn shows a slight negative effect on clt and flt this is due to the fact that when pn rises a small group of people who originally has a high probability to forward the information of opinion leaders may pull their ships head round to forward the information of normal users in addition after being influenced by opinion leaders some users will not forward the information of them but forward the information of the original post owner so the cumulative forwarding quantity directly caused by opinion leaders clt will relatively reduce a bit definitely fnt and cnt are more sensitive to the fluctuation of pn we can find out that even though pl has the half value of pn the coverage scale of public opinion caused by the former is approximately equal to the latter or even wider than it which powerfully proves that opinion leaders have much greater influence to promote the evolvement of public opinion than that produced by normal usersin most of the circumstances the average exposure rate of opinion leaders l also provides a positive effect on these indexes owing to the similar principles as the aforementioned content said the average exposure rate n belonging to normal users has a negative effect on clt and flt which is even more severe than that of pn from the default floating range of the two types of exposure rate it is obvious that the chance of an opinion leader being contacted with people is much greater than that of a normal user and the value of l is almost 1000 times than n part of the reason for this phenomenon stems from the considerable fan base and the strong voice of opinion leaders fig 9 shows the public opinion dissemination process with opinion leaders joining at different times implicating the influence of opinion leaders on the speed of information propagation and the final size of the cumulative forwarding population it can be seen that during the outbreak of public opinion the earlier the opinion leaders participate the greater the cumulative quantity of forwarding will be during the stable period of public opinion propagation it will appear the situation similar to the above and the final size of the cumulative number of forwarding will tend to be larger than that in the circumstance where opinion leaders join in the information propagation during the outbreak therefore if we intend to make one information become popular much faster we can persuade opinion leaders to get involved in the early stage of the information outbreak as quickly as possible moreover if we mainly hope to broaden the coverage of public opinion and more people contact with the relevant information we can allow opinion leaders to participate in the stable period of propagation in this paper we propose an opinion-leader susceptible-forwarding-immune ol-sfi dynamics model based on the forwarding quantities generated by opinion leaders and normal users in different stages from the chinese sina-microblog during the outbreak of covid-19 for there are always many opinion leaders with an enormous fan base in a real-world investigating the propagation mechanism with the influence of opinion leaders is extraordinarily necessary and significant we take the great driving power of the opinion leaders in the information propagation process into consideration while studying the spreading dynamics of the information within the interference of different numbers of opinion leaders at each active period the role of our model is to examine how opinion leaders have influenced public opinion and information propagation in different stages when the outbreak unfolds we have performed the data fitting based on the real data related to covid-19 obtained from chinese sina-microblog to verify the effectiveness of our model based on the results of numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis at different stages we can use the rules of evolution with regard to characteristic indexes of public opinion to formulate effective interventions for opinion leaders to participate in the public opinion to a large extent the average inactive rate  in this model is determined by the general publics character and their interest so it is more difficult to be controlled however we can have an insight into the hidden crisis behind the public opinion by putting average exposure rates and forwarding probabilities into a real-time update strategy more significantly the index o which is calculated from actual data can be used to derive the thresholds of pn and n utilizing a contrary thinking so that we could simulate the earlier brewing process of public opinion and notify the relevant departments to make plans of facing the emergency before the outbreak of public opinion on the other hand for some positive information we are supposed to encourage opinion leaders to forward it several times in order to increase the forwarding probability pl and average exposure rate l meanwhile it can be inferred from the estimation results of cumulative forwarding quantity that the best time and the appropriate number of opinion leaders for the intervention in different stages consequently we are able to use the golden stage to maximize the positive influence of those opinion leaders as for some bad information we need to reduce the exposure rate of normal users n avoiding more people to read such information and at the same time n could be increased in this way it is more conducive to creating a good direction for the development of public opinion and avoiding sharpening conflicts between different kinds of people furthermore it is vital to pay attention to c by doing real-time detection of its tendency combined with the results of prcc analysis if we perceive that some pieces of harmful information have entered the situation where the public opinion is well prepared to break out n and pn should be declined as soon as possible simultaneously it is necessary to stop the participation of opinion leaders by preventing pl increasing successively to make the number of susceptible users s0 decrease so as to avoid the harmful public opinion to become a more severe deterioration in a word the propagation scale can be gradually promoted with the participation of opinion leaders and their entering time will control the forwarding lifeline that is the earlier opinion leaders get into the intervention the greater their influence will be our focus here is to make use of our ol-sfi dynamics model to help original post owners design effective communication strategies for the on-going battle against covid-19 and future pandemic outbreaks in terms of public opinion and information dissemination  super-spreaders and the rate of transmission of the sars virus michael small ck tse david walker m   the sars virus first appeared during october 2002 in the guangdong province of southern china it then passed over the border to hong kong and from there spread to europe africa asia australia and the americas 1 the outbreak in 2003 infected 8422 killing 916 2 in this paper we focus on modelling the transmission of sars within hong kong beside mainland china hong kong suffered the greatest casualties 2 in addition the epidemiological data currently available for hong kong is far superior to that of the chinese mainland1
 two characteristic features were observed during the sars outbreak in hong kong in 2003 see fig 1
 3 4 so-called super-spread events sse in which a single individual initiates a large number of cases and persistent transmission within the community two widely cited sses were observed early in the epidemic and have been the subject of much attention at the amoy gardens housing estate and at the prince of wales hospital epidemiological studies 5 1 have found that in hong kong the fatality rate was approximately 17 compared to 11 globallythe mean incubation period was 64 days range 210 days 6the duration between onset of symptoms and hospitalisation was 35 days andthe mean number of individuals infected by each case during the initial phase of the epidemic excluding sses was 27 4
fig 1daily sars infection data for hong kong the top panel is the daily infection rate reported in the hong kong media during the outbreak the lower plot is the revised estimated daily number of infections determined after more detailed investigation by the hong kong department of health at the end of the epidemic 105 days after the first recorded case a total of 1755 confirmed infections had been identified in hong kong both data sets are freely available standard deterministic sir susceptible-infected-removed models of the spread of infectious diseases 7 make several important assumptions an alternative approach 8 particularly popular for the study of sexually transmitted diseases 9 10 11 is to build an explicit network and model disease transmission along the links under certain network structures it is then possible to obtain a closed form study of the underlying transmission pattern 10 12 in particular 12 studied the transmission of an epidemic among a population whose individuals are connected both locally and globally from this they were able to obtain an approximately poisson distribution for the contact distribution in 13 hufnagel and co-workers also studied the local and non-local transmission of epidemics the main features modelled by 13 are local sir infection with the usual stochastic differential equations and long distance complex network links to model global aviation routes they show that transmission dynamics with similar geographical dispersion to the 2003 sars outbreak can develop in the model in contrast to 13 we focus on abstract network models within a particular community a similar global model of sars transmission could be achieved by introducing an aviation network model on top of the models presented in this paper recently both small-world sw and scale-free sf networks have been observed in many areas of natural and physical science including social relationships 14 15 the important feature of both sw and sf networks is that they are highly connected the average path length between random individuals is relatively short moreover for sf networks the node degree distribution follows a scale-free distribution hence in many areas of natural and physical science this new model structure has unveiled a rich range of behaviours in this paper we apply these methods to the modelling of the spread of sars in hong kong transmission is only allowed to occur along a limited number of direct links between individuals by doing this we will avoid making one of the assumptions underlying standard susceptible-infected-removed sir models a homogeneous fully connected population the sir model assumes that all individuals are susceptible to the disease and all suffer an equal small positive probability of contracting the virus this homogeneous model leads to a continuous and smooth inter-day distribution of infections irregularities in this are usually attributed to random variation and non-stationarity in the model parameters in proposing an alternative to the standard sir model we do not claim that the sir model has failed certainly the power of any model lies in its simplicity and its ability to capture the important features of a system hence like the sir model the complex network model that we describe here is very simple and is described by a very small number of parameters analysis of the spread of sars with sir models shows good correlation between decreasing infection rate r and the introduction of various governmental control measures quarantine and public awareness campaigns 16 however these results are based on a very simplistic model and localised outbreaks such as the incident at amoy gardens are not modelled very well while it is impossible to predict the occurrence of such outbreaks swsf models provide a more realistic physical model of the relationships between individuals in a community and will therefore provide a better picture of the true disease dynamics note that since one cannot actually predict when a particular sse will occur one cannot accurately model the timing of the peak in the time series of fig 1 moreover it is not possible to accurately model the initial sse at the prince of wales hospital which kick started the sars outbreak in hong kong to include the same initial spread of sars in hong kong via a rather singular sse that sse must be included explicitly in the model in other areas where swsf models have been applied a rich range of behaviours has been observed unlike standard differential equation based models sw andor sf structures model the underlying network of connections between individuals directly our model is designed to capture explicitly the small-world features of social interaction our model is not scale-free to generate a scale-free model for disease epidemics one needs a power-law distribution of infection links we consider the theoretical implementation of such a model in a separate paper 16 finally we will also provide one possible answer to the question posed by galvani and may 17 were sars super-spreaders anomalies or are super-spreaders characteristic of most infectious diseases 17 we show that even with uniform rates of infection super-spreaders will occur to varying degrees in a small-world or scale-free 16 network the implication is that super-spreaders are not necessarily a result of variable rate of infection nonetheless we argue that the sars outbreak in hong kong was initiated by a single rather unfortunate super-spreader event in the next section we describe our model and study its behaviour analytically subsequent sections present some numerical simulations and a summary of our results our aim is to capture accurately the qualitative features of the sars epidemic with the simplest model the fewest parameters we propose four distinct states individuals can be susceptible s prone p infected i or removed r the transmission path is depicted in fig 2
 infected individuals can cause susceptible individuals to whom they are linked to become prone with some probability p1 or p2 by infection we mean the transition from the susceptible state to the prone state infected individuals can cause their immediate neighbours to become infected with probability p1 long range links cause infection with probability p2 prone individuals become infected with probability r0 and finally infected individuals become removed with probability r1 just as in the sir model we do not distinguish fatalities from recoveries in either case the individuals are assumed to have acquired immunity the model states that we describe here bear a close correspondence to the four states of the seir model the prone state is analogous to the exposed e state in the seir model we choose to use the new term p because the epidemiological state is slightly different by prone we mean both the infected but not infectious incubation period and the pre-symptomatic period for sars all infections in hong kong could be traced to contact with a symptomatic individual2
hence for the purposes of modelling transmission we assume that during the pre-symptomatic period there is no chance of transmission moreover to calibrate our model with the observed data which by definition are hospital admissions we further prescribe that the time between the onset of symptoms and hospitalisation is constant or equivalently follows a stationary unimodal distributionfig 2the top panel depicts the transmission state diagram s to p based on the sw structure and the infection probabilities p12 p to i with probability r0 and i to r with probability r1 the lower panel depicts the distinction between local ie short range and non-local long range network links the lower panel shows the arrangement of nodes in a small-world network the black infected node may infect its four immediate neighbours with probability p1 and three other nodes hashed with probability p2 in our model we explicitly model the geographical structure of the population we include both local and non-local links because of common transmission of sars within specific housing estates and districts in hong kong and the both real and perceived risk of transmission in workplaces primarily hospitals and schools or other public areas we model these two types of transmission separately the geographical arrangement of nodes represents the residence of each individual so by local transmission we mean only transmission within a family unit ie residents of a single flat or between adjacent flats3
hence non-local transmission refers to transmission between non-family members due to the mixing of individuals in public spaces in the context of the sars outbreak in hong kong this would include transmission within hospitals schools and public spaces in our model we expect sse to be represented through a single node with a large number of non-local connections4
 we fix the population n and assume that there are no other additions to or deletions from the population from any other cause for the duration of each simulation the population of n nodes is arranged in a regular grid of side length l l2n and each node is connected directly to n1 immediate neighbours5
an infected individual will infect each of its n1 neighbours provided that they are still susceptible with probability p1 furthermore each node has n2 non-local ie long distance links see fig 2 these are links to nodes that are geographically remote from one another infection occurs along these pathways with probability p2 for each node i the number n2i is fixed and so are the links to its n2i remote neighbours once they are established the number n2i is chosen to be proportional to a decaying exponential fxxex with parameter  proportional to the expected average number of links to remote nodes where n2ix hence we have 1pn2im1cem where cm0em11e1 it is the inclusion of non-local links with a random number of links that can give rise to the networks sw and in other cases not considered here sf structure in this paper we assign an exponentially decaying probability distribution to any number of links and for uni-directional links this is sufficient to generate the necessary sw properties an sf network requires a power-law distribution of the number of links which can consequently lead to more nodes with many more links and we do not examine that case here the sf distribution of the induced network of actual infections has been considered elsewhere 16 it is worth considering that for the model that we present here the links between nodes are uni-directional that is infection only spreads in one direction clearly the true network of social interaction consists of bi-directional links but for the purposes of simulating disease transmission unidirectional links appear to be a sufficient approximation the consequence of this is that it becomes easier to generate the small-world and elsewhere the scale-free network finally for each simulation we seed the model with one randomly chosen initial infection we expect that computational simulations of this network will show that infection spreads locally just as sars spread within particular geographical regions of hong kong moreover the system can also exhibit non-local infection as a single individual may infect individuals in distant communities occasionally individuals will infect a large number of others exactly as was observed at the start of the sars epidemic in hong kong an sse however unlike the start of the sars epidemic in hong kong because we seed our population with a single infectious individual we do not expect to see the initial sse triggered by that individual except by chance therefore the initial growth of transmission in our model is exponential rather than an sse the only way to overcome this is to include explicitly the seed sse in the model regardless of network topology the epidemic will eventually be contained if the rate of infection is lower than the rate of removal intuitively provided that n1p1p2r1 one would expect the disease to become endemic conversely if n1p1p2r1 the disease will be contained in what follows we study this condition more precisely moreover with this model we can analytically compute the probability of an outbreak being self-terminating for a single infectious node the probability of no further infections on a given day is given by 2pno1m01p1n11p2mpn2im1p1n11e1m0e11p2m1p1n1e11e11p2 hence the probability of no further infections from this node can be closely approximated by the infinite geometric series using the average pno1 computed in eq 2 3pnonepno1r1pno121r1r1pno131r12r1pno1r11pno11r1 provided that pno11r11 upon substitution of eq 2 into 3 we find that 4pnoner11p1n111r11p1n1p2e11
 eq 4 is the probability of no infections from a given individual and is therefore a weak lower bound on the probability of no general outbreak now let us denote the probability of no further infections occurring given that there are k infectious nodes by pkpnonekprobno further infectionk infectious nodes where for notational convenience we will drop the subscript on pnone treating infections as discrete events ie they occur one at a time we have that 1pk is the probability of at least one further infection from k infectious nodes the probability that the epidemic will terminate is given by 5psafep1pp21p2p31p3p41p4m0pm1n1m1pn where ppnone is given by eq 4 by expanding eq 5 and comparing to the pentagonal number theorem6
we find that eq 5 can be rewritten as an infinite sum 6m0pm1n1m1pnpp2p5p7p12p15p22m11m1p12m3m1p12m3m1 where the sequence of indices 012571215222635 is the generalised pentagonal numbers described as sequence a001318 in 18 eq 6 may also be re-written in terms of the dedekind eta function but for the purposes of this discussion it is unnecessary to do so nonetheless for 0p1 this sequence converges fairly rapidly as the order of the exponent increases the exact7
probability of a general outbreak can alternatively be obtained by using a branching process method following 19 we define 7g1x1p1p1xn1m01cem1p2p2xm1p1p1xn11e11e11p2p2x the probability generating function for the number of secondary cases produced by a single infectious case in a day then the probability generating function for the overall number of secondary infections from a single primary case is 8gxj1g1xjr11r1j1r1g1x11r1g1x one can then obtain the probability of no general outbreak ie the probability of the disease not becoming endemic as the smallest solution x01 of gxx unfortunately eq 8 cannot be readily used for further analysis similarly although eq 5 can be computed easily it is not in a form that is immediately amenable for further analysis however since psafepnone it is clear that 11p2e11 will make psafe0 hence either 1 or p21 will lead to widespread infection as expected differentiating 5 with respect to 1p1n1 we can easily verify that psafe is a monotonic function of both p1 and n1 one can therefore observe that psafe0 if p11 or n11 the most severe limitation on eq 5 and also eqs 7 8 is that we assume that no infected nodes have common neighbours and that all of the neighbours are susceptible in reality the number of potential infections is limited by the fact that some of the potential neighbours are already infected it is therefore important to estimate the number of neighbours of an infected node that have not been infected this is equivalent to estimating the ratio of local and non-local infections in an epidemic8
 one can consider the network of infected individuals as consisting of a number of clumps one clump for each non-local infection ie each clump is seeded by a non-local transmission all other transmissions within that clump are local provided p20 this implies that as the clump gets bigger the probability of any given infection being a long range infection will increase conversely as the number of clumps increases the probability of local infection relative to non-local infection will increase9
 let us now estimate the expected number of connections from an infected node let ns denote the expected number of susceptible nodes linked to a random node if this node is the result of a non-local infection then we suppose that nsn1 however if this is the result of a short range infection then this number should be lower certainly no more than n11 now problong range infectioninfectionp2n1kp1p2probshort range infectioninfectionn1kp1n1kp1p2 where k is the proportion of local links that support possible infection and 0kn11n1 hence 10nsn1p2n1kp1p2n1kn1kp1n1kp1p2n1n1k2p1p2n1kp1p2
 from the preceding geometric argument if infection grows in a single clump then k12 moreover k12 only if nodes remain infected when they are on the interior of such clump ie when r1 is very low we would therefore expect that 12kn11n1 note that k is not a model parameter but rather it is a term in the model that will both depend on the various model parameters and vary with time finally we now consider the rate of transmission let pt it and rt be the number of prone infected and removed individuals at time t in days the probabilities r0 and r1 can therefore be considered as the rates at which prone nodes become infectious and infectious nodes become removed respectively similarly n1p1kp2stit is the expected number of new infections suppose that strtitptt then 11rt1rtr1itit1itr1itr0ptpt1ptr0ptnkit where nkn1p1kp2 is the expected number of links for each infectious node we are now modelling the inter-day process assuming discrete day-to-day dynamics the reason for this approximation is that the available time series data which will be the basis of our comparison is similarly course-grained assuming that the population is seeded with a single infectious individual the solution of eq 11 is given by 12rtitpt1r1001r1r00nk1r0t010pdtp1010t where pv1v2v3 is the matrix of eigenvectors and dt1t0002t0003t is formed from the corresponding eigenvalues given by 11231r0r1214r0r12nkr0 it then follows that the system has a marginally stable focus ie the epidemic will terminate if 231 ie 13nkr114nkr02r02r1 the second condition 14 is only violated if nk1 which would also violate condition 13 therefore the epidemic is controllable provided that nkn1p1kp2r1 the right hand side of this inequality is the rate of infection and the left hand side is the rate of removal as expected in fact this result is exactly analogous to the equivalent result for the continuous sir model 7 moreover 15maxi123i1r0r1214r0r12nkr0
 computationally we can see that as r0 or nk increases then the rate of growth of the epidemic also increases conversely as r1 increases the rate of growth decreases this is as one would expect as increasing r1 will decrease the number of infectious individuals while increasing either r0 or nk increases this quantity as stated our model has seven explicit parameters l n1  p1 p2 r1 and r2 for the population of hong kong we set l2700 nl27290000 we arbitrarily choose n14 and set en27 16 one further parameter is the time interval between successive steps in the discrete time simulations from our model we choose the natural scale of one day however it is not obvious that this is the best choice given that the data is discretised to this interval it is perhaps the best choice in this situation nonetheless to confirm that this choice is appropriate we have repeated our analysis with both longer and shorter time steps the results are equivalent the average incubation period between infection and an individual becoming symptomatic is 64 days 6 the number of days in the prone state can therefore be modelled as the result of a series of independent bernoulli trials with a mean 1r0 and so it follows a geometric distribution fxx1px1p10
for a general disease model it would possibly be more appropriate to have a separate state for the pre-symptomatic but infectious period although contact tracing of all sars patients in hong kong has demonstrated that this is not a significant period for sars we have repeated the simulations with this state if the hiatus in this state is relatively short the results are not altered significantly in a similar spirit the time before hospitalisation is 35 days and we model this as a series of independent bernoulli trials in an effort to establish the degree to which hospital transmission in our model matches what was observed we first assume that hospitalisation is equivalent to isolation of infectious individuals that is we suppose that infectious individuals are only infectious for 35 days the current weight of evidence suggests that hospital transmission was a crucial factor for the sars outbreak in hong kong during 2003 we will show that this is also the case for our model hence we suppose for now that the average amount of time prior to isolation is 4 days we will consider larger values later in our model the number of days prior to hospitalisation is also made to follow a geometric distribution with mean 1r1 hence the only free parameters are  p1 and p2 without active control we also know that the average number of new infections per case excluding sses is 27 4 in this state each infectious individual will infect on average n1p1en2ip2 new individuals every day since en2i and we suppose that the time before hospitalisation is d days we have 16n1p1p227d we set d4 and therefore p11n10675p20135n1p2 in subsequent simulations we also consider d346 and also a larger number of new infections than 27 in each case the results are equivalent to those presented here however we maintain the values described above in the following discussion any deviation of results between these and other values will be highlighted in the text our initial model parameters are therefore 16 l2700r0174014r114025n147 andp1013574p2 note that because we have the possibility of p to i transition after zero days r0174 rather than 164 this does not have a significant effect on our results it is merely a computational convenience now from eq 15 we can deduce that the rate of growth of infection is approximately 1050135r10135r1206753p17p2 which for r1025 yields either a growth rate significantly less than exhibited in the data or rates of infection significantly greater even for reasonable variation of d and the average number of secondary infections we obtain similar results hence we conclude that the assumption of no nosocomial transmission is inconsistent with the observed data increasing the average infectious time to 6 days gives a substantially higher rate of infection consistent with the observed data subject to eq 5 we explore which parameter values give a significant probability of the epidemic becoming endemic from eq 13 we have that psafe1 if nkr1 consistent with the discussion of the preceding section we start with the assumption that kn11n1 and set n14 and 7 fig 3
is a plot of the probability of complete infection for various parameter values estimated from the data and eq 5 we see that there is close agreement between the theoretical and experimental results moreover we note that a smaller value of k is appropriate for scenarios with a relatively high proportion of local spreading ie p1 larger and p20 this is consistent with the case of spreading within a single clump and we approach the situation of k12 however in these simulations the best choice is k12 in all cases only for extremely small values of r1 and p2 would we expect smaller values of k typically kn11n134 seems to be a good choice furthermore in fig 3 it is evident that the greatest probability of an epidemic becoming endemic is when there is both local and non-local infection in the model that we have constructed here local infection spreads approximately geometrically11
while non-local infection spreads exponentially yet it is some combination of both that provided the greatest possibility of an outbreak spreading without control clearly exponential growth will lead all else being equal to more rapid growth of an epidemic than geometric growth but by combining some geometric growth the epidemic becomes even more dangerous it seems that the additional local transmissions allow each non-local transmission the possibility of seeding a new infection cluster rather than just a single point and each new cluster is more difficult to eradicate than a single point infection 
fig 4
depicts level curves for the probability of fixed levels of infection that is we compute the parameter values p1201 and r10105 required to achieve specific values of psafe we see that only for p1202 is the outbreak likely to be controlled moreover the variation with r1 is not critical ie the range of behaviour for specific p12 is not great finally in fig 5
we plot the probability of the epidemic being controlled for various values of  with p1201 r001 and r1025 consistent with fig 4 results for different values of r01 did not change significantly moreover from fig 5 we see that only for 2 does the infection probability p2 have a significant effect that is to limit long range infection one should aim to reduce the average number of long range links below 2 we find that for all values of p12 and 2 there was remarkably little variation in the value of psafe however the rate of infection eq 15 did change significantly subject to the choice of parameters in the previous sections we now simulate the expected dynamics and compare this to the theoretical bounds of section 22 according to theory restricting the infectious period to five or fewer days does not yield a growth rate large enough to be consistent with the observed data we test that assertion numerically and find that the observed data over 1000 individuals infected after 50 days is inconsistent with the simulation for r1025 however by lowering r1 to 0165 and therefore increasing the mean infectious period to six days we achieve results more consistent with the observed data we see that only with r10165 do we obtain results for which the true data is not statistically atypical moreover this result is robust to moderate changes of the other relevant parameters as illustrated in fig 6
 we conclude that the obtained results for which the true data is not atypical we require r10165 ie a mean exposure time of six or more days moreover we see from fig 6 that widespread infection is associated with a large number of clusters the results of the next section corroborate this to examine the role of clustering more closely fig 7
is a snapshot of a single simulation for parameter values r1025 and p20006 this simulation shows sse resulting from clustering and highly connected nodes moreover the gradual spread of the disease within a single cluster is evident one can see that the number of clusters is far less than the number of infections time series of the infection total appear qualitatively similar to the hong kong sars data specifically burstiness typical of sses is evident however the quantitative behaviour of this model is remarkably different to the dynamics observed in the sars outbreak the daily number of reported infections in fig 1 far exceeds the total number of active infected and prone individuals in fig 7 finally we provide simulations of the hong kong epidemic and from multiple simulations estimate the likelihood of various outcomes based on the model we initiate the model with a single infected individual and a relatively low removal rate r1 fig 8
depicts our results we can see from fig 8 that many of the features of the true data are reproduced well in the simulations however two important aspects of the simulations are not sufficiently similar to the data firstly the initial spreading of the disease is exponential rather than the single sse observed in the real data secondly the magnitude of the sses in the simulations is somewhat smaller than the largest sses in the data this second aspect can be overcome by simply altering the distribution of non-local links in 16 we describe how a power-law distribution of links can lead to many more extreme events conversely the initial sse in the data cannot be modelled well by our simulations except by chance therefore to achieve similar initial events we would expect that we would have to execute many simulations and choose only those that suit our purpose or simply build the sse into the model neither of these approaches are desirable we prefer to focus on the possibility of sses occurring randomly without explicitly adding them in the model hence we do see sses but not necessarily immediately after the start of the simulation as we suppose occurred in the true data we now wish to demonstrated how the sw model described here improves on stochastic sir-type models 7 one very simple way to achieve this is to compare the distribution of statistic values measured from simulations of either type of model to the true data in fig 9
we do this and we find that the small-world model exhibits statistical properties much closer to the observed data in fig 9 we compare the results for the sir-type model with stochastic inputs to the sw model described in this paper by generating multiple simulations of both models and estimating simple statistical measures from both sets of simulations we see that the model dynamics of the sw model are much closer to the true datafig 9probability distribution on the lag one autocorrelation for 1000 simulations of the sw model and the standard sir model with stochastic perturbations the heavy vertical line is the equivalent quantity for the true data we see that the simulations from the sw model b are indistinguishable from the data the sir model panel a is not assuming that this model and parameters are accurate or at least appropriate we compute the likely behaviour for various epidemics we generated 1000 realisations of the model depicted in fig 8 and computed the total number of casualties fig 10
is a plot of the probability distribution of the number of fatalities for these simulations and fig 11
is the probability distribution for the daily number of infections we found that the probability of infecting fewer than 20 people was approximately 018 while the probability of infecting more than 1000 was 027 one can see that with respect to these gross statistics the true situation for hong kong 1755 casualties is quite typical12
it is interesting to note however that there is a large variation in the number of casualties in all cases the parameter values of fig 8 provided effective control of sars transmission after approximately 150 days from these simulations we therefore conclude that with effective control measures in place the likelihood of a significant outbreak is low we summarise the main results of the preceding sections as follows the probability of the disease spread being controlled psafe is approximately m0pm1n1m1pm where pr11p1n111r11p1n1p2e11 section 22 an equivalent value can also be obtained from the smallest zero of eq 8 subject to 7 in 01the epidemic is under control if nkn1kp1p2r1 section 22for the endemic case the rate of growth of infection is 1r0r1214r0r12nkr0
this model exhibits behaviour consistent with both sses and persistent localised transmission section 34 more extreme sses can be observed simply by fattening the tail of the distribution of links by assigning a power-law distribution to the number of nonlocal links that a node has one can readily obtain sse involving many hundreds of secondary infections from a single sourcean sse does not imply highly infectious individuals only highly connected ones section 34theoretical results and model simulations are unlike the true data unless exposure time is significantly greater than an average of three days 22 33 if the exposure time is three days or less the rate of growth of the epidemic is significantly lower than that observed in the true datanosocomial transmission was therefore a key factor in the acuteness of the sars epidemic in hong kong in 2003 effective control of hospital transmissions would have prevented a serious outbreak section 33 with respect to nosocomial transmission our model therefore confirms what has been observed independently and suggested by many authorssimulations of our model with minimal parameter variation produced dynamics indistinguishable from the true data these same parameter values exhibit a wide variety of behaviours section 35 hence any effort to actually obtain maximum likelihood parameter estimates from the observed data is futile despite this our calculations show that the true data is certainly typical of our models moreover our models exhibit a marked long-tailedness both in infection times and epidemic lifetimesthe likelihood of infecting fewer than 20 people was approximately 018 and the likelihood of infecting more than 1000 was 027 section 35
 apart from deriving analytic expression for the spreading and control of an epidemic the main results of this study when applied to the sars epidemic in hong kong in 2003 is that our data is consistent with the observation that the epidemic that occurred was largely preventable the primary factor for the severity of the outbreak was poor infection control in the hospital setting and the delayed introduction of quarantine and community isolation practices this is consistent with various discussions presented elsewhere however we note that nosocomial transmission was considered only by supposing admittedly erroneously that the time between becoming symptomatic and infectious and hospitalisation is constant nosocomial transmission is simulated by changing the expected duration between becoming symptomatic i and becoming removed r although this is perhaps unconventional from an epidemiological viewpoint it is probably the best that we can do as the only data that we have to work from is the date of hospital admission this conclusion is in contrast with work done by pastor-satorras and colleagues 20 21 with scale-free sis type 7 disease models in that case they found that the disease would almost always persist and that random immunisation was ineffective 21 the model presented here emphasised the small-world transmission dynamics created by providing a small number of highly connected nodes we model the inter-connection between nodes with one-directional links rather than the bi-directional links we would expect for social contacts because this makes the network much easier to construct without sacrificing any realism this model could easily be extended to exhibit scale-free characteristics by simply altering the distribution of non-local links to follow a power-law distribution doing so would produce simulations with a larger number of highly connected individuals and therefore we could simulate the largest sses in the data the results presented in this paper show small less than 100 individuals sses extension to the power-law distribution would provide sses with a larger number of secondary infections we should note that it is very difficult to reliably and accurately fit even a moderate number of parameters to a stochastic model from such limited data especially when the model for the same parameter values can exhibit a wide variety of behaviour to overcome this we a make our model so simple that the number of parameters is very few certainly comparable in number to ordinary sir and b only fit the model with typical parameter values and test that for these parameter values the observed data is typical certainly we cannot exclude the quite likely probability that other parameter values also produce behaviour of which the observed data is typical therefore in this paper we only draw conclusions based on our observations of parameters that produce behaviours that are either typical or more importantly atypical of the observed data although we have observed that our model exhibits more realistic dynamics than sir models it is only a model and like the sir model our model is a compromise between complexity and realism we intend to address this problem in the future by applying monte carlo markov chain models 22 to this sparse data 23 even our choice of a discrete time model is open to debate the choice with a time interval chosen as one day was motivated by the data and what was more intuitive to us we have conducted calculations with both longer and shorter inter-interval time scales and find that the results are invariant under a suitable change in time scale ie we get equivalent results by using a shorter time step moreover recent epidemiological case studies have found that overall in hong kong 8 of individuals sharing a flat with a sars patient contracted sars 24 given an average infectious period of four days prior to hospitalisation this implies that the daily probability of transmission is 002 this is approximately consistent with the values of p1 used in this study and therefore provides further support of our results conversely analysis of the sse at the prince of wales hospital found that for a group of medical students the probability of direct contact with the index patient leading to sars infection was 1027 5 as this study dealt with a single meeting this implies a daily infection probability of approximately 0371 significantly higher than p2 in our simulations hence although we have concluded that sses may occur without individuals necessarily being highly infectious epidemiological evidence suggests that in some cases this may still be the case finally we note that although the methods presented here are applied only to the sars outbreak in hong kong in 2003 these methods are not limited to this situation apart from repeating or modifying this analysis for different infectious diseases such as hiv aids we imagine that these techniques could be useful in the theoretical study of quarantine and isolation practices as well as disease transmission among isolated communities quarantine can be effectively modelled as a limitation of long range transmission one can easily model change in quarantine by varying the parameter  or alternatively but not equivalently p2 this should provide a new simpler approach to the study of quarantine to supplement compartmental models such as those described in 25  a study of the probable transmission routes of merscov during the first hospital outbreak in the republic of korea s xiao y li m sung j wei z yang   as a novel human coronavirus with alarming morbidity and mortality1 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov has become a global threat since it was first identified in 2012 by september 2017 over 2000 cases of merscov had been reported in 27 countries leading to at least 722 deaths2 although the majority of those cases were distributed on or near the arabian peninsula3 a single imported case in the republic of korea led to an unprecedentedly large mers epidemic between may and july 20154 revealing the potential for the global spread of mers5
 similar to other coronaviruses merscov is thought to be shed mainly in the respiratory secretions of infected individuals and spread through respiratory activities such as coughing however the precise humantohuman transmission routes of the virus remain unclear6 as shown in figure 1 three major possible transmission routes are known to exist for communicable respiratory infections the longrange airborne route the close contact route and the fomite route7 8 9 the current dominant view is that merscov largely spreads via the respiratory close contact route10 11 which is supported by evidence that most of the affected healthcare workers hcws have been nurses who have had prolonged and repeated close contact with merscov patients12 nevertheless the possible roles of airborne and fomite transmission cannot be excluded research suggests that merscov may be spread through longrange airborne transmission for example the viral rna has been detected on the entrance to airventilating equipment13 and the virus has been detected in air samples from patients rooms restrooms and common corridors14 on the other hand seo et al13 and kim et al14 detected merscov rna on objects in mers patients rooms and in elevators and experiments by van doremalen et al15 suggest that merscov is able to survive on surfaces long enough for further transmission which increases the likelihood of fomite transmission thus the recommendations of world health organization who10 16 and centers for disease control and prevention cdc17 on standard precaution droplet precaution contact precaution and airborne precaution remain vague a better understanding of the exact transmission mode of merscov could aid the development and selection of more appropriate and effective intervention methods healthcare settings have been investigated as breeding grounds for large mers outbreaks because many cases of infection have not been recognized and isolated in time3 5 18 similarly in the republic of korea almost all cases are suspected to have been hospital acquired originating from pyeongtaek st marys hospital19 the index patient for the outbreak in this hospital was a 68yearold man who had recently travelled to the middle east and was hospitalized from 15 to may 17 2015 with no isolation or protection measures implemented4 he was thought to have directly infected 26 people including 11 other patients 13 visitors or family members and two hcws4 compared to previous nosocomial outbreaks on or near the arabian peninsula this outbreak was larger20 and the distribution of infection showed a clear spatial pattern although the sample size was not sufficiently large for this pattern to be statistically significant to investigate the probable transmission routes of merscov we carried out a detailed modeling study of the outbreak in pyeongtaek st marys hospital we retrospectively analyzed the spatial pattern of infection and developed a multiagent model to simulate the possible spread of the virus from the index patients ward by air flow close contact and surface touching table 1 lists the seven hypotheses examined in the study three for single routes three for tworoute combinations and one for a threeroute combination the doseresponse relationship model was used to calculate the possible infection risk for each hypothesis a major challenge with this approach is the lack of appropriate input data such as doseresponse parameters hence a range of such parameters was considered with various value combinations of important parameters leastsquares fitting was carried out in 1140 scenarios to compare the distribution of the infection risk with that of the reported attack rates the results presented below provide probable evidence for the transmission of merscov in different scenarios our analyses allowed us to retrospectively acquire the largest viruscontaining droplet sizes doseresponse parameters and virus loads as revealed by google maps and verified by our field visits pyeongtaek st marys hospital is located in a rather open area and is much taller than all of the surrounding buildings except one as shown in figure 2 the outbreak occurred on the eighth floor of the hospital for which the floor plan is shown in figure 3 the floor plan excluding the elevators and storerooms was used as the computational domain the index patient stayed in the hospital from 15 to 17 may 2015 and thus this period was taken as the suspected exposure period the symptoms of the index patient included fever cough dyspnoea and myalgia21
 the eighth floor contained one nurses station and 32 wards comprising 19 single rooms rooms 82018219 six double rooms rooms 81018106 and seven large rooms for five room 8109 or seven persons rooms 8107 and 8108 and rooms 81108113 according to the hospital staff nurses and cleaners visited patients on the floor from room 8101 in a clockwise direction to room 8219 a mechanical ventilation system which included a supply and an exhaust was installed in all rooms except the index patients room room 810422 the mechanical ventilation rate was assumed to be 10 ls per person each room had a separate ceiling fan coil unit to provide cooling and heating and each toilet had a separate exhaust system the toilet exhaust air flow rate was assumed to be 6 ach there were two small windows each 35  35 cm in the single rooms and double rooms four in the large rooms and 10 in the corridor the doors and windows in the regular rooms were usually closed because there was no ventilation system in the index patients room we assumed that the door and windows in this room were slightly 15 open during the day and completely closed at night figure 3 shows the total numbers of infected patients of the first generation and other inpatients on the eighth floor of pyeongtaek st marys hospital we studied the infection patterns of the inpatients because they stayed on the floor longer and more data are available during the period in which the index patient was hospitalized 11 mers cases of 67 normal patients were reported in the first generation on the eighth floor4 we assumed that all of the exposure doses received by the first generation of infected patients came from the index patient as a result of his respiratory activities such as coughing6 wards on the floor were categorized by their position in four regions namely the source ward room 8104 adjacent wards rooms 81018103 and 81058108 downstream wards rooms 81098113 and remote wards rooms 82138219 the average attack rate was 016 the rate was highest in the source ward 100 lower in the downstream and adjacent wards 021 and 012 respectively and nonexistent in remote wards 000 because we evaluated the seven hypotheses based on the differences between the attack rate and predicted infection risk in different regions the spatial distribution characteristics of the different hypotheses were important factors in our study however the existing models such as the discretetime markov chain model8 23 and the differential equation model24 25 are commonly used to estimate overall infection risk and thus predict uniform distributions therefore we developed a multiagent model26 which enabled us to model the individual heterogeneities caused by the agents behavior and geographical environment27 28 figure 4 shows the system architecture of our model the system is modular based and consists of four basic components the initialization generator simulation engine global database and data processing module appendix s1 fig s1 shows the basic procedures included in the program for the model the initialization generator has two branches namely the geometric generator and agents generator the geometric generator is used to build the virtual physical environment and produce surfaces based on the literature29 30 and life experience we identified 20 kinds of representative surface which were appendix s2 table s1 classified into five groups according to their materials namely porous surfaces nonporous surfaces toilet surfaces skin and mucous membranes which differ in properties such as virus transfer rates appendix s2 table s2 and virus inactivation rates appendix s2 table s3 the agents generator was used to create representative individuals during the outbreak five representative resident roles were identified as study objects that is inpatients visitors family members nurses and cleaners the numbers of agents are shown in appendix s2 table s8 each autonomous agent directly corresponds to one human individual in the real world the simulation engine which comprised behavior models of the representative roles was used to simulate the behavior of the agents in the behavior models rules were set to regulate the time sequences for different types of behavior according to the geometry constraints and agent roles for example all the agents need to open the door to the room to enter the corridor and family members take care of patients while the cleaners do cleaning work appendix s2 tables s6 and s7 show the behavior frequencies and sequences of touching surfaces for the different types of behavior the multiagent model retained the heterogeneity for each agent so agents with the same role share the same rules but do not act synchronously in addition agents were endowed with an implicitly bounded intellect to make the simulations more realistic for example patients and family members used the public toilets in the corridor only when the toilets in the room were occupied which influenced the effect of the public surfaces during the computational period as shown in appendix s1 fig s1 in each time step for each agent the agent first acquired information from the global database and then compared the acquired information with the behavior rules and made a command according to the command the agent remained static or performed an action finally information about the agents was sent to the global database which was updated the global database recorded the agents state information and the contamination states of the surfaces and air in the temporary workspace the data processing module was used to process the data from the global database and calculate the infection risk for the three basic transmission routes the module included six models namely the multizone model the longrange airborne route exposure model the normal distribution model the close contact route exposure model the surface contamination model and the doseresponse relationship model details of the abovementioned mathematical models are provided in appendix s12s17 for the longrange airborne route computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations31 32 33 were used to predict the wind pressures for all 48 windows the multizone model31 34 mix multizone infiltration and exfiltration35 was applied to calculate the hourly airflow patterns and aerosol concentrations in the 36 zones on the outbreak floor furthermore the longrange airborne route exposure model25 was used to calculate the exposure doses d
a in the respiratory tract of each agent for the close contact route the normal distribution model36 37 was used to acquire the movement patterns in the corridor and the contact probability of any pair of two agents was derived based on a respiratory jet assumption8 25 38 the close contact route exposure model25 was used to calculate the exposure doses from three mechanisms shortrange airborne transmission d
cs inhalation of inspirable droplets d
ci and deposition of large droplets on mucous membranes d
cm for the fomite route the surface contamination model26 was used to calculate the numbers of viruses on the different environmental and human surfaces the process by which the viruses spread within the surface network was considered to be a discretetime nonhomogeneous markov chain the transition matrix at a time point corresponded to a touching action and was determined by the properties of the two contacting surfaces in the touching action because the virus quantities on the mucous membranes of the susceptible agents transferred via hand contact were regarded as the exposure doses due to the fomite route8 the surface contamination model was able to directly calculate the exposure doses d
f for this route a doseresponse relationship model25 26 39 was used to compute the infection risk of each agent based on the acquired exposure doses the parameters used in the models in the data processing module are listed in the tables in appendix s2 among these parameters the largest viruscontaining droplet size d

0 was also in the range of 101105 excluding several unqualified scenarios we considered 1140 scenarios and ran the simulations 1000 times for the seven hypotheses in each scenario because the agents behavior retained partial randomness in our multiagent model simulations the results of the different simulation experiments varied therefore we calculated the average values of the 1000 simulations the spatial distributions of the average infection risks at the end of the computational period 2400 on may 17 2015 are shown in figure 5 the values of the four parameters were assumed to vary in a unified manner for the longrange airborne route the infection risk in the downstream wards was expected to be higher than that in the adjacent wards as a result of the combined effects of the natural ventilation due to wind pressure thermal buoyancy and mechanical ventilation when there was no wind the wards and the corridor on the eighth floor were in a negative pressure state due to the exhaust fans in the toilets for the predominant wind directions namely northwesterly westerly and southwesterly appendix s3 fig s4 the wind pressure coefficients on the windows of adjacent wards were mostly positive whereas those of downstream wards were negative appendix s3 fig s5 which contributed to larger negative pressures in the downstream wards and smaller negative pressures in the adjacent wards therefore for wards of the same size more aerosols spread to the downstream wards than to the adjacent wards however because the toilet exhaust fans were run at the same ventilation rates for all rooms the negative pressures in the small rooms were higher than those in the large rooms and thus the infection risk in the small rooms in the adjacent wards was higher than that in the large rooms in the downstream wards figure 5a the infection risk was lowest in the remote wards figure 5a the remote wards had at least two zones zones 34 and 36 between them and the source ward appendix s1 fig s2 so the aerosol concentration was further diluted furthermore during the day the air flow could transport aerosols from zone 34 to zone 36 only when the wind was from the northwest appendix s3 fig s6 which meant that most of the time there were no virus sources for rooms 8113 and 82018219 similarly in the remote areas the infection risk in rooms 82138217 was even lower than that in rooms 8218 and 8219 figure 5a for the close contact route with the assumed four parameters the transmission was very effective compared to the other two routes thus the infection risk for a susceptible person via this route was mainly determined by whether a person met with the index patient under the normal distribution assumption people would be more likely to stay in nearby areas than in remote areas so the index patient and people nearby would share a similarly high chance of appearing in the neighborhood areas and have more opportunities for close contact resulting in a sequentially decreasing risk of infection in the source adjacent downstream and remote wards figure 5b for the fomite route the infection risk was mainly induced by the nurses routine rounds and contaminated environmental surfaces we assumed that the nurses conducted routine rounds five times a day at 0700 1100 1500 1800 and 2100 appendix s2 table s6 because nurses do not always clean their hands after coming into contact with patients41 and handwashing is not always very effective42 their hands may have played an important role as a mobile medium in transferring viruses from the source to the skin of subsequent patients and the surrounding surfaces in line with this the number of viruses spread to patients decreased from room 8104 the index patients room clockwise to room 8103 which is consistent with the direction of the nurses routine rounds from room 8101 clockwise to room 8219 at other times the surrounding surfaces acted as temporary sources in spreading viruses to patients because more viruses naturally die on the skin than on environmental surfaces appendix s2 table s3 in most cases patients have the same opportunities to come in contact with common surfaces and thus these surfaces contribute to a uniform spatial distribution however in this outbreak the environmental surfaces common to all patients were not a significant factor the private toilets in the rooms were preferentially chosen by patients and family members an average of 21 timesday for each room while the common toilets in the corridor were used at a low frequency an average of 5 timesday for each therefore the overall distribution mostly complied with the direction of the routine round figure 5c table 2 shows the scenarios with the best fit the minimum rss for the seven hypotheses among the three singleroute hypotheses the prediction of hypothesis 1 long air fitted the attack rates best because only the prediction of the longrange airborne route presented a higher infection risk in the downstream ward than in the adjacent ward figure 5a the fomite route predicted a much higher infection risk in the adjacent ward than in the downstream ward figure 5c so hypothesis 3 fomite had the worst fit hypotheses 47 involved at least two transmission routes so they had better fit than hypothesis 3 fomite and worse fit than hypothesis 1 long air for the combinedroute hypotheses the values

g in the scenarios with the best fit were mostly lower than those for the singleroute hypotheses in these scenarios the infection risk due to the close contact route was higher than those due to the longrange airborne and fomite routes so the close contact routes in hypotheses 4 long air  close 6 close  fomite and 7 long air  close  fomite played a predominant role in transmission by contributing at least 82 of the infection risk because the prediction of the fomite route deviated greatly from the attack rates the contributions of this route for hypotheses 5 long air  fomite 6 close  fomite and 7 long air  close  fomite were 02 figure 6 shows the hypotheses with the best fit ie the minimum rss in the 1140 scenarios five hypotheses had the best fit hypotheses 1 long air red dots 2 close orange dots 4 long air  close green dots 5 long air  fomite cyan dots and 7 long air  close  fomite purple dots when the largest viruscontaining droplet size d
g ranged from 20 to 200 m there were always some scenarios in which the fit of all seven hypotheses was not good tiny dots in these scenarios the parameters were relatively small so all seven hypotheses predicted very low infection risks which deviated greatly from the reported attack rates as d
g increased the predicted infection risks became higher and thus the numbers of these kinds of scenarios decreased the scenarios with a d
g of 20 m are shown in figure 6a in these scenarios our assumed d
g was smaller than the largest initial diameter for the airborne droplets 30 m meaning that all of the virusladen bioaerosols were airborne droplets and could remain suspended in the air for a long time therefore the viruses on the surfaces mainly originated from the deposition of airborne droplets which caused negligible infection risk due to the fomite route in the scenarios in which the products of the viral load and doseresponse parameters in respiratory tracts r

g increased the infection risks due to the singleroute and doubleroute modes increased and thus the number of scenarios with the threeroute mode purple dots decreased in this study to evaluate the transmission hypotheses we estimated the spatial distribution of the infection risk under each hypothesis and then compared these results with the reported outbreak data therefore a good estimation model was needed to reflect the underlying mechanisms of the hypotheses nevertheless the models such as the discretetime markov chain model8 23 and the differential equation model24 25 43 were not applicable due to their systembased feature which removes the individual heterogeneity of infection risk28 in fact the human behavior in those models is merely described by behavioral frequency however in practice human behavior is also dependent on behavioral rules and geometry constraints for example when a nurse visits patients during a routine round although the frequency of interaction is the same for all patients the amount of virus spread to patients varies with their location which further influences the infection risk there are similar issues with the environmental surfaces in the existing models in particular because multiple surfaces of the same material8 23 25 and even all of the surfaces in a zone24 43 are regarded as a whole the viral concentrations on different surfaces are the same which contributes to a uniform infection risk distribution to address the above problems we used a multiagent model26 to analyze the multiroute transmission different from the existing systembased models the agentbased model is able to characterize the diversity of individuals more specifically the behavior of individuals is simulated according to behavioral rules and geometry constraints which take the sequence of human actions into account furthermore the multiple surfaces in our system were identified as different units in contrast to the homogeneous systems in previous works as shown in figure 5 our results reflect the individual heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of infection risk which could not be obtained from other models although the ranges of r

g in the range from 20 to 200 m the range for the viral load was very large from 102 to 1011 mrna copiesml in the respiratory tract with the average value of viral load during the first week after diagnosis being 5  107 mrna copiesml in fatal cases and 39  106 mrna copiesml in survivors47 according to a study by gryphon scientific48 based on datasets from animal models of mhv and sarscov we estimated the doseresponse parameter of merscov on mucous membranes as 32  103mrna copy due to the absence of data the doseresponse parameter in the respiratory tract was set as 103fold higher than that on the mucous membranes similar to the influenza a virus24 the eight morelikely scenarios scenarios iviii based on the above analyses are summarized in table 3 and are shown in figure 6 with roman numerals with a viral load l
0 of 39  106 mrna copiesml scenarios i ii iii and iv none of the hypotheses had good fit figure 6 and table 3 which is not consistent with the index patient surviving this outbreak however similar to other large mers transmission clusters49 50 the outbreak in pyongtaek st marys hospital may have been caused by a super spreader who had a higher viral load than most mers patients51 considering that there was no ventilation system in the index patients ward the merscov may have accumulated in the ward effectively making it a source for a superspreading event52 according to figure 6 with a viral load l

g of 20 or 50 m also did not have good fit so d
g was less likely to be in the range of 2050 m and merscov may have existed in saliva as sarscov does53 hence among scenarios iviii only scenarios vii and viii had acceptable fit and the probable hypothesis in these two scenarios is hypothesis 4 long air  close according to table 3 the contribution made by the longrange airborne route to the infection risk was low and that made by the close contact route was predominant especially by the mechanism of inhalation of inspirable droplets if the index patient was a super spreader the viral loads might be even higher than the average value in fatal cases 5  107 mrna copiesml when the two doseresponse parameters were fixed r  32mrna copy m  32  103mrna copy and the viral load increased from 106 to 1011 mrna copiesml the overall best fit was achieved with a high viral load the largest dots l

0  18  1010 mrna copiesml in figure 6bd and the corresponding probable hypothesis is hypothesis 1 long air figure 6 because among the three basic routes only the prediction made by the longrange airborne route was consistent with the qualitative characteristics of the outbreak data this study has some limitations first our understanding of the multiple phenomena that govern disease transmission is not complete for example in our model and other models16 17 it is assumed that transmission is monodirectional from the hands to the mucous membranes in the eyes noses and mouths of susceptible individuals however there are limited data on what happens to the particles that have been transferred to the mucous membranes such as their residence time second due to our limited knowledge of merscov some parameters in the model were not available from the literature such as the transfer rates between hands and surfaces appendix s2 table s2 and firstorder inactivation rates appendix s2 table s3 these parameters were estimated or surrogated with data on other coronaviruses influenza viruses bacteriophages or even bacteria which could introduce errors into the results third there is a lack of detailed information on individual behavior during the outbreak especially that of the index patient individual differences in the behavioral modes of the nurses when visiting patients were also not considered in this study these data are crucial for building multiagent models and influence the exposure doses via the three transmission routes for example if the index patient walked in the corridor the duration of that behavior would have influenced the virus source strength of the longrange airborne and fomite routes and the frequency of the behavior would have influenced the close contact route fourth our conclusions on the relative importance of the transmission routes may not always be applicable to other mers outbreaks for example the contribution of the longrange airborne route during this outbreak was magnified because the ventilation system was not installed in the index patients room although the role of the longrange airborne route may vary during different mers outbreaks this study supports the hypothesis of the longrange airborne transmission of merscov with both known data and reasonable assumptions and highlights the importance of ventilation systems in healthcare environments overall further research on the transmission mechanisms of mers outbreaks involving laboratory measurements observations in hospitals and mers outbreak analyses is needed to improve our understanding of mers transmission in this study of the first nosocomial mers outbreak in the republic of korea the scenarios with a superspreader or a superspreading event corresponded with unusually high viral loads or sources our modeling suggested that longrange airborne transmission of merscov was the most credible hypothesis in explaining the observed data our longrange airborne route model predicted the spatial infection pattern well that is the downstream wards had a higher infection risk than the adjacent wards however in the scenarios in which the index patient shed a more typical amount of merscov as parameterized according to available viral load data from the literature our model showed that the hypothesis combining the close contact and longrange airborne routes better explained the observed pattern of infection on the eighth floor of pyongtaek st marys hospital with the contribution of the former predominant and that of the latter relatively small our multiagent multiroute transmission model and associated approaches can be applied to studies of the transmission in outbreaks of other viruses however our study also reveals crucial input data such as doseresponse parameters and virus inactivation rates on surfaces need to be obtained  a hybrid model for disease spread and an application to the sars pandemic teruhiko yoneyama sanmay das mukkai krishnamoorthy  pandemics can cause immense disruption and damage to communities and societies thus far modeling of pandemics has focused on either large-scale difference equation models like the sir and the seir models or detailed micro-level simulations which are harder to apply at a global scale this paper introduces a hybrid model for pandemics considering both global and local spread of infections we hypothesize that the spread of an infectious disease between regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and the spread within a region is influenced by local conditions thus we model the spread of pandemics considering the connections between regions for the global spread of infection and population density based on the seir model for the local spread of infection we validate our hybrid model by carrying out a simulation study for the spread of sars pandemic of 2002-2003 using available data on population population density and traffic networks between different regions while it is well-known that international relationships and global traffic patterns significantly influence the spread of pandemics our results show that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatly improve the results of modeling disease spread  modeling of the spread of infectious disease typically falls into one of two categories analytically tractable models like the seir model are capable of capturing some globally important phenomena like the rate of spread of diseases using few parameters however they have a hard time reflecting differences in global spread due to local conditions for example it can be difficult to model different rates of spread in countries with different population densities and public health policies of variable strength and coordination network-or agent-based models are capable of reflecting details of individual conditions however modeling large-scale global disease-spread using such models often runs into methodological problems like overfitting because of the vast number of possible parameters this paper proposes a granular network-based hybrid model of disease spread in which individual regions are modeled as nodes in the network and the spread of disease within nodes is modeled analytically using a simplified derivative of the seir model with the help of demographic parameters like population density the properties of the network as a whole like connectivity are determined using real data on traffic between regions we demonstrate the power of this approach by simulating the spread of sars  one of the key takeaways is that the level of granularity has a significant effect on the success of network-or agent-based simulation models for example we show that modeling china as an individual node is unsuccessful whereas breaking it up into constituent regions gives an impressive match to real infection data on sars one of the great advantages of our model is its parsimony it contains relatively few tweakable parameters compared with general agent-based models at the same time it is capable of reproducing the important broad flows of disease however it is important to remember that exact reproduction of historical data is not the end-goal exceptions that do not correspond to real data provide insight into specific local phenomena that influenced the progression of a pandemic such as an actual timing of the first infected case in a country there is a vast literature on understanding the spread of disease using analytical and simulation models in the next section we give a brief overview of the most common modeling methodologies including differential equation models and simulation models but here we discuss related research more generally the most closely related to this work can be grouped into two categories first several researchers have simulated and analyzed the local spread of sars in 2002-2003 20 23 50  in particular huang et al reproduce the situations in singapore taipei and toronto individually and compare with the actual transitions 20  this also ties in to a significant existing literature on local modeling of historical pandemics like the influenza during the first world war eg 6 26  other examples also abound jenvald et al use a virtual city based on linkping sweden considering the number of schools age distribution and household type 21  longini et al model population and contact processes based on thailand census data demographic information and social network data 25  kelso et al model a real community in the south west of western australia 22 27  the second category involves simulating global infection spread using international traffic data for example several papers use air travel data to estimate connectivity in a network 8 9 14 15  however these authors typically simulate a hypothetical global pandemic with a focus on intervention policies the focus of our research is to validate the simulation with real historical data much existing research simulates infection in networks with reasonable properties but not necessarily based on existing real-world data for example bailey simulates epidemics in two dimensions such as square grids 1  patel et al 39 and weycker et al 43 consider hypothetical populations of 10000 persons comprised of five communities of equal size containing schools and neighborhoods vespignani pastor-satorras and co-authors simulate spreading infectious diseases with complex networks 2 28 36 35 38 37  carrat et al 5  glass et al 18  and eubank 13 also use generated complex networks for simulation another major theme of research has been on the effects of prevention andor mitigation strategies these typically compare a base simulation and an alternative simulation which considers some proposed strategy for example longini et al use stochastic epidemic simulations to investigate the effectiveness of targeted antiviral prophylaxis to contain influenza 24  kelso et al simulate the effect of social isolation such as school closure individual isolation workplace nonattendance and reduction of contact 22  carrat et al explore the impact of interventions such as vaccination treatment quarantine and closure of schools and workplaces 5  germann et al simulate and compared the baseline and several combinations of mitigation methods 17  patel et al use genetic algorithms to find optimal vaccination strategies 39  weycker et al estimate the population-wide benefits of routine vaccination of children 43   the sars pandemic of 2002 is a useful case study for our modeling methodology the pandemic spread to 29 countriesregions in 2002 and 2003 in total 8096 people were infected and 774 people died as of december 31 2003 48  figure 1 shows the spread of sars as of april 8 2003 47  in 20 of 29 countriesregions 100 of total cases in the country were imported as defined by who from other countries 16  the sars pandemic is a particularly useful case study because we have high-fidelity data on the outbreak first the beginning and end of the pandemic are clear according to the who the first case was a male in his 40s in guangdong china in november 2002 sars started substantially spreading from hong kong to other countries in february 2003 infecting 29 countries and regions by july 2003 after that there were no new cases except one infection through a laboratory accident second the number of cases is clearly reported and relatively small who reported the cumulative number of cases and the number of new infected cases from march 17th to july 11th 2003 45  third the number of infected countries is clearly shown there are 29 countriesregions which are infected by sars by the end of 2003 48  thus we have good data on the progress of infection in different countries and regions we first introduce the main methodologies for modeling the spread of infectious diseases before describing our approach in detail the classic sir model proposed by kermack and mckendrick in 1927 3  posits three classes of agents susceptible infectious and removed susceptible agents hereafter denoted s are vulnerable to a disease and have the potential to be infected infectious agents i are currently infected and have the risk of infecting s removed r agents are removed from the system -they are either dead or acquired immunity thus r is not infected again r is also called recovered when we assume it is not dead when r is not dead but has instead acquired immunity the total population s  i  r is constant the model assumes that agents in the set s are sometimes infected by a contact in i and change to r at a constant rate this yields the expressions below for the transition of populations of these three classes where  is the rate of infection from s to i and  is the rate of recovery from i to r  is inversely proportion to the average infectious period      1  when we assume that the population is constant in this case the total population n is given by s  i  r when   1 the infection spreads since the probability that s becomes i is greater than the speed that i becomes r the basic reproduction number r 0  is the average number of persons infected by a single infected person when the population has no immunity and no control against the infection 49  in the sir differential equation model the basic reproduction number is given by r 0  n  if one infected person infects more than one susceptible person ie r 0  1 secondary infection occurs and the infection spreads on the other hand if r 0  1 the disease converges in the system therefore r 0  1 is a threshold for spread the seir model is a derivative of the sir model sir doesnt consider the incubation period thus when s is infected it becomes i immediately and starts to infect other s 44  in the real world there is some duration between the time that a person is infected and the time that heshe starts infecting others the seir model denotes agents in the incubation period as belonging to class e exposed 19  the corresponding transition equations are agent-based modeling provides an explicit local method of understanding the spread of infection it allows for fine-grained control over many aspects of the dynamic model of disease spread including geographic factors and agent movements for example carley et al 4 simulate the spread of anthrax and epstein 12 investigates the spread of smallpox with agent based models deguchi et al have developed an agent based simulation language called soars spot oriented agent role simulator 11 10 for simulating the spread of disease considering modules such as human activities opportunity for contact between people in a society disease state and intervention to control the spread network-based models typically represent agents as nodes on graphs and allow the connectivity structure of the graph to determine the possible spread of disease for example extending an sir model to networks would involve allowing a susceptible vertex s to be infected by an infectious vertex i only if s is adjacent to i network-based models are useful in that they can reflect social and economic networks peoples behaviors and social contacts build the network and the infection route is on the network our model uses local regions and interconnections between them there are three possibilities for a new infection in a region 1 infection from travelers from outside the region 2 infection from returning travelers and 3 infection from local persons we denote infection types 1 and 2 as global infections and type 3 as local infections figure 2 shows the basic structure of our model we assume that infection starts in a particular country or region and spreads from there at each cycle infections of all types can occur global infections types 1 and 2 occur with frequencies that are dependent on the level of travel between regions and local infections are mostly dependent on the population density of a region details of the data used are below our local model is based on the concept behind the seir model we consider the same four types of agents in each region susceptible exposed infectious and removed when an infection occurs agents are considered exposed the model proceeds in time cycles t the number  where the sum is over other regions t ij is the sum of travelers from region i to region j and the number of travelers from region j to region i since infection can occur through both arriving and returning travelers and p  g t is a global infection coefficient at time t described below local infection follows a similar process so that the number of agents newly exposed through the local infection mechanism at any time t is given by el it is assumed that agents go from exposed to infectious according to some incubation period that is disease-specific and similarly from infectious to removed according to some disease-specific recovery period for the purposes of this paper we set these to 10 for both incubation period and infectious period but these parameters can of course be varied for modeling other diseases infection probabilities as awareness of a disease spreads it is likely that heightened awareness and prevention measures start to reduce the spread of infection we model this in our global and local infection coefficients by introducing a term that dampens the coefficient over time for global infection we use p  where p g is a basic global infection coefficient held constant across regions and d g models the dampening effect we use a similar equation for the local infection coefficient in this case d l is assumed constant across regions but the basic local infection coefficient p li is region-specific given by p li   i c 1 c 2 where  i is the population density of region i assumed to be the primary driver of high local infection rates it is worth noting that the original seir model gives a similar type of equation for newly exposed agents e    s  i where  is the infection rate the main novelty here is the combination of modeling a declining infection rate and treating each region separately there are several model parameters that need to be calibrated using real data it is useful to consider some background information on the characteristics of sars in this context the sars coronavirus causes general infection with viremia especially severe pneumonia and intestine infection it is transmitted primarily through droplet infection due to its resistance to dryness it can also be transmitted through air it is thought that the incubation period of sars is usually 2-10 days and the average is 5 days 32  in the pandemic of 2002-2003 most countries reported a median incubation period of 4-5 days and a mean of 4-6 days in the incubation period it is unlikely an infected person will spread the disease through droplet infection the infectious period is thought to be about two weeks with its peak from the 7th-10th day after infection 32  transmission efficiency appears to be greatest from severely ill patients who are experiencing rapid clinical deterioration usually during the second week of illness maximum virus excretion from the respiratory tract occurs on about day 10 of illness and then declines to 0 by day 23 there are no reports on transmission beyond 10 days of fever resolution 42  the death rate varies by age group sars affects older patients much more severely but the overall death rate was about 96 in the 2002-2003 sars pandemic significantly higher than that of seasonal influenzas another notable feature of sars is that it is believed that super-spreading events where a person infects many more than the average rate of infection are a key component in its transmission our model does not deal explicitly with such levels of granularity which may lead to some outlier predictions in areas where the law of large numbers does not take over this is discussed further in section 5 it is thought that the origin of sars was guangdong in china quickly spreading to hong kong thus we consider countriesregions which have strong relationships with china and hong kong at first we examine the numbers of travelers from china and hong kong and consider the ten countriesregions where the number of travelers to and from china and hong kong is the largest see table 1  yielding a total of 17 countries 16 of these 17 countriesregions were infected by sars since there were 29 countriesregions in total with reported cases of sars half of them are represented in this table besides these 16 countriesregions there are 13 other infected countries by sars canada france india indonesia italy kuwait new zealand ireland romania south africa spain sweden switzerland we focus on these 30 countriesregions in our experiments there are 8 countriesregions which had local spread china hong kong taiwan canada singapore vietnam philippines and mongolia 7 of these 8 are included in table 1  we hypothesize that population density of an area is positively correlated with the local infection rate because higher population densities lead to more frequent contact we test this hypothesis using data from chinese provinces hong kong and taiwan the most significant infected regions figure 3 shows how the number of infections in different chinese provinces varied greatly at the peak of the infection from 31  which makes it necessary to treat the individual regions separately since 97 of infections occur in 6 provinces we use data from these 6 they are guangdong province the initial infected province beijing municipality shanxi province inner mongolia autonomous region hebei province and tianjin municipality table 2 shows basic data on population and density for each of the provinces hong kong and taiwan using these 6 provinces hong kong and taiwan we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between population density and infection rate at the 001-level we choose the values for c1 and c2 by trial and error our initial simulations are focused on the 6 regions of china taiwan and hong kong table 3 shows the number of travelers among the three countries however it is difficult to estimate travel between the regions of china or to allocate travelers from china to the other countries amongst the regions of china in order to approximate this travel information we use data on passenger land traffic and civil aviation in china in 2007 30  table 4 shows the each passenger traffic and the total 30 we use land traffic data for the 6 provinces we are interested in as shown in table 5 30 we compute the share of each region in the total where the total share is 100 then based on tables 4 and 5  we approximate the number of travelers between two regions by assuming that the share of a region is directly proportional to the number of travelers to the region also we assume that the share of passenger traffic by air is proportional to the share of passenger traffic by land we estimate travel between the different regions of china and hong kong and taiwan by using the share of the airport of each region in china in the national total table 6 shows the number of passengers using the main airport in 6 regions of china and the share in the national total 7  we apportion the number of travelers between china and hong kong or taiwan according to the share for example the share of beijing airport in the national total is 137859 table 8 4 results for the preliminary experiment we simulate with 6 regions in the chinese mainland hong kong and taiwan the number of susceptible agents in each regioncountry is initially equal to the population of each country table 7 shows the summary for parameter values used in simulation these simulation parameters were chosen to provide a good fit to data from this initial simulation but we discuss below several inferences that can be made because many of the parameters are constant exploiting the granularity of the model then in the second part of this section we use the same parameters to extend the model to 30 countriesregions which provides a test for the parameters allowing us to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks in a validation setting figure 4 show the transition of the number of infected cases and the number of cumulative cases respectively comparing real data and the results of our model for the model we show data from time cycles 45 through 75 the results of chinas 6 regions are summed up and the total is shown for china the figure shows that our model captures both the dynamics of the spread of sars as well as the total numbers very well the peaks come in order hong kong china and taiwan the model achieves this without using any special parameters that vary in different countries populations densities and travel data are all taken from the real world the sars epidemic started spreading from hong kong and immediately reached mainland china the peak of hong kong comes earlier than that of china since the population density is higher however the curve decreases from some point because the percentage of susceptible agents in the population decreases and the percentage of recovered agents increases then the number of infectious agents decreases after that the number of infected agents in china increases because of its population the number of infected agents at its peak in china is the largest among the three countriesregions the peak in taiwan is slightly delayed because of the time lag in the infection reaching taiwan figure 5 shows the predicted from the model and actual number of cases for each of the eight modeled regions while the fit is good for several of the most important in terms of number of cases regions and therefore the overall numbers are good there are some discrepancies for some of the regions that had a relatively fewer number of cases specifically the model underpredicts the number of cases for some of the less densely populated provinces of china shanxi inner mongolia and hebei and overpredicts for one of the more densely populated regions tianjin there are idiosyncratic events associated with the spread of any pandemic so it is not entirely surprising that some of the results do not match perfectly the next section considers anomalies in more detail where some data is available but it is important to note that the level of granularity in modeling is very important figure 6 shows the difference in the model in two cases one where the six infected provinces in china are modeled independently and one where the six provinces are aggregated into one using aggregated data on population density travel etc the figure clearly shows that the more granular model is a much better fit to the data as mentioned above we use the parameters from the 8 regioncountry simulation to extend the model to 30 total countries 35 regioncountries since we continue to divide china into 6 regions again we use real population density and international travel data from the 27 new countries for canada and vietnam we use only toronto and hanoi since only these regions had local spread cases 16  table 8 show the expected number of travelers between countriesregions we again apportion the number of travelers between each region in mainland china and other countries based on the share of each region figure 8 shows the comparison of the number of cumulative cases in simulation with real data especially for the significantly impacted countries the number of cases corresponds well in the real world there were 8 countriesregions which had local spread in the model 18 countriesregions develop local spread there are four true statistical outliers in the data in terms of number of cases predicted by the model versus number of cases experienced in reality these are singapore macao canada and japan we hypothesize that the outliers in this case are related to the nature of the spread of sars an early chance outbreak in a country or region can lead to significantly more cases than expected similarly if a country manages to avoid a case of sars for longer than predicted by international travel data heightened awareness and prevention strategies will lead to many fewer cases than expected for sars in particular this factor may be particularly important because there is considerable evidence that some people infected with sars are super spreaders who may affect the trajectory of the spread while an infected person infects on average 1-3 people 32  some infected people pass the virus to many other people 16  although it is not clear what causes someone to become a super spreader it is suspected that a person who has a chronic illness such as diabetes is more likely to be a super spreader 32  16  in each of the outlier cases where the model makes a significantly different prediction than the actual trajectory of the pandemic it turns our that the first reported case happened at a different time than would statistically be predicted by travel flows while macao japan and republic of korea have large numbers of travelers fromto china and hong kong these countries experienced much less infection than predicted by the model it turns out that each of these countries experienced its first infection at a much later date than predicted as shown in table 9  republic of korea imported the first case in april 25th macao imported the first case in may 5th 2003 and japan was never infected these countries imported their first cases one or more months after vietnam canada taiwan singapore and the philippines meanwhile canada despite being less strongly linked by travel to china and hong kong was infected on february 23rd early in the pandemic in fact from the original super-spread event at the metropole hotel to provide some more weight to this hypothesis we ran the model but this time using the actual time of first infection in the country rather than travel data other than that the parameters of the simulation remained the same figure 9 shows that the cumulative number of cases from the model then correspond better to real data local considerations our model trades off adaptability to local conditions for a smaller number of parameters to fit this can have several effects here we discuss two of them and how they might affect the results first if we look at data from seasonal flu cases we find that canada typically has a large number of cases and the united states has the largest number of influenza isolates 46  both of these suggest that the local infection coefficient may be higher in canada and the united states than other countries indeed this could have been an additional factor in the surprisingly large number of canadian cases however the united states was surprising because although it imported 27 cases the infection did not spread locally this may indicate that the quarantining and isolation measures employed worked effectively a second interesting point is that singapore and vietnam both report many fewer cases than predicted by the model this may be partly explained by their lower propensity to spread infection again as evidenced by seasonal flu data there may also have been a significantly bigger push to hospitalize and keep patients confined weakly evidenced by the fact that the proportion of those infected who were healthcare workers in these two countries 41 and 57 in singapore and vietnam respectively was much higher than other countries 21 we have discussed a hybrid network and local model for the spread of pandemics and applied it to the case of sars when parameters are calibrated to real data on populations densities and traffic we show that the model reproduces many of the key dynamics of the spread of sars in 2002 and 2003 while remaining parsimonious and therefore useful for understanding the root causes of why pandemics spread in the way they do both the successes and the failures of the simple model provide insights into pandemic spread for example it is clear that it is important to model international traffic to understand the pathways of spread at the same time for any particular pandemic individual idiosyncrasies can come into play for example the importance of super-spreaders in sars is reflected in the fact that the time of first infection in a country has a big role in how many people get infected the other major takeaway from this work is that the level of granularity in the network structure of the model has a significant impact for example treating china as one large entity leads to poorer prediction but at the same time specializing all the way down to cities would end up requiring too much data to accurately calibrate the model and would probably not provide significantly better prediction  a realistic two-strain model for mers-cov infection uncovers the high risk for epidemic propagation tridip sardar indrajit ghosh xavier rod joydev chattopadhyay benjamin althouse   the first case of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infection was identified in saudi arabia in 201215 since then the country suffers from repeated outbreaks of mers-cov in different provinces fig 1a and 1b2 there are two main routes of mers-cov transmission animal-to-human and human-to-human46 it is suspected that dromedary camels are the source of human infections1 but the transmission route of mers-cov to humans is yet not well understood fig 1c however transmission from camels to humans is confirmed from the isolation of near-identical strains of mers-cov from epidemiologically coexisting camels and humans7 the patients might be exposed to mers-cov by consumption of raw camel products8 eg milk and dairy products raw meat etc meanwhile human-to-human transmission has been reported in society and hospital settings936 with the virus being transmitted between humans during close human-to-human contact through droplets of respiratory secretions potential propagation to nearby and more distant regions is also a high-risk possibility as an outbreak of mers-cov is likely to emerge in areas such as nearby countries in the middle east and eastern africa where the camel trade connects the different regions fig 1 unfortunately as for now mers-cov vaccines are only at the preclinical phase10 increasing our understanding of its epidemic potential and knowledge on the drivers of mers-cov variability might help to achieve better preparedness ahead of forthcoming epidemics the ability to predict disease outbreaks will provide a mechanism for policymakers and health-care services to respond to epidemics in a timely manner reducing the impact and maximizing the limited resources available to be deployed11 the timing and severity of infectious disease outbreaks two matters of considerable public-health relevance are the main challenges when attempting to predict disease outbreaks1114 attempts to set up prediction frameworks for anticipating epidemics for other diseases such as dengue and influenza were pursued in the recent past with different degree of success but clear added value1116 these systems proved effective to better anticipate future outbreaks and increase our understanding on mechanisms driving disease variability to this end a threshold quantity that is most important to anticipate the risk of future outbreaks is the basic reproduction number r0 there are quite a few studies that estimated r0 for the current mers-cov outbreak majumdar et al28 for instance estimated r0 for jeddah and riyadh using a function called incidence decay with exponential adjustments idea they found that the estimate of r0 in jeddah and riyadh are in the ranges 3567 and 2028 respectively a stochastic epidemiological model of mers-cov with zoonotic and human-to-human transmission was considered by poletto et al29 to quantify the rates of generation of cases from those two transmission routes they found that spring 2014 cases led to the increase in transmission rates which brings r0 to values above unity heishet al32 used a simple mathematical model to trace the temporal course of south korea mers-cov outbreak they estimated r0 to be in the range of 70 to 193 instead nishiura et al30 estimated the expected number of secondary cases following the importation of an index case countries other than ksa qatar and uae using a branching process type modelling approach they also suggested that even if r0 is below unity a large cluster of cases with multiple generations might occur the aforementioned studies indicated that the basic reproduction number is above unity although there are few studies that suggest r0 is less than one41718 however at the same time intriguing differences in observed and predicted scenarios clearly suggested other important factors might be missing in previous models built for these mers-cov case studies for instance in a recent survey for mers-cov in over 1300 saudi arabian camels sabiret al1 found that camels share three coronaviruses cov species with humans among them one has been dominant in the region since december 2014 and led to the human mers-cov outbreaks occurring in 2015 the wide species range of covs and their propensity to cross species boundaries suggest that more mers-cov uncontained outbreaks may likely occur in the future zumlaet al19 also suggested that mers-cov species can mutate to have increased inter-human transmissibility cottenet al37 used mers data from the period may to september 2013 they found four saudi arabia mers-cov phylogenetic clades with 3 clades apparently no longer contributing to current cases therefore not appearing in the saliva of camels they also show that the ancestors of most of the viral clades originated in riyadh see cotten et al37 recently strain variability in mers-cov infection was confirmed in 51 respiratory samples from 32 patients confirming that more than one strain of human mers-covis present20 the fact that more than one mers-cov strain is currently circulating in saudi arabia should be properly accounted for as this presence may have substantially contributed to amplify the transmission intensity producing repeated mers-cov changes in incidence through their periodic reintroduction into human populations19 furthermore chan et al34 characterized mers-cov viruses from dromedaries in saudi arabia and egypt and compared them with a human mers-cov reference strain they isolated three dromedary strains two from saudi arabia and one from egypt the human and dromedary mers-cov strains had similar viral replication competence in vero-e6 cells and respiratory tropism in ex-vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract they also suggested that dromedary viruses from saudi arabia and egypt are probably infectious to human beings34 we constructed three different 2-strain models for mers-cov that consider community human-human hospital human-human and passive zoonotic transmission fig 1c and see also s1s18 tables models derived also incorporate the effect of strain variability with strain-1 as the dominant strain fig 1c and s1s18 tables variability among models is based upon three different disease incidence functions eg bl nm and sat models 2123 and see formulation in table 1a and fig 2 the top panel in fig 2 represents the bl force of infection here as the number of infected individuals increases the disease transmission also increases linearly the bottom-left panel represents the nm incidence function biologically this incidence function can account for psychological effects 3839 in the presence of psychological effects initially the disease transmission rate increases rapidly when the number of infected individuals is small however this rate falls also rapidly in the presence of a large number of infected persons in the community as in the case of mers-cov infections the cfr is about 40 psychological effects for this infection represents the effect in the community of fear of becoming infected this fear effect reduces the transmission rate rapidly in the presence of a high number of infections in the community the bottom-right panel of fig 2 represents the sat incidence function biologically this incidence function represents the crowding effect in disease transmission this crowding effect explains how the number of new infections becomes constant as the number of infected individual increases this effect is known to reproduce the awareness effect of the disease during the course of an epidemic furthermore we investigated the potential effects of super-spreading events by incorporating an additional compartment for super-spreaders to our 2-strain model we also consider the effect of variable zoonotic transmission by incorporating dynamics of the camel population into our 2-strain model information about the calculation of the epidemiological parameter values for the newly proposed 2-strain models is provided in table 1b data used corresponds to weekly cases of mers-cov for the three provinces in saudi arabia where most clinical cases for mers-cov occurred for the time intervals july 6th 2013 till june 28th 2016 riyadh april 7th2014 till june 26th2016 macca and april 20th2014 till june 26th2016 madina respectively fig 1a main parameters of the different models are provided in table 1b parameters estimates are obtained by fitting the models to new mers-cov hospitalized weekly data40 we also estimated from data itself some unknown initial conditions for the model delayed rejection adaptive metropolis algorithm is used here to sample the 95 confidencethe goodness of fitsto compare among 2-strain and single strain models were tested by determining the respective aic and bic values see s19 table to further compare among predictive capabilities of these models with regard to those of their single-strain versions predictions of raw clinical cases were attempted albeit some discrepancies exist fairly accurate results were obtained despite the low numbers and highly stochastic nature of the three datasets and the nearly operational capacity of these models fig 3 in fact near-operational systems usually require a much longer training period than the scarce three years employed here differences arising from the comparison of simulated and observed cases may also be due to the fact that we are fitting the 2-strain and single strain models to cumulative mers-cov cases rather than to new casesthe procedure for model adjustment is as follows for approaching near-operational predictions in each province we followed former initiatives eg on influenza14 and dengue16 and partitioned the whole clinical cases datasets into two parts first part was used for calibrating the models and the remaining part 52 weeks were left aside for out-of-fit prediction for riyadh macca and madina prediction periods were respectively from weeks 105156 7th june 2015 - 11th june 2016 weeks 65116 11th july 2015 - 2nd july 2016 and weeks 63114 11th july 2015 - 2nd july 2016fig 3 we generated predictions for three major characteristics of the epidemiological cycle similar to previous attempts made for cholera dengue and influenza154143 namely a peak week the week during which the maximum number of clinical cases occurred in a season comprising 52 weeks b peak maximum the number of cases occurring at the peak week and c season totals the total number of cases in the entire season prediction for each target variable was made every 4 weeks ie week 0 4 8  48 with week 0 corresponding to the first week of the prediction interval in the case of predictions for week n data up to week n was used to fit the model and the trajectory predicted for out-of-fit future weeks n1 through week 52 fig 3 indeed the best models at predicting mers-cov incidence differed among regions fig 4 highlighting the complexity of the epidemiological situation particularly in riyadh there where at least there were two strains co-circulating m2 stands up clearly as the best model function see bottom panel in fig 4 in comparison with macca and madina with only one strain fig 4 top panels we estimated the basic reproduction number r0 the community reproduction number rc and the hospital reproduction number rh for the whole period of data for riyadh macca and madina s1s18 tables 4445 we also estimated weekly values of r0 rc and rh for each prediction interval in the three provinces ie weeks 105156 in riyadh weeks 65116 in macca and weeks 63114 in madina respectively the predictions of r0 rc and rh are made for each 4-week time interval in the prediction period the estimate of r0 rc and rh during 0th week is obtained using the estimated parameter values for the training period of mers-cov data ie in riyadh week 1104 in macca week 164 and in madina week 162 afterwards we keep on adding 4 data points to the previous data and re-estimate the parameters these estimated parameters were then plugged into obtain values of r0 rc and rh in 4th week to 48th week of the prediction period thus in intervals of 4 weeks we obtain an estimate of r0 rc and rh temporal evolution of r0 rc and rh for the three provinces is depicted in s1s4 figs respectively using the model that provides the best prediction for the season total cases in the three provinces ie a 2-strain model with bl incidence for macca and the 2-strain model with sat incidence for both madina and riyadh we predicted the total number of cases in the following year using the parameter estimates in the last prediction point ie 48th week of the current season we draw 1000 samples based on these parameter samples we determined 1000 estimates of the season total cases in the next year43 we then defined a large outbreak in the forthcoming season in a particular region as those events when cases exceeded the total number of cases in the previous season by more than one standard deviation see fig 5 thus the probability of a large outbreak pl in those provinces isdetermined as the ratio of samples that exceed the total number of cases in a season divided by the total number of samples we also considered the case when two strains of mers-cov may be co-circulating in the human population in saudi arabia we also simulated the situation when one strain is assumed to be more active with a higher transmission rate whilst the other is much less transmissible among individuals in the different provinces of saudi-arabia37although we have considered two strains circulating in the community setting we do not distinguish among strains in hospital premises this is due to the lack of strain specific data in hospital settings however we are able to distinguish the contribution of infection from community and hospital setting by estimating the community reproduction number rc and the hospital reproduction number rh however to account for this effect we propose three different forces of infection bl nm and sat to model the mers transmission in the three provinces saturated sat functions describe crowding effects in disease transmission whereas non-monotone nm functions are used to incorporatepsychological effects as the cfr in mers-cov is about 40 it is easily expected that awareness in front of a mers-cov situation may play an important role during an epidemic4446 thus a model with such a crowding effect might seem a priori more realistic in comparison to the bilinear bl transmission see also fig 2 the crowding effect in disease transmission3839 can also be interpreted as the behavioral change of susceptible individuals when the number of infected individuals increases fig 2 this fact causes a lower number of new infections when a large number of infected individuals are already present in the community this behavioral change in the susceptible population may occur due to for instance public health awareness campaigns and alerts raised by local or international authorities the psychological effect is somewhat similar to the crowding effect but with the effect of fear being added to the awareness the psychological effect is stronger as the transmission rate decreases more rapidly with an increasing number of infected individuals fig 2 4042 recently kucharski et al35 suggested that mers-cov transmission is over dispersed and hence outbreaks can include super-spreading events in a similar study nishiura et al33 concluded that super-spreaders who visited multiple healthcare facilities drove up the epidemic by generating larger number of secondary cases therefore we also consider the role of potential super-spreaders in the context of a 2-strain model with bl incidence function up to july 2018 2237 new cases were reported with 1861 only in ksa and 793 deaths45cfr 355 this is an alarming situation as previous predictions on mers-cov had instead suggested that mers-cov might not sustain as an epidemic in the arabian peninsula the who report44 suggests that mers-cov is still a relatively rare disease about which the medical personnel in health-care facilities have low awareness globally mers-cov awareness is limited and because symptoms of mers-cov infection are non-specific initial cases can be sometimes easily missed with improved compliance in infection prevention and control namely by stricter adherence to the standard precautions at all times human-to-human transmission in health-care facilities can be reduced and even possibly eliminated with additional use of transmission-based precautions in that regard predictive mathematical models can help strengthen our understanding of both mers-cov transmission and control in this study we addressed the capacity of predictive mathematical models based on two-strain mers-cov configurations having different transmission functions the models differed from each other in their force of infection and in how they cope with heterogeneity in transmission estimates of transmission rates suggest that community and hospital transmission are dominant in the case of 2-strain models in riyadh macca and madina the majority of the 2-strain models suggest that mers-cov transmission is dominated by community and hospital human-human transmissions a fact that reflects the actual transmission scenario in saudi arabia 24 estimates of the parameter that measures transmission diversity between the two strains in the three provinces suggest that two strains are only active in riyadh this opposite trend in riyadh in comparison to the other two provinces may be due to the fact that riyadh is the capital city with good large health care facilities and a majority of the mers-cov patients in saudi arabia come to riyadh for treatment2 these patients may therefore carry different mers strains ultimately leading to multiple strains being presently co-circulating in riyadh similarly cotten et al37 found that ancestors of most of the viral clades originated from riyadh we compared among the 2-strain models according to their predictive performance with regard to three targets ie peak week peak maximum and season totals our results suggest that among the three 2-strain models the model with sat incidence provides consistently skillful predictions and may be used to date as the best predictive model for mers-cov in riyadh riyadh iswhere most of the mers-cov cases occur while for the provinces of macca and madina with lower reported mers cases it is difficult to determine the best model among the three 2-strain models this fact justifies our earlier finding that in riyadh two different strains are currently active and therefore the performance of the 2-strain models is better there as per our results for macca and madina only one dominant strain is active in those provinces therefore predictions based on single strain models are there more appropriate our results also suggest that among the single strain models those with sat incidence always accurately predict the three targets for these two provinces thus a dynamical mers model considering this crowding effect is the most appropriate configuration to cope with the nature of mers-cov transmission we estimated r0 using the best 2-strain model in riyadh and estimates are in good agreement with the findings of majumdar et al 28the finding that r0 is most of the time above 1 s1 fig is well supported by some previous estimates in literature283032 lower contribution of community transmission in r0 see table 2b in riyadh and macca suggests that mers-cov transmission is triggered from hospital settings in those provinces most interestingly in some forecasted periods r0 attains large values a fact that denotes that a rapid propagation among the susceptible population is indeed possible more worrisome is the range of values into which r0 moves most of the time above 1 and below 25 a fact that makes it a dangerous infection in terms of silent and constant potential population spread community reproduction number rc well above unity see s4 fig in most of the predictive weeks indicate that in a near future a large outbreak may be possible in those provinces out-of-fit predictions for the next season totals suggest that there is a high possibility of larger outbreaks in macca and riyadh however our results instead indicate that there is a very low possibility of larger outbreaks in madina the fact that this outbreak did not happen in 20172018 does not preclude what may occur in the forthcoming seasons under such a scenario authorities and international health agencies should prepare and actively work towards the prompt implementation of cheap albeit efficient computational platforms ready to assist in the simulation of how a potential outbreak might evolve in the region more so given the high probability that another large mers-cov outbreak occurs in the arabian peninsula or nearby countries migration may also play a major role for increased transmission in the provinces of saudi arabia and this feature should be properly accounted for in future model configurations in summary our findings suggest that in a majority of provinces a single mers-cov strain is currently active conversely to the situation in riyadh however in the near future it is also possible that more general mers-cov transmission occurs from multiple strains in other provinces of saudi arabia  the role of hospital environment in transmissions of multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms po chia ying sharmila sengupta anjanna kukreja sasheela sl ponnampalavanar oon ng tek kalisvar marimuthu   hospital plumbing systems are held to stringent standards to reduce transmission of infection to vulnerable patients however the aqueous environment presents unique challenges to infection prevention and control ipc with wet surfaces providing the solid-liquid interface that predisposes to biofilm formation 8 these biofilms have been proven to harbour multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms mdro 2 9 which were genetically related to clinical isolates suggesting that aqueous environment can serve as a reservoir for human infections furthermore waste material disposed into the sinks and drains potentially provide the nutrients necessary for the formation and maintenance of biofilms which function as a reservoir for mdro 10 these mdro are not contained within the hospital environment but may spread into the community via the sewage system across the world in singapore bangladesh india lebanon and spain raw hospital sewage has been shown to contain carbapenamase-producing enterobacteriaceae and other mdrgn 1117 as such it is crucial that environmental contamination and subsequent transmission of mdrgn within the hospital is prevented various plumbing components have been implicated in mdrgn outbreaks including sinks and washbasins in separate outbreaks of cre mdr p aeruginosa and polyspecies german imipenemase-1 gim-1 1821 sink faucet aerators in a crpa outbreak 22 and multiple plumbing components from the sink drains to wall pipes in a crpa outbreak 23 in a cr sphingomonas koreensis outbreak sink aerators faucets mixing valves pipes and other plumbing fixtures were also found to be contaminated 24 shower drains have also been implicated with crpa outbreak 25 in a study by stjrne et al investigation of a crpa outbreak revealed contamination of sinks with isolates closely related to crpa from patients 23 following sink replacement crpa reappeared on sink surveillance cultures after a mean duration of 13 weeks drainpipes were crpa culture positive as well suggesting that the reservoir was lower down in the drainage system even following acetic acid treatment 2 wall pipes remained positive after 10 weeks sink drains siphon and pipes to the wall were then changed again but after 5 weeks 1 pipe became positive again all bathroom sinks continued to be treated with acetic acid and after at least 2 weeks of acetic acid treatment the nosocomial transmission of crpa was stopped clinical crpa infections reappeared when the acetic acid treatment was stopped an established reservoir of mdrgn deep in the drainage system has also been described in outbreaks involving cr sphingomonas koreensis and kpc-producing ecoli 21 24 despite replacing various components of the contaminated sinks for the cr sphingomonas koreensis 24 and extensive replacement of drains and plumbing infrastructure all the way to the central drainage stacks for the kpc-producing e coli 21 the sinks were recolonised after a short period of time adjustment of hot-water temperature to 60 c and augmentation of free chlorine concentrations to at least 05 mg per litre resulted in the control of the cr sphinogomonas koreensis outbreak 24 on the other hand the kpc-producing e coli 21 persisted at a lower rate of infection in spite of additional control interventions including cohorting enhanced cleaning measures and temporary ward closure for terminal cleaning with sodium hypochlorite and decontamination with hydrogen peroxide vapour 21 retrograde contamination from common sewage pipes can also occur in showers 25 the use of showers may result in airborne or droplet transmission from shower drains to patients in a crpa outbreak study hopman et al demonstrated crpa in air samples collected immediately and 15 min after running the shower for 10 min enhanced infection control and prevention measures were then adopted with daily cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces of the patients room and washroom the shower and sink drains were also mechanically cleaned and then disinfected surveillance environmental sampling then became negative for crpa but halting these measures resulted in recontamination within 1 week in a quasi-experimental study water safe strategies in the healthcare setting including removal of sinks from patients rooms have demonstrated a decrease in mdrgn infections in an intensive care unit icu setting 26 other water safe strategies were also implemented during the study period including the use of antibacterial water filters which were replaced monthly replacement of sink siphons and aerators every 3 months use of filtered water from central sinks and use of 2 chlorhexidine impregnated washcloths for patients daily hygiene and discarding dirty water in a disposal room separate from patient areas other infection control and prevention strategies were also introduced including measures to improve hand hygiene contact precautions for and cohorting of patients colonized or infected with mdrgn use of dedicated equipment updating environmental cleaning protocols and adoption of ultraviolet light disinfection technology for terminal cleaning of isolation rooms the role of water safe strategies was also supported by another quasi-experimental study in which sink removal and use of water-free patient care in the icu resulted in the reduction of mdrgn colonisation rates 27 there was a reduced rate of icu acquired gram-negative bacilli after removal of sinks and the introduction of water-free patient care while it is difficult to attribute the reduction of mdrgn to sink removal conclusively the above studies highlight the potential role of sinks as a source for mdrgn infections and the importance of ipc strategies for prevention of mdrgn acquisition from the aqueous environment a surveillance study in an icu found sink drains located near the toilet were much more likely to be positive for blakpc 2023 sinks drains compared to sink drains near the entry door 523 sink drains 28 the difference in contamination of sink drains based on the proximity to the toilets suggest that sink drains may be contaminated by the droplets generated during flushing of toilets this emphasizes the need for ipc intervention at the design stage of wards and patient rooms in a mathematical modelling study by julia et al 29 among the risk factors identified for sink contamination were the presence of a sink in adjacent rooms sharing common plumbing status of sink in the past 30 days status of patient in the same room presence of mdro positive patient in past 14 days presence of mdro positive patient in adjacent room and infection-control interventions performed in past 7 days the investigators also found that ipc interventions show a non-sustained negative effect on sink positivity 29 these findings are in keeping with the aforementioned studies sink basin design water drainage speed and connectivity of the plumbing system may potentially influence the occurrence and trajectory of mdrgn outbreaks 3032 in an experimental design replicate hand-washing sinks were inoculated with a green fluorescent protein gfp-expressing e coli and dispersal was measured using settle plates and air sampling 30 in the first 2 weeks of the experiment no environmental contamination was detected from the sink to the level of the waste trap however when a biofilm was allowed to develop the sink strainer became colonized with gfp expressing e coli subsequently environmental contamination during faucet use occurred as a result of droplet dispersion 30 31 likewise when the sink bowl was already contaminated the use of the sink resulted in environmental contamination 30 these studies also demonstrated the retrograde contamination of separate sink waste traps which shared proximal connections in plumbing sinks could possibly contaminate the immediate surrounding environment for up to 1 m 32 key design factors that influenced the environmental contamination were the design of the sink basin speed of drainage of wastewater and the location of the sink drains in an experimental sink model with contaminated sink waste traps sinks that rapidly drained and or had rear-draining sinks had less environmental contamination 32 when sink basin drainage was immediately underneath the faucet environmental contamination occurred regardless of the speed of the drainage but was 8 times greater with slow drainage the importance of sink basin design was supported by a separate study where sinks with faucets aligned behind a drain had a higher rate of contamination by p aeruginosa compared to drains aligned directly with in front of or to the side of the faucet 33 similarly slower drainage was found to be associated with a higher microbiological burden and drain positivity for contamination 33 in addition the presence of a drainage cover was shown to reduce contamination of countertops and healthcare worker hcws gowns in a study by hajar et al 34 in the absence of a drain cover 11 of countertops 9 of gowns and 6 of hands after hand washing demonstrated contamination with gram-negative organisms compared to the contamination of 1 of countertops 2 of gowns and 0 of hands with drainage cover available observational and quasi-experimental evidence strongly support a significant role of the aqueous environment as a nosocomial reservoir of mdrgn infections both in the outbreak and non-outbreak settings there is a paucity of randomized controlled trials examining the role of interventions targeting the aqueous environment in reducing rates of mdrgn infections existing evidence also provide a strong mechanistic rationale for potential pathways of dissemination of mdrgn through hospital plumbing and wastewater management systems and subsequent spread to patients these models suggest that infection risk from aqueous environments can be modified via design changes in addition to established infection prevention measures targeting human to human mdrgn transmission promising environmental interventions demonstrated in quasi-experimental studies to reduce mdrgn infection rates include regular cleaning with acetic acid water safe strategies sterilization of water using chemicals or controlled water temperatures and physical replacement or removal of affected plumbing systems the current evidence is insufficient for conclusive recommendations in international guidelines including the recently published world health organizations guideline 35 as to the recommended methods for environmental cleaning and disinfection of mdrgn there is a pressing need for research examining the effectiveness of aqueous environmental cleaning and disinfection interventions both individually and as part of bundles for prevention of transmission of mdrgn additional epidemiologic and mechanistic studies examining the factors and pathways affecting the transmission of mdrgn from the aqueous environment would help inform the design of strategies to be tested for the purpose of this review dry environmental surfaces include the immediate patient environment including high-touch surfaces such as bed rail bedside tables and call bells two recent studies examined the role of the physical environmental surfaces in the transmission of mdro in two separate icu outbreaks in an icu outbreak of extensively drug-resistant xdr a baumannii involving eight patients with clinical infections 36 microbiological sampling of the bedside physical environment demonstrated contamination with xdr a baumannii the outbreak was rapidly controlled after the institution of an intensified ipc bundle which included environmental disinfection routine disinfection of devices and terminal cleaning of environment and surfaces molecular analysis revealed diversity in the clones of a baumannii which suggested an ongoing evolution of the isolates and suggests that outbreak strains can quickly adapt over a short time period of 23 months 36 in the second icu outbreak investigation involving both oxa-48-producing enterobacteriaceae and mdr a baumannii 37 13 oxa-48-producing enterobacteriaceae carriers and 18 mdr a baumannii carriers were identified initial outbreak response included in-depth bleach cleaning of the environment and a review of device disinfection protocols despite this environmental surveillance cultures post terminal cleaning showed persistence of oxa-48 on sinks and mattresses the outbreak was subsequently controlled with a combination of bleach environmental cleaning and hydrogen peroxide vapour environmental contamination by mdrgn varies greatly depending on the endemicity transmissibility and resistance mechanism of the organisms sampling techniques and disinfection protocols in one of the more extensive studies which was conducted over a period of 32 months investigators conducted daily environmental sampling for a week and at day 14 or at the point of discharge of patient occupying the room 38 a total of 2860 samples surrounding the environment of 80 unique patients were obtained the environment surrounding seventy of these patients demonstrated contamination across all study days 38 in another study investigating the environmental contamination of crab in an endemic setting investigators found that icu rooms occupied by patients carrying crab were consistently colonized by genomically similar strains of crab 39 the investigators also demonstrated persistence of crab in the environment and subsequent clinical infection highlighting the need for carefully thought out ipc strategies to control mdro in an endemic setting environmental contamination by colonized or infected patients is a key step in the onward transmission of mdro and understanding risk factors for environmental contamination may facilitate preventive ipc strategies a recent study by mody et al 40 demonstrated that contamination of patients hands with mdro is frequent and correlates with contamination of high-touch surfaces patients who were colonized or infected with crab were also shown to have higher environmental contamination with clonal crab compared to patients who were not 39 41 the higher burden of mdrgn as usually observed in clinical infections has been shown to increase environmental contamination 42 43 in a study of 26 patients colonized with kpc-producing cre and environmental contamination a group of 6 patients were identified as super-spreaders 43 majority of these super-spreaders had high rectal cre concentrations and faecal incontinence was the only patient-level risk factor for being a super-spreader although the median number of cre colonies found on environmental sampling was 35 iqr 111 the 6 patients 18 overall had more than 50 kpc-producing colonies detected in the environment the term super-spreader has been used to describe a highly infectious person who transmits an agent of diseases to a disproportionately large number of individuals often via environmental contamination lerner et al in their study of the transmission of kpc-producing cre identified a group of infectedcolonized patients 18 in whose vicinity the environmental load of the mdro was high 80 and classified them as super-spreaders 44 the status of a super-spreader however is not constant when the rectal concentration of cre changed the degree of environmental contamination was also noted to change these findings stress the importance of early identification and physical separation of mdro carriers to reduce environmental contamination and prevent onward transmission the degree of environmental contamination of dry areas of hospital washrooms depending on the method of hand drying has also been studied 45 the 2 methods of hand drying using paper towels versus using jet air dryers were evaluated significantly fewer bacteria including esbl-producing organisms were recovered from the environment when paper towels were used compared to jet air dryers as such in high-risk environments the microbial dispersal risk during the use of medical equipment and para-clinical service equipment needs to be carefully considered and evaluated before adoption and use in an experiment test surfaces including over-bed table different materials including vinyl stainless steel formica and cloth were inoculated with cr k pneumoniae e coli and enterobacter species 46 to evaluate survivability of organisms up to 72 h apart from cr k pneumoniae on the formica surface all pathogens survived at  15 at 24 h and all cultures at 72 h were negative 46 a systematic review by muller et al suggested copper surfaces harbour fewer bacteria than non-copper surfaces however besides an increase in cost there remains uncertainty about the efficacy for prevention of healthcare-associated infections or mdro 47 studies have demonstrated mdrgn contaminating dry surfaces in the hospital environment can also be responsible for the spread of infection 41 hcws responsible for cleaning and decontamination should be educated and monitored for strict adherence to protocols for decontamination of environment where patients infectedcolonized with mdro are housed hospital engineers and infection control practitioners need to discuss and collaborate when material choices for environmental surfaces are being made coordination between the ic team and microbiology laboratory on need-based environmental surveillance should be able to pre-empt outbreaks caused by mdro which are able to remain dormant in the hospital environment majority of the studies on the dry environment were conducted in non-outbreak settings with only two studies implicating the dry environment as a potential source of an outbreak most studies were quasi-experimental and observational in nature potentially because they were conducted as part of routine infection control measures to control the outbreak purpose designed studies to address the dry environments role in human infections and ways to prevent them are very much needed four studies examined the role of medical and para-clinical service equipment in the transmission of mdrgn organisms in an outbreak setting equipment implicated in these studies include the velcro of blood pressure cuffs positioning pillow ice machine and a tea dispenser the velcro of the bp cuff was implicated in an outbreak of two clones of crab among icu patients 48 in another report an outbreak of blakpc-2 cr k pneumoniae involving 105 patients in a university hospital was traced back to a positioning pillow and was observed to persist for 21 months 49 hospitality equipment may also be a source in an outbreak one such example would be the discovery of an ice machine as the source of an ongoing crab outbreak uncovered incidentally while investigating a cr k pneumoniae outbreak 50 the investigators demonstrated clonal relatedness of the crab isolates from three patients one hcw and the ice machine water outlet which stresses the importance of dedicated ipc strategies for ice machines and other hospitality equipment 51 in a report from japan a cold tea dispenser was also involved in a metallo--lactamase mbl producing enterobacteriaceae outbreak 52 the outbreak which involved diverse species of imp-1 producing enterobacteriaceae including k pneumoniae e coli citrobacter freundii klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter aerogenes terminated after the removal of the tea dispenser 52 studies conducted in non-outbreak settings also suggest portable equipment personal protective equipment of hcws and kitchen cutting boards play a potential role in mdrgn transmission in an icu experiment portable machines were inoculated with a designed dna marker to investigate the role of portable machines as a vector in microorganism transmission 53 doppler ultrasound machines in surgical icus and electrocardiogram machines in medical icus were inoculated and high touch surfaces in the patients environment common work areas and other portable equipment were then sampled days after results demonstrate contamination of the environment days after inoculation implicating hcws hands as a possible vector for dissemination of microorganisms in the hospital environment several studies have identified the role of environmental contamination in the transmission of mdro from the patient to hands and clothes of hcws leading to further propagation of the organism in the hospital 5456 in one study which looked at 254 hcw-patient interactions with 52 patients a baumannii was identified from hcws hands or gloves in 30 of the interactions or 478 95 ci 1241845 hcws touching the bed rail or 219 95ci 100482 performing wound dressing or 835 95 ci 2073363 or interacting with the endotracheal tube or tracheostomy site or 515 95ci 2101260 56 in another study investigators identified other risk factors including positive environmental cultures or 42 95 ci 2765 time spent in room for a duration of  5 min or 20 95 ci 1234 performing physical examinations or 17 95 ci 1228 and contact with the ventilator or 18 95ci 1128 as crucial risk factors for multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii mdrab contamination of hcws protective clothing 54 yan z et al in their study of 67 new patients with cr-kp found 315 of bed units contaminated 79 of positive environmental samples and 36 of icu staff colonized 55 these findings stress to importance of identifying index patients of outbreaks in order to confidently investigate the environmental source of outbreak propagation compliance to transmission-based precaution aggressive environmental cleaning and sustained hcw education in ipc measures may decrease transmission however the mechanisms of transmission of mdrgn are not well defined warranting further studies and exploration the role of air transmission of mdrgn is not well established and is inconsistent air environment of the patient has been implicated as a possible vector in the spread of mdro 57 biological aerosols can be detected in the air either in the form of nuclei droplets water or body fluids or as aggregate microorganisms associated with dry particles the dry form is likely to be the cause of the spread of healthcare-associated pathogens including mdrgn 58 the smaller the particle the longer they remain suspended in the air and thus get widely distributed especially in the hospital environment where air movement is uncontrolled survival of gram-negative bacteria in the air depends on bacterial species particle size and climatic factors such as temperature and humidity in most studies acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas spp have been shown to survive for a considerable period of time 59 there are two main methods for air sampling active and passive active sampling uses air impactors centrifugal air machines or filtration systems which are expensive but require less time passive methods are based on sedimentation on settle plates this requires more time but are least expensive no one method has shown to be better than the other factors which affect sampling are the amount of air contamination biological burden type of airflow in the room being tested and activity levels in the room during sample collection 58 all reported studies were conducted in adult patients and organisms implicated were crab and pseudomonas species 6066 majority of the studies were conducted in icus 61 63 64 66 one included icu and step down medical wards 62 and the other was carried out in open wards 60 in all studies the air sampling methods differed as some used passive method 61 63 65 while others used the active process 60 62 64 66 majority of the studies found a baumannii the results of the studies were mixed with 5 studies demonstrating air contamination surrounding colonized or infected a baumannii patients and 2 studies showing no association thailand 60 and maryland usa 64 the difference seen in these studies could be attributed to the climatic differences differing ipc practices close circuit suctioning of ventilated patients and the difference in methodologies regardless these findings stress the importance of the need for well-designed studies employing state of the art methods to study the role of air environment in mdro transmission and infection air and environmental surface contamination were significantly higher among rectally colonized patients compared to patients with respiratory colonization 383 vs 131 and 155 vs 55 respectively which was explained by the use of closed-circuit ventilation in an icu study 65 not surprisingly air closest to patients contained higher concentrations of the organism 66 preceding activities prior to air sampling also influenced the degree of air contamination with bacterial contamination of greater than 60 times being recorded during treatment activities such as endotracheal suctioning and changing of bed sheets and diapers however there was no association between the extent of contamination of air surrounding a patient and burden of crab on patients respiratory tract or skin 62 the complex interplay between underlying disease characteristics of the patients and pathogens contaminating the air environment has been documented for example in a study conducted by panagea et al in a cystic fibrosis treatment facility p aeruginosa was detected in the majority of air samples collected from patients rooms ward corridors and outpatient clinics 67 p aeruginosa has also been described to contaminate hospital wards operation theatres icus and labour rooms 59 68 69 clonal relatedness between strains isolated from the air and clinical samples show that crab can survive in icu air for approximately 4 weeks potentially causing further nosocomial infections 66 crab and p aeruginosa were the most common organisms implicated in the contamination of the air environment in the nosocomial setting most of the studies were not designed to show direct transmission of pathogens from the air even though the design and conduct of such studies could be resource-intensive this could be one of the focus of future research additionally more research in identifying the ideal methods for pathogen identification in the air environment is much needed future research could include air microbiome analysis potentially compared with classical microbiological methods in identifying the role of air environment in persistence and transmission of nosocomial pathogens this review highlights the role of the hospital environment in persistence and onward transmission of mdrgn environmental contamination with mdrgn is significant in the outbreak and non-outbreak settings the aqueous environment seems to be the biggest reservoir for mdrgn in the hospital environment and maybe a source of mdrgn outbreaks and persistence in the endemic setting this may in part be due to the difficulties in eradicating mdrgn from the plumbing systems more research is needed in identifying the optimal ipc strategy to prevent mdrgn transmission from the aqueous environment to patients dry environmental surfaces and medical equipment seem to be associated more with gram-positive and non-fermenting gram-negative organisms than enterobacteriaceae 70 a baumanii was the primary gram-negative organisms associated with contamination of dry surfaces and subsequent transmission to patients existing reports indicate that other than direct patient-to-patient transmission and patient-to-hcw-to-patient transmissions the hospital environment plays a crucial role in the transmission of mdrgn these reports strongly support the need for a clearly defined ipc strategy to control environmental colonisation and onward transmission of mdrgn more research is needed to quantify the proportion of mdrgn transmissions via environmental contaminations and identify the most effective ipc strategy to prevent mdrgn transmissions via the aqueous environment further research is needed to quantify the role of the hospital environment in the transmission of mdrgn and ipc strategies to prevent them study design should be rigorous and take into consideration the possible influence of climate tropical sub-tropical and temperate regions patient population and ward structure naturally ventilated and centrally air-conditioned wards additionally the implementation strategy and efficiency of ipc measures may differ according to resource availability endemicity of mdrgn organisms and the presence of guidelines especially in low-middle income countries  prediction of covid-19 disease progression in india under the effect of national lockdown sourish das  in this policy paper we implement the epidemiological sir to estimate the basic reproduction number r0 at national and state level we also developed the statistical machine learning model to predict the cases ahead of time our analysis indicates that the situation of punjab r0  16 is not good it requires immediate aggressive attention we see the r0 for madhya pradesh 337  maharastra 325 and tamil nadu 309 are more than 3 the r0 of andhra pradesh 296 delhi 282 and west bengal 277 is more than the indias r0  275 as of 04 march 2020 indias r0  275 as of 04 march 2020 is very much comparable to hubeichina at the early disease progression stage our analysis indicates that the early disease progression of india is that of similar to china therefore with lockdown in place india should expect as many as cases if not more like china if lockdown works we should expect less than 66224 cases by may 012020 all data and r code for this paper is available from httpsgithubcomsourish-cmicovid19  the world health organization who declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid-19 as a pandemic it will take twelve to eighteen months to develop the vaccine for the covid-19 5  the absence of a vaccine makes the situation worse for the already overstretched indian health care system for example the number of hospital beds per 1000 population is less than one 13 -it is just one indicator to cite the miserable situation of indias health care system in the absence of a vaccine the social distancing is the optimal strategy to control the spread of novel coronavirus 5  other than social distancing broad base rapid test and cluster tests are essential to identify those who are infected and isolate them however india did not have enough testing capacity as it is reported widely in media 2  though indian scientists recently developed the affordable testing kit for covid-19 8  india needed a complete overhaul of its health care system in a war footing in such a situation indias prime minister narendra modi announced an unprecedented three-weeks nationwide lockdown on the 24th march 2020 the purpose of the lockdown is to slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus so that the govt can take a multi-prong strategy to add more beds in its network of hospitals scale up the production of the testing kit of the covid-19 and personal protection equipment ppe for the health workers in such a grim scenario the important question for indian health officials is how many new confirmed cases will be seen and by what time with the hope that the national lockdown will slow down the spread of the virus which will buy them time to overhaul of the health care system however is lockdown going to provide the necessary slow down of the virus spread even if the lockdown helps india to control the spread of the virus it is not economically sustainable to continue the lockdown further as large the workforce in india employed in the informal sector as a daily wage laborer therefore in this policy paper we try to estimate the effect of lockdown and set up a track following which we will know if the lockdown is working in this paper we develop the epidemiological sir model and statistical machine learning model to predict disease progression in india we implemented the sir model to estimate the basic reproduction number r 0 at the national and state level so that we identify which states require more attention then we implement the machine learning model to predict the number of cases ahead of time so indian administration can be better prepared ahead of time in section 2 we introduce the database from where the data is downloaded and model is built in section 3 we present the methodology to analyze and predict the data in section 4 we present our analysis and prediction of the covid-19 disease progression in india section 5 concludes the paper with some policy recommendations in this paper we used the following major databases  legendary statistician prof george box once said all models are wrong but some are useful see 3  keeping this in our mind here in this paper we take a model agnostic two-prong approach one is to understand the severity of the ground situation and the second is the prediction which will help the health officials to make the plans accordingly the epidemic models for infectious disease yield insights into the dynamic behavior of the disease spread with new insights health officials can develop more effective disease intervention strategies besides such epidemic models are also used to forecast the course of the epidemic in addition to epidemic models we consider the statistical machine learning sml models which are extremely good for prediction often the interpretability of sml models is questioned however as we take a model agnostic approach we can use the epidemic models to understand the ground reality while adopting the sml to achieve better prediction accuracy the popular epidemic models for an infectious disease is the susceptible infected recovered sir model the model considers a closed population to start with a few infected people are added to the population it assumes that the mixing pattern is homogeneous during the period of the sickness the contagious people each infect on average r 0 other people who each then go on to infect r 0 others who are susceptible the r 0 is popularly known as the basic reproduction number the r 0 is the fundamental quantity of the disease progression and higher r 0 means more people will tend to be infected in the course of the epidemic the major advantage of the sir model is it gives a number r 0  which can be used to benchmark and compare the ground situation of different states and resource allocations can be made to those states which are hard hit the sir model can be described as where s i and r are the number of people in the population that are susceptible infected and recovered the  is the transmission rate each susceptible person contacts  people per day a fraction i n of which are infectious therefore  si n move out of the susceptible group and goes into the infected group the transmission rate is the average rate of contacts a susceptible person makes that is sufficient to transmit the infection the parameter  is the recovery rate and i is the flow out of the infected crowd and goes into the recovered group the average duration a person spends in the infected group is 1  days for covid-19 1  is around 14 days see 5  in this paper we follow the sir implementation methodology as described in 12  given r 0   and  the implementation of sir model is fairly straight forward via desolve package a solvers for initial value problems of differential equations see 10  it is known that r 0     see 4  we considered  as 1 14  from 5  however we need some good estimates of the r 0  so that we can implement the sir model and predict the disease progression in india in order to estimate the r 0  we use the r-package called r0 a toolbox to estimate r 0  see 7  the time between the infection of a primary case and one of its secondary cases is called a generation time see 11  the r0 package assumes generation time of infection is known and should be provided as input the mean generation time for the wuhan has been reported as 65 days 6  in this paper we assume the generation time follows gamma distribution and we estimated the mean and shape parameter of the gamma distribution using data our estimated mean generation time for hubei province turns out to be 67 presented in the table 1  on the recovery from infection we assume the individuals are assumed to be immune to re-infection in the short term this assumption is same as 5  currently we are deploying a grid search method over the mean and shape of the gamma distribution for the time generation process for a particular choice of the mean  and shape  parameter we generate the time and then given that as input we estimate the r 0 using the r0 package in r then for an estimated r 0 and  assumed to be 114 we simulate the disease progression for the period for which we observed the new incidences then we calculate the mean square error mse in the following way wheret is the new incidence estimated from sir model described in 1 at time point t and i obs t is the actual incidence observed in the data at time point t we estimate the mean parameter  and shape parameter  for which the mse in 2 is minimum the for estimated mean and shape parameter r 0 is estimated using the r0 package the infection rate of a typical epidemic reaches its peak and then it slows down the sir model predicts when that peak will be reached very well because it captures the inherent dynamism of the epidemic however the sir model is not helpful for short and medium-term predictions we also need short and medium-term prediction to predict the cases as quickly as possible so that the health officials can take the appropriate decision the statistical machine learning sml models are most popular for its prediction accuracy from short to medium term 9  consequently sml and sir models complement each other note that the sml does not do well in long term prediction particularly it cannot predict when it will reach the peak under this understanding we develop traditional sml models and not deep learning models we refrain to develop deep learning type models because we need a lot of data however in epidemiology we do not have such kind of big data in addition the literature on how to adopt deep-learning for small data is not sufficient yet therefore we refrain from developing deep learning models and we develop the traditional regression type sml model for short to medium type prediction as different countries or provinces population levels are different we consider the our variable to analyze as cases per 100000 aka rate  100 000 the we model the rate as a function of time country and time-country interaction in the following way where rate it is the rate of the i th country at the t th time point  i is the effect of i th country  i t is the linear effect of time on the rate of the i th country  i t 2 is the quadratic effect of time on the rate of the i th country we considered the following countries in our model 1  on march 24 2020 india announced the national lockdown of the nation to measure the effectiveness of the lockdown we used all data up to march 24 2020 to train the model and learn the parameters of the model based on the trained model we predict the disease progression path since the incubation period of the covid-19 is about 14 days it is likely that for 14 days from the beginning of the lockdown the disease will follow the predicted path and then it will deviate down from the predicted path if the new confirmed cases come below the predicted path then we will know that is due to the effect of lockdown on the other hand if the disease progression stays on the predicted path then we will know the lockdown did not work if the disease progression comes above the predicted path then we can say that the ground situation worsen during the lockdown exploratory data analysis eda is important to develop good predictive models in the figure 1  we plot the case per 100000 aka rate for us eu and iran the worst-hit us eu and irans rates are in the range of 70 and 250 on the other hand disease progression among asian countries is very different see figure  2 the disease progression for both india and japan are similar we see the exponential rise in india and japan but at a very lower rate than the western nations china has able to flatten the curve and south korea was able to curb the rise from exponential to linear however so far south korea experienced the worst rate among the major four asian countries table  3 we present the actual prediction till may 01 2020 if lockdown works then actual confirmed cases for india should stay below 66224 by may 012020 a comparison of r 0 between india and china  in the table 1  r 0 with a 95 confidence interval for hubei province and china is around 25 during the first 23 days from the starting of the lockdown indias r 0 with a 95 confidence interval computed using two different starting points as breakout one from 02-mar-2020 because the number of cases in india started rising from that day the r 0 for india for the first 22 days till the lockdown is around 25 like china however if we use the data till 04-apr-2020 then the r 0 value is around 275 it indicates since the lockdown the situation has worsen it is also clear from the figure 4  in the second approach we consider indias breakout from 23-jan-2020 in that situation if we consider the data till 24-mar-2020 the r 0 with 95 confidence is almost 19 and if we consider data till 04-apr-2020 the r 0 is nearly 21 it means if we use the data earlier to 02-mar-2020 the indias r 0 looks better in the figure 3  we compare the incidences of hubei and india in figure 3a and 3b  we consider the date range for hubei from 23-jan-2020 to 14-feb-2020 ie during the first 23 days of hubei lockdown on the other hand we considered the data for india from the 02-jan-2020 to 24-jan-2020 till the lockdown on the 23-jan-2020 hubei had 444 confirmed cases and overall china had 548 confirmed cases on 02-jan-2020 india had only 3 confirmed cases whereas on the day of lockdown ie on 24-jan-2020 india had 536 confirmed cases so on the day when the lockdown starts both india and hubei andor china had a comparable number of cases perhaps we should consider indias r 0 as around 25 similar to that of the early stage covid-19 disease progression of china even with the lockdown china experienced more than 80000 cases perhaps we should prepare for at least that many cases if not more in india stat wise r 0  in table  2 we present the state wise basic reproduction number r 0  as of 04 march 2020 we see the punjabs r 0 is worst in the country punjabs high r 0  16 is likely due to a super spreader who ignored advice to self quarantine after returning from a trip to italy and germany see 1  the situation is punjab is really complicated and serious intervention is required in figure 5  we present the cases in punjab over time since march 20 2020 the number of confirmed cases increased at an unprecedented rate from table  2 we see the r 0 for madhya pradesh 337  maharastra 325 and tamil nadu 309 are more than 3 clearly the situations are complicated in these three states the r 0 of andhra pradesh 296 delhi 282 and west bengal 277 is more than the indias r 0 which is 275 these seven states should need special attention as their r 0 is more than that of india 275 these numbers are as of 4 apr 2020 for the following states we either do not have enough data to make inference for r 0  or the algorithm fail to converge 1 andaman and nicobar islands 2 arunachal pradesh  here we present a point by point discussion of our analysis and prediction 1 situation of punjab r 0  16 is bad it requires immediate aggressive attention 2 we see the r 0 for madhya pradesh 337  maharastra 325 and tamil nadu 309 are more than 3 aggressive intervention is needed table 1  r 0 with a 95 confidence interval for hubei province and china is around 25 during the first 23 days from the starting of the lockdown indias r 0 with a 95 confidence interval using two different starting points one from 02-mar-2020 because the number of cases in india started rising from that day the r 0 for india for the first 22 days till the lockdown is around 25 like china however if we use the data till 04-apr-2020 then the r 0 value is around 275 in the second approach we consider indias breakout from 23-jan-2020 in that situation if we consider the data till 24-mar-2020 the r 0 with 95 confidence is almost 19 and if we consider data till 04-apr-2020 the r 0 is nearly 21  we consider the date range for hubei from 23-jan-2020 to 14-feb-2020 ie during the first 23 days of hubei lockdown on the other hand we considered the data for india from the 02-jan-2020 to 24-jan-2020 before the lockdown on the 23-jan-2020 hubei had 444 confirmed cases and overall china had 548 confirmed cases on 02-jan-2020 india had only 3 confirmed cases whereas on the day of lockdown ie on 24-jan-2020 india had 536 confirmed cases punjabs high r 0 is likely due to a super spreader ignored advice to self quarantine after returning from a trip to italy and germany see 1  the high r 0 is likely due to a super spreader ignored advice to self quarantine after returning from a trip to italy and germany see 1   using models to identify routes of nosocomial infection a large hospital outbreak of sars in hong kong two factors dominated the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars during the 2002-2003 global outbreak namely super-spreading events sse and hospital infections although both factors were important during the first and the largest hospital outbreak in hong kong the relative importance of different routes of infection has not yet been quantified we estimated the parameters of a novel mathematical model of hospital infection using sars episode data these estimates described levels of transmission between the index super-spreader staff and patients and were used to compare three plausible hypotheses the broadest of the supported hypotheses ascribes the initial surge in cases to a single super-spreading individual and suggests that the per capita risk of infection to patients increased approximately one month after the start of the outbreak our estimate for the number of cases caused by the sse is substantially lower than the previously reported values which were mostly based on self-reported exposure information this discrepancy suggests that the early identification of the index case as a super-spreader might have led to biased contact tracing resulting in too few cases being attributed to staff-to-staff transmission we propose that in future outbreaks of sars or other directly transmissible respiratory pathogens simple mathematical models could be used to validate preliminary conclusions concerning the relative importance of different routes of transmission with important implications for infection control kwok kin on  leung gabriel m  lam wai yee  riley steven emergence of novel human infections new insights and new challenges ann kimball marie stella quah r   in 2009 a cluster of high mortality influenza cases was detected in mexico an observational study of 899 patients hospitalized in mexico between late march and 1 june 2009 showed that pandemic h1n1 disproportionately affected young people fifty-eight patients 65 of those hospitalized became critically ill with complications including severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock among those who became critically ill the mortality rate was 41 domnguez-cherit et al 2009 the pandemic and its management have been the subject of an in-depth analysis commissioned by the world health organization who and that analysis proved prescient in more recent global outbreak events such as ebola who 2005 this cluster heralded a global pandemic and the declaration by who of a public health emergency of international concern phiec it occurred in the context of a decade of planning for a potential h5n1 outbreak which included who updating its pandemic guidance pandemic influenza preparedness and response 2009 in 1997 a small but lethal cluster of influenza occurred in children in a hong kong nursery of the 18 cases 6 died mounts et al 1999 science shifted its understanding of influenza and recognized that flu could come directly from birds to humans in fact h5n1 which emerged in 2003 acquired the popular moniker of bird flu the outbreak was curtailed through active surveillance changes in practice and poultry culling of live markets in hong kong however the outbreak proved a harbinger of more widespread recognition of bird flu h5n1 was identified through active surveillance of poultry and wild birds waterfowl were particularly affected human cases were sporadic but carried a very high mortality rate estimated at 60 webster et al 2006 although the virus proved difficult to transmit to humans case fatality was high as of february 2011 about 500 laboratory-confirmed human cases had been reported to the who from 15 countries about 60 of reported cases were fatal the spread of h5n1 was geographically broad with extension into nigeria and throughout southern and se asia in waterfowl and in domestic fowl extensive planning for a potential pandemic was put into place given the apparent proximity of the threat and the high mortality in humans veterinary and human health collaboration was a central precept of this planning in the one health concept heymann and dixon 2013 the h5n1 threat did not materialize despite the high level of circulation in birds preparedness in se asia in particular included tabletop exercises culling of birds through rapid response and at least one joint investigation carried out between laos and thailand in this setting h1n1 ran its course with a milder clinical syndrome although it is estimated that the global death toll was 284 000 the pandemic of h1n1 precipitated some confusion as well as competition for access to antivirals and vaccines in the aftermath of these contentious discussions new policy initiatives were put into place this included the pandemic influenza preparedness pip who plan which took some years to negotiate it balances access to new viral strains for vaccine production with access to these vaccines for poor countries the fineberg commission to examine an after action performance of the international health regulations ihr was central to potential reform as well this will be more fully discussed below in 2013 a new influenza virus h7n9 was isolated from patients in the peoples republic of china isolates were both from birds and from humans although 571 cases occurred globally with 212 deaths international spread was limited to two countries the national response to this epidemic was very strong which is a key to control discussed below the 2009 influenza pandemic also followed another global respiratory emergency sars the etiology of sars a new coronavirus was not known in late 2002 when cases and deaths began to occur in guangdong province of the peoples republic of china initially misdesignated as a chlamydial pneumonia early in the course public alarm mounted as antibiotics proved futile in treatment between november 2002 and july 2003 a total of 8427 probable sars cases were reported from 29 countries with 813 deaths for a mortality rate of 96 mmwr 2003 sars effectively demonstrated the potential mobility of respiratory pathogens while sars was declared poorly transmissible it effectively jumped continents in travelers and infiltrated populations through nosocomial spread in contrast to influenza which is highly transmissible sars still requires direct exposure to bodily fluids for transmission however sars shifted the scientific paradigm of zoonotic transmission more fully  with incrimination of wet markets vending civet cats initially thought to be the source this initial assessment has proved less robust in terms of reservoir for new human pathogens as discussed below sars also challenged our understanding of transmission dynamics for reasons that remain unclear a single infected person who spent a single night in a hotel in kowloon resulted in geographically broad transmission the concept of a super-spreader was popularized lloyd-smith et al 2005 this phenomenon was also described in a second scenario in beijing shen et al 2004 traditionally infection has been characterized by a reproductive rate which is essentially the rate at which an infectious case replaces itself if the rate is 1 then there will be no spread as the infection will simply stay the same absolute number as the index case recovers however if the rate is higher ie 1 then spread into the population will occur as a single case infects multiple individuals so the number of cases increases super-spreaders seem to have high infection rates although the overall rate for the pathogen in question may be low this has of course changed our assumptions for modeling disease spread in populations following the 2009 h1n1 pandemic and the avian influenza emergence of 1997 and the sars pandemic of 2003 a new virus emerged on the arabian peninsula mers-cov is a new human pathogen that also causes pneumonia and respiratory distress the story of mers is less history and more present in terms of defining its epidemic potential it reinforces the need for one health collaboration between veterinarians clinicians and public health specialists making use of their relative expertise mers was first reported in 2012 as a case report of a patient in an icu with severe respiratory disease from jordan hijawi et al 2013 at the time of this writing 1321 cases and 466 deaths have been reported to the who with an average case fatality ratio of 35 in one epidemiological analysis the case fatality ratio for primary cases was 74 95 ci 4991 whereas for secondary cases it was 20 95 ci 742 alsolamy 2015 like its coronavirus cousin sars mers-cov has demonstrated agile spread within hospitals oboho et al 2015 and across continents in 2015 a large outbreak occurred in south korea cowling et al 2015 that outbreak was characterized by a mortality rate of about 20 among 186 cases 33 were fatal it also featured super-spreading events in fact a single case housed in the emergency room with persistent cough was linked to 81 cases in one hospital kucharski 2015 to summarize the recent episodes of respiratory infectious diseases related to influenza sars-cov and mers-cov have demonstrated increasingly direct links between animal and human infections agile intercontinental geographic spread and complex transmission dynamics including super-spreader events transmission within health-care settings has also been a prominent feature these characteristics have challenged traditional assumptions about the pathogenesis and epidemiology of infectious diseases a new form of a human neurodegenerative disease that emerged in britain in the 1990s was linked to the emergence of bovine spongiform encephalitis bse in cattle mad cow disease this link was demonstrated through multiple casecontrol studies the biological proof of a common etiology came somewhat later hill et al 1997 prions are not microbial life in the traditional sense they are autocatalytic proteins or proteins that make change in the instance of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tses of mad cow disease bse sheep scrapie elk chronic wasting disease as well as in the human diseases of creutzfeldt-jakob disease cjd new variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease vcjd and kuru these changes occur in the central nervous system while the new vcjd epidemic related to ingestion of infected beef from bse-affected cows has waned due to enhanced global surveillance and animal husbandry practices research into prion disease continues it appears that despite their lack of genetic material prions do undergo mutation and strain diversification in response to selective pressures collinge et al 2007 soberingly it is believed that some humans estimated 1 in 4000 britons silently carry pathogenic prions for many years this risk persists and creates safety concerns for blood transfusions and organ transplantation the story of bse demonstrated the limitation of the traditional assumption that genetic reproduction of pathogens is necessary for infection as outlined above the uk beef industry had historically been a relatively stable one when fragmented among many smaller farms across the british isles to protect this industry the government maintained a tariff on the imports of competing products from abroad with the explosion of global trading in beef after world war ii coincident with refrigerated transport and the movement toward global free trade the united kingdom negotiated a timetable under the general agreement on tariffs and trade to scale down tariffs on beef which heightened competition in the uk beef industry and increased pressure for more efficient and less costly production methods against this backdrop innovation in rendering was introduced into the slaughterhouses of the united kingdom the rendering or processing of carcasses of cows and other animals after the edible and usable bits of flesh and meat have been cut away has been done for centuries and for decades uk farmers used the meat and bone meal from rendering as a protein source for beef cattle historically the rendering process was similar to pressure cooking  applying very high temperatures for very long times so eventually even the bones broke down into powder it was an expensive fuel-consuming and time-consuming process when a new cold vacuum extraction method of rendering was introduced requiring lower temperatures ie less energy and less time it seemed a winwin situation considering the increasing pressure on the uk beef industry in the face of global competition but sometime after the new rendering practice was introduced into the united kingdom the prion disease known as mad cow disease emerged the new process discovered by uk beef industry was not effectively disinfecting for prions existence of prion disease was unknown prior to its dramatic emergence first in cows and then in people the context is important to appreciate somehow the streamlining of the rendering process played a role british scientists tested the new process by deliberately introducing animals with mad cow disease and assaying the resulting meat and bone meal product they found that the newer rendering process does not remove the infection whereas the older process did zika virus emerged in sub-saharan africa in the late 1940s it is a close cousin of dengue virus and in the same family as yellow

all of these diseases have become globally distributed zika is the most recent arrival in the americas it has circulated in asia for some time chen and hamer 2016 while clinically relatively mild epidemiologic studies in brazil have suggested a link between zika virus and severe birth defects in newborns viral infection in early pregnancy appears to be associated with microcephaly which is associated with profound brain injury in newborns again the emergence of a new infectious disease is pushing the boundaries of biomedical knowledge in the absence of certain prevention or treatment options the government of brazil has gone as far as advising women not to become pregnant mcneil 2015 the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has continued to be a major concern in 2008 a new enzyme in gram-negative bacteria was detected which caused broad antibiotic resistance this enzyme was produced by mobile genes that travel on plasmids plasmids are small circular dna genetic packages which are distinct from the dna of the bacteria itself these are mobile with the ability to be taken in across classes of bacteria if and when they confer a selective advantage for survival as in the case of antimicrobial resistance the new enzyme ndm-1 new delhi metalloproteinase-1 was traced to an infection that occurred in patients who had been treated in india a more complete study of the epidemiology of this enzyme in gram-negative bacterial isolates from the subcontinent suggested a broad range of gram-negatives were affected kumarasamy et al 2010 this new biology which was first described for extended spectrum beta lactamase esbl resistance in the 1990s has provoked renewed concern in antimicrobial resistance 2011 was declared by the who as the year to address antimicrobial resistance the pharmaceutical pipeline is bereft of new antibiotics to address this challenge chillingly another new pan-resistant plasmid has been reported from china which is resistant even to the last line of defense the polymixin class of antimicrobials liu et al 2015 this report included isolates from pigs at slaughter retail pig and chicken meat and humans again the specter of intensive agriculture fostering new biological threats calls for careful study the isolates were largely from areas of intensive porcine agriculture in china figure 1
indicates sites sampled for polymixin plasmid resistance the question of where new infections lurk in nature has been an active area of research as noted above the initial reservoir for sars coronavirus was thought to be civet cats which are domestically raised for food in china however further investigation has suggested that there may be a single host involved in many emergent diseases in an elegant demonstration of interdisciplinary research han et al 2015 have recently published a persuasive article on the role of bats in emerging infections whether or not the theses of the article prove true with further research the work provides additional evidence of how extremely powerful interdisciplinary research can be toward solving the puzzles of emergent diseases in humans in discussing the spillover of viruses from bats to humans the authors writefactors that contribute to the intrusion of bats into human living environment can be summarized into a push and a pull brssow 2012 a push refers to the enormous demand for more space and resources brought by the human population explosion which leads to the destruction of bat habitats and shortage of food natural environmental changes such as typhoons and droughts can also place stresses on bats a pull involves the living environments built by humans characterized by urbanization intensive agriculture and food animal breeding which attracts bats into human living environments for an abundant of food supply
 so coming full circle this discussion highlights the critical importance of further understanding these events of species jumping or spillovers given the pressures will only augment rather than abate infections potentially housed in bats as their natural reservoir from han and colleagues is shown in table 1
 it is an impressive array which brings us to consider how indispensible further understanding in these interactions is to gain insight into emergent human infections so what explains the apparent increased pace of emergence of new human infections is it simply that we are more able with our new technologies to detect them or are there forces at work that are fostering this trend the stories of bse and nvcjd recounted above were outlined because the united kingdom although a small country has excellent epidemiologic statistical laboratory and clinical acumen while cases of bse and nvcjd were not confined to the united kingdom the origin of emergence was tracked and described relatively efficiently but what of influenza the potential contribution of intensive poultry and swine agriculture to the emergence of influenza a emergence was outlined in my earlier article for this publication research over the past decade has continued to provide evidence of this risk as intensive practices have spread to developing countries the assurance of biosecurity has become less sure as noted in the discussion above of polymixin resistance through plasmids in pigs and humans while many new strains of influenza arise in wild birds particularly waterfowl the link to human populations appears to be through domestic poultry leibler et al 2009 however other anthropogenic mechanisms are also at play without the global mobile environment of travel and trade emergence would remain a largely local phenomenon however as we saw with the influenza discussion above that is not the case nor was it the case with sars or with mers-cov international tourism surpassed 11 billion arrivals in 2013 according to the world bank world bank international tourism after a slump in global trade during the global recession exports of food in 2014 reached nearly 15 trillion in value for selected countries where data were available this of course does not include all of global trade which has surpassed 3 trillion in value merchandise trade by product guarding against transcontinental transmission in food or through human travel is a complex undertaking with safeguards at the source the most likely answer however research testing and demonstration of effective measures remain wanting finally climate change largely attributed to human activity seems to be readjusting the boundaries of mosquito borne diseases the recent incursion of zika into brazil is attributed to the el nio weather pattern now in force in that geography while el nio oscillation is not directly attributable to human activity the shifting of such natural oscillations and their severity may well be in his landmark 1993 book planetary overload global environmental change and the health of the human species anthony j mcmichael outlines the human-generated stress on natural systems mcmichael 1993 he posits that food will become increasingly scarce for the human community the macroecologic effects of human activity on climate water food agriculture pollution and human health are well described but the systematic link between the macrolevel what we can see and what is occurring on the microlevel remains an important area of research to address the emergence of new pathogens we need more precise knowledge about the mechanisms that form the critical pathway to emergence a follow-up report to the landmark iom report emerging infections microbial threats to health emergence detection and response was published in 2003 smolinski et al microbial threats to health additional factors of emergence were examined in this report human susceptibility to infection climate and weather changing ecosystems poverty and social inequity war and famine the lack of political will and intent to harm thus the original 6 factors grew to 13 while enriching the discussion and description of emergence this proliferation of factors also created overlapping domains within factors for example climate and weather are an integral physical science aspect of ecosystems the failure of political will is integral to the neglect of public health systems and so forth from an analytic point of view the need for in-depth study of factors and how they actually work has become critical for scientific insight into public health protection mcmichael has suggested the term the anthropogenic epoch to describe our contemporary situation in other words human kind is changing the nature of our environment in unprecedented ways more recently the rockefeller-lancet commission has suggested the new scientific discipline of planetary health as a unifying concept to bring the disparate strands of life sciences and ecology more closely together to foster interdisciplinary research and insight the rockefeller foundation 2015 the key to success will require intense investment in transdisciplinary research which brings in disparate databases and talents into risk analysis in addition to formal disease surveillance reporting a number of informal diseases surveillance networks have arisen among countries which share common borders or work within a common economic bloc these networks facilitate the flow of information across borders and allow collaborative investigations tabletop exercises and resource sharing on an ongoing basis in postconflict areas such as the mekong basin they contribute to health security gresham et al 2013 increasing sophistication of bringing disparate data sets together and creating models to understand possible scenarios has brought additional insight into prevention and control efforts for emerging diseases prediction of where outbreaks are most likely to occur remains a very imperfect science jones et al 2008 retrospective niche modeling has brought additional insight into how different factors may interact to foster outbreaks daszak et al 2013 laboratory diagnosis of unknown agents has also advanced during the sars outbreak the who convened an informal network approach to fully sequence the new agent in 1-month time david 2004 one group has put forward a vision of bringing full genomic sequencing into the laboratories of developing countries aarestrup et al 2012 clearly the ability to quickly diagnose new agents without the necessity of culture would be an important advance as importantly the integration of informatics linking genomic analyses to phylogenetic metadata would allow global tracking of agents as the boundaries of microbiology are stretched with new insights from emergent diseases the ability of the people of the world to protect against pandemics is more important than ever global traffic and trade continue to grow confounding national approaches with their international span in 2005 following sars the who adopted the ihr international health regulations this is the only law with the force of an international treaty which is in place to govern the conduct of countries during global security

policy influenza  generality of the final size formula for an epidemic of a newly invading infectious disease junling ma david earn j d  the well-known formula for the final size of an epidemic was published by kermack and mckendrick in 1927  their analysis was based on a simple susceptible-infected-recovered sir model that assumes exponentially distributed infectious periods more recent analyses have established that the standard final size formula is valid regardless of the distribution of infectious periods but that it fails to be correct in the presence of certain kinds of heterogeneous mixing eg if there is a core group as for sexually transmitted diseases we review previous work and establish more general conditions under which kermack and mckendricks formula is valid we show that the final size formula is unchanged if there is a latent stage any number of distinct infectious stages andor a stage during which infectives are isolated the durations of each stage can be drawn from any integrable distribution we also consider the possibility that the transmission rates of infectious individuals are arbitrarily distributed-allowing in particular for the existence of super-spreaders-and prove that this potential complexity has no impact on the final size formula finally we show that the final size formula is unchanged even for a general class of spatial contact structures we conclude that whenever a new respiratory pathogen emerges an estimate of the expected magnitude of the epidemic can be made as soon the basic reproduction number r 0 can be approximated and this estimate is likely to be improved only by more accurate estimates of r 0  not by knowledge of any other epidemiological details  whenever a serious infectious disease emerges or re-emerges in a human population a matter of immediate interest is the likely magnitude of the outbreak this is often called the expected final size of the epidemic bailey 1975 anderson and watsons 1980 anderson and may 1991 andersson and britton 2000 diekmann and heesterbeek 2000  which we denote z of course if the emergent pathogen becomes endemic in the population then there will never really be a final size but in that case the matter at issue is the likely magnitude of the first major wave of cases to our knowledge a formal mathematical argument leading to an estimate of an epidemics expected final size z was first published in the landmark 1927 paper by kermack and mckendrick 1927  the formula for z that kermack and mckendrick obtained eq 5 below depends only on the basic reproduction number r 0 the expected number of secondary cases caused by a typical primary case in a fully susceptible population however without further analysis it is unclear to what extent this formula depends on the particular assumptions that kermack and mckendrick made in constructing their model and hence whether it bears a strong relationship to the final size in realistic situations one implicit assumption of the kermack and mckendrick 1927 analysis is that infectious periods are exponentially distributed anderson and watsons 1980 showed that the final size formula remains valid if infectious periods follow a gamma distribution in section 13 of their book diekmann and heesterbeek 2000 generalized this statement to cover an arbitrary distribution of infectious periods another key assumption of the kermack and mckendrick 1927 analysis is that the host population is homogeneously mixed it is well known that if this assumption is dropped then the final size will not necessarily be given by the standard formula in particular the existence of a core group as for sexually transmitted diseases gives rise to a different formula for the final size anderson and may 1991 diekmann and heesterbeek 2000  in this paper we explore the generality of the standard kermack-mckendrick final size formula 5 we begin with a pedagogical review of the main results that have been obtained previously adding model structure in steps we then proceed to generalize these results in three new directions showing that the standard formula remains valid i regardless of the number of distinct infectious stages ii if the mean contact rate is itself arbitrarily distributed and iii for a large class of spatially heterogeneous contact structures we conclude that the kermack-mckendrick formula 5 applies in great generality making it an extremely useful relationship in practice the standard sir model anderson and may 1991 diekmann and heesterbeek 2000 brauer and castillo-chavez 2001  is represented by a system of three ordinary differential equations here s i and r denote the proportions of the population that are susceptible infectious and recovered respectively recovered individuals are assumed to be immune to reinfection since s  i  r  1 one of the three equations is redundant the two parameters in the model are the transmission rate  and the recovery rate   the mean infectious period is t  1  the basic reproduction number is r 0  t the proportion of the population that is infected can increase and hence an epidemic can occur if and only if r 0  1 in eqs 1 recruitment of new susceptibles through birth or immigration is ignored as is loss of individuals through mortality or emmigration this approximation is reasonable provided the timescale of the epidemic is much shorter than the timescale over which demographic turnover occurs no recruitment ensures that the disease will eventually burn out ie i  0 to see formally that we must have i  0 note that the positive orthant is invariant so all solutions of eqs 1 lie in the non-negative bounded set defined by s i r  0 and s  i  r  1 observing that we see that s  i is decreasing whenever i  0 however s  i is bounded below by 0 hence it has a limit moreover eq 2 implies that d dt s  i is bounded because i is bounded hence lim t d dt s  i  0 so eq 2 yields i  0 this model 1 is sufficiently simple that an exact solution can be obtained for the phase portrait forming dids and integrating yields an epidemic ends when no infectives remain consequently we can find the final size z by setting i  0 in eq 3 and solving for z  s0  s this yields the implicit relation an explicit form is given in appendix a the general formula 4 applies regardless of the proportions of the population that are susceptible and infective initially a less than fully susceptible population must be taken into account if some individuals have been vaccinated or retain immunity from previous exposures however in the important special case where a new pathogen enters a fully susceptible population we have both i0 1 and s0  1 in the limit i0  0 s0  1 which is the usual final size formula the practical utility of the final size formula would appear to be limited by the fact that it is derived from the overly simplistic standard sir model in the remainder of this paper we show that in fact the formula is valid under very general circumstances we generalize the model in several steps in order to explain the ideas clearly and to avoid exposing the reader to a notational burden at the outset the standard sir model ignores any delay between the time an individual is infected and the onset of infectiousness this latent period is often substantial compared with the infectious period anderson and may 1991  in addition some pathogens notably hiv give rise to a sequence of distinct stages of infection each yielding a different transmission rate redfield et al 1986 seligmann et al 1987  it is common to incorporate latency by including an exposed class e yielding an seir model schwartz and smith 1983 earn et al 2000a  however noting that the exposed stage can be regarded as an infectious stage during which the transmission rate happens to be zero we lose no generality by restricting attention to multiple infectious stage models which we refer to as si n r models if there are n infectious stages generalizing the sir model 1 to include multiple infectious stages the equations for an si n r ar where i i is the density of individuals in the ith infectious stage  i is the transmission rate for contact with individuals in this stage and 1 i is the mean duration of this stage the sum of eqs 6 is zero implying that s  n i1 i i  r is invariant and hence that eq 6d is superfluous as in the basic sir model to see that the final size is well-defined in this model we generalize the argument given for the simple sir model in section 2 let j k  s  k i1 i i  then d dt j k   k i k  so i k  0 implies j k is decreasing and lim t d dt j k  0 hence i k   0 for all k before a new disease is introduced into a population everyone is susceptible ie s  1 i 1      i n  0 and r  0 which is known as the disease free equilibrium dfe the stability of the dfe determines whether the new disease can cause an epidemic hyman et al 1999 proved that the quantity determines the stability of the dfe ie the dfe is locally stable if r 0  1 and unstable if r 0  1 note r 0 as defined by 7 is the sum of the products of the transmission rate and mean duration in each infectious stage ie it is the basic reproduction number for this model we now proceed to show that eqs 6 yield the same final size formula as 5 anderson and watsons 1980 established this for the special case in which each stage has the same transmission rate and duration  i   and  i   for all i their method can easily be generalized to arbitrary  i and  i as follows let g k  n ik1 i i  r k  1     n  1 and g n  r then eqs 6c and 6d imply d dt g k   k i k for each k  1     n consequently eq 6a implies that the function is a constant of the motion for a newly invading disease s0  1 i k 0  0 and recalling that z  r  1  s and eq 7 the final size formula eq 5 immediately follows consideration of a special case of the model in the previous section allows us to infer that the distribution of stage durations in any infectious stage need not be exponentially distributed the final size formula 5 holds true if the stage durations follow a gamma distribution which has probability density here the shape parameter k is a positive integer and the scale parameter   0 the mean is k and the variance is k 2  this family of distributions includes the exponential distribution k  1 nearly normal distributions k large and the delta distribution which yields a fixed duration k   the term  i in eq 1b for the simple sir model implies that the durations of infectious periods are exponentially distributed with mean 1 brauer and castillo-chavez 2001  since the sum of exponentially distributed random variables is gamma distributed a standard trick anderson and watsons 1980 lloyd 2001ab enables us to replace an exponential distribution with mean 1 by a gamma distribution g kk which also has mean 1  the trick is to replace a single infectious stage with k identical exponentially distributed substages of mean duration 1k  the model then has precisely the form the si n r model 6 but with the sequence of infectious stages being mathematical artefacts rather than biologically meaningful since this substage trick can be applied equally well to any infectious stage anderson and watsons 1980 conclusion that the final size in an sir model with gamma distributed infectious periods is given by the usual formula 5 now generalizes to an arbitrary number of stages each with gamma distributed durations although expressed differently in their original paper kermack and mckendrick 1927 studied a particular limit of the gamma distributed multiple stage model described in the previous section suppose we have a sequence of n infectious stages each with the same fixed stage duration   thus this is the limit k   in the gamma distribution 10 with   1  during stage i the transmission rate is  i i  1     n if we now let the number of infectious stages increase n   and the length of each stage decrease   0 keeping the total infectious period t  n  constant then we arrive at a model in which the transmission rate  varies continuously through the infectious period in such a model an individuals infectivity depends on hisher stage-age ie the amount of time since initial infection using a stage-age sir formulation kermack and mckendrick 1927 derived the final size formula 5 and showed that its form is independent of how the transmission rate depends on stage-age we have seen that the final size formula 5 is the same if stage durations are distributed according to any member of the family of the gamma distributions 10 this suggests that any distribution of stage durations will yield the same final size unlike the situation for gamma distributed infectious periods with an arbitrary distribution the time-evolution of the infectious class can no longer be expressed using ordinary differential equations odes instead we must construct a system of integro-differential equations feng and thieme 2000  let ut be the rate at which individuals become infectious enter class i at time t  0 ie the equation for the susceptible class is the same as in the standard sir model we also define ut for t  0 since this will allow us to specify the initial conditions for t  0 ut is the rate at which individuals who were still infectious at the initial time time 0 became infectious at time t hence the number of infectious individuals at time t  0 is let f t be the probability density of the infectious period so for the special case of a gamma distribution f t is given by g k t in eq 10 for an individual who becomes infectious at time   0 the probability density that she recovers leaves the i class at time t   is however for individuals who became infectious at time   0 the probability density to leave class i at time t must be conditioned by still being infectious at time 0 hence the rate of change of the number of infectious individuals at time t is those who leave class i enter class r hence in appendix b we show that if the infectious period is exponentially distributed then eqs 11 reduce to the the standard sir model 1 as in the standard sir model 1 the population size is invariant s  i  r  1 s  0 and s exists establishing that i  0 so the disease will burn out regardless of the infectious period distribution requires a little more work since f t and l t are probability densities  0 f t dt   0 l t dt  1 consequently switching the order of integrations we find next integrating from 0 to  on both sides of eq 11f we have i  0 to relate the final size in the present model to the usual formula 5 we need an expression for the basic reproduction number r 0  feng and thieme 2000 have we now divide eq 11b by s and integrate yielding therefore the usual final size formula 5 will follow if  0 it dt  t z this is plausible intuitively since the integral  0 it dt sums all infectious individuals weighted by the time they are infectious this must also equal the mean infectious period t times the number of individuals infected over the course of the entire epidemic the final size z more rigorously in appendix b we prove lemma 61 for the model specified by eqs 11 in the limit 11 if the initial number of infectious individuals is small i0  0 then the final size of the epidemic z is given by the classical formula 5 in this formula the basic reproduction number is r 0  t where t is the mean infectious period with modest additional effort we can generalize theorem 61 to the multiple stage si n r model ie the usual final size formula 5 is still valid if there are multiple infectious stages and the durations of each stage are arbitrarily distributed recall that latent stages can be considered infectious stages with zero transmission rate so we do not make any explicit reference to latency as in all the situations considered above we assume that vital dynamics births and deaths can be ignored and that recovery entails lifelong immunity suppose the ith infectious stage has duration distribution with probability density f i t and mean t i  thus in the special case that durations in each stage follow gamma distributions 10 we have f i t  g ki i t and the the rate of change of the susceptible class is given by eq 6a as when all stage durations are exponentially distributed similar to section 6 the equation for each infectious stage can be writte where u i t is the number of individuals entering class i i at time t and the initial conditions are specified by individuals who leave the last infectious stage recover into class r henc when the infectious periods and the latent period are exponentially distributed ie f i t   i e i t  the technique introduced in appendix b can be applied to show that the model 13 is indeed the standard multiple-stage sir model in their analysis of the si n r model with arbitrarily distributed stage durations 13 feng and thieme 2000 have shown that the basic reproduction number is and that the disease free equilibrium is unstable if and only if r 0  1 similar to previous sections we find that s  i i i  r  1 is invariant s  0 and s exists integrating eq 13a from 0 to t and and switching the order of integrations we have it  0 similarly integrating from 0 to  we have i  0 thus the disease will also eventually burn out theorem 71 consider the multiple stage si n r epidemic model with arbitrarily distributed stage durations specified by eqs 13  if the initial number of infectious individuals is suffciently small ie in the limit i i i 0  0 the final size z is given by the unique solution of eq 5 or explicitly by eq a2  in which r 0 is given by eq 14  proof to prove this we divide by s on both sides of 6a and integrate with respect to time using lemma 61 eq 15 becomes suppose i i 0  i 1 switching the order of integration also integrating eq 13d and switching the order of integrations we have ie summed over all time the number of individuals who enter the i  1th stage is the same as the number who enter the ith stage we then integrate eq 6a from the definition of u 1 t in eq 13c we have for all i  1     n notice that the final size z  s0  s so eq 16 becomes during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 poutanen et al 2003 low and mcgeer 2003  one aspect of observed transmission that received a great deal of attention was the existence of super-spreaders who sars update 27 2003 ie individuals who infect many more people than the average eg at least an order of magnitude greater than r 0  in this section we prove that the existence of the type of super-spreaders that occurred during the sars outbreak in 2003 has no effect on the final size formula one mechanism for the generation of super-spreaders is that the infectious period distribution could be bimodal such that a small proportion of individuals are infectious much longer than average this situation is already covered by theorem 71 which deals with arbitrary distributions of stage durations in this section we consider a different type of generalization of the sir model in all of the models we have considered thus far it has been assumed implicitly that all infectious individuals have the same transmission rate if some individuals actually have a much higher than average transmission rate then they will be super-spreaders this could arise for example because of individual variation in viral load reflecting variation in immune response or as the result of chance occurence of environmental circumstances that promote disease spread as apparently occurred during the sars epidemic who sars update 33 2003 whatever the origin we focus here on variation in transmission rate that is manifested only after an individual is infected in the following sections we consider the effects of intrinsic variation in contact rates among individuals which results from inhomogeneous contact network structure in the host population we now proceed to develop and analyze an sir model with a distribution of transmission rates and show that the usual final size formula 5 applies extension of our results to a multiple stage si n r model is straightfoward and similar to the way we generalized our results for the sir with arbitrary infectious period distribution to an si n r model with arbitrary stage duration distributions let i t be the distribution at time t of infectious individuals that have transmission rate  note that we assume implicitly that a given individual retains the same transmission rate throughout hisher infectious period and hence that this transmission rate is determined as soon as infection occurs let q be the probability that a newly infectious individual has transmission rate  thus the mean transmission rate is the rate of change of the proportion of the population that is susceptible i upon infection individuals leave the susceptible class s and enter the infectious class i a proportion q of them having a transmission rate  upon recovery they leave the infectious class at rate   thus in order to ensure that the model is well posed we must establish that if i 0  0 then i t  0 for all time suppose this is not true then there exists and t such that  0 i t d  0 i t  0 for t  t but i t  0 substituting these conditions into eq 21b we obtain t  0 but this contradicts the hypothesis that i t decreases from i 0  0 to i t  0 hence i t  0 for all t  0 we now check that the disease will always burn out in this model as expected which is strictly negative hence s  i tot is decreasing and bounded below by zero hence lim t d dt s  i tot   0 ie i tot   0 for the model specified by eqs 21 the basic reproduction number is in appendix bwe prove that the disease free equilibrium dfe is unstable if and only if r 0  1 to find the final size we divide by s on both sides of 21a and integrate substituting eq 21a in eq 21b we can writ integrating this we obtain since we have established that i   0 we can write substituting 25 into 24 and using 23 we obtain hence since the final size z  s0  s we have it is possible to generalize this theorem for an si n r model with arbitrarily distributed stage durations and arbitrarily distributed transmission rates in each stage we do not go through the details because no new ideas are required with theorems 71 and 81 in hand the extra effort required for the generalization is merely one of keeping track of notation in all of the models that we have discussed so far we have assumed that the population is homogeneously mixed in the remainder of this paper we explore the significance of heterogeneous mixing for the final size formula in the present section we identify an important class of spatially structured models for which the standard formula 5 remains valid a simple but important example of heterogenous mixing occurs if the population is divided into a number of spatially isolated patches eg cities often called a metapopulation hanski and gilpin 1997  in ecological models coupling among patches in a metapopulation usually occurs as a result of migration earn et al 2000b  in the present context inter-patch coupling occurs because individuals travel temporarily from their home patch to other patches on such journeys susceptible individuals might contact infectious individuals and become infected and infectious individuals might contact susceptibles and infect them if we restrict attention to a single infectious stage with exponentially distributed infectious period then the model is specified as follows here s i  i i  and r i i  1     n are the proportions of the population in patch i that are susceptible infectious recovered respectively summing eqs 26 we see that s i t  i i t  r i t  1 is invariant in all patches we denote by n i the number of individuals in patch i so the total population size is n  i n i  it is also convenient to use b   i j  to denote the n  n transmission matrix similar to our analysis of other models in previous sections it is straightforward to prove that s i  r i  i i  exist that s i   r i   1 and that i i   0 since  i j  0 the dominant eigenvalue  of b is real and positive horn and johnson 1985  if we linearize the model 26 at the disease free equilibrium dfe s i  1 i i  0 r i  0 we see that the stability of the dfe is determined by  if   1 then the dfe is unstable otherwise it is stable thus the threshold for exponential growth of cases an epidemic is determined by the value of r 0    which can be interpreted as the basic reproduction number van den driessche and watmough 2002  the final size in patch i is z i  s i 0  s i  we can obtain a system of n coupled algebraic equations for the z i if we divide by s i on both sides of eq 26a and integrate from 0 to  these algebraic equations contain  0 i i dt which can be eliminated by integrating eq 26c and noting that z i  r i   r i 0 in the limit i i 0  0 s i 0  1 we obtain these equations form a special case of a more general final size formula discussed by diekmann and heesterbeek 2000 exercises 617 and 619 in their solution to exercise 619 diekmann and heesterbeek 2000 sketch an argument that implies that if r 0  1 then there is a unique non-trivial ie non-zero solution to eqs 27 the final size for the whole metapopulation z is not in general the simple average of the z i s in eq 27 rather each z i must be weighted by the population size n i of patch i ie consequently there will always be particular values of the n i that make z in eq 28 equal to the solution of the standard formula 5 however since population sizes are given a priori the problem of interest is to find necessary and sufficient conditions on the transmission matrix b that ensure that the sum in eq 28 is equal to the final size obtained from the standard formula 5 regardless of the values of the n i  in eq 28 z will have no dependence on the patch population sizes if and and only if given this eq 27 implies ie the transmission rate is the same in all patches if on the other hand we start with eq 30 as an assumption then inserting eq 29 in eq 27 restricting attention to situations in which the transmission rate is the same in every patch may seem to be an extremely stringent constraint in fact this is often the situation of interest for example individuals who normally reside in boston philadelphia or new york can expect to contact similar numbers of people each day even though the new york metropolitan area has a population that is several times larger than the other two more generally if patches represent large cities in a given country then it is reasonable to expect that the number of contacts an individual has will not depend strongly on the size of the city given eq 30 we can write where p i j is the probability for an individual in patch i that a given contact is with an individual in patch j and  is the transmission rate the product of the number of contacts per unit time and the probability that a contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual leads to transmission note that since the rows of the matrix p are probability distributions it follows that n j1 p i j  1 i  1     n ie p is a stochastic matrix horn and johnson 1985  for convenience we make the mild assumption that p i j  0 for all i and j ie for any pair of patches there is a non-zero probability that residents of the two patches will come into contact it then follows that if the final size z is positive then the final size z i is strictly positive in every patch to see this note that if z i  0 for some i then eq 27  since p i j  0 implies  i j  0 eq 33 implies z j  0 for all j since p is a positive stochastic matrix its largest eigenvalue is 1 horn and johnson 1985  consequently the largest eigenvalue of b   p is  and the basic reproduction number is r 0     therefore we have theorem 91 consider the multi-patch sir epidemic model specified by eqs 26  suppose the transmission rate in each patch is the same ie n j1  i j   for each i then in the limit that the initial proportion of individuals that are infectious is small ie i i 0  0 for each i the final size z of an epidemic is given implicitly by eq 5 or explicitly by eq a2  where r 0     at this point it will come as no surprise that with some effort in keeping track of notation theorem 91 can be generalized to a multi-patch si n r model with arbitrarily distributed stage durations and arbitrarily distributed transmission rates  equations 26 which specify the spatially heterogeneous model we analyzed in the previous section can be interpretted as representing other types of social heterogeneities which are known to yield different final size formulae gart 1968 dwyer et al 2000 diekmann and heesterbeek 2000 andreasen 2003  in this section we briefly discuss two other interpretations which lead to a transmision matrix that is not proportional to a stochastic matrix and will not yield the usual final size formula 5 rather than specifying heterogeneities of transmission resulting from spatial structure as in the previous section suppose that heterogeneities arise from age-structured mixing patterns one possible formulation is to categorize the population by discrete age cohorts which is typically motivated by mixing patterns of children in schools if we consider a time-scale short enough that transfer from one cohort to the next can be ignored then the standard realistic agestructured model schenzle 1984 reduces to eqs 26  where the transmission matrix b now refers to contact patterns among different age cohorts as in the case of the spatial patch interpretation it might be reasonable to assume that there is a stochastic matrix p such that where the interpretation is that individuals in cohort i have a proportion p i j of their contacts with individuals in cohort j and  i is the transmission rate for individuals in cohort i unlike the spatial interpretation however it would be hard to justify taking  i to be the same for each i in particular young children tend to come into much closer contact with their classmates than teenagers or adults do with members of their cohorts as a result theorem 91 will not apply and the final size will not be given by the usual formula 5 in section 8 where we discussed super-spreaders we specifically excluded the types of super-spreaders that occur for sexually transmitted diseases namely individuals who always have a higher rate of contact with others regardless of whether they happen to be infected when such core groups yorke and hethcote 1984 anderson et al 1986 exist eqs 26 can still be used with the interpretation that the stratification of the population is by social group rather than spatial region or age cohort like the age-structured situation we can safely assume that eq 34 holds but not that  i is the same for every i as in eq 30 indeed a large difference in  i is precisely what defines the core groups again we have a situation where the usual final size formula will not apply core groups are well known to have a critical role in the transmission dynamics of sexually transmitted diseases so it is not surprising that they will affect the final size of epidemics the well-known formula 5 for the expected final size of an epidemic is valid in remarkably general circumstances previous work eg kermack and mckendrick 1927  anderson and watsons 1980  diekmann and heesterbeek 2000  established that the formula is valid in an sir model with an arbitrarily distributed infectious period theorem 61 here we have shown in addition that the standard formula 5 is invariant to the number of latent and infectious stages of disease theorem 71 the distributions of transmission rates within stages theorem 81 and even to common spatial contact heterogeneities theorem 91 the invariance of the final size formula has important practical implications typically the time at which one wishes to estimate the expected final size of an epidemic is long before enough information has been gathered to estimate the distributions of latent and infectious periods or other epidemiological details our theorems provide rigorous support for estimates of the expected magnitude of epidemics based solely on estimates of the basic reproduction number r 0  which is the only parameter that appears in the final size formula 5 it should be noted that the final size formula refers only to the ensemble average size of an epidemic for a disease with a given r 0  different stochastic realizations of the same process will lead to different final sizes and our analysis says nothing about the variance or higher moments of the final size distribution kurtz 1980 proved that in the limit that the population size goes to infinity the ensemble mean of the stochastic sir model with arbitrarily distributed infectious period converges to the solutions of the integro-differential equation model specified in our eqs 11 hence the standard final size formula gives the mean final size of the stochastic sir model however it is difficult to deduce the distribution of the final size and this remains an open problem for stochastic sir models with arbitrarily distributed infectious periods for stochastic seir models with gamma distributed latent and infectious periods anderson and watsons 1980 derived a normal approximation to the final size distribution that is valid in the limit of large population size if there is little variation in the length of the latent period and the infectious period is short the stochastic seir model can be approximated by a chain binomial model bailey 1975  which is a discrete time markov chain the time step for this chain is equal to the fixed-length latent period since the infectious period is presumed infinitesimal all contacts occur instantaneously at the end of the latent period for such models the only parameter is the probability q that a contact between an infectious individual and a susceptible individual leads to infection with the assumption that q  1  e r0  von bahr and martin-lof 1980 and scalia-tomba 1985 showed that final size distribution for the traditional chain binomial model is asymptotically normal in the limit of large population size scalia-tomba 1986 and andersson 1999 studied more general chain binomial models with heterogeneous contact structures equivalent to those we discussed in sections 9 and 10 and found asymptotic final size distributions their results imply that if q  1  e r0 then the ensemble mean final size in these chain binomial models is the solution of our eqs 27 we emphasized two circumstances under which the usual final size formula will not apply one was the case of age-structured heterogeneity of transmission while this would influence the final size it is unlikely that we would be able to parameterize the age-structured contact patterns sufficiently well to improve on the final size estimate generated with the assumption of homogeneous mixing the other case we discussed was the existence of social core groups which are extremely important in the epidemiological dynamics of sexually transmitted diseases in this case some estimate of the difference in transmission rates in different social groups would likely be needed to obtain a useful estimate of the final size in computing the final size we have always assumed that there are no temporal changes in the transmission rate  temporal variations in  could result from intrinsic seasonality of contact rates imposition of control measures or behavioral change in response to epidemic alerts small seasonal variations in  cause only small perturbations to the final size formula and substantial seasonality is generally associated with school-age children london and yorke 1973 who form a small fraction of the susceptible pool when a new infection enters a population infection control measures such as those adopted during the 2003 sars epidemic lipsitch et al 2003 wallinga and teunis 2004  could have a dramatic effect on the final size in this case rather than r 0  the reproduction number that is relevant for the final size formula must be calculated after sustainable precautionary measures have been put into place individual behavioral change could alter the transmission rate through time-dependence   t as in the case of imposed control measures or through density-dependence   i with  decreasing as i increases which would arise if people tend to be more careful when they are aware of more cases in either case the standard final size formula might yield a poor approximation of the true final size all of our analysis is predicated on the assumption that vital dynamics births and deaths and more generally any source of new susceptible individuals can be ignored this approximation is not valid in circumstances where infectious periods are substantial compared with life expectancy or where immunity decays rapidly it will however typically be relevant whenever a new respiratory pathogen emerges as in the case of the sars outbreak in 2003 donnelly et al 2003 or the emergence of a new subtype of influenza earn et al 2002  we are interested in growth or decay of i  which is determined only by eq d1b defining xt   0  i t d multiplying both sides of eq d1b by  and integrating with respect to  we find on the other hand recall that it   0 i t dt the total number of infectious individuals at time t therefore integrating eq b2b with respect to  noting that q is a probability density function so the origin of this system of two ordinary differential equations is locally stable if and only if  0 q d    0 or equivalently r 0  1 thus the dfe is stable if r 0  1 and unstable if r 0  1 we can expand model 21 to include multiple stages using the same techniques we find that the conclusion that the epidemic threshold is given by r 0  1 remains valid  evolving transmission network dynamics of covid-19 cluster infections in south korea a descriptive study yejin kim xiaoqian jiang  background extensive contact tracing and testing in south korea allows us to investigate the transmission dynamics of the covid-19 into diverse local communities objective understand the critical aspects of transmission dynamics in a different age sex and clusters with various activities methods we conducted a retrospective observational study with 3127 confirmed cases contact tracing data from the center for disease and prevention cdc of south korea we investigated network property concerning infected persons demographics and different infection clusters findings overall women had higher centrality scores than men after week four when the confirmed cases rapidly increased older adults have higher centrality than youngmiddle-aged adults after week 9 in the infection clusters youngmiddle-aged adults infection clusters such as religious gatherings and gym facilities have higher average path lengths and diameter than older adults nursing home infection clusters interpretation some women had higher reproduction numbers and bridged successive transmission than men when the confirmed cases rapidly increased similarly some older adults who were not residents of nursing homes had higher reproduction numbers and bridged successive transmission than youngmiddle-aged adults after the peak has passed the youngmiddle-aged adults religious gatherings and group workout have caused long successive transmissions in contrast the older adults nursing homes were a small world where the transmissions within a few steps can reach out to many persons research in context evidence before this study on may 1 2020 pubmed query covid-19 or sars-ncov-2 or novel coronavirus or ncov and transmission network or transmission dynamics or transmission pattern or centrality and cluster or community yield eight peer-reviewed papers these papers have provided an evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics via estimated reproduction number however most of them have focused on the entire system in one location and there was no comparison between transmission dynamics of different clusters added value of this study this study to the best of our knowledge is the first to compare the transmission dynamics of different cluster infections we present the transmission dynamic with varying levels of granularity entire country vs cluster infections as a longitudinal view from the whole country-level analysis we found that females have higher centrality degree or betweenness than males from the cluster infection view we found that youngmiddle-aged adults infection clusters such as religious gatherings and gym facilities have higher average path lengths and diameter than older adults nursing home infection clusters implications of all the available evidence this study sheds light on different transmission dynamics concerning demographics age and sex and diverse behavior in cluster infections these findings are essential for planning tailored policies to diverse communities our analysis code is publicly available to adapt to newly reported cases  amid the global pandemic on coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19  epidemiologists promote containment strategies to prevent community transmission1 contact tracing of susceptible persons and extensive testing in south korea demonstrated as an example of successful containment1 south korea reported the first confirmed cases on january 20 2020 and the instances spiked from february 20 to 29 202023 as of mid-march 2020 such containment strategies helped flatten the curve of new confirmed cases 2 the contact tracing and testing allow us to investigate different transmission dynamics into various local communities person-to-person transmissions can be represented as a transmission network and this network facilitates investigation of topological dynamics in disease transmission and detection of super-spreaders 4 5 also the transmission network can be divided into individual infection clusters that have different characteristics in terms of demographics and network topology the network analysis has been widely studied in various infectious diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome mers 4 5 several acute respiratory syndrome sars667 tuberculosis 8 9 and cholera10 some covid-19 studies have revealed evolving person-to-person transmission dynamics in china in a longitudinal view 11 12 a genomic mutation study has investigated country-to-country transmission dynamics on a global scale 13 a piece of critical missing knowledge is how person-to-person transmission differs across different demographics and also different super-spreading environments in cluster infections thus the objective of our study was to investigate network characteristics of person-to-person transmission in the different granularity entire country and individual cluster infections we provided interactive visualization in the code repository httpsgithubcomyejinjkimcovid19-transmission-network for an intuitive understanding of the evolving transmission network to the best of our knowledge our work is first to compare transmission dynamics in cluster-wise we conducted a retrospective observational study with contact tracing data from the center for disease controls and prevention cdc of south korea the south korea cdc actively performed testing monitoring and tracing contacts and disseminated the information to the public we collected the contact tracing data prepared in the data science for covid-19 project in south korea14 which enables researchers to access the data publicly this data contains demographics exposure type or travel history confirmedrelease date underlying disease deceased status this study used 3127 patients transmission data from january 20 2020 to april 7 2020 retrieved on april 8 2020 the evolving transmission network we built a longitudinal transmission network using the transmission data the transmission network consisted of nodes for the infected persons and directed edges from infectious nodes infector to infected nodes infectee the nodes and edges had timestamps at which the infectees infections are confirmed this longitudinal network evolved over time as accumulating all previous nodes and edges transmission network characteristics we presented network characteristics in terms of centrality and path lengths -centrality is a useful measure to investigate individual patients who shed the virus most ie superspreaders over time we analyzed network centrality with degree and betweenness node degree is the number of edges linked to the node in the network betweenness is the extent to which a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes15 nodes with high betweenness may have high control over transmission passing between nodes we used betweenness to measure how much a patient contributed to the transmission as intermediate hosts we defined a super-spreading person as a person with a degree  35 for degree or top 5 betweenness values16 note that the node degree was calculated based on all accumulated transmissions whereas the reproduction number is generally calculated within the observation period -path length can measure how far the transmission chain of successive cases can go the path length is the number of nodes or steps in the shortest path from a source node to a target node the average path length is the average value of the shortest path lengths between all pairs of nodes in the network the longest path length also known as diameter is the maximum amount of the shortest path length infection clusters we divided the transmission network into subgraphs with connected nodes ie the connected components the connected components are an extended concept of infection cluster as the connected components include all successive infected persons who are infected from the infection cluster for briefly we denoted the connected components as the infection cluster during the contact tracing it is expected that the index patient was unidentifiable in each infection cluster to represent links among the nodes in the same cluster with an unknown index patient we set a virtual index patient and we made edges from the virtual index patient to infected patients for each infection cluster the evolving transmission network from january 20 2020 to april 7 2020 we identified a total 1611 transmission from 3127 patients 727 person to person 884 persons in infection clusters with unknown index patient we presented demographic characteristics of patients and their transmission  fig1  table 1  when newly confirmed cases rapidly increase weeks 4 5 6 and after the recently confirmed cases decrease after peak week 10 note that the mass cluster infection occurred at week 4 with an outbreak in religious gathering in daegu 17 the demographic characteristics of patients and their transmission varied in different observation periods until week 4 the confirmed positive cases were at a low level male to female ratio was similar 53 male 47 female after week 4 south korea reported more female cases than male ones also female-to-female transmissions were more frequent than male-to-male transmissions but there was no statistical power as chi-squared value of the contingency table136 p-value02430 throughout all observations the largest age group was age 25-49 although there was no reported transmission among similar aged children and adolescents presumably due to strict school closure this young age group sometimes infected their middle-aged parents in week 6 south korea reported an increased number of new confirmed cases from older adults and the transmissions occurred mostly among the older adults we also presented the network property of the transmission network the transmission network had a mean degree of 188 after aggregating all time windows the system was getting sparse as new confirmed cases exponentially increased with unknown transmission paths complete network visualization in supplement 1 the centrality of individual patients we further investigated the distribution of the network centrality concerning infected persons sex and race animated plot in supplement 2 we computed the statistical significance on the difference of centrality distribution using the mann-whitney-u test 18 as a result we found that women have higher centrality scores than men as the confirmed cases exponentially increase around week 5 to 6 fig 3  during the first four weeks after the first case the number of instances slowly increased and men tend to have higher degrees and betweenness women however started to have higher degrees and betweenness after week 5 we used the mann-whitney-u for hypothesis testing on whether super-spreading women have higher centrality values than super-spreading men the p-values were statistically significant after week 6 for degree p-value00156 and week 11 for betweenness p-value00402 we found that older adults have higher centrality than youngmiddle-aged adults after the peak has passed around week 9 fig 3  after week 9 more older adults had higher degree and betweenness values than youngmiddle-aged adults we used the mann-whitney-u for hypothesis testing on whether the super-spreading older adults have higher centrality than super-spreading young adults the p-values were statistically significant after week 9 for degree p-value00413 note that there was a time lag between degree and betweenness as the betweenness increases after successive transmission occurs  there were a total of 147 clusters defined as connected components and we selected 12 clusters that have at least 20 patients involved these clusters turned out to be related to religious gatherings gym facilities nursing homes and customer call center office table 3  fig 4  the clusters network visualization is available at supplement1 overall the top four largest clusters were related to guro customer call center shincheonji church river of grace community church and gym facilities in cheonan a common characteristic of the four largest clusters was that they all had higher women rates 72 55 60 and 72 respectively clusters with the smallest path lengths were all related to nursing homes gunpo nursing home cheongdo daenam hospital psychiatric ward and bongwha nursing home clusters with the most considerable path length were related to gym facilities in cheonan and shincheonji church we observed that similar activities share similar path lengths three nursing homes had the path length of 191-194 four churches had the path length of 242-294 all rights reserved no reuse

this version posted may 12 2020   the objective of this study was to provide the evolving transmission dynamics of covid-19 in south korea we investigated network property and demographic features from the whole transmission network and also clustered level the demographics of newly confirmed patients and their transmission provided an overview of how various demographic groups contribute to transmission the main observation includes i in early days until week four most confirmed positives were imported cases who were male in their 40s ii women were more than 50 of newly confirmed cases after week 4 iii there were more female-to-female transmissions than male-to-male transmissions iv children and adolescents infected their parents and v older adults infected other older adults further investigation is needed to obtain statistical power we expect these observations can provide situational awareness to future contact tracing efforts the network characteristics of the entire system found the transmission networks density and successive transmission lengths evolved over time the transmission network was getting sparse as the number of newly confirmed cases rapidly increased the sparsity limitation was inherited from the contact tracing containing the increasing number of unknown transmission paths in local communities thus our estimate on network property degree betweenness diameter and path length should be interpreted as a lower bound the main finding from network centrality analysis was that women had higher centrality in both degree and betweenness than men had as the instances rapidly increased this implies not only that womens reproduction number was larger than mens but also that some women bridged the long successive transmissions a possible explanation might be that men are more likely to die or critically ill than women and consequently men have less opportunity to shed the virus 19 note that the higher portion of confirmed cases does not necessarily cause higher centrality the second finding is that older adults had high centrality after the peak has passed around week 9 note that these older adults with high reproduction numbers were not related to nursing homes older adults are more vulnerable to critical illness20 based on our findings they were not active super-spreaders in the early days still after the virus propagated into local communities the older adults were more likely to be infected by the virus and be superspreaders a breakdown into smaller infection clusters allowed us to find common network characteristics within similar activities there were three major types of clusters religious gatherings gym facilities and nursing homes the religious gathering and gym facilities clusters had high path length and diameter these clusters mainly consisted of youngmiddle-aged adults this observation may imply that the active behavior eg physically close gatherings in church active group workout in closed facilities of youngmiddle-aged adults can spread further away to other communities thus restricting trips to other cities would be an adequate policy to prevent the spread effectively in contrast the nursing home type clusters consist of older adults with low path lengths and low diameter each nursing home cluster grew fast with relatively short path length implying that the clusters might have a small-world property that spread the virus rapidly as the majority of nodes were reachable in a small number of steps among the three nursing homes cheongdo daenam hospital psychiatric ward had the highest fatality 3182 this closed psychiatric ward has many long-term patients with underlying diseases 17 apart from the above local community infections imported cases were also consistently increasing during all observation periods the mean age of the imported patients was 42 years old at week two and consistently decreased to 356 years old until week 11 men took more than 50 of the imported cases for all observation periods from 71 to 59 at week two and week 11 this studys limitation mainly comes from the sample bias in contact tracing data the contact tracing of the rapidly evolving infectious disease inevitably contains case ascertainment biases non-homogenous sampling over time and location and uncontrolled correlation11 a substantial number of cases were missing officially confirmed cases from korea cdc was more than 8000 as of april each local province government performs and reports the contact tracing but the difficulty of the instances or granularity of reporting varies from each local government for example the import cases were more likely to be tracked well but the mass infection cluster in shincheonji church has not been carefully investigated despite the limitations our descriptive study can provide an overview of evolving transmission dynamics in the country and infection clusters for the rapidly emerging infectious disease our findings suggest a different level of reproduction and successive transmission chain over sex age and cluster activities our analysis code is publicly available to adapt to newly reported cases all rights

popescu   the emergence of a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 causing the disease covid-19 in wuhan china in late 2019 is currently testing international public health and preparedness efforts as the cases of covid-19 surge past 100 000 and over 1600 have been identified in the united states the question of capacity and preparedness comes into play one arm of response lies within health care when responding to infectious disease threats hospitals lean heavily on the expertise and guidance of their infection prevention and control ipc programs which comprise infection preventionists with backgrounds in nursing epidemiology and microbiology its not surprising that ipc would lead such efforts as it is the intersection of health care and public health during the 2014 dallas ebola cluster readiness efforts were led by primarily ipc and consumed 80 of their time and 70 of daily infection prevention duties were not completed during this time1 these ipc outbreak efforts include education reinforcement of infection prevention standards like isolation and proper usage of personal protective equipment ppe and established processes to ensure that the i3 strategy identify isolate and inform is used and that the health care facilities meet the guidance of the centers for disease control and prevention and world health organization these strategies are in addition to daily surveillance and reporting requirements among other duties ipc efforts have proven critical in previous coronavirus outbreaks because hospitals can easily act as amplifiers for disease in 2003 the outbreak of sars-cov in toronto shed light on the ability for hospital transmission to fuel an outbreak in canada alone 43 of the cases were health care workers and in phase ii of the outbreak and of the cases in toronto 72 were a result of nosocomial transmission2-4 in fact health care transmission rose from 17 in phase i to 88 in phase ii of the outbreak despite quarantine efforts put into place the implementation of enhanced infection prevention measures is widely considered to have been the most effective in halting sars-cov transmission the relaxation of these efforts following phase i of the outbreak resulted in the high rate of nosocomial transmission and the second phase of the outbreak the mers-cov outbreak in south korea is also a lesson in ipc efforts during coronavirus outbreaks of the 186 cases identified in 2015 roughly 9199 are believed to be from health care transmission56 83 of the mers-cov transmission events were a result of 5 super-spreaders this particular outbreak is relevant in that it was largely in part due to several factors overcrowded emergency departments delays in isolation infection prevention failures utilization of familyvisitors in the care process multiple patients per hospital room and hospital or doctor shopping prior to a diagnosis the index case-patient had contact with 600 people across 4 health care facilities the outbreak is particularly unique in that not only did intrahospital infections occur but also hospital-to-hospital which involved 17 hospitals but ultimately originated from 178 the role of super-spreaders and a health care system using multiple patients per room coupled with infection prevention failures is a situation ripe with potential for an explosive outbreak prolonged waiting times in crowded emergency rooms with no isolation can also heavily contribute to the spread of respiratory infections like coronavirus these historical outbreaks of mers-cov and sars-cov underscore the role of hospitals in disease transmission and the impact of infection prevention failures a recent analysis of 138 patients hospitalized with covid-19 in wuhan china has reiterated these critical lessons in outbreak response9 of the 138 patients hospitalized 26 required admission to the intensive care unit which increases length of stay and is often more resource intensive in terms of health care working staffing and supplies one particularly concerning finding was that 41 of the hospitalized patients studied were believed to have acquired the disease through human-to-human transmission as a result of hospital exposures this volume of health-care-associated cases is not wholly unexpected based off of previous coronavirus outbreaks but deeply worrisome in that again it highlights the potential for hospitals to amplify disease transmission in response to these findings and the international efforts to stop the spread of the disease across dozens of countries infection prevention efforts must be prioritized hospitals are the front line for infectious disease response and their ability to identify isolate and inform public health of potential cases is vital to halt transmission reinforcing and investing in ipc efforts within hospitals in the united states and globally must happen to combat the outbreak unfortunately to truly use ipc programs for covid-19 response it is important to understand why health-care-associated outbreaks and infection prevention failures occur all too often like most public health efforts attention and resources tend to flood ipc programs during emergent times the more underlying and systemic issue though is that ipc programs are fighting several roadblocks to better strengthen their hospitals preparedness for infectious disease threats first these programs are notoriously understaffed a 2018 study by infection preventionists barles et al found that when staffing needs were reviewed an effective ipc program needed 10 full-time employed infection preventionist for every 69 beds10 unfortunately average staffing tends to be at 1 infection preventionist for a minimum of 80100 beds more important though those ipc efforts tend to be focused on those health-care-associated infection surveillance and reporting requirements that are linked to mandated reporting and medicare reimbursement a 20132014 study found that these mandated reporting burdens consumed 5 hours a day for infection preventionists11 when put in the context of taking time away from mandated reporting and reimbursement-associated infections its not surprising that hospital administrators would prioritize those efforts over infectious disease events that are often perceived as unlikely a 2018 report by the office inspector general of the us department of health and human services assessed hospital readiness to emerging infectious disease threats following the 20132016 ebola outbreak12 the surveyed hospital administrators reported a higher level of preparedness but noted that emergency preparedness personnel often lacked the specialized knowledge required for infectious disease threats moreover administrators noted that it was difficult to integrate procedures specific to emerging infectious diseases specifically ipc into emergency plans and that responding to such events was out of the comfort zone for emergency preparedness coordinators researchers found that although a majority of hospital administrators felt more prepared there were competing priorities to maintaining preparedness and the likelihood of an event was small 82 of these administrators cited competing priorities for funding and other resources and 95 reported that competing priorities eg increasing focus on active shooter threats andor desire to not focus on singular threats reduced the focus on emerging infectious diseases meaning that not sustaining infectious disease preparedness is a deliberate choice being made by hospital administrators because a majority of ebola preparedness was overseen by the ipc program and infection preventionists the decision to not invest in infectious disease preparedness can also be seen as a decision to not invest in the public good that is ipc furthermore only one-third of respondents could report which tier their hospital fell into in the 2015-established special pathogens tiered hospital framework13
 as hospitals in the united states struggle with shortages of ppe and work to prepare for potential cases of covid-19 it is critical that such efforts not only include ipc but also seek to invest in biopreparedness infection prevention is at the very nexus of biopreparedness in health care and yet the united states has continuously under-resourced and underused this critical resource this outbreak should be seen as an opportunity to reinforce hospital preparedness through not only staffing resources and surge capacity but also ipc efforts in the future when we evaluate our response to covid-19 and look to invest in infectious disease readiness and health care preparedness it is critical that we do not neglect the role of infection prevention programs and the value they bring to biodefense ipc programs are at the nexus of public health and health care acting as sentinels for infectious disease threats and a source for tacit knowledge recognizing their potential and investing in their utilization serve to combat poor investment in biopreparedness across the health care industry while enhancing us health security  geographical tracking and mapping of coronavirus disease

the disease within hubei compared to the 20022003 sars-cov and the 20122014 mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus the covid-19 coronavirus spread strikingly fast while mers took about two and a half years to infect 1000 people and sars took roughly 4 months the novel sars-cov-2 reached that figure in just 48 days on 30 january 2020 the world health organization who declared that the new sars-cov-2 coronavirus outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern pheic 2 as with the original sars-cov epidemic of 20022003 3 and with seasonal influenza 4 5 geographic information systems gis and methods including among other application possibilities online real- or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread predictive risk mapping using population travel data and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time see as an example the first diagram in 6 are proving indispensable for our timely understanding of the new disease source dynamics and epidemiology and in shaping our effective response to it indeed health professionals have long considered conventional mapping and more recently geographic information systems gis as critical tools in tracking and combating contagion the earliest map visualisation of the relationship between place and health was in 1694 on plague containment in italy 7 the value of maps as a communication tool blossomed over the next 225 years in the service of understanding and tracking infectious diseases such as yellow fever cholera and the 1918 influenza pandemic from the 1960s when computerised geographic information systems were born the possibilities for analysing visualising and detecting patterns of disease dramatically increased again a 2014 review of the health gis literature found that 248 out of 865 included papers 287 focused on infectious disease mapping 8 since then we have seen a revolution in applied health geography through web-based tools 9 10 now as we deploy these tools to protect human lives we can ingest big data from their sources and display results in interactive and near-real-time dashboards these online dashboards have become a pivotal source of information during the covid-19 outbreak this paper offers pointers to and describes a range of practical onlinemobile gis and mapping dashboards and applications for tracking the coronavirus epidemic and associated events as they unfold around the world some of these dashboards and applications are receiving data updates in near-real-time at the time of writing and one of them is meant for individual users in china to check if the app user has had any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with sars-cov-2 in the recent past we also briefly discuss additional ways gis can support the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics when disease can travel so quickly information has to move even faster this is where map-based dashboards become crucial 11 at the time of this writing in mid-february 2020 seven coronavirus dashboards are among the top ten requested applications from esri arcgis online service accumulating over 160 million views first published on 22 january 2020 in response to escalating pandemic fears in late january 2020 the johns hopkins universitys center for systems science and engineering jhu csse dashboard leads the pack garnering 140 million views developed by lauren gardner an epidemiologist and her team from the jhu csse the dashboard went viral with hundreds of news articles and shares on social media fig 1 12 this intense response to the jhu csse and other dashboards shows how eager people are to track health threats anyone with internet access can learn in a few short clicks a tremendous amount of information about the covid-19 virus from these resources the jhu csse dashboards interactive map locates and tallies confirmed infections fatalities and recoveries graphs detail virus progress over time viewers can see the day and time of the most recent data update and data sources the dashboards five authoritative data sources include world health organization who us centers for disease control and prevention national health commission of the peoples republic of china european centre for disease prevention and control and the chinese online medical resource dxycn the dashboard provides links to these sources and others a blog post 13 details this work the corresponding data repository is accessible as google sheets in github 14 web services allow gis users to consume and display disparate data inputs without central hosting or processing to ease data sharing and speed information aggregation in the first dashboard iteration from january 22 through january 31 2020 the hopkins team manually updated data twice per day in february 2020 esris arcgis living atlas team assisted them in adopting a semi-automated living data stream strategy to update the dashboard it primarily relies on the dxycn data resource which updates every 15 min for case reports at provincial and country levels however lauren gardners blog 13 notes that for countries outside of china other data resources were quicker to update than dxycn so those case counts are manually updated throughout the day current feature layers are freely accessible in the arcgis living atlas 15 yet the covid-19 outbreak has been difficult to monitor as gardner explains it is especially challenging to collect good data at a fine spatial resolution which is what most people want to know and without having travel data in real time that captures these altered mobility patterns it is hard to assess what the geographic risk profile will look like moving forward 16 the jhu csse dashboard at the time of writing lacks archiving services for full retrospective map visualisation of data from previous days as far as the latter are concerned the dashboard only offers timeline charts of total confirmed cases grouped into mainland china and other locations and total recovered cases but one is unable to retrieve and display detailed map snapshots in time by individual countryregion and chinese province eg to see how the coronavirus world distribution map looked in the past on a specific day such as 25 january 2020 the dashboard developers are encouraged to compile and make such interactive daily map snapshots permanently accessible online for future reference after the epidemic has gone as a service to public health researchers and professionals worldwide the who directs and coordinates international health combating communicable diseases through surveillance preparedness and response and applying gis technology to this work on 26 january 2020 the who unveiled its arcgis operations dashboard for covid-19 which also maps and lists coronavirus cases and total number of deaths by country and chinese province with informational panels about the map and its data resources fig 2 17 prior to 18 february 2020 the who and jhu csse dashboards had some interesting differences each had a vastly different total case count as can be seen in figs 1 and 2 both taken on 16 february 2020 the who dashboard reflected laboratory-confirmed cases whereas jhu csse included cases diagnosed using a symptom array plus chest imaging accounting for some 18000 additional reports however as of 19 february 2020 both dashboards are in sync displaying similar total case counts the who dashboard includes an epidemic curve up front showing cases by date of reporting putting the epi curve visualisation above the cumulative cases graph provides important information about outbreak progression and may decrease fear since we can see a steady decline in the total number of new cases per day since 4 february 2020 except for a spike on 13 february 2020 when more than 15 k cases were added after china started to include clinically diagnosed cases and not just laboratory-confirmed cases in its figures a hamburger menu at the top right corner of the who dashboard provides links to additional information about covid-19 and leads to an interactive web map that puts covid-19 into context among other who-monitored health emergencies such as dengue fever rift valley fever and west nile fever 18 the who is updating its covid-19 dashboard automatically using arcgis geoevent server to push updates to a single feature service multiple times per day the who dashboard optimisation measures include moving tiled data off its server and into arcgis online tiled services to benefit from esris content delivery network this allows good map performance at 1012 levels of zoom both the who and jhu csse dashboards consider the importance of mobile devices among dashboards built with esris arcgis operations dashboard app nearly 8 of viewers choose those built for mobile consumption consistent with how people want to receive information mobile-optimised dashboards are versatile and accessible on phones or tablets founded in 2006 healthmap is run by a team of researchers epidemiologists and software developers at boston childrens hospital usa and uses online media sources for real-time surveillance of emerging public health threats healthmap collates outbreak data from a range of sources including news media eg via google news social media validated official alerts eg from the who and expert-curated accounts 19 healthmaps interactive map for sars-cov-2 available at 20 offers near-real-time geolocated updates from these sources to better understand the progression of the pandemic fig 3 in the same vein as healthmap bluedot a canadian firm specialising in automated infectious disease surveillance 21 uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques to sift through news reports in 65 languages forum and blog posts airline ticketing data animal disease networks etc to pick up indications and news of unusual unfolding events and possible disease outbreaks the firm employs trained epidemiologists to further analyse outbreak results obtained by automated means before releasing them to its clients and is said to have been among the earliest to break news of covid-19 outbreak as it started in china healthmap also offers an outbreaks near me feature that informs individual users about nearby disease transmission risks based on their current location as obtained from their web browsersmartphone fig 4 while government travel restrictions initiate social distancing it is now possible for individuals to further the cause by using a dedicated app that provides a detailed spatial scale to support informed personal decisions about self-quarantine and seeking medical treatment co-launched by chinas national health commission and china electronics technology group corporation the close contact detector appplatform uses big data from public authorities about the movement of people public transport data covering flights and trains booking a train seat in china requires the input of id information as well as disease case records to check if the user has had any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected in the recent past fig 5 the platform can inform the user based on herhis location and recent movements whether she has within the last 2 weeks the assumed incubation period of covid-19 worked together shared a classroom lived in the same building or travelled by train all passengers and crew members in the same carriage or plane cabin staff and passengers within three rows of an infected person with a person confirmed or suspected to have the virus close contact detector can be accessed via three of the most popular mobile social and payment apps in china namely alipay wechat and qq 22 the platform might raise some location data privacy questions among some audiences even though it explicitly asks its users to observe chinas cybersecurity laws and not abuse private information and has been very well received by the public in china as explained by carolyn bigg a hong kong-based technology lawyer at the law firm dla piper in a comment to the bbc in china and across asia individual data are not seen as something to be locked down but as something that can be used provided this is done in a transparent way with consent where needed from a chinese perspective this is a really useful service for people and a really powerful tool that shows the power of data being used for good 22 a related and complementary voluntary system was implemented in guangzhou underground guangdong province china so that if a person is later diagnosed with coronavirus it would be easier to track herhis transport routines and notify related passengers who boarded the same metro carriages starting on 17 february 2020 every metro carriage in guangzhou underground displays a unique qr code that passengers are invited to scan once they board the carriage they then need to quickly fill in an online form that appears on their phone which includes name id no optional gender their starting metro station and their destination station as each carriage has a unique qr code if the passenger walks into another carriage during transportation she will have to scan the new qr code of that carriage and auto fill in the corresponding form again if the passengers journey involves changing to other metro lines to reach their final destination then she will have to repeat the same process for every additional carriage they board fig 6 human mobility places scientists at a serious disadvantage in slowing potential epidemics a person can pick up a virus in one place and share it to another location within hours among the jet set there is potential to become a super spreader 23 infecting many people across an expansive geographical area while vaccine technology has advanced significantly it still takes a year or more to formulate a vaccinetime enough for the virus to reach every corner of the world the last trains and scheduled domestic and international flights left wuhan the morning of 23 january 2020 putting an end to a surge of outbound chinese lunar new year travel that had started 3 days earlier fig 7 the who commended the move by chinese authorities to place wuhan under quarantine which was unprecedented at scale by the end of january 2020 chinese authorities had enforced further transportation restrictions in 15 additional cities the worldpop research group at southampton university uk used historical data and patterns from baidus location services and international flight itineraries to better understand population movements out of wuhan prior to the citys lockdown look at travellers volumes and destinations across china and the world and compile a predictive global risk map for the likely spread of sars-cov-2 virus from its epicentre in wuhan according to worldpops analysis within mainland china the cities of beijing guangzhou shanghai and chongqing are all identified as high-risk while the most at-risk places worldwide are thailand 1st japan 2nd and hong kong 3rd followed by the usa 6th australia 10th and the uk 17th detailed results and maps can be accessed on the worldpop online portal 24 it is noteworthy that worldpop also mapped population distributions and mobility patterns mobile phone flow maps using mobile telecom data in west african countries to support efforts in controlling the 2014 ebola virus outbreak 25 spatial analysis methods are indeed powerful for modelling disease spread detecting patterns and statistically significant hotspots and predicting what will happen next 26 similar work has been conducted at northeastern university boston massachusetts usa to develop predictive models of the covid-19 epidemic using epirisk a tool that estimates the probability that infected individuals will spread the disease to other parts of the world via air travel epirisk also tracks the effectiveness of travel bans and is part of the gleam global epidemic and mobility model project see their interactive map of covid-19 at 27 during infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics social media play an important role in communicating verified facts and correct prevention tips to the masses but also carry the risk of virally spreading misinformation confusion and fear among the general public 28 29 in the case of covid-19 false or misleading information such as eating sesame oil or garlic can help prevent and cure coronavirus and a decade-old map showing global air travel 30 rumours and panic have been spreading globally on social media much faster than the virus to partially illustrate this phenomenon twitter user mehdi moussad mehdimoussaid a research scientist at max planck institute for human development berlin germany published an animated map of the world on his account showing the worldwide propagation of the hashtagcoronavirus on twitter in green and the actual cases of coronavirus in red between 24 and 31 january 2020 fig 8 31 of course not all tweets and retweets with the hashtag coronavirus are spreading misinformation and many of them originate from legitimate bodies and organisations such as the who but the map serves as a good illustration of the viral nature of twitter and other social media a more detailed map set covering other coronavirus hashtags and classifying tweets by their truthfulness before mapping them could offer valuable insights and guidance for social media companies and health organisations worldwide in their fight against misinformation in fact it has been said that the who is fighting a parallel pandemic or infodemic of misinformation besides covid-19 32 the who has joined forces with social media giants such as facebook twitter youtube google and pinterest to combat the spread of misinformation around coronavirus for example pinterest and youtube users can now at the time of writing this article see a link prominently displayed that points to an official who page about covid-19 whenever they search for or browsewatch material about coronavirus on these platforms john snow 18131858 was able to trace the source of a cholera outbreak in soho london in 1854 thanks to his well-known manual spatial analysis exercise using hand-drawn paper maps of cholera cases and water pumpswater companies supplying them with water today more advanced computerised spatial analyses integrating phyloepidemiological methods are used to identify the likely sources of new outbreaks eg see the map and discussion of the likely source of sars-cov-2 in 34 an important factor affecting epidemics such as covid-19 is the calendar during the ebola and mers scares of 2014 many people considered cancelling their participation in the hajj pilgrimage to mecca made by over two million muslims every year equipped with days-old data and rumours many faithful proceeded with their pilgrimage putting themselves at risk of contracting potentially deadly viruses and further spreading disease when they returned home in the coronavirus outbreak chinese new year celebrations posed a threat as the themes of togetherness and reunion trigger the largest human migration in the world the chinese government extended the lunar new year holiday to reduce mass gatherings that were to happen upon return to work and schools a public health intervention called social distancing travellers worldwide were subsequently restricted from entering china with access to current information authorities in beijing macao and hong kong cancelled many major festivities dashboards and web maps that bring together location and time-sensitive events in relationship to a spreading disease give travellers and officials the potential to reduce exposure facing treatment facility shortages in wuhan government officials commissioned in late january the emergency construction of two new hospitals which together provide an additional 2600 beds construction teams finished the first hospital on 2 february 2020 just 10 days after breaking ground 35 the second facility received its first patients on 6 february 2020 site selection whether for emergency treatment units or permanent infrastructure is a common and high-value application of gis technology during public health emergencies of international concern we often see shortages of medicines and supplies shortages can have significant consequences such as hoarding and price gauging by suppliers or distributors sometimes the impacted places are also manufacturing centres for the supplies leading to a production decline digital supply chain maps prove foundational to planning and ensuring geographical diversity in suppliers as well as aligning needs with distribution residents of affected areas can use publicly available applications to locate crucial aid and resources apps and maps can display information and navigation to hospitals with available beds clinics offering medical aid along with current wait times grocery stores and pharmacies that are open places to purchase personal protective equipment and more in heavily impacted cities this information could critically improve outcomes and save lives in china unmanned aerial vehicles uav are transporting crucial medical supplies and patient lab samples in highly impacted areas drones reduce human contact with lab samples and free up ground transport assets and personnel 36 drones are also being used for broad disinfectant operations in china 37 integrated drone and gis technologies can help target and speed efforts in places they are needed most modern gis technologies centre around web-based tools improved data sharing and real-time information to support critical decision-making dashboards exemplify those ideals and have been extremely popular in sharing and understanding the spread of sars-cov-2 coronavirus communication through map-based dashboards offers accessible information to people around the world eager to protect themselves and their communities this tool type improves data transparency and helps authorities disseminate information certainly dashboards have taken centre stage in covid-19 outbreak awareness but we hope that readers consider how a comprehensive gis platform can support the entire process of infectious disease surveillance preparedness and response because as one epidemiologist put it outbreaks like this should be expected to happen more frequently moving forward 16 in other words it is not a question of if another outbreak will occur but when and where viruses like sars-cov-2 know no country or continent boundaries  healthcare worker exposure to middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov revision of screening strategies urgently needed hala amer abdulrahman alqahtani s faisal alaklobi juhaina altayeb ziad memish a   the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is a pathogen of zoonotic reservoir that has caused many outbreaks in healthcare settings involving many healthcare workers hcws alfaraj et al 2018a memish and al-tawfiq 2014 as of february 2018 a total of 2143 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with mers-cov including 750 deaths had been reported globally from 27 countries including 12 countries of the middle east anon 2018 emergency departments have been highlighted as the initial site of the spread of this virus in most of the recent outbreaks ghazal et al 2017 assiri et al 2013 balkhy et al 2016 a recent mers-cov outbreak occurred at king saud medical city ksmc concurrent with outbreaks at two other hospitals in the riyadh region in june 2017 amer et al 2018 this study was performed to better understand the best strategies to handle exposed hcws the risk of transmission of mers-cov infection to hcws in this outbreak was assessed and all available literature reviewed in an attempt to improve future preventive and post-exposure management interventions a descriptive report on exposure criteria and screening results of hcws acquiring mers-cov infection during the june 2017 outbreak at ksmc was produced real-time pcr rt-pcr of nasopharyngeal samples was used to test the traced contacts for mers-cov all hcws with unprotected exposure to confirmed cases were tested after 24 h of exposure two negative results for mers-cov obtained 3 days apart and being free of any suggestive signs and symptoms were used to stop their isolation and allow them to return to active duty further retesting depended on being symptomatic within the 14-day post-exposure monitoring period data were collected as part of the post-exposure management process considering the super-spreading phenomenon of some of the reported positive mers-cov cases during the ksmc outbreak and because some of the cases had been intubated in a multi-bed room before being suspected and isolated the tracing of contacts was very inclusive and included all persons who had been in attendance in the same area where the patient had stayed a total of 1055 subjects were traced at the time 879 hcws and 176 patients hcws who had experienced high-risk unprotected exposure or had performed or attended aerosol-generating procedures even if protected were swabbed twice while those who had experienced unprotected low-risk exposure and protected hcws not attending aerosol-generating procedures were swabbed once a total of 2000 swabs were collected during the outbreak period overall 17 hcws tested positive for mers-cov linked to four index cases the first two index cases were super-spreaders with the first case infecting nine exposed hcws and the second index case infecting six exposed hcws the third and fourth index cases infected one hcw each two of the nine affected hcws related to the first index case are not included in this report table 1
 the activities undertaken by the infected hcws ranged from mild exposure eg exposure during routine nursing care being in the same clinical area or just having a simple peer conversation to more high-risk exposure eg intubation and connecting infected patients on bilevel positive airway pressure bipap of all the positive hcw contacts 40 615 hcws tested positive on the first sampling 53 815 tested positive on the second sampling and only one hcw tested positive on the third sampling fortunately none of the positive mers-cov hcws had severe disease 53 were asymptomatic and 46 had mild symptoms the presence or absence of symptoms was found to be unrelated to the infected hcws cycle threshold ct value among the 15 positive hcws the time to negative results ranged between 4 and 47 days average 145 days and the infected hcws needed on average two samples for clearance over the last 5 years since the virus emerged in september 2012 it has been found that the incubation period for mers-cov cases in whom exposure is known is between 55 and 65 days and evidence suggests that the incubation period could be as long as 14 days the infection control community continues to be challenged by the lack of updated evidence-based infection control guidelines for handling hcws in contact with cases positive for mers-cov some of the key questions include 1 which of the exposed hcws are at risk of acquiring mers-cov and need to be tested 2 what exposure justifies testing 3 should asymptomatic contacts be screened 4 are asymptomatic positive hcws infectious 5 how many samples need to be taken for confirmation of positivity and clearance and how many days apart 6 how long should hcws be quarantined and when is it safe for them to return to active duty although many reports of hospital outbreaks have been published to date very few have discussed these key infection control questions in any detail this is why national and international guidance on managing exposed hcws has been inconsistent and sometimes confusing to the professional infection control community the latest available guidance from the saudi ministry of health published in 2017 still discourages the testing of asymptomatic hcws and allows only one sample from hcws who have had high-risk exposure to be cleared command and control center ministry of health kingdom of saudi arabia scientific advisory board 2017 similarly the latest us centers for disease control and prevention guidance published in 2015 discourages the testing of asymptomatic contacts cdc 2015 the world health organization who as always has the most comprehensive guidance which is balanced evidence-based considers the different levels of healthcare infrastructure and most importantly is built on the consensus of expert opinion leaders from the six who regions in their interim guidance released in june 2015 the who makes recommendations for inclusive testing in clustersoutbreaks associated with healthcare settings if feasible all contacts of laboratory confirmed cases especially hcw contacts and inpatients sharing roomswards with confirmed cases regardless of the development of symptoms should be tested for mers-cov using pcr who 2018a in 2015 the who also provided guidance on the management of asymptomatic persons who were pcr-positive and in january 2018 published updated recommendations who 2018b who 2018c in both documents the who states until more is known asymptomatic rt-pcr positive persons should be isolated followed up daily for symptoms and tested at least weekly  or earlier if symptoms develop  for mers-cov until a first negative test and then every 2448 hours releasing positive contacts only after 2 negative pcr results 24 hrs apart home versus hospital isolation of rt-pcr-positive persons depends on isolation bed capacity the ability to monitor persons daily outside a healthcare setting and the overall social conditions of the household and its occupants unfortunately due to the lack of scientific evidence at the time of guideline development the same who guidance documents give member states the conditional permission to return their asymptomatic pcr-positive hcws to active duty if there are a significant number of asymptomatic rt-pcr-positive hcws and concerns exist about keeping the healthcare system functioning for all patients during an outbreak clearance is bound by the following conditions which are almost impossible to comply with and monitor in a healthcare facility with an ongoing mers-cov outbreak there should be good infection control infrastructure in the facility hcws should not work in areas with patients at risk of mers-cov infection complications and all positive hcws should be monitored by repeat pcr testing for virus clearance and for compliance with good infection control practices including wearing masks when within 1 meter of others hcws or patients this component of the guidance needs to be revised based on the recent evidence showing possible transmission from asymptomatic pcr-positive hcws which could put patients and other hcws at unnecessary risk if the conditions mentioned in the who document are not strictly applied and monitored alfaraj et al 2018b a recently published report from another hospital outbreak in riyadh involving 153 hcw contacts with seven 45 hcws testing positive for mers-cov looked critically at the ideal infection control practices in handling hcws in contact with positive cases alfaraj et al 2018b the findings of that report are consistent with those of the present study confirming the lack of relevance regarding the extent of exposure or presence or absence of symptoms among hcw contacts of confirmed mers-cov cases alfaraj et al 2018b both reports highlight the difficulties in ruling out positive hcws from the first sample and stress the need for repeat sampling to confirm positivity and negativity this report corroborates what has been published previously and calls for an urgent review and update of the available local and international guidance on handling hcws in contact with mers-cov-positive cases and encourages critical monitoring of future outbreaks to answer any remaining infection control queries five years after the emergence of the disease significant new knowledge has been gained but some gaps and challenges remain including the definite source of infection and the exact routes of direct or indirect exposure how to predict super-spreaders clear guidance on handling exposed hcws who can act as disease carriers spreading the disease to others and finally how to detect cases early in the emergency room with the development of rapid easy-to-use highly sensitive and specific point-of-care testing in an effort to prevent any unnecessary risky exposure of hcws and possibly compromising hcw and patient safety by propagating healthcare-associated outbreaks the available evidence to date supports the 2015 who guidance in its call to be liberal in testing all close contacts of mers-cov cases regardless of the significance of contact or presence or absence of symptoms as well as the need for repeat testing weekly until negative and every 2448 h for release from isolation in addition urgent careful review of guidance regarding the return of asymptomatic mers-cov-positive hcws under investigation to active duty is needed all public health guidelines especially those addressing emerging pathogens of international public health importance need to be regularly updated based on new scientific evidence furthermore areas of ambiguity need to be addressed with focused research initiatives by the countries affected no funding was obtained for this study irb approval was obtained from the ksmc research committee reference number h1ri-01-jan18-02 all authors declare no conflict of interest  urgent development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic agents to control the emerging threat of middle east respiratory syndrome mers lu lu shuai xia tianlei ying shibo jiang   dear editor as of june 12 2015 the world health organization had been notified of 1289 laboratory-confirmed cases of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infection globally including at least 455 related deaths case-fatality rate of 35 httpwwwwhointcsrdon12-june-2015-mers-koreaen on may 20 a 68-year-old man returning to the republic of korea from a trip to saudi arabia was diagnosed with mers-cov infection and since then the virus has spread resulting in a cluster of 145 mers-cov cases including 14 deaths in south korea and china httpwwwwhointcsrdiseasecoronavirusinfectionsen bringing the total number of countries reporting mers-cov infection to 25 this patient became the one of the most active mers super-spreader while the mers super-spreader in abu dhabi was linked to 28 confirmed mers cases httpwwwrecombinomicscomnews04291401uaemerssuperspreader28html most of these cases in this cluster represent medical staff family and other caregivers or those close to the original patient before he was diagnosed with mers-cov infection and isolated therefore an understandable sense of panic has arisen among those who have had contact with the newly diagnosed cases this is yet another alarm sounding the necessity for the rapid development of therapeutic and prophylactic agents to treat mers patients and protect high-risk populations from mers-cov until an effective and safe vaccine is available12 based on our previous experience in developing viral fusion inhibitors against hiv3 and sars-cov4 we designed and synthesized a peptide hr2p derived from the hr2 domain in the s2 subunit of the spike s protein of the mers-cov emc2012 strain we found that hr2p could bind with the hr1 domain to form a stable six-helix bundle and thus inhibit viral fusion core formation and s protein-mediated cell-cell fusion hr2p was demonstrated to potently inhibit infection by both pseudotyped and live mers-cov in different cell lines5 we then modified the hr2p peptide by introducing glu e and lys k residues at the i to i4 or i to i3 arrangements we found that one of these hr2p analogous peptides hr2p-m2 exhibited significantly improved stability solubility and antiviral activity5 interestingly the hr2p-m2 peptide could potently inhibit infection by pseudoviruses expressing mers-cov s protein with or without mutation in the hr1 region suggesting that it could be effective against most currently available mers-cov mutants we further demonstrated that the hr2p-m2 peptide administered via the intranasal route could protect ad5-hdpp4-transduced mice6 from challenge by mers-cov strains with or without mutations in the hr1 region indicating that this peptide could be used as a nasal spray to protect high-risk populations including healthcare workers mers patients family members and those having close contacts with the patients from mers-cov infection7 intranasal application of the peptide to mers-cov-infected patients may suppress viral replication in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and thus reduce the release of virions thereby preventing the spreading of mers-cov to other people furthermore we and other groups have identified monoclonal antibodies mabs targeting neutralizing epitopes in the receptor-binding domain of the s1 subunit of mers-cov s protein these mabs including m3368 mers-49 3b1110 and mersmab111 have shown potent neutralizing activity against mers-cov the human mab m336 which was derived from a very large naive antibody library belongs to the igg1 subclass with high avidity 99 pm and neutralizing activity against pseudotyped and authentic mers-cov the half maximal inhibitory concentration of 0033 and 047 nm respectively12 more interestingly the m336 mab is a germline-like antibody with only one mutation in the heavy chain and five in the light chain as such it is safe for humans highly expressible and highly soluble in vivo studies have shown that this mab is very effective in protecting mers-cov-susceptible animals from viral challenge unpublished data suggesting that the m336m mab is a very promising drug candidate for the urgent treatment of mers-cov-infected patients12 we have also performed in vitro studies demonstrating that the combination of hr2p-m2 peptide with m336 mab exhibited a strong synergistic effect against mers-cov infection unpublished data this observation suggests that intranasal administration of hr2p-m2 peptide combined with intravenous administration of m336 mab may be a powerful strategy for treatment of mers patients laboratory-produced mabs m1024 a human mab against hendra virus and nipah virus and zmapp comprising three chimeric mabs against ebola virus have shown good in vivo efficacy in animal models1314 and have been successfully used in clinics to treat patients infected by hendra virus or nipah virus13 and ebola virus15 respectively therefore it can be plausibly suggested that m336 mab and hr2p-m2 peptide both of which have demonstrated excellent in vivo efficacy in animal models may also have high potential for clinical application in both urgent and prophylactic treatment of mers patients  covid-19 outbreak progression in italian regions approaching the peak by the end of march in northern italy and first week of april in southern italy cosimo distante prisco piscitelli alessandro miani   according to the italian national institute of health iss by march 29th in italy there were more than 101000 people who tested positive for sars-cov-2 since the beginning of the epidemic 75500 currently positive and 14600 healed 1 about 58 of cases are male median age 62 years old detailed epidemiological figures provided by the italian national institute of health tell us that men represent the majority of cases between 50 and 89 years old range of 5566 while in the younger age groups males and females are equally represented among people who tested positive for sars-cov-2 men also represent the vast majority of deceased people in all age groups from 30 to 89 years old range 6682 2 regional figures available up to 29 march show

mainly on lombardy and the northern regions of the po valley padana plain but the peak of the epidemic has not yet been reached until now southern regions seemed to be less affected by sars-cov-2 although a huge number of people mainly students attending universities in northern italy came back from po valley to their families in the south in the middle of the outbreak thus representing a potential factor able to accelerate the spread of the viral infection here we present an attempt to predict the peak of the outbreak in italy which is expected to reach a national level by the end of march and the different progression of the epidemic in southern italian regions compared to lombardy the exponential estimation is based on the work of wu et al 6 which was based on that of zhao et al 7 where the epidemic curve obeyed an exponential growth as of the date of this study 23 april 2020 the epidemic growth was still near exponential and the fitted model had many inlier data points the method is based on a non-linear least square framework for intrinsic growth estimation  in order to obtain r01m with m being the laplace transforming the probability distribution of the serial interval tg of the infection the r0 estimation is obtained with 100 susceptibility for sars-cov-2 at the early stage in wuhan as reported in 8 in figure 2 the r0 number estimates are computed for the southern italian regions and for the initial outbreak region lombardy according to our model in lombardy each infected person has involved 4 people 36 the r0 lowers to 314 for campania which shows the highest value among the southern italian regions followed by apulia 311 sicily 299 abruzzo 30 calabria 284 molise 26 and basilicata 266 r0 is an average value but it can also be computed day-by-day to monitor the transmission of the infection being an average value it can be skewed by super-spreader events a super-spreader is when an infected individual infects an unexpectedly large number of people in italy this event can be also generated not necessarily by an individual but from the perturbation of a susceptible population as occurred in apulia and sicily with an uncontrolled large group of people coming from areas experiencing an outbreak for a super-spreader such events are not necessarily a bad sign as they can indicate that fewer people are perpetuating an epidemic super-spreaders may also be easier to identify and contain since their symptoms are likely to be more severe in short r0 is a moving target tracking every case and the transmission of a disease is extremely difficult so the estimation of r0 is a complex and challenging issue estimates often change as new data becomes available if we define the yt as the number of infected people with symptoms at time t the exponential growth rate is lnytt let us consider tg75 as the generation time ie the serial interval and tl52 as the latent or incubation time values taken from 6 the infectious time titgtl and the ratio of exposed period to generation time is tltg the basic reproductive number can be approximated tor01tg1tg2 in order to estimate r0 it is important to find  and then the number of infected peopleytsuspectpconfirmed
suspect corresponds to the number of individuals screened with the test which have been confirmed figure 3 and table 1 show the estimated r0 values computed on a daily basis for the italian regions and for the initial outbreak in lombardy where about 40 cases were confirmed out of 100 suspects figure 4 the two methods provide an agreement of values although the first method based on an exponential fit should provide a better estimation having been computed on the entire time series from figure 3 it becomes an important aspect with respect to the wuhan r0268 as reported in 6 we used the susceptibleexposedinfectiousrecovered seir model 47 to simulate the epidemic since it was established on january 2020 it is based on a previous model sir which was based on three compartments but since the infection has an incubation period the compartment e exposed was included as shown in figure 5 these compartments are modeled over time and capture the changes in the population let us say that given n is the total population then n  s  e  i  r where s susceptible the portion of the population that does not have any vax coverage or immunity e exposed the portion of the population that has been infected but is in the incubation period that does not infect other individuals i infectious the portion of n that is infectious and may infect others resulting in either death or recovery r recovered the number of infectious people who have healed and become immune this model captures the dynamics of these compartments over time by four ordinary differential equations one of the most important aspects of these ordinary differential equations is equilibrium which is achieved by setting their derivatives to 0 along time t the two equilibriums are disease-free equilibrium dfe and endemic equilibrium ee besides equilibrium stability is an issue correlated with the basic reproductive number where dfe is stable if r01 when r01 dfe is unstable and ee is stable the four equations arestsin

where t is the number of days after january 31st the first found cases in italy  a regularization parameter and b the bias a training procedure was performed on the observable data in order to find optimal cb we considered with exposed people the number of twice-infected people after lockdown which is in line with the predictions and the observed values as shown in figure 6a the new daily cases peak of 29 march is shown and predicted with a gaussian fit while in figure 6b red curve the expected peak of the seir model is at the second half of april at a national level it is expected that southern italian regions could reach the peak later in the second half of april regarding the number of the active cases peak it must be noted that according to 10 several cases are undocumented so the amplitude of the peak also takes into account a small portion of undocumented cases in a specific study carried out china before the lockdown the author estimated that 86 of all infections were undocumented highlighting the importance of setting up a quarantine procedure to limit the spread as reported in 11 mobility is another important aspect for the diffusion of the virus where they show that travel restrictions are useful in the early stage of an outbreak this paper has introduced the study of sars-cov-2 in italy by studying the evolution of the epidemic at regional level we have experimented two different techniques to compute the basic reproduction number one related to an estimate on a daily basis and the other on the studied period the daily basis estimation is useful for the used compartment seir model to estimate the epidemic peak at national level we showed correct prediction on the new daily cases peak occurred on march 29th and gave an estimate of the active cases peak at national level future works will be oriented to forecast new daily cases by training deep neural networks methods whose results will be inserted in dinamyc seir model to reach better epidemic peak estimation  epidemiological and clinical characteristics of three family clusters of covid-19 transmitted by latent patients in china jing li jiguang ding li chen liang hong xiaoqi yu enling ye gangqiang sun binbin zhang xinxin zhang qingfeng sun   since december 2019 an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan hubei province china 1 2 sars-cov-2 has been characterised by high infectivity through human-to-human transmission and relatively low mortality 3 the mean r0 of sars-cov-2 is estimated to range from 224 to 358 4 5 as a result the epidemic of covid-19 has rapidly spread to the whole country and worldwide as of 26 march 2020 195 countries had been affected and the cumulative number of confirmed cases had reached 81 968 and 389 199 in china and worldwide with 3293 and 17 914 deaths respectively currently the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 especially transmission patterns have not been well elucidated the first family clustering study reported that five family members who travelled to wuhan from shenzhen were infected with sars-cov-2 and when they returned to shenzhen the additional family members who did not travel to wuhan became infected with the virus 6 the epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis indicates that sars-cov-2 can be transmitted person-to-person in hospital and family settings 6 subsequently several studies also reported the family cluster transmission resulting in the infection of 311 family members 711 even during the incubation period however further investigation is required to understand the transmission patterns among family members wenzhou is one of the regions with a high prevalence of infection outside hubei province probably because of the close economic cooperation and convenient public transportation between two regions in the early stage of the epidemic over 7000 people came back to ruian a county-level city under the administration of wenzhou among these people 74 were diagnosed with covid-19 and three family clusters of 31 members were identified in this study we aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of these three family clusters of covid-19 cases by comparing them with sporadic cases which would provide insights for epidemic control in the context of the current serious situation worldwide from 21 january 2020 to 9 february 2020 74 covid-19 patients who were all positive for the nucleic-acid test of sars-cov-2 and received isolation and treatment in the designated ruian peoples hospital were enrolled in the present retrospective study among the patients 31 patients were identified to belong to three different families according to their family relationships and history of close contacts figs 1 and 2 while the other 43 patients were sporadic cases

 the epidemiological history including exposure history travelling vehicle contact tracing family member relationship date of illness onset and date of admission and isolation were collected in detail for each patient by two attending physicians the transmission chain was carefully evaluated to clarify the relationship within the cluster members according to the close contact history and exposure time a close contact was defined as an act of sharing a meal party vehicle or living room with a confirmed or latently infected patient within 14 days an index case g0 was defined as the original source of sars-cov-2 infection among the family the patients who were infected by contact and exposure to the index case were defined as the first-generation cases g1 and the patients who were infected by contact and exposure to the first-generation patients were defined as second-generation cases g2 and so on the patients without an infected family member were defined as sporadic cases index case a a 46-year-old female who came back from wuhan on 17 january 2020 had dinner with four family members on 18 january 2020 she developed symptoms of cough 10 days later and was confirmed with covid-19 on 1 february 2020 the four family members cases a14 g1 developed the disease 514 days after the dinner and were called first-generation cases of index case a figs 1a and 2a index case b was a 57-year-old female who came back from wuhan on 15 january 2020 she developed a fever 4 days later and was diagnosed with covid-19 on 23 january 2020 during the next two weeks four family members cases b1 2 10 and 11 g1 who had a close contact history with index case b were confirmed to be infected by sars-cov-2 sequentially then case b2 g1 one of the four first-generation cases of index case b transmitted the infection to five family members cases b36 and 9 g2 who were called second-generation cases another first-generation case b11 g1 transmitted the infection to three family members

investigated using sporadic patients as controls such a specific population provides us an opportunity to analyse the relationship between transmission and the disease presentation in different settings where the sporadic patients were used as external controls to the family cluster patients more patients in sporadic cases came back from wuhan than in the family cluster all three index cases were latent patients without any symptoms at the time when they came back to ruian this study revealed that sporadic cases had lower levels of albumin and lymphocyte counts than family cluster cases otherwise there were no significant differences in terms of other epidemiological characters and clinical features between the two groups in addition the lymphocyte counts in sporadic cases were lower than those in the cases of second and third generations family cluster cases although there was no difference in the lymphocyte counts among the different generations within family cluster human coronavirus pneumonia is often associated with an elevated production of chemokines which recruit massive inflammatory cell infiltration and release cytokines resulting in acute pulmonary injury 13 the decrease of lymphocyte counts and elevation of cytokineschemokines are the hallmark of coronavirus-associated pneumonia and are associated with the severity of the pneumonia recent studies on covid-19 have demonstrated that the lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood are remarkably decreased in patients who are admitted in the intensive care unit icu compared with non-icu patients 1 14 in addition several studies on covid-19 or mers have shown that hypoalbuminemia is a frequent feature and associated with the severity of the pneumonia 1517 probably owing to increased energy consumption or altered pulmonary vessel permeability the finding in this study that the decrease of lymphocyte counts and hypoalbuminaemia in sporadic cases compared with family cluster cases indicates that there is an increased immune activation or dysfunction and thus more severe pulmonary inflammation in sporadic cases than in family cluster cases within the family clusters virus transmission through different generations and the clinical presentations were investigated the age of second- and third-generation patients was younger than that of the index and first-generation patients it has been reported that when hosts of different sexes or ages were encountered the pathogen may change optimal exploitative strategy leading to considerable variation of pathogen transmission and virulence 18 the trade-off between transmission and virulence would change in coordination with host immunity that is associated with age sars-cov-2 seems prone to affect older males with comorbidities 19 in this study two patients a1 g1 and b1 g1 developed severe pneumonia in first generation while no severe cases were observed in the second or third generation more mild patients were found in the second or third generation which are also noted to be younger in age may be attributed to age in addition to it could be inferred that following the passage through several generations within the family cluster the virulence of sars-cov-2 decreased gradually epidemiological evidence from covid-19 family clusters has suggested that most index cases are asymptomatic carriers mild patients or even latent patients 7 9 10 which is consistent with our observation however the characteristics of index cases with covid-19 are reportedly different from those in the mers family clusters who have moderate or severe symptoms and are never asymptomatic carriers 2022 the higher virulence and mortality in mers may explain the different characteristics of the index cases as the viral load of sars-cov-2 detected in the asymptomatic patients is similar to that in the symptomatic patients 23 the asymptomatic index cases are capable of causing cluster infection in the family setting a recent study with the largest sample so far in china showed that the median incubation period for covid-19 was 4 days iqr 27 with the longest incubation period up to 24 days and only 438 patients presented with a fever at admission 24 highlighting the importance of monitoring and isolating potential infected family members who have had an exposure history in the family setting previous studies have demonstrated that the outbreak of sars-cov and mers-cov infections have resulted in large clusters of patients most of which are associated with the nosocomial transmission called super-spreader events 2527 since the virological and clinical characteristics are similar among sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 28 it is worth noting the super-spreader events in covid-19 as of 7 march the daily number of newly diagnosed patients had decreased to less than 150 cases in china currently there are no specific antiviral agents or vaccines available for sars-cov-2 which possesses a high infectivity and thus advanced epidemiological surveillance and timely identification and isolation of suspected cases or individuals who had a close contact or exposure history remains a priority to prevent family cluster or super-spread events the chinese experience shows that intensive social interventions including isolation are crucial in delaying and blocking the spread and subsequent outbreaks of the disease in conclusion family clusters of covid-19 can be caused by latent patients the epidemiological and clinical symptoms are similar between the family cluster and sporadic patients but the sporadic patients showed lower lymphocytes and hypoalbuminaemia these findings indicate that close surveillance timely identification and isolation of the suspected or latent cases is crucial in preventing family clusters or even super-spread events
