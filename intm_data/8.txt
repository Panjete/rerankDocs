coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in humans mammals and birds in humans the virus causes respiratory tract infections which are mild but may be lethal in some cases coronaviruses are a group of an rnavirus and also known as a 2019-ncov virus coronaviruses are viruses in the subfamily orthocoronaviridae of family coronaviridae in the order nidovirales coronaviruses are enveloped viruses and have a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome with a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry 8 31 the genomic size of coronavirus varies from 26 to 32 kilobase 7 coronaviruses are categorized into four genera ie alpha beta delta and gamma where alpha and beta are responsible for causing infection in humans 17 there are seven strains of human coronaviruses viz human coronavirus 229ehcov-229e human coronavirus oc43hcov-oc43 sars-cov human coronavirus nl63hcov-nl63 new heaven coronavirus human coronavirus hku middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov previously known as novel coronavirus 2012 and hcov-emc novel coronavirus 2019-ncov also known as wuhan pneumonia or wuhan coronavirus the coronaviruses hcov-229e -nl63 -oc43 and -hku1 frequently circulate in human population and cause respiratory infection in adults and children the incubation period for human coronavirus is 25 days 15 as it is communicable disease and transfer from one person to another person through a droplet and direct contact 9 the recent identification of fourth human coronavirus hcov-nl63 was diagnosed from a 7-month-old child who suffers from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis symptoms of coronavirus are feeling tired difficulty in breathing fever coughing and sore throat as the symptoms are similar to other respiratory diseases including flu and common cold in this review we have explained the actual mechanism of coronavirus and its overexpression in the cell membrane fig 1for identification of active infection serology test was performed for the surveillance purpose serology test was performed however it has its own limitation ie it cannot be considered as diagnostic test in this test antibodies to mers-cov can be finalized from previous infections 34 the populations of certain places which are disease-ridden with mers infection are suspectable for molecular test and clinical tests to identify active infections of mers-cov 22 to identify the viral rna within reckonable samples a molecular test called real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr are vividly used for identification and confirmation of mers-cov infection entails as per central for disease control and prevention cdc there must be either a positive rrt-pcr result for at least two definite genomic targets or single positive target with the sequencing of a second target as per cdc the united states has approved an rrt-pcr assay for mers-cov the test is thru under the buff of an emergency use authorization but human error poor laboratory conditions and ignorance while testing the samples is such prevalent factors which could affect the capability and proficiency of rrt-pcr test for this rrt-pcr assay cdc recommended collecting multiple samples including lower and upper respiratory sample serum and stool specimen cdc considers a patient under examination to be negative for active mers-cov infection when one negative rrt-pcr test on the mentioned specimen cdc consider mers patient to be negative for active mers-cov infection followed by two successive negative rrt-pcr tests on all samples 1the peoples who had infection to mers-cov serology test helps to identify antibody from them these types of antibody have the capability to attack attenuate kill the hosted virus within the immune system the presence of antibodies to mers-cov shows that a person had been formerly diseased with the virus and develops an immune response confirmation to date recommends there may be a wider range of mers disease than was initially thought for example a public health investigator has recognized individuals who are pcr-positive but have no mers symptoms we do not know if mers-cov can be spread by these people cdc has a two-phase methodology for serology testing using two screening tests and one confirmatory test to distinguish antibodies to mers-cov 6 the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa is a screening tests to detect the occurrence and concentration of specific antibodies that is bind to a viral protein cdc recommended elisa test for antibodies against two different mers-cov proteins viz nucleocapsid n and spike s to identify the neutralizing antibodies the microneutralization assay is a good confirmatory test which helps to measure specific antibodies in serum specimens however compared to elisa the microneutralization assay is a laboratory intensive and time-consuming method and requires at least 5 days before the result are available if a clinical sample is found to be positive either by elisa or microneutralization the specimen is determined to be confirmed positive 5 if a clinical sample is found to be positive by both elisas and negative by microneutralization the sample is determined to be intermediate if a clinical sample is found to be positive by only one elisa and negative by microneutralization the sample is determined to be negative 18 in the end a final determination of a confirmed positive serology the result needs to be a positive elisa test and confirmation by microneutralization assay mers-cov serology test is used for surveillance test not for diagnostic purpose-these are the tools which developed in response to the mers-cov outbreakin 1965 two scientists tyrell and bynoe studied the human coronavirus named b814 found in human embryonic tracheal organ cultures obtained from the respiratory tract of a person with common cold the existence of an infectious agent was demonstrated by inoculating the medium form these cultures in human volunteers in this experiment colds were produced but the growth of agents does not occur at the same time other two scientists hamre and procknow got to succeed in growing virus with unusual properties in tissue culture from samples which were picked up from adults with colds hamre named this virus as 229e hamres virus 12 in the late 1960s tyrell with a group of scientists worked on human strains and other animal viruses which included infectious bronchitis virus mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine which were morphologically the same as seen through electron microscopy 12 this new category of viruses was called coronavirus and was accepted as new genus of viruses further research gives more information about the epidemiology of human respiratory coronaviruses like it was found that in temperate climates respiratory coronavirus infections occur more often in the winter and spring 29 after three decades of discovery human strains oc43 and 229e were studied like many other viruses the reinfection was common as the research continues to explore the pathogenicity and epidemiology of the human coronavirus the importance and number of animal coronaviruses were growing rapidly in 2003 the new virus sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was identified which first infected humans in southern china sars-cov killed 774 people and at least 8000 people were infected 23 sars infection affected 29 countries since 2004 there have not been any known cases in the world 16 the transmission of sars is primarily from person to person symptoms are like influenza-like and include fever malaise headache diarrhea and shivering the evolution of this virus demonstrated that this virus is not stable virus and can adapt to become more virulent even lethal to humans after that another outbreak in saudi arabia in 2012 cause many deaths and later spread to other countries it was called middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov as its origin was middle east the spread of infection occurred worldwide however most cases of deaths occurred in the middle east from2012 to 2018 the total number of cases reported was 2274 from 27 countries out of which 817 associated deaths were reported there are no further reports of cases of mers-covbut now in december 2019 there was an epidemic of new novel coronavirus in the city of wuhan china and was named as 2019-ncov 14 this infection is closely related to sars-cov and mers-cov 30 in december 2019 wmhc reported 27 cases of viral pneumonia most of the people who were infected had exposure to the huanan seafood market where poultry bats snakes and other wildlife animals were sold the cause of viral pneumonia was not sars mers influenza virus or adenovirus on january 10 reports came that the newly identified 2019-ncov has been isolated from patients with the help of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction methods on jan 2020 217 patients were infected with 2019-ncov out of which 9 patients died there are more than 20623 confirmed cases and at least 427 people have died as of 3 feb 2020 the virus has spread to at least to 20 countries including us australia thailand hong kong taiwan macau singapore japan south korea france malaysia canada germany nepal india and uaeafter close introspection from the chinses government it was tangible that the outbreak of covid-19 was ignited from fish and wild animal market of wuhan city china during november 2019 33 the virus has prominent intention to grown itself within the serum or raw blood within the mutilated bodies of animals birds and fishes after proper incubation within the animal blood the virus transmission occurs due to the human trespassing and mobilization as per who guideline to prevent an individual from contamination one can frequently wash hisher hand using sanitizer containing 70 ethanol 15 hydrogen peroxide 15 deionised water avoid unprotected animal contacts use of ffp1-3 mask as per whos most recent guideline march 31 2020 a patient with acute respiratory illness with certain symptoms of cough shortness of breath and a history of traveling in foreign territory is susceptible for community transmission of covid-19 disease heshe must be treated in quarantine at list for 14 dayschloroquine has some devastative and quandary effects against any kind of rna virus ie hepatitis a and c rabies polio hiv influenza a and b influenza a h5n1 lassa zika hendra nipah and ebola virus 27 chloroquine has also some lethal effects against some dna virus as well such as hepatitis b virus and herpes simplex virus but unfortunately very few clinical researches have been carryforward to detect the antiviral activity of chloroquine as far as the corona virus pandemic is concerned benefits of chloroquine were remarkably reported for sars-cov-1 in in-vitro cell line studies it was confirmed that chloroquine has significant inhibitory effects on the replication of hcov- 229e in epithelial lung cell cultures the chloroquine has been most prominently active against middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov the chloroquine has significant impact on establishing endolysosomal pathway as sars-cov-1 virus try to vandalize this pathway hence chloroquine could be very effective against novel corona virus a recent paper stated that both chloroquine and antiviral remdesivir inhibited sars-cov-2 in vitro and proposed that these drugs to be assessed in human patients suffering from covid-19 as far as its mechanism of action is concern against novel corona virus it has multiple mechanisms in which in step-by-step it inhibits the pre entry of virus penetration within the cellular surface receptors the chloroquine was found to have inhibitory effects against enzyme called quinone reductase 2 a structural neighbor of udp- n -acetylglucosamine 2-epimerases which is involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acids the chloroquinoline interferes the biosynthesis of sialic acid by which human coronavirus hcov-o43 and the orthomyxoviruses cannot utilize sialic acid moieties as receptor due to which the virial glycosylation on virus cell surface receptor would stop due to alkylation of endosome chloroquine shows in-vitro anti-viral effect when added to vero cells prior to virus exposure the mechanism is likely to be rapid annulment of virus endosome fusion with fluctuation of endosomal ph through endocytosisbased on the initial studies and positive outcomes of chloroquine indian council of medical research icmr on march 24 2020 suggested that those patients who are corona positive and the doctors and other healthcare professionals who are handling covid-19 patients are advised to take hydroxychloroquine a chloroquinoline derivative as a preventive drug as hydroxychloroquine an antimalarial drug has assumed prophylactic effects against covid-19 but as per forbes article by willam a haseltine march 25 2020 hydroxychloroquine has ineffective treatment of patients hospitalized with covid-19 the small controlled trails were conducted in shanghai public health clinical center china with 15 patients by giving 400 mg hydroxychloroquine dose for 7 days the results are not that much surprising when the treatment group was compared with the controlled group after ct scans it was observed that treatment group has less significance difference than the controlled group total 93 of patients in the control group tested negative for covid-19 after 7 days compare to 867 of patients in the hydroxychloroquine treated group the results were not that much favorable and statistically indistinguishableas per who on march 31 2020 no new country reported new cases on covid-19 for the last 24 h however the numbers of infected cases are alarming globally almost 75890 confirmed cases and 36405 deaths were reported till march 31 2020 as per who report more than 800000 surgical masks 873000 gloves 54000 n95 masks and 24000 face shields were exported in 75 countries along with covid-19 testing kits to 126 countries by operations support and logistics oslon 15 january 2020 the case of coronavirus 2019-ncov was reported by ministry of health labor and welfare japan mhlw from wuhan hubei province china 19the patient was male age 3039 years living in japan the patient traveled to wuhan china in late december and had a fever on 3 january 2020 while staying in wuhan he did not visit the huanan seafood wholesale market or any other live animal markets in wuhan 13 he has indicated that he was in close contact with a person with pneumonia on 6 january he returned to japan and tested negative for influenza when he visited a local clinic on the same day 21 on 10 january 2020 due to his continued symptoms of cough sore throat and fever he visited a local hospital and was found to have abnormal chest x-ray with infiltrates 32 he was admitted to the hospital on the same day and had remained fevered 10 on 14 january his attending doctor notified the case to a local public health authority under the surveillance system for unidentified serious infectious illness samples were collected and sent to the national institute of infectious diseases niid and at niid polymerase chain reaction pcr testing and sequencing were performed twice which identified very small amount of 2019-ncov rna on 15 january 2020 13on 20 january 2020 the first case of novel coronavirus was reported by national ihr focal point nfp for the republic of korea in the republic of korea the patient was a 35-year-old female chinese national residing in wuhan hubei province in chinathe case-patient had developed fever chill and muscle pain on 18 january while in wuhan she visited a local hospital in wuhan and was initially diagnosed with a cold on 19 january the case-patient was detected with fever 383 c upon arrival at the incheon international airport the case-patient was transferred to a nationally designated isolation hospital for testing and treatment the patient was tested positive was confirmed positive for novel coronavirus 2019-ncov on 20 january by sequencing at the korea centers for disease control and prevention kcdc the patient had chills runny nose and muscle pain the case-patient did not report visiting any markets including huanan seafood wholesale market nor did she have known contact with confirmed 2019-ncov cases or wild animals in wuhan city the case-patient is currently under isolation receiving treatment and is in a stable condition 4on 13 january 2020 the first imported case of coronavirus was reported by the ministry of public health mph thailand from wuhan hubei province chinathe patient was a 61-year-old chinese woman living in wuhan city hubei province china on 5 january 2020 she developed fever with chills sore throat and headache on 8 january 2020 she took a direct flight to thailand from wuhan city together with five family members in a tour group of 16 people the traveler with febrile illness was detected on the same day by thermal surveillance at suvarnabhumi airport bkk thailand and was hospitalized the same day 26 after the temperature check and initial assessment she was transferred to the hospital for further investigations and treatment 2 she reported a history of visiting a local fresh market in wuhan on regular basis however she did not report visiting the huanan south china seafood market from where most of the cases were detected 3 samples tested positive for coronaviruses by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr on 12 january 2020 25 the genomic sequencing analysis performed by emerging infectious diseases health science center the thai red cross society eid-trc and the thai national institute of health thai nih department of medical sciences confirmed that the patient was infected with the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov which was isolated in wuhan china for more information please see the disease outbreak news published on 12 january 2020in india the patient was detected with novel coronavirus in keralas thrissur district and the patient kept in an isolation ward while the number of people under observation 28 the condition of the woman patient a medical student from wuhan university was stable 11 the woman now in an isolation ward at the general hospital in thrissur is likely to be shifted to the medical college hospital there soon health officials were awaiting a result of one more testgene sequencing only after which it can be stated that the patient was affected with the virus 24 three others who had returned from china are also in isolation wards in thrissur of the four students who returned from china one of them has tested positive of the total 1053 people under observation after traveling to china as many as 247 arrived in the state on thursday while 15 people including seven who got admitted on thursday are under observation in isolation wards at various hospitals across the state the remaining are under home quarantine so far a total of 24 samples have been sent to the national institute of virology in pune for testing and 15 of them turned out to be negative while that of the woman tested positive 20after long hurdle and extensive research scientists have come to a conclusion that flavilavir an anti-viral drug has the potential to eradicate novel coronavirus this drug now subsequently promoted for marketing by national medical products administration since the outburst the flavilavir was developed by zhejiang hisun pharmaceutical company from the clinical research data it is postulated that flavilavir could play a game changer in the management of novel coronavirusin the above study of corona virus there are the various recent cases of corona virus affected patient human beings are addressed in the latest by 2020 so in the above article various causative agents and the mechanism of action of the corona virus are determined and studied the corona virus is of the various kinds and the most lethal corona virus is wuhan corona virus 2019 there are the two different diagnostic tests of the corona virus are discussed in the above study now days corona virus is spreading in the various regions of the world so maintain good hygienic conditions so that one should live a healthy lifeon 31 december 2019 the world health organization who was informed that a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had been identified in the city of wuhan in china world health organization 2020a it soon became apparent that a coronavirus  which causes respiratory illness in human beings  was likely to be implicated within a few weeks cases of human-to-human transmission were increasing exponentially within and across borders at the end of january 2020 the who declared a public health emergency of international concern pheic pursuant to the international health regulations world health organization 2016 this facilitated an internationally coordinated response to what became known as covid-19 which was attributable to a new coronavirus sars-cov-2 on 11 march 2020 the who declared covid-19 to be a global pandemic world health organization 2020b world health organization 2020cin the united kingdom uk the first cases of covid-19 were reported at the end of january and involved visitors to england ball wace  smyth 2020 the first case of a person contracting covid-19 within the uk occurred at the end of february bbc news 2020a as the risk grew an initial set of health protection regulations were adopted to enable action to be taken by the uk government to minimise the spread of covid-19 in the population the health protection coronavirus regulations 2020 uk si 2020 no 129 at the same time the government and their scientific advisors continued to support what was described as a herd immunity approach to managing the disease this involved allowing the virus to spread naturally through the british population in order to build up population immunity conn  lewis 2020by mid-march however the findings from pandemic modelling by experts at imperial college revealed that such an approach would soon overwhelm capacity to manage covid-19 cases within the national health service nhs indeed there were very real concerns that if the government did not take immediate mitigation measures then the uk might face more than 500000 deaths from covid-19 ferguson et al 2020 in the wake of such findings the uk government switched tack and announced a range of new lockdown measures designed to restrict peoples movements involving social distancing working from home and only undertaking essential travel leading to the cancellation of large social and sporting events doherty 2020 by the end of march both the prime minister boris johnson and the secretary of state for health and social care matt hancock were in self-imposed isolation with covid-19 symptoms as were several members of the government leadership team involved in managing the response to the pandemic proctor  weaver 2020in order to place the lockdown measures on a legislative footing the uk government introduced the coronavirus bill into the uk parliament on 19 march 2020 uk parliament 2020a in putting forward the bill it was clear the uk government was seeking a wide range of legal powers to manage the lockdown measures as well as to address a myriad of issues that had arisen in relation to responding to the covid-19 pandemic with this in mind the decision was taken to replace the initial health protection regulations passed in february which had drawn on health protection powers available under the public health control of disease act 1984 uk public general acts 1984 c 22 instead the preferred way forward now was bespoke primary legislation it was argued that this approach would provide the uk government and the devolved administrations with greater flexibility and a wider range of regulatory options to respond to the pandemic as well as enabling the uk parliament to undertake more detailed scrutiny of the use of government powers in the round institute for government 2020the purpose of the legislation was to respond to an emergency situation and manage the effects of the covid-19 pandemic given that it was likely to lead to a reduced workforce increased pressure on health services and death management processes in doing so the aims were to increase the health and social care workforce to ease the burden on frontline staff in health and other public bodies to contain and slow the spread of the virus and to manage the deceased in a respectful and dignified manner uk parliament 2020b in drafting the legislation the decision had also been taken that there would be a uk-wide approach save where specific measures were required in the devolved administrations following a short period of scrutiny by both houses the bill was quickly passed by the uk parliament in the face of minimal opposition the coronavirus act 2020 coronavirus act received royal assent on 25 march 2020 the act is due to expire two years from this date subject to a limited number of exceptions in contrast to other emergency legislation such as the civil contingencies act 2004 the acts parliamentary review mechanisms are more limited and spread over an extended period they involve bi-monthly government reporting in addition to the uk parliament being able to express its views at six months or vote at twelve months on whether the act should remain in force uk public general acts 2004 c 36 uk public general acts 2020 c 7 ss 89  90health is a devolved matter to northern ireland under constitutional arrangements in the uk therefore it is ordinarily a matter for the northern ireland executive and assembly to make policy and law in the area northern ireland act 1998 uk public general acts 1998 c 47 given the need for a uk-wide approach the assembly adopted a consent motion to permit legal measures for managing the covid-19 pandemic in northern ireland to be included in the coronavirus act northern ireland assembly 2020a given the urgency of the situation there was little opportunity for the assembly to engage in detailed scrutiny of the coronavirus bill before it was passed by the uk parliament and the act came into force northern ireland assembly 2020b walker  butler 2020 once the act was in force the northern ireland government quickly moved to adopt its own health protection regulations which set out the approach to be taken to lockdown measures locally they were brought into force at 11 pm on 28 march 2020 the health protection coronavirus restrictions regulations northern ireland 2020 ni sr 2020 no 55 specific measures contained in the health protection regulations include powers to enforce the closure of schools and businesses restrictions on peoples movement without reasonable excuse and enforcement powers for the police service of northern ireland ss 51  2 these regulations are required to be reviewed by the northern ireland department of health every twenty-one days to determine whether the measures should remain in place while regular reviews continue to take place mccormack 2020a the northern ireland executive has also published its plan for exiting lockdown outlining its principled and incremental approach to easing the restrictive measures imposed through the regulations in doing so the executive reaffirmed its commitment to north-south as well as east-west co-operation in managing the pandemic northern ireland direct government services 2020 northern ireland executive 2020the article focuses on examining the changes made to mental health and capacity laws in northern ireland through section 10 and schedules 10 and 11 of the coronavirus act emergency legislation we proceed by providing a brief overview of such laws before going on to explore the policy rationale for such changes as well as elaborating on how key aspects are likely to be operationalised in practice we also consider how these changes may potentially impact upon existing human rights protections for persons assessed as lacking mental capacity in northern ireland in undertaking this examination we acknowledge that it is necessarily at a preliminary stage given the recent implementation of such legislative changes a more detailed critical analysis of their impact and consequences can only be made following the end of the public health emergency with this caveat in mind we argue that it is important that regular parliamentary oversight is maintained in relation to the potential impact and consequences of such changes during the period they are in force this should be done in order to assess whether they remain a necessary proportionate and least restrictive response to the challenges faced in managing mental health and capacity issues in northern ireland during the covid-19 pandemicnorthern ireland is a devolved nation of the uk comprising six counties in the north-east of the island of ireland while the jurisdiction was formally created in 1921 its constitutional status including whether it should remain part of the uk or form part of a united ireland was one of the factors in a violent conflict commonly known as the troubles this conflict lasted for over twenty-five years in the twentieth century with its legacy continuing to resonate in northern ireland up until the present day see mcgarry  oleary 1995 mcgrattan 2010 mckittrick  mcvea 2012 during this period devolved government in northern ireland was suspended direct rule was imposed which involved the uk government assuming primary responsibility for governmental decision-making in northern ireland institute of government 2020 in 1998 a peace accord was reached  known as the good friday agreement or belfast agreement  which provided for the re-establishment of devolved power-sharing institutions the agreement was based on the principle of consent in the context of the constitutional position of northern ireland and a right to self-determination subject to the consent of the majority in northern ireland and ireland good fridaybelfast agreement 1998due to the nature of politics in northern ireland the devolved government has collapsed on a number of occasions in the past twenty years since the peace accord which has led to periods of direct rule being re-imposed by the uk government in january 2020 it was restored again following an agreement between the main political parties nevertheless political tensions continue to persist over the border between northern ireland and ireland most recently such tensions have been exacerbated by the uks decision to leave the european union colloquially known as brexit given that the north-south border on the island of ireland has now become the sole land border between the uk and the european union indeed it is the border question which has also led to a range of difficulties in facilitating a coordinated response to the covid-19 pandemic on the island although there is now evidence of increased north-south cooperation across a range of public health measures memorandum of understanding 2020 scally 2020there are two key pieces of legislation that are relevant to examining mental health and capacity laws in northern ireland the mental health northern ireland order 1986 mho northern ireland orders in council 1986 no 595 ni 4 and the mental capacity northern ireland act 2016 mcani acts of the northern ireland assembly 2016 2020 c 18 for present purposes we exclude consideration of the potential impact upon the criminal justice provisions of the mho and mcani the mho has been in force since 1986 and has been described as traditional mental health legislation harper davidson  mcclelland 2016 it provides for involuntary treatment of mental disorder which is defined as mental illness mental handicap and any other disorder or disability of mind mho article 31 this is based on diagnosis and risk presence of mental illness or severe mental impairment and failure to detain leading to substantial risk of serious physical harm to self or others mho articles 3  4 the mho is accompanied by a short code of practice and what is known as the gain guidelines which set out detailed information about the provision of mental health care in line with the mho guidelines on the use of the mental health northern ireland order 1986in the early 2000s the bamford review began what would be a lengthy examination of law policy and provisions affecting people assessed with mental health needs and learning disabilities in northern ireland the review produced a number of reports including one which recommended comprehensive reform of mental health and capacity laws in northern ireland such law reform was to be grounded in a rights-based approach in which the key principles of respect and autonomy were embedded bamford review of mental health and learning disability 2007 davidson mccallion  potter 2003 following the completion of the bamford reviews work there ensued a further lengthy period of consultation and executive review before a draft proposal for legislative reform  the mental capacity bill  was eventually introduced into the northern ireland assembly in 2015 following detailed scrutiny it was eventually passed and received royal assent in 2016 since such time the northern ireland department of health has been working on a phased implementation and once the act is fully implemented the mho will be repealedthe mcani is an innovative ground-breaking piece of legislation both in the uk and internationally campbell brophy davidson  obrien 2018 northern ireland has opted for a form of fusion legislation bringing together capacity and mental health law across medical specialities see dawson  szmukler 2006 what this means is that impairment of decision-making capacity and best interests are the only criteria to be used when making decisions across health and social care lynch taggart  campbell 2017 at the heart of this reform of mental health and capacity laws is a recognition of both the moral and legal importance of a persons autonomy and rights it applies in all circumstances where a persons autonomy might be compromised on health grounds it acknowledges the importance of recognising parity of esteem between mental and physical illness the aim is to treat mental and physical illness equally under the law with the objective of reducing stigma associated with separate mental health legislationnotwithstanding this innovative rights-based approach to fusing mental health and capacity laws in northern ireland it has nevertheless attracted criticism on the grounds that the mcani is not fully compliant with the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities crpd un general assembly 24 january 2007 ares61106 article 1 of the crpd clarifies that the term persons with disabilities includes persons with mental and intellectual impairments the mcani has been criticised on the grounds that it does not recognise legal capacity as set out in article 12 of the crpd which affirms that persons with disabilities have the right to recognition everywhere as persons before the law the united nations committee on the rights of persons with disabilities has interpreted legal capacity under article 12 as including the capacity to be both a holder of rights and an actor under the law  which entitles a person to full protection of his or her rights by the legal system in the circumstances legal capacity and mental capacity should be viewed as distinct concepts with the latter referring to the decision-making skills of a person therefore perceived or actual deficits in mental capacity must not be used as justification for denying legal capacity united nations committee on the rights of persons with disabilities 2014 paras 1213 the approach to supporting a person assessed as lacking mental capacity in exercising their legal capacity forms part of broader academic debates about whether and to what extent compliance with the crpd is achievable under domestic law see arstein-kerslake  flynn 2016 donnelly 2016 flynn 2013 harper et al 2016 mcsherry  wilson 2015 series 2015 stavert 2018 szmukler daw  callard 2014the first phase of the mcani implementation programme was commenced on 2 december 2019 this involved the introduction of the deprivation of liberty safeguards dols scheme through the dols regulations which was accompanied by a code of practice mental capacity deprivation of liberty no 2 regulations northern ireland 2019 ni si 2019 no 199 northern ireland department of health 2019b the dols code of practice reiterates that under the mcani mental capacity is to be presumed and the burden of proof balance of probabilities is on those seeking to assert incapacity to show otherwise and on the basis of reasonable belief taking account of the factors noted below the test for capacity is whether or not a person aged 16 years or over is unable to make a decision for themselves because of an impairment of or disturbance in the function of the mind or brain whether temporary or permanent and whatever its origin mcani s 31  2a a determination of incapacity is time and decision specific mcani s 31 and any intervention must be taken on a best interests basis mcani ss 2  7 dols code of practice chapter 7 factors to be taken into account in determining whether a person has the capacity are based on a functional assessment which includes their ability to understand use weigh and appreciate communicate and retain the information relevant or required to the process of making the decision in question see mcani s 4 dols code of practice chapter 5the statutory principles set out in the mcani underpin the operation of the dols scheme mcani ss 1  2 in line with such principles the dols code of practice makes clear that if a person is assessed as lacking capacity to make a decision they should nevertheless be included as far as possible in any discussions about deprivation of liberty and to be able to make their views and opinions known they are entitled to know and be given all the information used in any assessments no assumptions can be made about a person and they have the right to

practice para 921 if a person is to be deprived of their liberty then all necessary legal safeguards should be put in place and they have the right to challenge new and existing authorisations made under the dols scheme to what is known as the review tribunal during the first phase of implementing the mcani the review tribunal can only consider a specified range of authorisations made under the dols scheme such as a trust panel authorisation interim authorisation trust panel extension authorisation short-term detention authorisation or an extension authorisation dols code of practice paras 142155the dols code of practice also makes clear that an application for a dols authorisation is only required when a person is deprived of their liberty as opposed to having their freedom restricted in short the deprivation of liberty has to be necessary to protect a person from harm be proportionate and be in their best interests the criteria for determining whether there has been a deprivation of liberty is whether the person in question is under continuous supervision and control and whether they are free to leave this draws on the acid test set out by baroness hale in cheshire west p by his litigation friend the official solicitor v cheshire west and chester council p and q by their litigation friend the official solicitor v surrey county council 2014 uksc 19 paras 48 59 dols code of practice paras 26218 in the event that a person is deemed to have met the criteria then a suitable authorisation must be sought under the dols scheme with the exception of needing to receive life-saving medical treatment deprivation of liberty of a person lacking capacity for medical treatment in a hospital setting requires a short-term detention authorisation this form of authorisation can be put in place by two specified healthcare professionals for fourteen days which can be extended for a further fourteen days based on specified criteria dols code of practice paras 123 1291212 219222 mcani schedule 2outside the hospital setting a dols application can be authorised by a suitably constituted trust panel whether the person is based at a care or nursing home day centre respite facility any other health or social care setting or in a private home dols code of practice para 721 the panel must make a decision about a dols authorisation within seven working days after the trust has received the application dols code of practice para 113 the use of the term trust panel in this context refers to the fact that the entity charged with making dols authorisations is situated within one of the five trusts which manage hospitals and other health and social care facilities in northern ireland the trusts form part of the northern ireland health service known as health and social care which is equivalent to the national health service in england wales and scotland health and social care online 2020 to be properly constituted under the dols scheme the panel must consist of members appointed by the relevant trust comprising three suitably qualified persons one medical practitioner one approved social worker and one other healthcare professional who could be a registered nurse or midwife registered dentist occupational therapist speech and language therapist practitioner psychologist in addition panel members must have undertaken the requisite training in making formal assessments of capacity under the mcani as well as specific training for sitting on these panels dols regulations reg 2 dols code of practice paras 144145we recognise that the dols scheme which operates in england and wales has attracted significant criticism to date bartlett 2014 fanning 2016 law commission 2017 uk parliament 2018 and will shortly be replaced with the liberty protection safeguards scheme see mental capacity amendment act 2019 uk public general acts 2019 c 18 series 2020 however it is too soon to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness or otherwise of the operation of the northern ireland dols scheme given it has only been operational since early december 2019 besides being premature any such assessment is now further complicated by the introduction of changes to the scheme brought about by the emergency legislation to address the covid-19 pandemic key aspects of the dols scheme which are impacted by such changes include which suitably qualified persons can now making formal assessments of capacity the role and functions of the nominated person how applications are now to be made for dols authorisations the composition and methods of decision-making by trust panels making dols authorisations and the appeal mechanisms to the review tribunal we now turn to consider these changes in more detail in the following sections of the articlethe coronavirus act 2020 introduces changes to both the mho and the mcani following the passing of the emergency legislation these changes were brought into force by statutory instrument on 30 march and 2 april 2020 respectively see mental health northern ireland amendment order 2020 ni si 2020 no 46 mental capacity deprivation of liberty amendment regulations northern ireland 2020 ni si 2020 no 57 these statutory changes were accompanied by two emergency codes of practice which provide more detailed guidance as to how these changes will work in practice both offer a similar rationale for the changes first there is a need to address the consequences arising from a likely reduced workforce of health and social care professionals as a result of illness suffered due to the covid-19 pandemic second the changes are designed to mitigate this impact third pursuing mitigation in this way will ensure that persons can still be either compulsorily admitted and detained under the mho or be legally deprived of their liberty while still ensuring safeguards are in place under the mcani northern ireland department of health 2020a northern ireland department of health 2020bspecific reference is made to the use of detention powers in both emergency codes of practice although recognising that the covid-19 pandemic has necessitated rapid health emergency planning it is made clear that the use of such powers should not be seen prima facie as operating pursuant to the mhos emergency provisions without further justification in the case of detention powers under the mho it is also emphasised that due processes and proper safeguards must be adhered to mho emergency code of practice para 6 similarly in the case of the mcani reference is made to the fact that even where a person may have tested positive for covid-19 they cannot be detained deprived of liberty or secluded without proper processes and legal support the code also emphasises in bold type that if a person who lacks capacity is isolated and therefore prevented from leaving it is likely that the person is deprived of liberty this necessitates adherence to legal processes including the dols scheme mcani emergency code of practice para 9given such emphasis it is surprising that no further detail is provided as to what is meant by the need to adhere to legal processes apart from the dols scheme while it is our view that the use of existing mental health and capacity law is much more appropriate in the case of persons assessed as lacking capacity with covid-19 who either needs medical treatment or who may pose a risk of transmitting covid-19 infection to others it is important to keep in mind that there is a range of legal processes that could potentially be used in the context of a public health emergency for example this could include the use of the new health protection powers in part 1a of the public health northern ireland act 1967 acts of northern ireland parliament chapter 36 such powers were imported into the 1967 act through s 48 schedule 18 of the coronavirus act 2020 and they provided the legal basis for the adoption of the northern ireland health protection regulations in late march 2020 which imposed lockdown measures locally in response to the covid-19 pandemic the new part 1a provisions mirror many of the general health protection powers contained in part 2a of the public health control of disease act 1984 which applies in england and wales but they are focused on addressing the covid-19 pandemic with this in mind the term infection or contamination is defined in part 1a as an infection or contamination with coronavirus which presents or could present significant harm to human health in circumstances where coronavirus means severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 s 25a2 regulations which would seek to enable these special restrictions or requirements would need to be proportionate and in response to an imminent threat to public health which could include making provision for persons with coronavirus to be detained quarantined or otherwise kept in isolation for the protection of the public health in specified circumstances s 25dit is also emphasised in both emergency codes of practice that the usual legal processes which apply in the case of use of the mho and the mcani should continue to be used in the first instance making use of the emergency provisions should be seen as a matter of last resort in circumstances where there is no other option eg mcani emergency code of practice para 6 to the authors knowledge there has been little use made of these provisions to date we do recognise that there are or will be circumstances where the use of the emergency provisions might be justified particularly where for example a significant covid-19 outbreak occurs in a closed mental health unit resulting in a substantial depletion of the available psychiatric care workforce campbell  grierson 2020 it is nevertheless important that where the use of the provisions is contemplated or take effect then the emergency codes exhortation that a persons human rights should remain at the forefront of decision making during this emergency period should be adhered to with specific reference to the protections provided by article 2 right to life article 3 prohibition against inhuman and degrading treatment article 5 the right to liberty and security and article 8 the right to respect for private and family life as enshrined in the european convention on human rights echr see mho emergency code of practice para 2 mcani emergency code of practice paras 1 8in the context of healthcare staff numbers being low due to sickness or isolation the emergency provisions allow for an approved social worker who makes the application for involuntary admission to hospital to be replaced by a relevant social worker if the former is not available mho emergency code of practice para 22 in addition a responsible medical officer who provides the medical reports for continued detention for assessment and then treatment can also be replaced by a relevant medical practitioner in circumstances where it would be impractical to wait for the former to be available mho emergency code of practice para 38while the mho emergency code of practice provides minimum experience requirements for both the relevant social worker and the relevant medical practitioner both healthcare professionals are stepping into roles they might not have relevant experience of given the legal requirements in this regard set out in the mho in addition there is no mention within the mho emergency code of the need for specialised training to perform this role this presents a number of potential risks for example a prescribed form authorising the detention may be incorrectly completed due to inexperience or a replacement for the approved social worker andor responsible medical officer may misinterpret the law or act in error when applying the criteria for detention both events would have obvious implications for whether detention powers are being used appropriately in accordance with the law as well as giving rise to a potential interference of a patients human rights specifically under articles 3 5 and 8 of the echrthe time limits within the mho provide important safeguards for the patient in relation to the detention powers exercised being proportionate and the least restrictive option mho emergency code of practice paras 18 526 the mho provides precise periods of time for each stage of compulsory admission to be reviewed and reported on by the responsible medical officer who reviews detention in the form of providing reports through completion of further prescribed forms and ultimately the review tribunal mho art 71 if these time limits are breached then detention under the mho would ordinarily lapse the mho emergency code of practice extends a number of these time limits as an example the initial period of detention under the mho is for assessment and prior to the changes introduced via the emergency provisions can last for a period of fourteen days in total from the date of admission mho arts 97 8 during this period the patient can appeal their detention to the review tribunal this assessment period has now been extended to twenty-eight days mho emergency code of practice para 34 by extending the assessment time limit there could be a delay to an appeal before the review tribunal and the implication is that a patient could be detained for longer than is necessary this again raises the prospect of a potential interference of the patients human rights on the grounds noted previously it also begs the question as to whether these time extensions are actually required in the present circumstances as there are already modifications addressing potential sickness in the workforce which allow others to step into the roles usually performed by the approved social worker and responsible medical officer it is not clear why any additional measures are required in order to ensure that the original statutory time limits are metindividual health and social care trusts must monitor the use of emergency provisions on an individual basis and prepare a report on whether or not their use was appropriate in a given set of circumstances this report is to be forwarded to the northern ireland department of health within fifty-six days following the end of the emergency period with temporary prescribed forms having been created to assist in this monitoring exercise mho emergency code of practice para 21 annex a there is also a requirement to inform the patient and the nearest relative that the emergency modifications are being used mho art 32 mho emergency code of practice paras 1921 while disclosure about the use of the provisions is to be welcomed in the interests of transparency the question is whether this retrospective monitoring will be sufficiently robust or even appropriate in terms of dealing with an issue of this magnitude namely the compulsory detention and treatment of a patient while there are few details provided as to how trusts will monitor the use of the emergency provisions in practice or justify their use it will inevitably require additional work and perhaps more staff this can hardly be the desired outcome given the objective in introducing such provisions was in large part to mitigate the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on an already depleted workforceduring the covid-19 pandemic the approach taken by uk courts and tribunals has been to minimise risk to judges tribunal members legal representatives and the parties courts and tribunals judiciary 2020a northern ireland department of justice 2020 northern ireland lord chief justices office 2020 in practice this has resulted in a shift to remote hearings where possible eg re a children remote hearings 2020 ewca civ 583 re b children remote hearing interim care order 2020 ewca civ 584 the review tribunal is an independent judicial body which hears and determines applications appealing decisions made under the mho and the mcani on specified grounds as a result of the covid-19 pandemic the tribunal has also been conducting remote hearings predominantly by telephone in the context of mental health the obvious issue is whether or not this is the appropriate environment for an acutely ill patient to challenge their detention although there has been positive support overall on the part of the uk judiciary and the legal profession for the shift towards remote hearings in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic harrison 2020 a report on a recent hearing before the court of protection which deals inter alia with dols authorisations under mental capacity legislation in england and wales called into question whether it was an equally positive experience for applicants or their family members kitzinger 2020 ruck keene 2020 clearly more empirical research is needed which examines the experiences of those challenging detention or deprivation of liberty under uk mental health and capacity laws including in northern ireland courts and tribunals judiciary 2020b this would enable a more nuanced examination of the experiences of applicants and supporting family membersfriends as well as other parties to remote hearings including whether the right to a fair trial under article 6 of the echr is engagedunder the dols regulations an application for a dols authorisation to a trust panel must contain a medical report dols regulations reg 11 while this requirement remains the mcani emergency code of practice goes on to statethere may be circumstances where it is deemed that a deprivation of liberty is necessary and not putting one in place would cause an unacceptable risk of harm to p the person if it is not reasonably possible to carry out a medical examination d the doctor can rely on the emergency provision in the absence of the additional safeguard of trust panel authorisation mcani emergency code of practice para 17the above statement presumably refers to section 56 of the mcani which sets out what constitutes an emergency this situation will arise if at the time when the doctor making the report determines what would be in the persons best interests that person a knows that the safeguard in that section is not met but reasonably believes that to delay the report until that safeguard is met would involve an unacceptable risk of harm to the person or b does not know whether the safeguard is met but reasonably believes that to delay the report until it is established whether the safeguard is met would involve an unacceptable risk of harm to the person while this does not strictly represent a change to the existing law its inclusion in the mcani emergency code of practice has the potential to be over relied upon during the covid-19 pandemic as it would lessen the burden on an already under-pressure workforce this over reliance could in turn lead to a reduction in confidence in the ability of the mcani and the dols scheme to provide safeguards and protect persons from arbitrary decision-making in line with article 5 of the echr notwithstanding claims to the contrary in the emergency codeeven prior to the emergence of the covid-19 pandemic the implementation of the dols scheme has required a substantial change in working culture for many healthcare professionals in northern ireland indeed it was recognised that training was needed to understand the nature scope and practice of the new scheme training became a legal requirement for a range of healthcare professionals who would be working in the area dols regulations reg 23 as noted previously the dols regulations provide that only suitably qualified persons are to conduct formal assessments of capacity see reg 22 however one of the changes set out in the mcani emergency code of practice is the removal of the need for the suitably qualified person making formal assessments of capacity or participating in trust panels to have relevant training and experience in capacity mcani emergency code of practice para 47 this dispensing of training and the likelihood of minimal if any practical experience in working with the dols scheme on the part of healthcare professionals who may now be called upon to provide formal capacity assessments under the emergency provisions raises the potential for incorrect interpretation and application of the dols regulations and the mcani more generallythe composition of trust panels which determine dols authorisations has now been changed under the emergency provisions as noted previously the panels are usually constituted under the dols scheme to include one medical practitioner one approved social worker and one other suitably qualified person dols regulations reg 411b the emergency provisions dispense with the requirement for a medical practitioner and an approved social worker instead allowing for any three suitably qualified persons mcani emergency code of practice para 52 bearing in mind the infancy of the dols scheme it is only the medical practitioner and the approved social worker out of the suitably qualified persons who will have had sufficient professional experience in dealing with mental health and capacity laws prior to the dols scheme coming into force with the removal of the requirement for specialised training under the emergency provisions a trust panel could conceivably be composed of three healthcare professionals from disciplines that are neither sufficiently experienced nor trained in assessing capacity under the mcani particularly with regard to what constitutes deprivation of liberty under the dols scheme the absence of experience and training raises the potential for incorrect application of the dols regulations depending on an individuals circumstances this could also raise concerns about a potential infringement of their human rights under article 5 as well as articles 2 3 and 8 of the echras with the mho emergency code of practice there is also a requirement for individual trusts to monitor the use of the mcani emergency code of practice and to report to the northern ireland department of health no later than three months following the end of the period of emergency mcani emergency code of practice para 24 as noted previously concerns about exactly how this monitoring will take place in the case of the mho emergency code of practice are also mirrored with respect to the mcani emergency codesince 2 december 2019 the review tribunal has also been empowered to review dols authorisations and applications for the appointment or removal of nominated persons under the mcani as noted previously the tribunal is currently conducting remote hearings and there are similar concerns about how such hearings will work in the context of considering applications for dols authorisations arguably matters coming before the tribunal during the covid-19 pandemic might be more serious than has been the case to date particularly where existing safeguards in relation to such applications have been relaxed under the mcani emergency code of practice this begs the question as to whether remote hearings will always be appropriate in the circumstanceswhile we have considered how the dols scheme applies in the context of the hospital setting during the covid-19 pandemic how might this apply in the case of dols authorisations outside such setting such as for residents in nursing and residential care homes it is a particularly pressing question at the current time given evidence that care homes across the uk have become hotspots for the spread of covid-19 booth 2020 coker 2020 this has proved to be particularly problematic in the northern ireland context with well over half of all covid-19 deaths in the first wave of the pandemic occurring in such settings mccormack 2020b in relation to the risk posed by covid-19 in northern ireland care homes we focus solely on dols authorisation for present purposes rather than any other potential legal issues that might arise in relation to potential civil or criminal liability or non-compliance with quality assurance requirements rqia northern ireland 2020 erwin 2020in focusing on this particular issue it would be important to take account of both patients lacking capacity who have been discharged from a hospital to what is known as a step-down facility such as a care home and those persons lacking capacity who are already resident in such facilities in the first case the initial rationale for the hospital discharge may have been that the person was likely to be at much less risk of contracting covid-19 in addition to the fact that the discharge was likely to create additional bed capacity for those suffering from covid-19 who require hospital admission propper stoye  zaranko 2020 whilst an inpatient the person would most likely to have been subject to a dols authorisation on the basis of a best interests assessment that they did not have capacity to recognise their current care needs however in the event of a transfer to a care home there would be an urgent need to revisit the dols authorisation for that person in order to establish whether suitable safeguards were in place including those addressing the risk of covid-19 infectionin relation to persons lacking capacity already resident in northern ireland care homes many are elderly which is a recognised high-risk group for contracting covid-19 as discussed previously the relative infancy of the dols scheme means that it may be the case that some such residents do not as yet have the relevant dols authorisation in place where this is the case it could lead to a prima facie assertion that care homes would be in breach of the mcani and the dols regulations however care homes could seek to rely upon mcani emergency provisions providing protection from liability even if additional safeguards have not been met in the particular circumstances this would be on the grounds that all reasonable steps had been taken to put such safeguards in place persons in charge of care homes where the person has been deprived of their liberty would need to be able to establish that they have a reasonable belief that the person lacks capacity that it is in their best interests to deprive them of their liberty and that the prevention of serious harm condition has been met mcani ss 911 6567 dols code of practice 2019 chapters 4 7 paras 717720 10 where this has been satisfied then the deprivation of liberty could be treated as authorised even if this had not as yet been formally authorised by a trust panel although it would be expected that an application for dols application would be made as soon as possible as highlighted previously it would be important to reach this decision on a case-by-case basis involving an individual residents circumstances rather than those in charge of care homes using this as a general approach for not putting safeguards in place to manage the risk posed to residents from covid-19 northern ireland department of health 2020cgiven the exponential rise in infections and deaths from covid-19 of residents in care homes in northern ireland a more pressing question is whether the barring of visits by family members andor their continued residence in such facilities represents a potential infringement of their human rights under articles 2 3 5 and 8 of the echr in terms of family visits a recent judgment by the court of protection england  wales found there was no interference in an elderly residents rights under articles 5 and 8 in light of the refusal on the part of the care home to reinstate in-person family visits and to instead only permit indirect contact given the risk posed by covid-19 the court found that this approach represented a balanced and proportionate way forward in the circumstances bp v surrey county council  anor 2020 ewcop 17 at 36 per hayden j in another case an application was made alleging interference with articles 5 and 8 arising from a care homes refusal to allow an elderly terminally ill resident who lacked capacity to leave the facility in order to be cared for at her daughters home in this case the court of protection decided that the resident should be able to live with her family on the basis of a best interests assessment under s 4 of the mental capacity act 2005 uk public general acts 2005 c 9 the court also found that the refusal on the part of the care home to allow the resident to leave the facility represented a disproportionate interference with her article 8 rights in handing down judgment justice lieven was at pains to make clear that no arguments had been put to the court that the resident should not be allowed to leave the care home because of the risk posed by covid-19 or that the public interest in not allowing her to leave the home outweighed her best interests or article 8 rights ve v ao by her litigation friend the official solicitor the royal borough of greenwich and south east london ccg 2020 ewcop 23 at 3442 per lieven jboth cases were decided in the absence of covid-19 testing being available to residents in the care homes in question at the time so the court of protection was unable to reach a conclusion as the extent of the risk posed to the residents as well as to those caring for them notwithstanding a call by the northern ireland deputy first minister for universal testing to be instituted in care homes in early may it appears that it will take until the end of june 2020 for this to be completed bbc news 2020b bbc news 2020c this stands in stark contrast to the position in ireland for example where all such testing had been completed by may 2020 mcmahon 2020 as highlighted previously the reported death rate in care homes has been an escalating problem which suggests that residents in such facilities might bear the brunt of the first wave of the covid-19 epidemic in northern ireland without further pro-active intervention it raises serious concerns about the extent to which public authorities per s 6 human rights act 1998 with responsibility for northern ireland care homes have taken appropriate preventative measures to protect residents from the deadly risk posed by covid-19 pursuant to the right to life under article 2 of the echrduring the first wave of the covid-19 pandemic in northern ireland hundreds of people have died from the disease with residents in care homes being disproportionately represented in the overall death toll it is to be hoped that the combination of an expanded covid-19 community testing programme and the implementation of a contact tracing strategy will now result in a better understanding of the nature and extent of the spread of the disease in northern ireland northern ireland department of health 2020a this will enable a more pro-active approach to be taken to controlling the spread of covid-19 in the community as well as anticipating subsequent waves in the future as noted previously the northern ireland executive has also now published its strategy for easing lockdown measures as well as its coronavirus recovery plan setting out the guidelines that will inform its approach notwithstanding such plan the need for caution remains given persisting uncertainty about the ongoing risk posed by covid-19 to the northern ireland population while an effective vaccine to inoculate the population against the virus would bring more certainty to the situation it is unlikely that this will be forthcoming in the short to medium term thompson 2020in the circumstances the changes made to northern ireland mental health and capacity laws through emergency legislation look set to stay in place for the foreseeable future and up to a maximum of two years with the length of time these changes are likely be in place there is always a danger of mission creep whereby what was initially viewed as a temporary measure in a time of public health emergency becomes a normalised part of everyday practice in the field of mental health this should be resisted as what they represent is a deviation from accepted legislative parameters involving matters such as involuntary treatment and detention and deprivation of liberty for persons assessed as lacking capacity such parameters were agreed following extensive stakeholder consultation as well as detailed executive and parliamentary reviews in the lead up to the adoption of the mcani in 2016much of the legislative focus in responding to the first wave of the covid-19 pandemic in northern ireland has been on addressing concerns about health and social care workforce shortages and resources as well as meeting hospital surge capacity however it is important that action taken by key decision-makers as a result of changes made under emergency legislation constitute a necessary proportionate and least restrictive response in the circumstances in this regard the northern ireland assembly as well as its specialist committees the committee for health and the ad hoc committee on the covid-19 response have an important role to play the mcani is in the early stages of implementation with the majority of the provisions yet to come into force it will therefore be some time before the long-nurtured vision of an innovative internationally leading piece of legislation which fuses both capacity and mental health law across all medical specialities in health and social care is fully operational with the world watching it is important that political leaders in northern ireland provide sufficient financial support and resources to allow for the realisation of this vision this is in addition to ensuring that the changes made to mental health and capacity laws through emergency legislation to address the covid-19 pandemic are only in place for as long as is absolutely necessary and that adequate human rights protections remain in place during this period for those assessed as lacking capacity in northern ireland

values we will seecdc is encouraging limiting events and meetings that require close contact if there is no outbreak and cancel large meetings or events during an outbreak and also plan for distance and digital learning in the universities they also advice monitoring absenteeism and assess ways to increase physical space between students and limit interactions4545cdc 2020 coronavirus covd-19 online website u2a06 accessed 14 april 2020 many universities are closed their campuses to students and went through digital learning in covid-19 outbreak but still some allow researchers to go on in many countries universities are autonomous so in turkey they are not under ministry of education nor a ministry of higher education exist but there is the council of higher education cohe yk which is the constitutionally governing body responsible for strategic planning coordinating supervising and monitoring of universities in turkey the cohe has been following the outbreak from the first time on and closely monitor roadmaps of official authorities and successful universities of the designated countries in europe america and the far east when the outbreak did not reach to turkey yet measures to be taken in higher education institutions about covid-19 were released under three titles which are focusing on infection prevention measures while attending national and international meetings and also avoiding stigma on 6th of march 2020 table 54646yk 2020 measures to be taken in higher education institutions about covid-19 online website u2a08 accessed 14 april 2020when the first cases of

directed to the universities experienced in this field and their infrastructure was strengthened  cohe courses programs yokdersleriyokgovtr was created these resources are combination of entertainment and academic material the enhancement recommendations were submitted concerning the staff and personal rights of healthcare professionals working in university hospitals which are important for health education to the government and these enhancements were supported and necessary arrangements were made the students are allowed to suspend their studies or postpone their enrollmentalthough the universities can use distance learning methods synchronously or asynchronously in all courses in formal education programs the practices for different programs and clinical practices for the medical school students are concerning about the students and trainees involvement in the care of covid-19 patients are important issues to be solved for different universities in usa the high probability that medical students in the hospital would be exposed to outbreak cases and the need to conserve ppe seemed to outweigh the educational benefits of students participation the association of american medical colleges recommended that member schools suspend clinical rotations for medical students for several weeks 67 in turkey although all formal education in campuses are suspended in the universities the medical schools are allowed to make their own decision about last year medical students to continue or not to their clinical practices also voluntarily work within the hospitals are

covid-194949harvard university 2020 coronavirus covd-19 online website httpswwwharvardeducoronavirus accessed 10 april 2020 the universities and other higher education institutions play extremely important role because they can help to slow the spread of the outbreak improve guidelines save the society and keep them in a physiologically safe mood publish papers run webinars work with local health departments invent new tools for the diagnosis and make research on the virus and potential vaccines etc the national authorities also provide sources with the help of academicians and for helping the academicians as an example besides funding researches the turkish scientific and technological research council of turkey tbtak opened a portal about covid-19 which is very useful for being update in a pandemican outbreak can emerge all of a sudden or sometimes there may be signs of it beforehand active surveillance infection control measures are extremely important but may be not enough all the times usually there are local guidelines for institutional roles in case of an outbreak mainly guided by local health and governor authorities in case of a pandemic controlling the outbreak is a much bigger problem and difficult issue in a pandemic there are no borders anymore each country could be affected from others decisions and infection control measures the world population will be under risk of similar agent regardless of their citizenships countries or welt all national and international institutions should be connected with each other work together share experience publish guideline for general population heath care facilities local authorities public service facilities students etc in turkeys case the ministry of health the council of higher education the ministry of education and all other institutions response to the current pandemic can be a model for future studies hopefully continuously after the end of pandemic the covid-19 advisory committee which consists of professionals from different areas was extremely important to monitor the outbreak and provide advices after evaluating updated informationorganizations like who and unesco are extremely important to keep the countries updated share different countries measures and show the global aspect they have to be clear and transparent in each step not to lost the trust of the populations besides their informative roles managing bridges between different countries and providing the important supplies like ppe and hygiene products to those countries in need are extremely important roles in a pandemic health protection agencies and cdc like institutions have leader roles guiding the authorities about the virus characteristics reading the outbreak curve measures to be taken etc health ministries of countries should guide the operational plans in different levels other ministries should follow the advices and proposals to manage their routine work in a pandemic era educational institutions primary and secondary schools should continue to connect with their students not to lost even a year for a generation in a pandemic universities should not suspend their

ankara city hospital a hospital with 3810 total hospital beds and 696 icu bedsthe novel coronavirus covid-19 was first detected in wuhan china in late 2019 and within months had upended much of the normative activities of daily economic social and governmental life the criminal justice system was not spared as virtually all aspects of the american legal system were faced with increased logistical and public health concerns overnight the strain on criminal justice was felt perhaps nowhere as acutely as in new york city the epicenter of the outbreak where the nypd to date may 25 2020 has lost 43 officers with another 5793 testing positive for covid-19 police and correctional officers have become front-line workers during the pandemic with heightened exposure to high-risk situations and locations often lacking the requisite personal protective equipment ppe necessary to reduce potential exposure contact with the public combined with the health dangers posed by correctional and detention facilities generally have placed these workers squarely in the midst of a system-wide crisis in a may 2020 survey of 32 state health departments the cdc reports that at least 4893 inmates and 2778 staff have been diagnosed with covid-19 while 88 and 15 respectively have been lost to the virus across 420 separate prisons and jails cdc 2020 the numbers are almost certainly higherthe immigration system similarly has been impacted by covid-19 this is especially true given the criminalization of immigration processes more generally in recent years nowhere is this more so the case than in immigrant detention policies and practices immigrant detention a practice rarely utilized during most of the twentieth century has increased since the 1980s and reached its peak during the trump administration tens of thousands of immigrants are currently being held in detention facilities and local jails on any given day far exceeding the number of beds reported by the department of homeland security dhs these conditions are ripe for spread of communicable diseases and indeed early reports indicate that these detention facilities may be hidden covid-19 hotspotslegal activity related to immigration policy and practice if anything has increased during the pandemic with lawsuits being filed by detainees staff and legal organizations on behalf of immigrants the aclu alone has filed 90 legal actions regarding covid-19 including state and city chapters that have filed lawsuits against us immigration and customs enforcement ice detention centers and processing centers in california maryland massachusetts michigan ohio pennsylvania texas and washington aclu 2020a 2020b as early as march 2020 a federal court in harrisburg pa ruled that ice must release 10 individuals who had sued on the basis of being at high risk of contracting coronavirus aclu-pa 2020 similar decisions were handed down in new jersey and massachusetts in april 2020 a federal judge in california ordered an ice detention facility to release detainees and facilitate social distancing kopetman 2020 a ruling followed by a federal judge in miami who ordered three ice facilities in south florida to release detainees due to the pandemic madan 2020a most recently another federal judge ordered the government to better explain why it had yet to release more than 350 parents and children from three family detention centers merchant 2020on march 15 a coalition of immigration system functionaries including judges attorneys and ice officers sent a letter to the us department of justice requesting an emergency closure of the nations immigration courts brennan center 2020 subsequently a lawsuit was brought to suspend in-person immigration court processing during the outbreak a petition denied by a federal judge in washington dc kruzel 2020 the judge ruled that since the immigration system writ large had already modified its practices and protocols in light of covid-19 no sweeping stoppage of cases was warrantedthe coronavirus outbreak has also provided the trump administration with a pretext for alterations to existing immigration policies early on in the outbreak dhs moved to close the southern border immediately removing any migrants encountered by cbp by sending them back to mexico or central america within about two hours those from other nations are transferred to ice for rapid deportation including those potentially seeking asylum and children associated press 2020 this order was first issued in march and has since been renewed in april and may the latter of which notably had no end date on may 19 2020 the doj asked the 9th circuit court of appeals to replace the flores agreement which would allow the administration to modify the rules governing the detention of migrant children and families in dhs facilities though this too was predicated on stopping the spread of the coronavirus the administration announced as early as 2019 its desire to modify the court settlement flores was what also was used to justify family separation policies in 2018 stracqualursi et al 2019 due to the public health and economic threat posed by the virus the administration has also suspended immigration to the us for at least 60 days beginning in april to limit competition for jobs associated press 2020the legal issues discussed above are myriad and dynamic impacting various aspects of the immigration system from lawful immigration to asylum seekers and refugees to unaccompanied children and detention center conditions while each of these deserve full empirical attention this paper focuses on three particular areas of immigration policy and practice during covid ice enforcement actions immigrant detention and deportations we summarize the current state of extant data and evidence on each of these and examine questions that remain for further researchon march 18th 2020 ice announced that it would cease enforcement actions during covid-19 except for individuals who have committed crimes or pose a threat to public safety in an effort to decrease the spread of the virus and to encourage those who need medical attention to seek it specifically ice stated that during the covid-19 crisis ice will not carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities such as hospitals doctors offices accredited health clinics and emergent or urgent care facilities except in the most extraordinary of circumstancesindividuals should not avoid seeking medical care because they fear civil immigration enforcement ice 2020 ice also temporarily suspended in-person reporting requirements as well as home visitations despite this announcement ice conducted immigration raids in states such as california even after the governor had declared a state of emergency and issued a stay at home order los angeles times 2020 though it did make fewer arrests in april compared to march ice still conducted operations leading to the arrest of at least 80 people in the los angeles area alone perrett 2020other ice enforcement actions since the start of the coronavirus pandemic have taken place as well including an arrest of an 18-year-old on his birthday residing in an office of refugee resettlement shelter in westchester ny sidahmed 2020 this individual was then transferred to immigrant detention at a nearby county correctional facility at the height of new yorks coronavirus surge residents in san diego and riverside counties in southern california report increased border patrol checkpoints along i-15 a major throughway running north through the state from the mexican border as well as checkpoints along state roads increased use of roving patrols and at least four arrests since march 23 have also been reported to the media srikrishnan 2020in the weeks prior to the march 18th announcement reports surfaced that immigrants were being targeted at hospitals courthouses and their childrens school burness and hindi 2020 lanard 2020 the miami herald reported that new arrests continued throughout the end of march including for those with non-criminal offenses madan 2020b these arrests were particularly notable as these individuals were then detained in several south florida detention facilities which have since become plagued with coronavirus these facilities have also been the target of legal action and ordered by the federal courts to release detainees due to unsafe conditions madan 2020athough ice pledged to limit enforcement actions during the pandemic the current situation in its detention facilities are significantly impacted by the administrations immigration crackdown in early 2020 when new york for example saw initial court appearances double in february and march compared to the december and january in the weeks prior to the march 18th announcement ice ramped up enforcement actions including a march 6 raid in new rochelle ny just hours before the area being designated a containment zone by governor andrew cuomo devereaux 2020 major ice operations were also carried out in michigan and ohio in early february well after coronavirus had gotten a foothold in the us warikoo 2020prior to covid 19 a growing body of evidence was accumulating that immigrants are exposed to dangerously poor health conditions and services within ice detention centers immigrant adults and children in detention centers experience detrimental physical and mental health outcomes as do family units and households outside the immigration detention centers long 2018 ornelas et al 2020 for example detained immigrants have increased levels of musculoskeletal gastrointestinal respiratory and neurologic symptoms while being detained and also commonly experienced anxiety depression posttraumatic stress disorder difficulty with relationships and self-harming behavior immigration detention itself undermines family authority and ability to respond to their childrens needs this difficulty is complicated by parental mental health problems in more extreme cases immigrants mortality and death have been associated with being detained long 2018 ornelas et al 2020a 2018 report titled code red the fatal consequences of dangerously substandard medical care in immigration detention reviewed fifteen deaths that occurred in ice detention between december 2015 and april 2017 long 2018 with the help of medical experts the report concludes that in more than half of those cases substandard medical care including unreasonable delays botched emergency responses and poor practitioner care contributed to the deaths many have argued that because immigration detention centers are private the lack of transparent policy health procedures and practices contribute to poor health conditions and services common in these detention centers ackerman and furman 2013 hernndez et al 2018 others suggest that poor health conditions and services are common in immigration detention centers because of the social political and cultural construction as undocumented or illegal immigrants are inherently criminal who do not warrant public healthcare attention and care ackerman and furman 2013 miller and peguero 2018 zarrugh 2020 this leads us to our question for this section are immigration dentition centers a shrouded hotspot for covid-19although the situation changes on a daily basis ongoing reports indicate that this system of inadequate medical access care and resulting poor health conditions and outcomes has only been exacerbated by covid-19 because the demand for medical needs are greater for everyone generally the gap between need and supply has only become more apparent in detention centers it is especially dire for people in such facilities given that exposure to the virus can lead to relatively quick and life-threatening consequences like many facilities tasked with providing medical care these detention facilities must now concern themselves with need for covid tests personal protective equipment like gloves and masks and increased access to medical treatments such as oxygen and ventilatorsdue to the highly contagious nature of covid-19 the crowded conditions of detention centers exacerbates the situation placing those held in these facilities at greater risk for contracting and spreading the virus this is true for those who are detained as well as employees at these facilities as of this articles writing ices website reports that as of may 11 2020 there are 29675 people being detained with 869 confirmed covid-19 cases with 1686 having been tested the website states that 42 ice employees working at detention centers have confirmed cases numbers are updated on ices website under the tab confirmed cases httpswwwicegovcoronavirusthe heightened risk at detention centers can be evaluated in more concrete terms against cdc guidelines in short detention centers cannot meet those basic general guidelines social distancing of an ideal six feet is impossible to implement within detention centers given the spatial and physical limitations this inability also means that if someone at a detention center an employee or a detainee contracts the virus the likelihood of spread is increased along with the potential speed and magnitude of spread the danger of the situation is intensified in that many people may be asymptomatic carriers and spread the virus without knowing johns hopkins university 2020 in cramped quarters by the time symptoms start to show many may have already been infected additionally people who are detained have limited ability to use disease prevention measures like hand-washing both due to access and supplies it is harder to practice medical isolation which the cdc defines as confining a confirmed or suspected covid-19 case ideally to a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes to prevent contact with others and to reduce the risk of transmission ncird 2020 and it is more difficult to institute a quarantine which the cdc defines as the practice of confining individuals who have had close contact with a covid-19 case to determine whether they develop symptoms of the disease ncird 2020acknowledging that facilities like jails prisons and detention centers possess significant impediments to these recommendations the cdc has produced the article interim guidance on management of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in correctional and detention facilities ncird 2020 in it guidance for correctional and detention facilities is organized into three sections 1 operational preparedness which aims to prepare a facility for the situation of transmission of covid-19 into the facility 2 prevention which concerns preventing the spread from outside to inside of the facility and 3 management of covid-19 which describes how to manage confirmed and suspected casesyet still numerous reports internal strikes and resulting lawsuits indicate that many facilities fail to meet these guidelines per the lancet ice facilities do not have the staffing capacity or facilities to screen quarantine to monitor for symptoms isolate infected individuals or deliver medical management in a setting with high rate of infection meyer et al 2020 other reports have found a lack of needed supplies and ppe such as cleaning supplies masks gloves trevizo 2020 and some have noted that detainees are not being given ppe nor are they being tested even when they are sick and showing symptoms of covid-19 lippa 2020 detainees have reported that access to soap hand sanitizer and disinfecting equipment is very limited or non-existent montoya-galvez 2020das a result of these conditions detainees at facilities across the country have organized related strikes and protests some examples include hunger strikes that have been organized across california including a 200 person strike at otay mesa detention center in san diego where at the time 120 detainees had confirmed cases plevin 2020 and a strike at adelanto ice processing center prompted by staffs failure to provide detainees ppe including masks gloves and cleaning supplies castillo 2020 protests have also been organized in detention centers in louisiana montoya-galvez 2020d and at least five hunger strikes have taken place at an ice processing center in pearsall texas alone  some because detainees are asking for information as detainees have reported being given false information about numbers and not being told about who has the virus and some for greater testing after positive cases trevizo 2020since the spatial parameters of detention centers precludes the cdc guidelines of medical isolation and quarantining many are instead using a practice of cohorting which refers to isolating cases in groups and quarantining groups of people together who have possibly been exposed while the cdc outlines this practice in its guidelines for detention centers it is intended as a last resort one federal lawsuit has already been filed which alleges immigration officials are violating cdc guidelines by using cohorting instead of releasing immigrant detainees where possible joffe-block and fernndez 2020a since immigration detention is a civil and not criminal matter ice has the broad authority to release its detainees including by placing them in programs in which officials monitor them through ankle bracelets or check-ins montoya-galvez 2020f and many similar lawsuits have been filed pushing for releasesas of may 15 2020 the aclu website states that it has filed 90 legal actions regarding covid-19 wwwacluorg these include state and city chapters that have filed lawsuits against ice detention centers and processing centers in california maryland massachusetts michigan ohio pennsylvania texas and washington american civil liberties union 2020a american civil liberties union 2020b aclu massachusetts 2020 aclu pennsylvania 2020 carmody 2020 coleman 2020 hancock 2020 morrissey 2020 an ongoing list of other organizations also filing lawsuits includes the university of miami school of laws immigration clinic the southern poverty law center rapid defense network legal aid service of broward county and the law firm of prada urizar pllc splc 2020 many of these lawsuits are seeking the release of detainees some with focus on high risk groups other groups like the new york lawyers for public interest nylpi have published reports documenting the poor conditions of detention centers and the increased urgency of these conditions in this era of covid-19 the nylpi report still detained and denied found serious often life-threatening deficiencies in the medical care provided to new yorkers in area immigration detention centers nylpi 2020 federal judges in some states have allowed for the release of small numbers of detainees who are at high risk for contracting the virus but many advocacy groups and lawmakers say it is not enough to address the dangerous conditions in which detainees are being forced to exist montoya-galvez 2020c at the end april a group of 26 senators signed a letter calling on the department of homeland security to investigate ice detention facilities to assess whether they have adopted necessary guidelines in regard to covid-19 us sentator d feinstein 2020reports suggest a lack of transparency when it comes to number of confirmed cases some inaccuracy comes from the testing rate only about 5 of the population of people detained have been tested trevizo 2020 some reports note ices initial unwillingness to share numbers about cases and that it took lawsuits to prompt ice to share this information splc 2020 other reports highlight instances in which ice has released information that is later contradicted thus leading to questions about the accuracy of information provided joffe-block and fernndez 2020b lack of transparency is a similar issue for employee cases while ice reports numbers of confirmed cases among its employees at detention centers this does not include the many other employees at these facilities who are not directly employed by ice those who work for the county or private health care companies etc gomez et al 2020detainees are also facing greater impediments to having their concerns heard and their experiences during the pandemic shared some detention centers are requiring lawyers to bring their own ppe to meet detainees gomez et al 2020 and many facilities do not have teleconferencing that allows for confidentiality due to unsecure connections or having to have conversations in earshot of employees gomez et al 2020 reports have also been surfacing about liability waivers detainees being required to sign liability waivers in exchange for ppe democracy now 2020 proctor 2020 rivlin-nadler 2020 and detainees being coerced into signing a paperwork that provides a positive evaluation of conditions in the detention center acevedo 2020 ice has also been minimizing and in cases outright denying some of the aforementioned strikes and protests in detention centers despite reports and evidence otherwise brown 2020 castillo 2020beginning in the 1980s immigration law reforms merged practices from criminal law and justice with immigration law and enforcement the cumulative effect of which was to create a murky area in which immigration policing practices and court processes are not regulated by the constitutional protections afforded to individuals within the criminal justice system garca hernndez 2013 namely the 4th search and seizure 5th due process and 6th right to counsel amendments individuals within 100 miles of us international borders may be subjected to warrantless searches chacn 2010 noncitizens can legally be deported without judicial review menjvar et al 2018 though immigrants appearing in immigration court technically have a right to counsel the immigration courts are in no way obligated to provide them with counsel if they do not provide their own most are unable eagly and shafer 2015this trend towards the tightening of immigration allowances while limiting protections increased under the obama administration as was evidenced through an upsurge in detention and deportation miller and peguero 2018 ricciardelli et al 2019 yet under the trump administration the rate of detentions and deportations has escalated to unprecedented levels policies enacted in the past three years that have contributed to this increase include promotion of a us southern border wall implementation of zero-tolerance which ordered the separation of children from their families and their subsequent detainment without a clear means to facilitate reunion deployment of 5000 us soldiers to the southern border and sanctioned use of teargas on children and families trying to cross and industrial tent facilities that housed over 3000 separated children adolescents without due process hernndez et al 2018 van hook and glick 2020 zarrugh 2020 it is important to note these policies and lack of protections for context as we move into our final considerations first how immigration policies both prior to covid-19 and under its guise are accelerating the us towards a near total dismantling of protections for immigrant men women children and families second through implementation of these policies is the us government spreading and deporting covid-19since march 21 2020 the southern border of the united states has been in effect sealed the day before the centers for disease control and prevention cdc had issued a largely unnoticed but sweeping order authorizing the summary expulsion of noncitizens arriving at the border without valid documents guttentag 2020 by application of a medical quarantine authorization the order supersedes the protections of the immigration and refugee laws through the use of an unreviewable border patrol health expulsion mechanism unrelated to any finding of disease or contagion guttentag 2020 in the six weeks between the order and the beginning of may the us expelled over 20000 migrants montoya-galvez 2020a through either deportation to their country of citizenship or for cross-border migrants by processing and then returning them to mexico or canada montoya-galvez 2020b a process that takes on average 96 min hernndez and miroff 2020 access to us immigration courts is denied as is the opportunity to file a claim for humanitarian protection montoya-galvez 2020a individuals seeking refuge through asylum and unaccompanied children groups that are normally protected by both us and international law have been pointedly targeted in the enforcement of this measurebetween 2016 and 2018 the us government initiated two immigration policies that were designed to function as barriers specifically to migrants seeking asylum metering and the migrant protection protocols mpp according to the immigration and nationality act ina any alien who is physically present in the united states or who arrives in the united states whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the united states after having been interdicted in international or united states waters irrespective of such aliens status may apply for asylum immigration and nationality act 1952 the practice of metering contrary to the ina works by requiring all requests for asylum to cross the border at a port of entry and then limiting the number of people who are able to access asylum at each port of entry frederick 2019 american immigration council 2020a guards at these border crossings direct individuals who are barred from the process to a point-person on the mexican side of the border where his or her name is placed on a waiting list the backlog of which can require days or months of waiting in mexico with daily check-ins regarding an individuals list status lu and watkins 2019 under mpp or the remain in mexico program if access to make a claim of asylum is granted the individual is given notice to appear in immigration court and then as the program title suggests returned to mexico to await the court date american immigration council 2020ain 2019 over 60000 people were returned to mexico under mpp miroff 2020 as a result improvised camps have sprung up along the border in mexico outside of ports of entry camps that are lacking in basic sanitation reliable access to medical services food or water sources and security glass et al 2019 the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr has issued a statement that they are prepared to fold them under their protection and management as refugee camps van fossen 2020 and yet the us and mexico have both been unwilling to declare the situation on the border officially an emergency the mechanism required for the unhcr to take over van fossen 2020 unhcr refugee status would allow for three broad protections 1 basic needs in the form of shelter and security 2 the implementation of infrastructure necessary to support large-scale health initiatives and 3 access to a lawyer van fossen 2020 mexicos stated reasoning for denying the unhcr is they do not want permanent settlements glass et al 2019 the united states logic is less well-defined unless juxtaposed next to the goal of ending asylum along the southern border according to elora mukherjee professor of law and director of the immigrants rights clinic at columbia law school given the complexity of immigration law and language and cultural barriers the process of seeking asylum when someone is in the united states is hard enough requiring asylum seekers to remain in mexico makes navigating the process virtually impossible as it severely limits migrants access to legal counsel mukherjee 2020 only 4 of those who remain in mexico under mpp have been able to access a lawyer mukherjee 2020 in 2018 the year before mpp was enacted the us granted asylum to 13248 people miroff 2020 as of december of 2019 one year after mpp began 29309 cases had been processed and 187 people were granted asylum mukherjee 2020until the public health order of march 20th 2020 one group that was exempt from the asylum processes discussed above was that of unaccompanied minors defined by us law to be a child who is under the age of 18 has no lawful immigration status and either does not have a parent or legal guardian in the united states or that parentlegal guardian is unable to care for them homeland security act of 2002 resulting from the us supreme court decision reno v flores the flores agreement set standards of legal protections for unaccompanied minors in the custody of us immigration agencies wu 2018 these standards were codified by the william wilberforce trafficking victims protection reauthorization acts of 2000 tvpra reauthorized in 2003 2005 2008 and 2013 under tvpra unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries must be transferred from cbpice custody to health and human services hhs office of refugee resettlement orr within three days montoya-galvez 2020b orr is mandated to keep the minors in the least restrictive setting until they can be released to either family members or approved sponsors while they wait for their immigration court proceedings cheatham 2020 under tvpra dhs is mandated to the greatest extent practicable that unaccompanied children in hhs custody have counsel  not only to represent them in legal proceedings but to protect them from mistreatment exploitation and trafficking american immigration council 2020b in march of 2020 orr received 1852 from cbp custody in april that number fell to just 58 montoya-galvez 2020g understanding the scope of this issue is challenging due to the same transparency issues discussed previously in the section on detention under covid-19 the number of children specifically unaccompanied minors who have been expelled under cdc order is not reported by the dhs though multiple news sources have put that number for the month of april between 400 and 700 children montoya-galvez 2020a guttentag and bertozzi 2020 though immigration officials in guatemala have reported receiving 417 minors alone from us custody since march otoole and carcamo 2020anow under the covid-19 public health order the asylum system is in effect shut down for both accompanied minors and adults the mpp courts have been closed through june 19 2020 though that date could easily be pushed back us department of justice 2020 many of those awaiting asylum hearings are forced to continue to wait in the border camps discussed above without access to basic needs or medical services like the detention centers the camp conditions are primed for the proliferation and rampant spread of the virus the legality of such a closure has been questioned by immigrant rights groups and legal experts guttentag 2020 the one avenue to protection that remains open is through the convention against torture cat miroff 2020 a form

immigration courts prevented the placement of children with foster families and turned away hundreds of unaccompanied minors at the border ice air the transportation arm of immigration and customs enforcement ice responsible for arranging transportation and deportation of immigrants by air is part of the pre-coronavirus system that has continued to function with efficiency since march these deportations are pulling individuals from detention facilities where as discussed previously both physical structures and covid-19 cohorting policies provide a perfect storm for rapid spread of the disease and the scope of disease incidence is not well known due to limited testing thus far one out of every two people who have been tested had positive results though as of this writing that accounts for less than 57 of detainees ice 2020 since president trump declared covid-19 a national emergency on march 13 2020 united states government 2020 a good deal of evidence exists to suggest that the united states the epicenter for coronavirus is actively exporting the disease particularly to central america and the caribbeanwhile statistics on the number of detainees who have been deported through ice air since the us declaration of a national emergency are not publicly available an analysis conducted by the center for economic policy and research determined that between march 15th and april 24th ice air made 71 flights collectively to guatemala honduras el salvador brazil nicaragua ecuador haiti and the dominican republic johnston 2020 as of april 17 2020 the ice screening process for detainees boarding ice air flights consisted of a temperature check in the flight line those with a fever above 99 degrees are removed for medical evaluation us immigration and customs

2020 otoole and carcamo 2020b guatemala has gone so far as to stop deportations from the us three times first on march 17th by suspending all incoming flights in order to create the space and time for both their government and the us government to establish health protocols to help them address the covid-19 deportation crisis mcdonnell et al 2020 madan and charles 2020 as of late april the us began testing immigrants prior to deportation narea 2020 but as noted above the testing is in no way comprehensive the danger covid-19 poses to health systems in countries with already vulnerable public health infrastructure is both direct and potentially catastrophic it will overwhelm marginal economic systems further exacerbating living conditions that demand of many that they must migrate in order to survivethe issues examined here confirm three realities for the us immigration system first despite a stated moratorium on ice enforcement ie police actions issued in march agents continue to conduct immigration raids set up checkpoints and make arrests while ice cautioned that it would continue to take action against undocumented immigrants that pose a public safety risk the criminal records of many of those targeted are hardly what one might expect to justify police raids during a pandemic eg drunk driving drug possession there are also reports of ice detaining other immigrants along with the original targets of the raids including family members or associates that are simply nearby these anecdotes coupled with a distrust of ice more generally has reportedly led to widespread fear that these continued enforcement actions may prevent the sick from seeking medical treatment if they are undocumentedevidence to date also indicates that ice detention facilities are likely shrouded covid-19 hotspots insofar as detention facilities generally are unable to adhere to cdc guidelines and testing is limited and sporadic it is improbable that these locations can effectively detect and control the virus when it is present indeed a litany of legal actions have been undertaken to remedy some of the most obvious problems and facilities in the ice detention system though the agency generally has been slow to respond to these directives moreover there is evidence that instead of releasing detainees many are simply shuffled around to other facilities with more space available in some cases such as in south florida these receiving facilities have already experienced a covid outbreakfinally data gathered to date indicate that deportations have continued during the pandemic and the asylum system has been in effect dismantled by the administrations response these deportations are concerning for at least two main reasons first that the us continues to violate its own and international law regarding asylum claims second that us policy is contributing to the spread of coronavirus throughout latin america and the caribbean as noted above deportees to haiti mexico jamaica guatemala and columbia have already tested positive for the virus upon arrival in their home countries mohammed et al 2020 and 23 of guatemalas coronavirus cases have been traced directly to the covid-positive status of returned detainees montoya-galvez 2020e as additional data are gathered there are sure to be further cases linked to the us immigration systemthough the production and acquisition of empirical data related to covid-19 and the immigration system are in its infancy this paper sought to highlight how covid-19 global pandemic has changed our current understanding of the relationships between immigration policy and justice in the us it is also important to note that we are only in the initial stages and logically the beginning of even understanding or hypothesizing how covid-19 will impact us immigration policy and justice as well as how other nations attempt to grapple with the complexities of immigration and justice during a pandemic the emerging reports arguments and conceptualizations of us immigration and justice discussed here only highlights the important advances to be made towards better understanding the correlates contexts and interactions of us immigration policy and justice during a global pandemic we encourage future research to further expand our evidence-based understanding of how covid-19 has impacted us immigration policies and practices particularly in regard to the pursuit of justice but more importantly it is vital to utilize evidence-based research to pursue just us immigration policies and practices in this covid-19 erain december 2019 a major outbreak of viral pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus started in wuhan china 1-3 the disease caused by this novel virus has been named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who 4 the disease has spread widely throughout china followed by other countries worldwide and it is now considered a pandemic 5-9 as the disease spread in the communities has increased many of the infected persons may not have an obvious history of exposure 10 the rapid rate of spread confirms the highly infectious nature of the novel coronavirus which is transmitted from person to person by means of droplets direct contact and inhaled air 11given that early detection and isolation of covid-19 cases could potentially decrease the spread rate initial efforts focused on the use of chest ct in the forefront of diagnosis in addition to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr testing 12 most common ct features of covid-19 include multilobar ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation in the periphery of the lungs 13-16 although early studies evaluating the clinical performance of chest ct obtained at initial presentation in the city of wuhan china showed high sensitivity 17 it is still questionable if chest ct should have any role in routine screening for covid-19 in patients with suspected infection therefore the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the performance of chest ct in patients under investigation for covid-19 from two centers in the province of henan china which is located near the center of this pandemicthis analysis was retrospective and approved by the relevant institutional review boards the need for written patient consent was waived the authors reviewed the medical records from 103 patients who were considered under investigation for covid-19 between january 21 2020 and february 14 2020 from two areas in henan province china the inclusion criteria of patient under investigation are summarized in table 1 4 the following exclusion criteria was applied 1 a person with a history of fever for more than 14 days but without symptoms and signs for acute respiratory infection ari or exposure history within 14 days 2 a person with history of ari for more than 14 days but without exposure history 3 a person with history of ari within 14 days but without exposure history laboratory tests or other examination providing sufficient evidence to exclude covid-19 eg other respiratory viruses including influenza a h1n1 h3n2 h7n9 influenza b respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza adenovirus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers all patients under investigation were kept in hospital for at least 2 weeks rt-pcr tests performed on throat-swab sputum or alveolar lavage fluid specimens in all patients were used as the standard of reference in this study rt-pcr testing was performed within 3 days after initial chest ct scanning for those who showed initially negative rt-pcr results repeat tests were done at intervals of 1-3 days up to 4 tests rt-pcr tests were performed in each patientthese patients were also divided into two subgroups based on the geographical distribution subgroup 1 included 56 residents from xinyang and zhumadian districts population estimated in 116 million inhabitants which are located in the southernmost area of henan province adjacent to the city of wuhan subgroup 2 included 47 residents from anyang district population estimated in 52 million inhabitants which is located in the northernmost area of henan province relatively distant from wuhanchest computed tomography ct was performed in all patients at initial clinical presentation by using multi-slice ct systems philips brilliance 16-detector ct and philips brilliance 128-detector ict philips best netherlands ge lightspeed 16-detector ct ge healthcare waukesha wi without intravenous contrast using standard clinical protocols parameters used included a peak x-ray tube voltage of 120 kv automatic tube current modulation 145-300mas and a slice thickness of 2 to 3 mm without interslice gap studies were obtained in supine position during inspiratory pause except in one elderly patient who was unable to hold his breath the images were reviewed by 3 radiologists with 8-15 years of experience in chest ct imaging who were blinded to the laboratorial status including the rt-pcr testing of the patients using a clinical picture archiving and communication system pacs workstation all diverging interpretations were resolved by discussion until a consensus was reachedall ct images were assessed according to previous reports of radiologic findings in covid-19 13-16 using the fleischner society lexicon as reference 22 the distribution of the lung opacities was defined as peripheral if the involvement was limited to the outer one-third of the lungs and it was defined as central if the involvement was limited to the inner two thirds of the lungs lymphadenopathy was defined as the presence of hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes  10 mm in short-axis dimensionthe sensitivity specificity positive predictive value ppv and negative predictive value npv for diagnosing covid-19 are reported with 95 confidence interval 95 ci using rt-pcr as reference the continuous demographic features and ct radiation dose were described as mean sd pearson chi-square analysis was used to test differences in ct performance and rt-pcr positivity prevalence between geographic regions statistical analysis was performed using spss 260 software international business machine ibm armonk ny the statistical significance level was set to 005a total of 103 patients underwent chest ct and rt-pcr including 48 males and 55 females with mean age of 46 15 years ranging from 12 to 98 years the mean computed tomography dose index ctdi and dose-length product dlp were 934 413 mgy and

respectivelya total of 8288 93 covid-19 cases had abnormalities on ct table 2 while 688 patients had a normal ct in 2382 28 patients cts showed pure ground-glass opacities ggo figure 1 and in 58 82 71 patients cts patients showed ggo mixed with consolidation figure 2 only one 182 patient showed pure consolidation in the right lower lobe in terms of distribution of the pulmonary opacities in 6382 77 patients the distribution of the lung opacities was peripheral in 382 4 patients the distribution was central and in 1682 20 patients the distribution was both central and peripheral figure 3 of 82 patients 25 31 patients had unilateral opacities and 57 patients 70 had bilateral opacities in addition opacities tended to involve multiple lobes 81 in 14 of 82 17 patients the right upper lobe was affected in 37 patients 45 the right middle lobe was affected in 58 patients 71 the right lower lobe was affected in 17 patients 21 the left upper lobe was affected in 41 patients 50 the lingula was affected and in 63 patients 77 the left lower lobe was affected meanwhile lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were less common only one patient had a unilateral pleural effusion which was accompanied by low serum protein elevated serum creatinine and a history of chronic pyelonephritis suggesting renal etiology none of those patients in this cohort showed lymphadenopathythe sensitivity specificity ppv and npv with 95 ci were 93 85-97 53 27-77 92 83-96 and 42 18-70 in the entire cohort respectively table 3 similar results were seen in both geographic subgroups the sensitivity specificity ppv and npv in subgroup 1 were 92 80-97 63 26-90 93 81-98 and 56 23-85 while in in subgroup 2 they were 95 81-99 43 12-80 90 76-97 and 60 17-93 respectively in addition there were no significant differences in the distribution of normal and abnormal ct or rt-pcr positivity in the two geographic subgroups respectively p0423 and p0931 table 4 and table 5 respectivelyin the present study the sensitivity and specificity of chest ct in patients under investigation for covid-19 was 93 and 53 respectively using the results of rt-pcr as the standard of reference with no significant differences between two distinct regions in the chinese province of henan one of which is geographically closer to the center of the disease outbreak in wuhan the sensitivity in this study is similar to a previous study 97 reported by ai et al who focused on the subjects in wuhan 17noticeably the sensitivity of the first rt-pcr testing was only about 42 in our study increasing to 75 on the second round of testing in fact this observation has been also seen in reports from other medical centers 1819 as a result many experts in china had proposed ct as a screening tool for covid-19 although ct was initially included in the diagnostic criteria for covid-19 in hubei province on the 5th edition of the diagnosis and treatment program of the 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia issued by the national health commission of china it was later removed on the 6th edition 20 our results suggest that chest ct may have a limited screening role for patients under investigation as the npv for covid-19 was only modest in both geographic regions ie 56 - 60 currently the definite diagnosis of covid-19 still relies on rt-pcr or fast genetic sequencingthe specificity of ct findings for covid-19 in our study was relatively low even in patients specifically under investigation for the disease in fact ggo consolidation interlobularintralobular septa thickening crazy paving pattern or other features on ct have been reported in several other non-infectious and infectious processes such as sars common viral pneumonias and other interstitial lung diseases 21 in our study 15 patients under investigation for covid-19 who showed findings on ct consistent with the disease were found to have other diagnoses our observation is aligned with other reports for instance ai et al estimated a sensitivity of 28 for the initial ct in a large single-center study in the city of wuhan with 1014 patients 17 slight differences in specificity between the two studies could have occurred due to diverse demographic profile inclusion criteria or diagnostic criteriaremarkably 688 rt-pcr-positive patients had a normal ct follow-up cts obtained 2 to 3 days after the initial scan in these patients not systematically studied here became positive in 16 patient while the other 5 patients remained negative during their hospitalization these 5 patients presented with normal lymphocyte count and only minor symptomsin this study we also noted that none of the patients had mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy those ct findings are aligned with the report by chung et al 14 this special ct features accompanied with the decrease number of peripheral blood lymphocytes may contribute to disclose the pathogenesis of covid-19 infection huang et al reported that the virus of covid-19 can consume lymphocytes which may also be an important substrate for the rapid proliferation of the virus in early stages of the disease 3 we contemplate that this cytopathic effect on lymphocytes could be one of the causes for the lack of lymphadenopathythis study is not without limitations first ct readers were aware of the high suspicion level for covid-19 in the population cohorts which could have led to observer bias nevertheless they were still blinded to the rt-pcr status of the patients second the ppv and npv could be affected by local prevalence of covid-19 in our sample of patients under investigation to balance the magnitude of such effects we included patients from distinct geographic regions from our province one closer and another distant from the center of the outbreak last we used rt-pcr in different specimens as the standard of reference in our study although the sensitivity of rt-pcr has been reported vary significantly such effects could have been balanced in our study by obtaining multiple sequential tests during hospital admissionwe conclude that 1 although initial chest ct showed a high sensitivity for detecting covid-19 the npv observed in both geographic regions 56 and 60 were too low for proposing this exam as a screening tool in patients under investigation 2 the specificity of ct findings was also relatively low reinforcing the need to consider all the clinical information exposure history and alternative diagnoseson january 7 2020 a new pathogenic virus causing pneumonia was identified in a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in wuhan hubei province china the pathogen had typical features of the coronavirus family and therefore was classified in the subgenus sarbecovirus orthocoronavirinae subfamily 1 2 this virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and the disease it causes has been named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 it is the third epidemic coronavirus that has emerged in the human population in the twenty-first century following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars outbreak in 2002 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers outbreak in 2012 3 4coronavirus is one of the main causes of human respiratory disease owing to frequent cross-species infections the emerging virus rapidly became a challenge for global public health due to it spreading through human-to-human transmission the majority of the earliest covid-19 patients were linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market however human-to-human transmission has frequently occurred and the epidemic has been gradually growing 5 as of march 4 2020 80566 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported in china internationally more than 14396 cases had been reported in 77 countries 6 7 the number of infected individuals is far surpassing that of sars and mers sars-cov-2 can cause severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome it has been reported that sars-cov-2 is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities suggesting that age and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcomes 8 9 in china the reported death rate approached 3 of the total number of covid-19 patients during february 2020at present information regarding the prevalence and case-fatality for the clinical features and epidemiology of covid-19 remains scarce however a relatively accurate evaluation of incidence and mortality is required to help refine the risk assessment and to ensure that the public and patients are managed in an effective way therefore it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the risks for individual groups of different ages and genders in this paper we report our initial analysis of the public data from local authorities our study shows that the incidence risk of covid-19 might be as low as 01 for children while it could be over 09 for 40-year-old adults our results also suggest that the mortality risk might be above 02 for patients older than 80 years notably the mortality risk was significantly different between patients of hubei province and those from other parts of chinabasic information on covid-19 cases was released on official websites by the national health commission of china and its local branches we collected data from a total of 6673 identified cases published before february 22 based on the completeness of the data we involved 5319 cases in our study all the 5319 covid-19 cases were residents outside hubei province a total of 76 fatal cases were included in our analysis among the 76 fatal cases 45 cases were reported as residents of hubei province and 31 cases were reported as residents of other parts of china epidemiological characteristics such as age gender and location were carefully checked to remove missing values or duplicated records the composition of the age of the general public was obtained from data of 1144648 individuals from the general census of china 2018 10 the census data were collected from the whole country including 31 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government ethical approval for this study and written informed consent from the participants of the study were not required in accordance with local legislation and national guidelineswe estimated the incidence risk of covid-19 for different age groups in the general public by a maximum likelihood approach in this approach given the age composition of the general public and the incidence risk of different age groups age composition of covid-19 cases can be obtained aswhere pincidece  agei is the incidence risk of age group i and pagei is the proportion of age group i in the general public we assumed that the incidence risk for different age groups could be obtained from a logistic function of age pincidenceagei11exp-ir the likelihood of observation for age composition of 5319 covid-19 cases can be maximized by searching for optimized  and  consequently the incidence risk can be achieved in a maximum likelihood approach where the risk is given by a logistic function of age with estimated parameters  and to assess the mortality risk of covid-19 in the general public we used a maximum likelihood approach that is similar to that mentioned above we obtained the age composition of fatal cases of covid-19 aswhere pmortality  infection agei is the risk of mortality condition on an individuals age and infection state and pagei  infection mortality is the age composition of fatal cases of covid-19 in this study we assumed that infection happens in all age groups for the general public and therefore have pagei  infection  pagei we further applied the maximum likelihood approach to obtain the mortality risk of covid-19 for different age groups in the general public pmortality  infection agei in the maximum likelihood approach the mortality risk was given by the aforementioned logistic function of age but with mortality-specific  and  to eliminate the concern that the high mortality risk of older people may inflate the mortality rate of the infected population we further imputed the mortality rate of the infected people asthe public data of a total of 5319 identified covid-19 cases were included in our analysis there were 2829 532 males and 2490 468 females in the covid-19 cases the male to female ratio turned out roughly equal across all age groups the age of covid-19 patients ranged from 05 to 97 years with a mean of 452 years the age and gender composition of covid-19 patients and the public reference are presented in table 1 compared to the general public the covid-19 cases had a higher average age and there was a higher proportion of people aged 3069 yearswe collected detailed information on 76 fatal cases and plotted the age composition of the cases and the general public in figure 1 it is evident that death occurs more frequently in older people but is rare for patients under 40 years old the fatal cases were from 34 to 89 years old with an average age of 7147 and a standard deviation of 1249based on the age composition of 5319 covid-19 cases and the 1144648 individuals of the general public we estimated the incidence risk by a maximum likelihood approach our results show that the disease can occur in all age groups and there is no significant difference between males and females figure 2 the difference in incidence risk for different genders is observed only for the groups between 15 and 50 years old after the age of 15 years males have a slightly higher incidence risk than women but the increase is negligible for people over 50 years old our result does not support a previous report that sars-cov-2 generally affects more males than females in the epidemic 8 the incidence risk is low for children and teenagers but rapidly increases for adults for adults over 40 years of age the risk is higher than 09 when they have full exposure to the virusin our assessment of mortality risk there is a significantly higher mortality risk in older adults figure 3a the estimated fatal probability is 001 for individuals under 40 years but it is more than 051 for people older than 90 years the calculated risk is much higher than previous reports stated our result is consistent with most of the earlier studies supporting the hypothesis that older age is associated with an increased risk of mortality in covid-19 patients our analysis of the total of 76 fatal cases suggests a mortality rate of 238 for general infection however we noticed that the mortality rate of covid-19 in reports is significantly different between identified cases of hubei province and that of other parts of china 11to compare the mortality risk between hubei and other provinces of china we divided 76 fatal cases into two subsets 45 cases from hubei province and 31 cases from other parts of china the aforementioned statistical analysis for mortality risk was applied to the two subsets with nine different age groups in each to account for variability we further obtained a standard deviation of estimates by applying the same method to 1000 simulated data sets that were generated from the initial estimation our results show that mortality risk is no more than 013  010 for people over 80 years outside hubei province but the risk is as high as 060  015 for the corresponding age group in hubei province figure 3b mortality risk falls under 005 for people younger than 70 years in other parts of china while only people under 50 years have a risk under 005 in hubei province we also calculated the expectation of mortality rates for a general infection inside and outside hubei province as 478 and 095 respectivelyour results suggest that there is a significantly higher mortality risk for covid-19 in seniors than that given in the previous report 11 this is probably due to the published report not accounting for the increasing death rate of the identified covid-19 cases in the previous study the crude mortality rate was only 23 but the rate was 37 on march 4 2020 3015 deaths among 80566 identified covid-19 cases as of march 4 2020 there were still 5952 covid-19 patients in critical condition in china it has been reported that the survival probability of critically ill patients continuously decreased with the increase of time since admission to the intensive care unit 12 our analysis was based on the composition of the age of the different populations and therefore it is less affected by the disease progression of patients especially the increasing death rate of critically ill patients age has been reported as the independent predictor of an adverse outcome in sars and mers comorbidities and low immune function in older people might be the major cause of a higher mortality of coronaviruses 3 4 11 prompt administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and the strengthening of immune support treatment might reduce the mortality of seniors 8our data showed that the mortality rate of covid-19 is five times higher in hubei province than that in other parts of china this result is supported by an early publication that stated the estimated case fatality rate of mainland china excluding hubei was 015 far less than that of the hubei province excluding the city of wuhan 141 and wuhan city 525 13 on the one hand this difference may be partially explained by insufficient medical resources due to such a large number of patients in hubei province during the outbreak according to the 2018 annual brief report of the health service development in wuhan city there were 86 hospital beds per 1000 people however hospital bed utilization ratio of 2017 and 2018 reached 9234 and 9422 respectively 14 it was shown that even under normal circumstances there were few spare beds on the other hand detailed information on the majority of fatal cases 40 of 45 in total from hubei province was published before january 25 2019 the mortality rate of early reported cases may be overstated because case detection is highly biased toward the more severe cases however we strongly suggest that international authorities try their best to immediately prevent covid-19 patients from overloading their health care system our hypothesis that a smooth-running health care system can effectively reduce the mortality rate of covid-19 is strongly supported by the low mortality rate in other parts of chinain conclusion we investigated the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of covid-19 patients and the general public in china our data show a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for older adults therefore it is prudent to strengthen the tertiary preventive and clinical care of old-aged patients to reduce mortality furthermore our results also support the conclusion that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1 or less our study could be of value to medical authorities to implement effective medical service the lack of complete data for all covid-19 cases potentially increases the occurrence of selection and measurement biases in this study therefore further large-scale epidemiological studies are necessary to elucidate the risk factors of covid-19 for the general publicall datasets generated for this study are available upon requestethical review and approval was not required for the study on human participants in accordance with the local legislation and

by synthesising data from across a range of surveillance settings we obtained estimates of the age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio that take into account the different denominator populations in the datasets our underlying assumption that attack rates ie the probability of becoming infected do not vary substantially by age is consistent with previous studies for respiratory infections under this assumption differences in age patterns among cases in wuhan versus those elsewhere in china would probably due to under-ascertainment of cases given the different surveillance systems in place our results are consistent with this hypothesis with cases in wuhan seen in older individuals who would have been identified through attendance at hospital whereas cases elsewhere in china being younger overall which would be explained by the policy of testing those with a travel history to wuhan after correcting for these biases we found that estimates of the case fatality ratio from china are consistent with those obtained from early international cases our age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio can be applied to any demography to give an estimate of the infection fatality ratio in older and younger populations these estimates can be combined with estimates of the infection attack rate approximately 80 for an unmitigated epidemic to give rough projections of scale similarly our estimates of the proportion of infections requiring hospitalisation can be combined with the infection attack rate to forecast health-care requirements
implications of all the available evidence
our estimates of the case fatality ratio for covid-19 although lower than some of the crude estimates made to date are substantially higher than for recent influenza pandemics eg h1n1 influenza in 2009 with the rapid geographical spread observed to date covid-19 therefore represents a major global health threat in the coming weeks and months our estimate of the proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation when combined with likely infection attack rates around 5080 show that even the most advanced health-care systems are likely to be overwhelmed these estimates are therefore crucial to enable countries around the world to best prepare as the global pandemic continues to unfold
assessing the severity of covid-19 is crucial to determine the appropriateness of mitigation strategies and to enable planning for health-care needs as epidemics unfold however crude case fatality ratios obtained by dividing the number of deaths by the number of cases can be misleading9 10 first there can be a period of 23 weeks between a person developing symptoms the case subsequently being detected and reported and observation of the final clinical outcome during a growing epidemic the final clinical outcome of most of the reported cases is typically unknown simply dividing the cumulative reported number of deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases will therefore underestimate the true case fatality ratio early in an epidemic9 10 11 this effect was observed in past epidemics of respiratory pathogens including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars12 and h1n19 influenza and as such is widely recognised thus many of the estimates of the case fatality ratio that have been obtained to date for covid-19 correct for this effect13 14 15 16 additionally however during the exponential growth phase of an epidemic the observed time lags between the onset of symptoms and outcome recovery or death are censored and naive estimates of the observed times from symptom onset to outcome provide biased estimates of the actual distributions ignoring this effect tends to bias the estimated case fatality ratio downwards during the early growth phase of an epidemicsecond surveillance of a newly emerged pathogen is typically biased towards detecting clinically severe cases especially at the start of an epidemic when diagnostic capacity is low figure 1
 estimates of the case fatality ratio can thus be biased upwards until the extent of clinically milder disease is determined9 data from the epicentre of the outbreak in wuhan have primarily been obtained through hospital surveillance and thus are likely to represent patients with moderate or severe illness with atypical pneumonia or acute respiratory distress being used to define suspected cases eligible for testing7 in these individuals clinical outcomes are likely to be more severe so any estimates of the case fatality ratio will be higher elsewhere in mainland china and the rest of the world countries and administrative regions alert to the risk of infection being imported via travel initially instituted surveillance for covid-19 with a broader set of clinical criteria for defining a suspected case these criteria typically included a combination of symptoms eg cough and fever combined with recent travel history to the affected region wuhan or hubei province2 17 such surveillance is likely to detect clinically mild cases but by initially restricting testing to those with a travel history or link might have missed other symptomatic caseshere we attempt to adjust for these biases in data sources to obtain estimates of the case fatality ratio proportion of all cases that will eventually lead to death and infection fatality ratio the proportion of all infections that will eventually lead to death using both individual-level case report data and aggregate case and death counts from mainland china from hong kong and macau and international case reports by adjusting for both underlying demography and potential under-ascertainment at different levels of the severity pyramid figure 1 these estimates should be broadly applicable across a range of settings to inform health planning while more detailed case data accruewe identified information on the characteristics of 48 patients who died from covid-19 in hubei reported by the national health commission and the hubei province health commission website up to feb 8 2020 we recorded the following data elements where available sex age date of symptom onset date of hospitalisation and date of death of the 48 cases neither the date of symptom onset nor the date of report was available for 13 cases we also removed eight cases with onset before jan 1 2020 or death before jan 21 2020 and three deaths after jan 28 2020 which were the dates consistent with reliable reporting of onset and death in this setting respectively considering the onset-to-death times including early onsets creates a bias towards long onset-to-death times reflecting under-ascertainment of deaths early on this left 24 deaths which we used to estimate the onset-to-death distributionwe collated data on 2010 cases reported in 37 countries and two special administrative regions of china hong kong and macau from government or ministry of health websites and media reports until feb 25 2020 we recorded the following information where available country or administrative region in which the case was detected whether the infection was acquired in china or abroad date of travel date of symptom onset date of hospitalisation date of confirmation date of recovery and date of death we used data from 165 recovered individuals with reported recovery dates and reported or imputed onset dates to estimate the onset-to-recovery distribution after excluding 26 recoveries without appropriate information on dates of recovery report or locality we used data on 1334 international cases to obtain estimates of the case fatality ratio not including cases without dates of reportdata on 70 117 pcr-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases by date of onset in wuhan and elsewhere in china from jan 1 to feb 11 2020 were extracted from the whochina joint mission report8 over this period a total of 1023 deaths were reported across china with these data available disaggregated into 10-year age bands between 09 years and 7079 years old and a further age band for those aged 80 years or older7 using collated data on daily reported deaths obtained each day from the national health commission regional websites we estimated that 74 of deaths occurred in wuhan and the remainder outside wuhan additionally the most recent available cumulative estimates march 3 2020 of 80 304 confirmed cases and 2946 deaths within china were extracted from the who covid-19 situation report number 431
an earlier preprint of a subset of these cases up to jan 26 2020 reported the age distribution of cases categorised by severity for 3665 cases18 under the china case definition a severe case is defined as tachypnoea 30 breaths per min or oxygen saturation 93 or higher at rest or pao2fio2 ratio less than 300 mm hg7 assuming severe cases to require hospitalisation as opposed to all of the patients who were hospitalised in china some of whom will have been hospitalised to reduce onward transmission we used the proportion of severe cases by age in these patients to estimate the proportion of cases and infections requiring hospitalisationdata on infection prevalence in repatriated expatriates returning to their home countries were obtained from government or ministry of health websites and media reports to match to the incidence reported in wuhan on jan 30 2020 we used data from six flights that departed between jan 30 and feb 1 2020 inclusivein early february 2020 a cruise liner named the diamond princess was quarantined after a disembarked passenger tested positive for the virus subsequently all 3711 passengers on board were tested over the next month we extracted data on the ages of passengers onboard on feb 5 2020 the dates of positive test reports which were available for 657 out of 712 pcr-confirmed cases and the dates of ten deaths among these cases from the reports of the japan ministry of health labour and welfare19 and international mediaage-stratified population data for 2018 were obtained from the national bureau of statistics of china20 according to these data the population of wuhan in 2018 was approximately 11 million peopleall analyses were done with r software version 362 with bayesian marko-chain monte carlo via the package drjacoby version 10021
data and code are available online at githubin estimating time intervals between symptom onset and outcome it was necessary to account for the fact that during a growing epidemic a higher proportion of the cases will have been infected recently appendix p 7 therefore we re-parameterised a gamma model to account for exponential growth using a growth rate of 014 per day obtained from the early case onset data appendix p 6 using bayesian methods we fitted gamma distributions to the data on time from onset to death and onset to recovery conditional on having observed the final outcome missing onset dates were imputed on the basis of dates of report where availableestimates of the distribution of times from onset-to-death were used to project the expected cumulative number of deaths given the onsets observed in wuhan and outside wuhan assuming a uniform attack rate across age groups using the age-distribution of the population we obtained an estimate of the expected number of infections in each age group under-ascertainment was estimated in and outside of wuhan by comparing the number of observed cases by age to this expected distribution assuming perfect ascertainment in the 5059 age group as this group had the highest number of detected cases relative to population size we also did a sensitivity analysis assuming a differential attack rate by age appendix p 9 for wuhan we added scaling to account for further under-ascertainment compared with outside of wuhan these steps gave us the expected age-distribution of casesfor a given onset-to-death distribution we obtained a modelled estimate of the cumulative number of deaths by age under an age-dependent case fatality ratio fitted relative to the case fatality ratio in the oldest age group which represented the highest crude case fatality ratio this estimate was compared with the observed deaths by age using a poisson likelihood these data were then jointly fitted alongside the most recent age-aggregated cumulative deaths and cases in mainland china given that the numbers of observed cases and deaths have dropped substantially following a peak in late january the ratio of current cumulative cases to current number of deaths once corrected for under-ascertainment should provide a good estimate of the final case fatality ratio11
to estimate the infection fatality ratio we fitted to data on infection prevalence from international wuhan residents who were repatriated to their home countries our age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio model was jointly fitted to the case data and infection prevalence data with use of bayesian methods using our previous estimate of the onset-to-death distribution as a prior full mathematical details are provided in the appendix p 8assuming a uniform attack rate by age groups we used the demography-adjusted under-ascertainment rates calculated above to obtain an estimate of the proportion of infected individuals who would require hospitalisationto independently validate our infection fatality ratio estimate we analysed data from the outbreak on the diamond princess cruise liner taking the dates of reported positive tests as a proxy for onset date we calculated the expected proportion of deaths observed until march 25 2020 given the onset times and estimated onset-to-death distribution appendix p 13we used parametric and non-parametric methods11 22 to estimate the case fatality ratio in cases reported outside of mainland china using individual-level data cases in which the outcome was unknown were treated as censored observations for parametric and non-parametric analyses missing onset dates were multiply imputed using information on the onset-to-report distribution and unreported recoveries were imputed using onset-to-outcome distributions and country summary data the parametric models were fitted to the data using bayesian methods appendix p 12the funder of the study had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report the corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publicationin the subset of 24 deaths from covid-19 that occurred in mainland china early in the epidemic with correction for bias introduced by the growth of the epidemic we estimated the mean time from onset to death to be 188 days 95 credible interval cri 157497 figure 2
 with a coefficient of variation of 045 95 cri 029054 with the small number of observations in these data and given that they were from early in the epidemic we could not rule out many deaths occurring with longer times from onset to death hence the high upper limit of the credible interval however given that the epidemic in china has since declined our posterior estimate of the mean time from onset to death informed by the analysis of aggregated data from china is more precise mean 178 days 169192 figure 2using data on the outcomes of 169 cases reported outside of mainland china we estimated a mean onset-to-recovery time of 247 days 95 cri 229281 and coefficient of variation of 035 031039 figure 2 both these onset-to-outcome estimates are consistent with a separate study in china23
case fatality ratios were estimated from aggregate data on cases and deaths in mainland china table 1
 a large proportion of the cases including all of those early in the epidemic were reported in wuhan where the local health system was quickly overwhelmed as a result the age distribution of cases reported in wuhan differed to that in the rest of china figure 3a
 reported cases in wuhan were more frequent in older age groups perhaps reflecting higher severity and therefore prioritisation for hospitalisation in wuhan while cases outside of wuhan might also show a bias in terms of the relationship between age and travel adjusting for differences in underlying demography and assuming no overall difference in the attack rate by age we estimated high under-ascertainment of cases in younger age groups both inside and outside of wuhan figure 3c d furthermore we estimated a higher level of under-ascertainment overall in wuhan compared with outside of wuhan figure 3c accounting for this under-ascertainment we estimated the highest case fatality ratio 134 112159 in the 80 years and older age group figure 3b table 1 with lower case fatality ratios associated with lower age groups and the lowest in the 09 years age group 000260 000031200382in cases reported outside of mainland china we estimated an overall modal case fatality ratio of 27 95 cri 1447 using the parametric model table 2
 in those who reported travel to mainland china and would therefore have been detected in the surveillance system we estimated an overall modal case fatality ratio of 11 0441 and in those without any reported travel to china therefore detected either through contact tracing or through hospital surveillance we estimated a case fatality ratio of 36 1972 using the parametric model the estimated case fatality ratio was lower in those aged under 60 years of age 14 0435 compared with those aged 60 years and over 45 18111 similar estimates were obtained using non-parametric methods table 2in international wuhan residents repatriated on six flights we estimated a prevalence of infection of 087 95 ci 03219 six of 689 adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment we estimate an infection fatality ratio of 066 95 cri 039133 as for the case fatality ratio this is strongly age-dependent with estimates rising steeply from age 50 years upwards table 1 the demography-adjusted and under-ascertainment-adjusted proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation ranges from 11 in the 2029 years age group up to 184 in those 80 years and older table 3
 using these age-stratified infection fatality ratio estimates we estimate the infection fatality ratio in the diamond princess population to be 29 given the delay from onset of symptoms to death we would expect 97 of these deaths to have occurred by march 25 2020 giving an estimate of the current infection fatality ratio of 28 compared with the empirical estimate of 14 95 ci 0726 ten of 712from an extensive analysis of data from different regions of the world our best estimate at the current time for the case fatality ratio of covid-19 in china is 138 95 cri 123153 although this value remains lower than estimates for other coronaviruses including sars24 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers25 it is substantially higher than estimates from the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic26 27 our estimate of an infection fatality ratio of 066 in china was informed by pcr testing of international wuhan residents returning on repatriation flights this value was consistent with the infection fatality ratio observed in passengers on the diamond princess cruise ship up to march 5 2020 although it is slightly above the upper 95 confidence limit of the age-adjusted infection fatality ratio observed by march 25 of 712 confirmed cases 601 have been discharged ten have died and 11 remain in a critical condition this difference might be due to repatriation flight data slightly underestimating milder infections or due to cruise passengers having better outcomes because of a potentially higher-than-average quality of health careour estimates of the probability of requiring hospitalisation assume that only severe cases require hospitalisation this assumption is clearly different from the pattern of hospitalisation that occurred in china where hospitalisation was also used to ensure case isolation mortality can also be expected to vary with the underlying health of specific populations given that the risks associated with covid-19 will be heavily influenced by the presence of underlying comorbiditiesour estimate of the case fatality ratio is substantially lower than the crude case fatality ratio obtained from china based on the cases and deaths observed to date which is currently 367 as well as many of the estimates currently in the literature the principle reason for this difference is that the crude estimate does not take into account the severity of cases for example various estimates have been made from patient populations ranging from those with generally milder symptoms for example international travellers detected through screening of travel history13 through to those identified in the hospital setting14 15
it is clear from the data that have emerged from china that case fatality ratio increases substantially with age our results suggest a very low fatality ratio in those under the age of 20 years as there are very few cases in this age group it remains unclear whether this reflects a low risk of death or a difference in susceptibility although early results indicate young people are not at lower risk of infection than adults28 serological testing in this age group will be crucial in the coming weeks to understand the significance of this age group in driving population transmission the estimated increase in severity with age is clearly reflected in case reports in which the mean age tends to be in the range of 5060 years different surveillance systems will pick up a different age case mix and we find that those with milder symptoms detected through a history of travel are younger on average than those detected through hospital surveillance our correction for this surveillance bias therefore allows us to obtain estimates that can be applied to different case mixes and demographic population structures however it should be noted that this correction is applicable under the assumption of a uniform infection attack rate ie exposure across the population we also assumed perfect case ascertainment outside of wuhan in the age group with the most cases relative to their population size 5059-year-olds however if many cases were missed the case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio estimates might be lower in the absence of random population surveys of infection prevalence our adjustment from case fatality ratio to infection fatality ratio relied on repatriation flight data which was not age specific the reported proportion of infected individuals who were asymptomatic on the diamond princess did not vary considerably by age supporting this approach but future larger representative population prevalence surveys and seroprevalence surveys will inform such estimates furthermuch of the data informing global estimates of the case fatality ratio at present are from the early outbreak in wuhan given that the health system in this city was quickly overwhelmed our estimates suggest that there is substantial under-ascertainment of cases in the younger age groups who we estimate to have milder disease by comparison with elsewhere in mainland china this under-ascertainment is the main factor driving the difference between our estimate of the crude case fatality ratio from china 367 and our best estimate of the overall case fatality ratio 138 the case fatality ratio is likely to be strongly influenced by the availability of health-care facilities however surprisingly although health-care availability in wuhan was stretched our estimates from international cases are of a similar magnitude suggesting relatively little difference in health outcome finally as clinical knowledge of this new disease accrues it is possible that outcomes will improve it will therefore be important to revise these estimates as epidemics unfoldthe world is currently experiencing the early stages of a global pandemic although china has succeeded in containing the disease spread for 2 months such containment is unlikely to be achievable in most countries thus much of the world will experience very large community epidemics of covid-19 over the coming weeks and months our estimates of the underlying infection fatality ratio of this virus will inform assessments of health effects likely to be experienced in different countries and thus decisions around appropriate mitigation policies to be adoptedall data and code used in this study are available in a github repositorythe sars-cov 2 or covid-19 is emerged as global pandemic declared by the who with 184976 reported cases across 159 countries until march 18 2020 and accounts for 7529 deaths globally who the severity of covid-19 can be easily understood by the exponentially increasing cases worldwide the virus affects respiratory system like other influenza viruses and appears as a major threat throughout the world after 1918 spanish flu h1n1 outbreak covid-19 is one of the highly infectious diseases with the ability to affect a large population globally and can cause severe impact on socioeconomic stability of the world the emergence of sars-cov traces back to year 2003 from china and again another mutant emerged in 2012 known as mers from saudi arabia all the three highly infectious strains of cov are found to be zoonotic and transmitted from animals to peoplethe sars-cov-2 is also believed to be spread from fish market of wuhan china in november 2019 and was first reported in the last week of december 2019 in 59 people at wuhan hubei china the strain was completely novel and unknown to scientific fraternity at the time of its outbreak the novel coronavirus or covid-19 is highly infectious and spread so fast through people-to-people contact the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic viral strains pose immense threat to the human population and need to addressed strategically with rapid response menachery et al 2018 the sars-cov-2 is a novel coronavirus and is classified into virus family of coronaviridae coronaviruses belong to large coronaviridae family of viruses causing infection leads from common cold to severe illness and respiratory diseases as per the studies conducted by various research groups worldwide the covid-19 genome is in close similarity with bat coronavirus and it belongs to beta coronavirus group of coronaviridae family the brief classification of the sars-cov-2 is depicted in fig 111 tekes and thiel 2016 ashour et al 2020 and some of the major human illnesses causing covs are given in table 111

the emergence of covid-19 has drawn very much attention of researchers and health professionals because of its high infection potential and novel structure researchers found the stability of sars-cov-2 on various surfaces and compared the same with sars-cov-1 the experimental data under varied circumstances on different surfaces are found to be similar for both the strains van doremalen et al 2020 the experimental observation shows that alterations in the epidemiologic characteristics of both the viruses may arise due to other reasons the high viral concentration in the upper respiratory tract in the patient and the potential of covid-19-infected individual to carry and spread the virus while being in asymptomatic condition are some probable reasons for high infection rate making its control challenging bai et al 2020 zou et al 2020covid-19 is a single-stranded ss rna virus consisting of 2636 kb positive sense rna genome the complete virus particle is made up of four major structural proteins namely spikes s nucleocapsid n membrane m and envelope e encoded by virus genome forni et al 2017 the size of sars-cov-2-encoded proteins shows similarity to bat sars-cov the important difference is longer length and structure of s protein of sars-cov-2 in comparison to sars-cov and bat sars-cov observed by researchers these s proteins are very crucial for receptor binding membrane fusion internalization of the sars-cov-2 tissue tropism and host array this s protein may be utilized as vital target for vaccine development menachery et al 2016 ji et al 2020 kumar et al 2020extensive efforts are already taken to control covid-19 spread and for the development of effective vaccines around the world scientists are working round the clock individually and in collaboration to get some effective solution for the severe pandemic occurred by covid-19 the covid-19 outbreak can be reduced and controlled only by maintaining self-hygiene social distancing and strong immunity until any vaccine or effective medication is found the present chapter provides an insight into the prevention and control strategies for covid-19 including vaccine development and control measurescovid-19 contains the largest rna genome and has spike proteins which play very important role in hostvirus interaction and infection after entering into host cells the viral genome translates into two large precursors poly-proteins known as pp1a and pp1ab these precursors further processed by orf1a-encoded viral proteinases pl pro papain-like proteinases and 3cl pro 3c-like proteinases into 16 mature non-structural proteins namely nsp1 to nsp16 these nsps perform several important functions in viral rna replication and transcription rna polymerase rna-processing enzymes such as poly u-specific endoribonuclease protease helicase 35 exoribonuclease ribose 2-o methyltransferase adenosine diphosphate-ribose-1-phosphatase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase narayanan et al 2015 additionally these nsps have a major role in viral rna replication and transcription due to the absence of proofreading mechanism during rna recombination process in pre-existed coronaviruses strains it may account to be responsible for the evolution of sars-cov-2 the s gene-encoding spike glycoproteins have the maximum recombination frequency ji et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 out of the three major proteins forming viral envelope s and m are glycol proteins and the e is non-glycosylated protein m and e proteins are essential for virus assembly morphogenesis and budding the m protein comprises short n terminal glycosylated ectodomain with a long c terminal domain and three membrane domains on the other hand s glycoprotein is a type 1 fusion viral protein which includes two heptad repeat regions hr-n and hr-c and forms protein ectodomain-surrounded coiled structure additionally the s protein cleaves into two subunits s1 and s2 and facilitates receptor binding at domain 270510 and membrane fusion respectively tripet et al 2004 yuen et al 2007 fehr and perlman 2015 narayanan et al 2015 kumar et al 2020 wan et al 2005 considering the importance of s protein in attachment with host cell and variation in sequence of s protein from sars-cov-1 s protein may be considered potential candidate for vaccine development systematic assessment identified that 380 amino acid substitutions between sars-cov-1 sars like bat cov and sars-cov-2 may be responsible for functional and pathogenic divergence of sars-cov-2 wu et al 2020the covid-19 virus is traced till death in non-survivors and the longest virus shedding of 37 days has been observed in survivors zhou et al 2020 it shows the severity of covid-19 and its high infection rate especially in elderly and immunocompromised or weak immunity individuals several pharmaceutical rd units and researchers are working to develop vaccine for sars-cov-2 pandemic researchers are putting all efforts to find a solution for combating this novel coronavirus researchers across the globe are trying to develop sars-cov-2 vaccine by using approaches like whole virus vaccine antibody vaccine dna vaccine recombinant protein subunit vaccine and mrna vaccine dresden 2020 currently there is no approved vaccine available for sars-cov-2 recently mrna 1273 investigational vaccine has been developed by niaid scientists in collaboration with the biotechnology company moderna inc based in cambridge ma the clinical trial began at kaiser permanente washington health research institute kpwhri in seattle and part of national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid national institutes of health is funding the trial on mrna platform approved for human trial after its promising response in animal models nih a team of researchers from the hong kong university of science and technology hong kong reported high genetic similarity between sars-cov outbreak in 2003 and sars-cov-2 this genetic similarity leads researchers to determine experimental data for sars-cov-1 b-cell and t-cell epitopes derived from s and n proteins which map identically to sars-cov-2 in comparison to the non-structural proteins the t-cell response against the structural proteins has been reported to be the most immunogenic in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of recovering sars-cov patients additionally t-cell responses against the s and n proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting li et al 2008 channappanavar et al 2014 ahmed et al 2020 as no mutation was observed in the sars-cov-2 proteins and long-lasting t-cell response against s protein immune targeting of these epitopes may provide protection against covid-19 or sars-cov-2 ahmed et al 2020 similar study was also reported by researchers from cfar king georges medical university lucknow india in which researchers found glycosylated s protein site as potential target for vaccine development due to the genetic similarity with sars-cov and bat cov kumar et al 2020 table 112 comprise of some of the vaccines under development in various pharma and rd laboratories with the stage of vaccine
the above given set of data is few of ongoing search for potential vaccine vaccine development is one of the typical processes and requires lot of efforts and time there are several vaccines under development for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov and researches are still going on at various stages of clinical trials the available advanced technology for virus genome sequencing and global emergency of pandemic expedite the process to develop vaccine at earliest the potential vaccine may take more than a year to come on the market after getting all approvals as once the researchers develop a vaccine it must get approved from various agencies like fda after which the vaccine is sent to three phases of clinical trial in phase 1 a small group of people are selected to evaluate the safety and immune response for vaccine after successful trial in phase 1 the vaccine is tested for phase 2 clinical trial on approximately few hundred people to analyse the dosage in phase 3 the effectiveness and safety evaluation of the vaccine will be evaluated on a large population once the vaccine passes all the three phases it successfully gets approval from the fda and is released for use to combat against the pathogensince the inception of deadly coronavirus such as sars-cov in 20032004 the human coronaviruses drew very much attention of the researchers worldwide to find a solution the emergence and transfer of zoonotic pathogens in humans become a great threat for human population after a decade of sars outbreak mers is emerged as another severe threat and continued infecting after its discovery in 2012 stockman et al 2006 in 2020 coronavirus emerged in a new form and is standing in front of the whole humanity as a severe threat in the form of pandemic accountable for many lives across the globe the timely containment and slow rate of transmission of sars-cov-1 and mers helped to control its larger impact menachery et al 2018 in context of sars and mers outbreaks many vaccines were developed and tested the majority of coronavirus vaccines studied or under development so far broadly comprise the following typeswhole virus vaccinelive attenuated vaccineantibody-based vaccinesmall subunit-based vaccinevector-based vaccinenucleic acid-based vaccine
live attenuated vaccines contain weakened or dead virus to induce immune response in individual recipient the live virus vaccine sometimes develops complications in the receiver but it provides a long-term immune response for the specific virus antibody-based vaccines contain monoclonal antibodies which are strain specific and provide limited range of protection as per the studies carried out on coronavirus it mutated many times and in the last 1518 years some species emerged as deadly virus the protein subunit-based vaccines are one of the safest vaccines providing protection to a wide range of virus strains by targeting viral s and n proteins which facilitate attachment and interaction of virus to host cells nucleic acid-based vaccines also known as dna or rna vaccine are also safe for the recipients and provide long-term immunity the mrna-based vaccine for covid-19 already sent for phase 1 clinical trial some of the coronavirus vaccines are listed in table 113
the research reported by various individual groups shows that cov s subunit protein provides complete protection than sars-cov live attenuated vaccines full-length s protein and dna-based s protein vaccines buchholz et al 2004 the s protein gene of coronavirus is a highly preferable target of antigenicity as exhibited by the reactivity with convalescent sars patient sera it shows precise binding to soluble ace-2 receptor additionally it promotes antibody-dependent viral access in raji b cells of human refractory b cells and provokes defense against a impute infection in an animal model liu et al 2020the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccine are the most important criteria for the development of vaccine the efficacy of a vaccine is defined as the reduction percentage of disease in vaccinated or recipients group in comparison to unvaccinated groups under optimal condition whereas the effectiveness of a vaccine is defined as the percentage control achieved for particular disease in vaccinated group compared to unvaccinated group at real world in natural environment the efficacy of vaccine is studied when the vaccine is in clinical trial whereas the effectiveness is studied after the release of vaccine commercially or to mass after all approvalsthe efficacy of different types of coronavirus vaccines is studied for their potential application in the prevention of the disease various types of coronavirus vaccines are under research like inactivated coronavirus live attenuated coronavirus s-protein-based vectored vaccines dna vaccines and combination vaccines vaccines for combating several animal-based covs have been developed and demonstrated to be efficient in averting viral contagion vaccines for human covs especially deadly sars-cov-1 mers-cov and the present pandemic covid-19 are under development in various levels of preclinical subclinical and clinical trials the study of virus-like particle vaccine in mice and whole virus vaccine in non-human primates and ferrets exhibits immune response against cov infection but later on vaccinated animals unveiled immunopathological lung disease tseng et al 2012 another study in canine cov vaccine exhibited that the vaccination with inactivated cov can expressively reduce the viral replication followed with the reduction in occurrence of clinical symptoms and disease due to virulent cov infection fulker et al 1995 in a study carried out on rhesus monkey with sars-cov inactivated vaccine exhibited effective concomitant humoral and mucosal immunity against sars-cov infection the rhesus monkey was inoculated with a varied dose 05 5 50 and 5000 g of vaccine and provided with booster dose after a week afterwards the animals were exposed to ns-1 strain of sars-cov the vaccinated monkeys had not shown any systematic side effects neither any clinical symptoms the vaccine in study shows promising results on monkeys and may be further tested under clinical trials on humans zhou et al 2005various therapeutic efforts were adopted for the cov vaccine globally however no solution in form of promising treatment or vaccination is identified till date progressive efforts on developed animal models and under clinical trials are ongoing to find an effective vaccine that is underway as discussed in the above sections targeting s glycoproteins of the virus and its subunits responsible for host interaction may be effective target for cov vaccine for humans as per research conducted on various cov genetic structure the s protein genetic make-up is found to be similar in sars-cov bat sars-cov and sars-cov-2 previously conducted studies on sars-cov and mers-cov vaccine development based on s glycoproteins of virus can provide insight into effective and efficient vaccine development against deadly strains of corona

coronaviruses covs belong to the family coronaviridae and order nidovirales which encompasses positivesense singlestranded rna viruses that replicate using a nested nido set of mrnas peiris 2016 according to the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv the family coronaviridae is classified into two subfamilies letovirinae and orthocoronavirinae king et al 2018 the latter includes human and animal coronaviruses figure 1 and is classified into four genera alpha beta gamma and deltacoronaviruses figure 1 most of human coronaviruses hcovs are betacoronaviruses including hcovoc43 hcovhku1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 sarscov1 sarscov2 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov cdc 2020 dilcher werno  jennings 2020 a few human coronaviruses such as hcov229e and hcovnl63 are alphacoronaviruses all bat coronaviruses are either alpha or betacoronaviruses three swine coronaviruses that are of significant concern to the porcine industry are transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus pedv and porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv which are alphacoronaviruses feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv and canine coronaviruses ccov are alphacoronaviruses while bovine coronavirus bcov and mouse coronavirus mcov murine hepatitis virus mhv are betacoronaviruses ashour elkhatib rahman  elshabrawy 2020before 2002 human covs were thought of as nuisance viruses causing common cold and were never perceived as serious public health threats ashour et al 2020 this perception changed in 20022003 after the emergence of the sarscov1 which was the first lethal form of covs to infect humans drosten et al 2003 the epidemic of sarscov1 caused 8422 illnesses and 916 deaths in 29 countries cdc 2017 who 2020a after its containment in 2004 the number of cases of sarscov1 is approaching zero cdc 2017 in 2012 another novel zoonotic coronavirus named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov caused an epidemic claiming the lives of 866 people in 27 countries who 2020bin december 2019 a new human coronavirus emerged in wuhan city hubei province china causing severe acute respiratory disease and this disease is referred to as the coronavirus disease2019 covid19 due to the drastic increase in the number of reported covid19 cases worldwide it was declared as a pandemic by the who on 11 march 2020 on the basis of preliminary genetic studies this new virus was tentatively named as 2019new coronavirus 2019ncov later it was renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 after the coronaviridae study group of the ictv determined that the virus belongs to the existing virus species severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus gorbalenya baker  baric 2020 who 2020c as of 21 may 2020 1035 am about 4858850 confirmed covid19 cases including 329300 deaths have been reported in 188 countries in the united states alone 1556749 cases have been reported resulting in more than 93606 deaths jhu 2020the overall fatality rate of sarscov2 is relatively low 68 as compared to that of sarscov1 and merscov 109 and 344 respectively but it is still in flux and very well could be lower than 68 however it is obvious that sarscov2 is much more contagious as evidenced by its spread to 185 countries across the globe within a very short time this has led to an increased concern of possible collapse of the medical care systems as they will not be able to accommodate a large number of cases simultaneously decaprio gartner burgess kothari  sayed 2020 specht 2020 for that reason the governments and public health sectors are racing against time to contain this pandemic before the occurrence of this catastrophic scenario because an effective and safe vaccine or antiviral drug for sarscov2 does not exist infection control is the only available method to limit the spread of the virus lai shih ko tang  hsueh 2020 the infection control and preventive measures depend mainly on our primary understanding of the routes of transmission of this virus a reported familial cluster of pneumonia associated with covid19 in hospital and family settings has confirmed the direct persontoperson transmission route for this virus chan et al 2020 other indirect transmission routes are postulated andor indicated such as faecaloral nosocomial airborne and contact with contaminated surfaces and fomites cai et al 2020 han lin ni  you 2020 the impact of the environmental conditions such as temperature relative and absolute humidity and sunlight on the virus stability and spread is largely unknown this review has collected all available data on the stability of sarscov2 and other coronaviruses from previously published reports we believe that the data provided herein should help establish a solid longterm protocol to interrupt indirect environmental transmission of sarscov2 limit its spread and mitigate its risksthe association of sarscov2 sarscov1 and merscov with acute respiratory diseases and their high loads detected in throat sputum and lower respiratory tract of infected persons indicate that viral particles of sarscov2 are shed in aerosols during coughing and sneezing calvet et al 2016 guery et al 2013 nhcprc 2020 pan et al 2020 the rna of sarscov1 has been detected in air samples collected from hospitals in china xiao et al 2004 the detection of rna of an animal cov such as pedv in air at 161 km distance from an infected farm in the united states indicates possible airborne transmission alonso et al 2014 although the detection of sarscov2 or its rna in aerosols has not yet been reported confirmed aerosol transmission of other coronaviruses suggests possible aerosol transmission of sarscov2 ge yang xia fu  zhang 2020 therefore understanding the persistence of sarscov2 is important to develop effective infection control measures of the virus in aerosolsthe persistence of various covs in aerosols at different environmental conditions has been studied the results of these studies are summarized in table 1 only two studies on aerosolized sarscov2 are available the first study compared the decay rates of sarscov2 and sarscov1 within 3h aerosolization time at room temperature 21c23c and a fixed relative humidity rh of 65 both viruses were detectable after 3 hr of aerosolization the median halflives were 109 and 118 hr for sarscov2 and sarscov1 respectively van doremalen et al 2020 in another study aerosolized sarscov2 retained its infectivity for a period of 16h at room temperature and the authors concluded that the virus can be considered as an airborne pathogen fears et al 2020 human coronavirus hcov229e a causative agent for common cold showed more stability in aerosols halflife  673 hr at similar conditions 20c and 50 rh and was infectious after 72 hr of aerosolization ijaz brunner sattar nair  johnsonlussenburg 1985 another study reported that infectious merscov was detectable after 1h of aerosolization despite a reduction in virus titre over the aerosolization time pyankov bodnev pyankova  agranovski 2018persistence of sarscov2 on plastic surface has been reported in two recent studies in the first study sarscov2 retained its infectivity for 4 days but was completely decayed after 7 days on plastic surface at room temperature and 65 rh chin et al 2020 the second study demonstrated that sarscov2 retained its infectivity for 3 days on plastic surface at room temperature the same study found no difference between the persistence of sarscov2 and sarscov1 on plastic surface and both viruses completely lost their infectivity after 4 days van doremalen et al 2020 duan et al 2003 reported longer persistence 4 days with complete decay after 5 days of sarscov1 on plastic surface on polystyrene petri dish sarscov1 survived for at least 6 days at room temperature and completely decayed after 9 days rabenau et al 2005 in another study sarscov1 retained its infectivity on plastic surface for 28 days at room temperature and 4050 rh chan et al 2011 although this study reported longer virus survival it has been shown that the survivability of sarscov1 on plastic surface is drastically affected by increases in temperature and rh as described belowas compared to sarscov1 and sarscov2 a little shorter survivability on plastic has been shown for merscov and hcov229e at room temperature both retained their infectivity for up to 2 days only and were completely inactivated after 3 days rabenau et al 2005 van doremalen bushmaker  munster 2013 in another study however hcov229e showed longer persistence 5 days on polyvinyl chloride pvc and polytetrafluoroethylene teflon at 21c and 3040 rh warnes little  keevil 2015one study reported that sarscov2 initial load  36 log tcid50 persisted for 3 days on stainless steel surface and that it became undetectable after 4 days van doremalen et al 2020 in another study a this virus with a higher initial load 55 log tcid50 retained its infectivity for 4 days and was completely inactivated after 7 days on stainless steel at room temperature and rh of 65 chin et al 2020 the available data demonstrated that the survivability of coronaviruses on metal surfaces differs according to the type of metal in general coronaviruses survive for shorter periods on copper copper nickel and brass than on stainless steel and zinc surfaces for instance sarscov1 persisted on copper for 8 hr while it remained infectious for 2 days on stainless steel with complete decay after 3 days van doremalen et al 2020 similarly hcov229e showed lower persistence on brass ranging from 10 min to 2 hr and copper nickel from 20 min to 1 hr than on stainless steel 5 days at room temperature and 3040 rh the reduction in virus persistence was found proportional to an increase in the copper content in brass and nickel table 2 warnes et al 2015 virucidal activity of copper and copper alloy was reported against various viruses and this might explain the short survival of covs on copper surface compared to other metal surfaces michels wilks noyce  keevil 2005 warns  keevil 2013in addition different survivability of various coronaviruses was observed on the same surface for instance sarscov2 showed lower survival on copper 4 hr than sarscov1 8 hr van doremalen et al 2020 similarly human coronavirus hcovoc43 showed shorter persistence 2 hr on aluminium than hcov229e which retained its infectivity for 6 hr under the same conditions of temperature and rh sizun yu  talbot 2000 some coronaviruses showed similar stability on the same surface such as merscov and sarscov1 both stayed infectious for up to 2 days on stainless steel surface at room temperature van doremalen et al 2013 and 2020 the porcine cov tgev and murine coronavirus mcov or mhv were detectable on stainless steel for 28 d with only 1 log reduction in their titres on day 1 casanova jeon rutala weber  sobsey 2010 the results presented here suggest that using coppermade common touch surfaces in hospitals might be helpful in reducing the persistence of sarscov2 furthermore the same virus might show different survivability on a single surface according to changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and rh as discussed belowrecently sarscov2 survivability on glass was studied at room temperature and rh of 65 the virus stayed infectious for 2 days and became completely undetectable after 4 days chin et al 2020 sarscov1 retained its infectivity for a longer time 4 days on glass at room temperature and completely decayed after 5 days duan et al 2003 the stability of sarscov1 on mosaic at room temperature was similar to its stability on glass survived for 3 days and decayed after 4 days duan et al 2003 similarly hcov229e survived for 5 days on either glass or ceramic surfaces at room temperature the time required for complete inactivation of this virus on both surfaces was not reported warnes et al 2015 on surgical latex gloves hcov229e survived for 3 hr and decayed after 6 hr while hcovoc43 survived for less than an hour and completely decayed after 1 hr sizun et al 2000 another study found that infectivity of hcov229e was detectable on silicon rubber at room temperature and 3040 rh for 3 days and that the virus became undetectable after 5 days warnes et al 2015the survivability of sarscov2 on cardboard was studied in comparison with sarscov1 sarscov2 survived for a longer time 1 day than sarscov1 which survived for only 8 hr under the same conditions van doremalen et al 2020 in a comparative study table 2 sarscov2 showed variable persistence on different porous surfaces in general it survived longer period of days on surfaces with higher porosity than those with lower porosity period of hours for instance it survived on inner and outer layers of surgical facemasks for 4 and 7 days respectively and for 1 day with complete decay after 2 days on cloth and banknotes however the virus survived for only 30 min on paper with complete decay after 3 hr chin et al 2020 sarscov1 demonstrated similar survivability behaviour in terms of the porosity of the surface it survived for 5 days on cloth and filter paper 4 days on press paper and wood boards and between 1 day and 2 days on disposable and cotton gowns respectively duan et al 2003 lai cheng  lim 2005 the survivability on lower porosity surfaces such as cardboard was only 8 hr van doremalen et al 2020 lai et al 2005 reported that survival of sarscov1 on cotton and disposable gowns and paper surfaces was proportional to the initial virus load table 2 compared to 6 hr survivability of hcov229e the hcovoc43 demonstrated lower survivability only 1 hr on cotton gauze sponges sizun et al 2000oral and upper respiratory tract fluids of the covid19 patients are key factors in sarscov2 transmission as the current data indicate that the major routes of transmission are droplet contact and aerosols lu  shi 2020 faecaloral transmission is also postulated since rna of sarscov2 was detected in anal swab samples collected from covid19 patients in china chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a in addition infectious sarscov2 particles were isolated from stool specimens of covid19 patients zhang et al 2020 furthermore nucleic acid of sarscov2 was detected in urine samples from covid19 cases wang li et al 2020 therefore it is very important to know how stable sarscov2 is in oral fluids and excrements of humans to help us project the roles that these items can play in transmitting this virus to date no data are available on the survival of sarscov2 in human excrements however this can be extrapolated from the available data on other covs table 3it has been found that coronaviruses can survive in stools for 1 hr to 4 days depending on the type and ph of the stool samples for instance sarscov1 survived in stool specimens from baby ph  67 normal adult ph  78 another normal adult ph  8 and adult with diarrhoea ph  9 for 1 hr 3 hr 6 hr and 4 days respectively the same virus was completely decayed in the same samples after 3 hr 6 hr 1 day and 5 days respectively lai et al 2005 similarly wang et al 2005 demonstrated that sarscov1 survived for 4 days and completely decayed after 5 days at room temperature in faecal samples collected from sarscov1 patients the same study found that the virus could survive for 2 days and decayed completely after 3 days at room temperature in domestic sewage wang et al 2005 both human coronavirus hcov229e and feline coronavirus fcov or feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv survived for 2 days and decayed after 3 days in primary and secondary effluents activated sludge at 23c gundy gerba  pepper 2009 the tgev and the mcov mhv survived for longer periods 21 days for both in pasteurized settled sewage at room temperature the tgev decayed after 35 days while mcov was inactivated within 28 days under the same conditions casanova rutala weber and sobsey 2009two studies reported different persistence patterns of coronaviruses in urine duan et al 2003 detected the infectivity of sarscov1 in urine for up to 5 days however the infectivity of the same virus was detected in urine for up to 17 days at room temperature in another study wang et al 2005 none of the two studies reported the period for complete decay of the virus in human sputum sarscov1 persisted for 5 days while in human blood serum it persisted for 4 days and decayed completely after 5 days duan et al 2003in light of these results possible faecaloral transmission of sarscov2 is suggested furthermore human coronaviruses such as sarscov1 and merscov have been considered as having potential for foodborne transmission greening  cannon 2016 this is because several studies reported the association of gastroenteritis symptoms and infection by sarscov1 and merscov chan et al 2015 cheng et al 2004 some studies revealed that up to 106 of patients with sarscov1 and 30 of patients with merscov had diarrhoea chan et al 2020 likewise diarrhoea and gastroenteritis symptoms have been reported in some cases of sarscov2 infection chan et al 2020 song et al 2020 this indicates that sarscov2 may also have the potential for foodborne and waterborne transmission this risk is probably greater in developing countries which are known to have poor water treatment systems poor hygienic measures in food processing and food service areas and use untreated or partially treated sewage for irrigating fresh produce aboubakr  goyal 2019 goyal  aboubakr 2016 mans armah steele  taylor 2016 it should be noted however that until now there is no evidence implicating food or waterborne transmission of sarscov2 in developed countries it is unlikely that foodborne transmission is occurring widely through food handlers as the level of virus deposited on foods is quite low and most of it would be inactivated in the stomach acid li zhao  hsern 2021 moore goulter  jaykus 2015 however this route of transmission cannot be completely excluded as assessed in a detailed risk assessment study by the ukfood standards agency oakenfull  wilson 2020the stability of coronaviruses has been studied in several types of waters table 4 at room temperature sarscov1 suspended in water stayed detectable for 3 days and was undetectable after 5 days duan et al 2003 another study reported only 2 days persistence and 3 days for complete decay of this virus in both chlorinated and dechlorinated tap water at room temperature wang et al 2005 the human coronavirus hcov229e survived a little longer 6 days with complete decay after 10 days in dechlorinated tap water gundy et al 2009 on the other hand animal coronavirus such as tgev and mcov showed much longer survivability in reagentgrade water at room temperature the infectivity of tgev was detectable for 6 weeks which became undetectable after 7 weeks while mcov stayed detectable for 7 weeks the end of the study period with no complete decay reported casanova et al 2009many studies have reported higher persistence of several covs in water and liquids at lower temperatures as compared to higher temperatures table 4 for instance the infectivity of sarscov1 in dechlorinated tap water was detectable for 14 days at 4c but for only 2 days at 20c wang et al 2005 similarly hcov229e decayed completely after 10 days in dechlorinated water at 23c but was detectable at least for 25 days at 4c in the same type of water gundy et al 2009 another study showed that after 49 days the tgev completely decayed in reagentgrade water at room temperature 25c while stayed infectious in the same type of water when stored at 4c for the same period the mcov mhv showed similar results in the same study casanova et al 2009 after 2 weeks the titres of lake watersuspended tgev and mhv were reduced by 25 log when stored at 25c but only 12 and 1 log of virus titres respectively were reduced at 4c in the same type of water casanova et al 2009sarscov2 persisted for 14 7 and 1 day in dulbeccos modified eagle medium dmem at 4c 22c and 37c respectively when the temperature was increased to 56c and 70c the persistence time was dramatically reduced to 10 min and 1 min respectively chin et al 2020 sarscov1 stayed detectable in dmem for 2 hr at 4c 20c and 37c however when storage temperature was increased to 56c 67c and 75c the virus decayed completely after 15 hr 1 hr and 30 min respectively duan et al 2003 another study on sarscov1 in dmem found that the virus stayed detectable after 1 hr at 56c and 65c but decayed completely after 45 min at 75c darnell subbarao feinstone  taylor 2004 likewise merscov stability in dmem decreased with an increase in temperature leclercq batejat burguire  manuguerra 2014 sarscov1 was detectable in minimal essential medium mem for 30 min at 4c while at 56c and 60c it became completely undetectable after 30 min rabenau et al 2005 the decrease in virus infectivity due to an increase in temperature was also reported for animal coronaviruses such as mouse coronavirus mcov or mhv and canine coronavirus ccov in mem and for tgev in hepes buffer laude 1981 saknimit inatsuki sugiyama  yagami 1988several studies have found that the survivability of coronaviruses in aerosols is affected by environmental conditions particularly temperature and relative humidity for instance the survival of hcov229e in aerosols was studied at two temperatures 6c and 20c and three rh levels low 30 medium 50 high 80 ijaz et al 1985 the high and low rh levels represented the two extremes in indoor atmospheric conditions in the temperate regions in the summer and winter seasons respectively while medium rh reflected the inside atmosphere of climatically controlled buildings the two temperatures were selected to represent the range encountered in late winter and early spring 6c to 20c or in indoor environments 20c the results demonstrated that hcov229e survived longer at 6c than 20c at all rh levels table 1 in addition the aerosolized virus survived for a longer time at medium rh 50 with halflives of 1025 hr and 673 hr at 6 and 20c respectively on the other hand high rh 80 at 20c was found to be the least favourable to the survival of aerosolized virus as it showed only 3 hr halflife at these conditions ijaz et al 1985the stability of merscov in aerosols for 10 min was studied under 20c40 rh and 20c70rh reflecting average indoor and outdoor environment during winter in the middle east region respectively the results showed that the virus was less stable at higher rh than lower rh van doremalen et al 2013 another study on merscov was carried out at two different environmental conditions 25c 79rh and 38c 24rh mimicking the common office and summer season climates in the middle eastern region at the common office condition low temperature and high rh 63 of the virus retained its infectivity however virus survival drastically decreased 47 survival in the hot and dry air common to the summer season pyankov et al 2018many studies have shown that the persistence of coronaviruses on surfaces and fomites is affected by temperature and relative humidity in general the available data show that coronaviruses survive longer at low temperatures and low rh table 2 for instance under 8090rh and 95 rh sarscov1 lost 075log and 1 log of its titre respectively on plastic surface at 33c after 1 day while at 38c 2 and 35 log reduction in virus titre was seen chan et al 2011 similar results were observed for merscov on plastic and stainless steel surfaces at 30c the virus decayed completely after 2 days and 1day when the samples were stored at 30 and 80 rh respectively however at 40 rh lower temperature 20c increased the persistence of the virus and delayed its complete decay to 3 days van doremalen et al 2013 the tgev and mcov showed lower persistence on stainless steel under high temperature and high rh after 28 days at 4c tgev titre was reduced by 025 and 3 logs under 20 and 80 rh respectively however the log reduction in virus titre was higher 2 and 5 log respectively at 20c casanova et al 2010 similarly the titre of mcov mhv was reduced by 025 and 25 logs under 20 and 80 rh respectively when stored at 4c on stainless steel surface at 20c  however 2 and 5 log reduction was seen casanova et al 2010temperature has also been shown to influence the persistence of coronaviruses in sewage the infectivity of sarscov1 was detectable for 14 days in domestic sewage when it was stored at 4c but for only 2 days at 20c wang et al 2005 in pasteurized settled sewage the infectivity of both porcine coronavirus tgev and mouse coronavirus mcov or mhv was detectable for up to 35 days at 4c but for 21 days only at 25c casanova et al 2009conformational changes in the spike proteins of covs are essential to enable the fusion of the virion with the host cell weismiller sturman buchmeier fleming and holmes 1990 found that this process is induced in mcov mhv at a ph of 80 on the contrary neutral ph mediated the spike proteins fusion of sarscov1 with the host cell xiao chakraborti dimitrov gramatikoff  dimitrov 2003 procock and garwes 1975 also demonstrated that adsorption penetration uncoating and rna replication of tgev in the host cell was determined by ph in general it has been found that covs are more stable at nearneutral ph as compared to the extreme acidic or alkaline ph sarscov1 suspended in mem completely lost its infectivity after 1 hr exposure to extreme acidic ph 1 and 3 and extreme alkaline ph 12 and 14 regardless of the temperature 4c 25c and 37c however the virus retained its infectivity when stored at ph 5 7 and 9 for 1 hr darnell et al 2004 similarly hcov 229e mhv tgev and ccov showed more stability at slightly acidic to neutral ph 675 than at highly acidic or highly alkaline ph 8 at both low and high temperatures however low temperature 4c increases the stability of these viruses at extreme ph values than at higher temperatures 25c and 37c daniel  talbot 1987 lamarre  talbot 1989 pocock et al 1975 pratelli 2008 sturman ricard  holmes 1990 in contrast to other covs sarscov2 showed higher stability when incubated at room temperature in the transport medium for 1 hr at a wide range of ph values ph 310 chin et al 2020 this finding may help explain the high spread rate of sarscov2 as compared to other human coronaviruses such as sarscov1 and merscovthe results presented in the previous sections clearly show that the ability of coronaviruses to survive in aerosols on surfaces and fomites and in suspensions and liquids is affected by temperature and relative humidity in general human and animal covs including sarscov2 showed more persistence under low temperature and low rh these results indicate that the spread of sarscov2 might be seasonally associated with winter and that it might be easier to control the virus spread during the summer months because of the high temperature and high humidity during those monthsthis assumption is supported by the fact that annual epidemics of influenza virus and hcov in temperate climates are usually activated by a sudden drop in outdoor temperatures sundell andersson brittainlong lindh  westin 2016 this is attributed to the lower amount of water vapour that a unit of air can hold at low temperature which means that the air is very dry in terms of the absolute humidity ah and this leads to a reduction in the size of aerosol droplets due to evaporation this prolongs the time when the infectious droplets remain airborne thereby increasing the chance of infecting new hosts harper 1961 on the same principle maintaining high humidity along with indoor heating during winter months might reduce the transmission of these viruses this is attributed to the indoor heating during wintertime which causes a sharp decrease in the rh of the indoor environment and subsequently reduces the size of aerosol particles through evaporation yang  marr 2011recent epidemiological studies consistently report a strong relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of sarscov2 wang jiang et al 2020 studied the relationship between daily means of temperatures and cumulative numbers of confirmed covid19 cases in the world from january 20 to february 4 2020 they found that temperature can alter the transmission of sarscov2 and suggested that countries and regions with a lower temperature should adopt the strictest control measures to prevent future reversal another study examined the effect of temperature and humidity on the global patterns of early outbreak dynamics of covid19 between january and march 2020 they found a strong impact of temperature and the humidity on the growth rate of covid19 cases across the world the growth rate of covid19 cases peaked at a temperature of 5c and a humidity of 061 kpa in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere during the outbreak month while it decreased in regions that had warmer or colder temperatures ficetola  rubolini 2020 a similar study found that the high covid19 community transmission areas across the world are located along the 3050 n corridor at similar weather patterns of 5c 11c average temperatures with low specific 36 gkg and absolute humidity 47 gm3 sajadi et al 2020 likewise average pressure average temperature minimum temperature and average water vapour pressure were found to be significantly correlated with the incidence of covid19 li et al 2020another epidemiological modelling study projected recurrent wintertime outbreaks of sarscov2 within the next five years kissler tedijanto goldstein grad  lipsitch 2020 a group of 200 ecological niche models were developed to project monthly variation in climate suitability for spread of sarscov2 throughout a typical climatological year the models showed that temperate warm and cold climates are more suitable to spread of the virus whereas arid and tropical climates are less favourable arajo  naimi 2020 contrary to the aforementioned reports another study reported that there is no evidence for temperaturedependence of the covid19 pandemic jamil alam gojobori  duarte 2020 we think that even if the climate conditions of summer season or warm regions may mitigate the growth rate of covid19 cases no geographical region is immune to this risk since the fast growth rate of covid19 cases has also occurred in some warm climates such as brazil and the philippines therefore strict measures for controlling the spread of the disease remain essential in all areas of the world and the absence of containment actions might lead to severe outbreaks in warm regions too hellewell et al 2020the international commission on illumination cie classified the ultraviolet radiation into three bands uvc 100280 nm uvb 280315 nm and uva 315400 nm visible light is the region between 400 nm and 780 nm the uvc is known as germicidal uv as it is absorbed by rna and dna bases of the virus thereby causing photochemical fusion of two adjacent pyrimidines and forming covalently linked dimers which then become nonpairing bases perdiz et al 2000 the potential of uvb inducing the formation of pyrimidine dimers is 20100fold lower than that of uvc perdiz et al 2000 dna and rna absorb uva weakly and therefore its effect is much lower than uvc and uvb in the formation of pyrimidine dimers however uva may cause other genetic damage such as oxidation of the bases and strand cleavage through the production of reactive oxygen species ravanat douki  cadet 2001a few studies have investigated the effect of artificial ultraviolet radiation uvr on coronaviruses table 5 sarscov1 was completely inactivated 6 log reduction in mem following 1hr exposure to uvc 260nm irradiance of 90 wcm2 at 83 cm exposure distance duan et al 2003 in a comparative study 6 min exposure to uvc 254nm irradiance of 4016 wcm2 completely inactivated 55 log of sarscov1 however 15 min exposure to uva 365nm irradiance of 2133 wcm2 did not show any virucidal efficacy against this virus darnell et al 2004 a third study demonstrated 53 and 63 log reduction of sarscov1 following exposure to 134 wcm2 of uvc 254 for 15 and 60 min respectively without complete inactivation of the virus kariwa fujii  takashima 2006 another study showed a 48 log reduction in ccov after 3 days of exposure to a very weak irradiance 71 wcm2 of uvc at 4 cm exposure distance pratelli 2008it is known that optical radiation from the sun is the only natural source of uvr that reaches the earth through the atmosphere however only twothirds of the energy from the sun that impinges on the atmosphere penetrates to the ground level the uvr comprises 5 of the total radiation received at the surface of the earth this component is extremely important in various biological processes solar iarc 1992 based on the virucidal efficacy of artificial uv radiation presented above and because there is no consensus on the suggested correlation between climate temperature and covid19 spread backer 2020 investigated the correlation between irradiance or sunlight and covid19 spread this observational study revealed that sun irradiance reduces the transmission of sarscov2 for example covid19 epidemic exploded during the darkest january in over 10 years in wuhan bcker 2020 on the other hand the available experimental data do not support this suggestion despite the reported virucidal efficacy of uvc its radiation from sun is completely filtered by the atmosphere and it does not reach the earths surface who 2020f in addition 95 of the suns uv radiation reaching the earths surface is uva who 2020f which has no virucidal efficacy table 4 on the other hand the uvb of the sun partially penetrates and reaches the earths surface and its influence on other viruses has been reported elghorr horsburgh  norval 1998 hart reid  hart 1993 karmer bos  teunissen 1995 sagripanti  lytle 2007 therefore studying the efficacy of sunlight and uvb on sarscov2 and the spread of covid19 might provide some explanation on the observed correlation between sun irradiance and covid19 spreadthe facts that the human coronaviruses hcov229e sarscov1 and sarscov2 can remain infectious in aerosols for 3 to 16 hr and can survive at room temperature and rh of 65 for a few days suggest possible airborne transmission of sarscov2 therefore stringent preventive measures should be taken by people in highrisk regions and in healthcare settings to avoid this possible route of transmission these findings support the cdc and who recommendations of covering faces by respirators or surgical masks or even by cloth covers in public during the covid19 epidemic the persistence of sarscov1 and sarscov2 was significantly low on copper latex and less porous fabrics as compared to other surfaces such as metals stainless steel and zinc glass and more porous fabrics this information might be helpful in designing methods to significantly decrease viral transmission in healthcare buildings and other areas at riskthe reported survival of sarscov1 and animal coronaviruses tgev and mcov in water and sewage along with diarrhoea and gastroenteritis symptoms linked to sarscov2 infection indicates the possibility of foodborne and waterborne transmission of sarscov2 this poses additional risk in developing countries because of their use of sewagepolluted waters for irrigation in addition to having poor water treatment systems although there are no confirmed foodborne or waterborne cases of sarscov2 so far it is very important to devise methods that can concentrate small amounts of this virus from large amounts of water wastewater and foods so adequate surveillance and epidemiological studies can be undertakenthe longer survival of covs at low temperatures and low relative humidity explains the observed peaks of covid19 cases during the cold and dry climates in temperate regions of the world and explains the predicted seasonality of the virus spread by epidemiological models additionally a sun irradiancedependent spread of sarscov2 has been suggested in an observational study although the efficacy of the artificial uvc against sarscov1 has been reported it does not support the suggested influence of suns irradiance on sarscov2 spread because all natural uvc radiated by the sun is blocked by the atmosphere and does not reach the earth since artificial uva showed no effect on sarscov1 it does not support the suggested sun irradiancedependent sarscov2 spread because the major type of natural solar uv radiation that reaches the earth is uva a few studies have shown virucidal efficacy of uvb on viruses other than covs however experimental studies on the efficacy of artificial uvb on sarscov2 are required to provide an explanation of the observed sun irradiancedepended covid19 spreadthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any

manuscript haa tas and smg reviewed and edited the final version of the manuscripta pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in china and first officially reported on 31 december 2019 the world health organization who announced a name for the new coronavirus disease covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 on 11 february 20201 since then covid-19 has been spreading throughout the world and a rapid increase in deaths has been reported in many countries as of 28 march a total of 571678 cases and 26494 deaths have been confirmed2 one study has estimated that there will be a total of 81114 deaths from covid-19 over the next four months in the us alone3 the number of covid-19 cases and deaths in japan is gradually increasing with 1499 cases including 60 critical cases and 49 deaths reported as of 28 march4 several small clusters of infected groups have been increasing in urban areas including those in hospitals and nursing homes in addition to cases with unlinked infections nevertheless the total number of deaths and severely ill patients has been comparatively small especially relative to the countrys population size as of 28 march the total number of deaths was 9136 in italy 4858 in spain and 1243 in the united states5 furthermore the trend of the increase is not sharp the reasons for this mild trend have been questioned outside japan6over the past few decades japan has not experienced any serious damage from new infectious diseases such as sars severe acute respiratory syndrome mers middle east respiratory syndrome or the ebola virus although japan experienced the 2009 h1n1 influenza flu pandemic the rate of deaths per 100000 population was 016 as of the end of may 2010 which was the lowest worldwide ironically this history of escapes might delay the establishment of the emergency operation headquarters in japan the urgent expansion of polymerase chain reaction pcr tests which must be the frontline response to the novel coronavirus outbreak has faced time-consuming obstacles in japan a recent revision of the act on special measures for pandemic influenza and new infectious diseases preparedness and response allows the prime minister to declare a state of emergency for the outbreak but under the current legislation no central or local government can enforce lockdowns such as those undertaken in other countriesunder such limitations the current goal of the japanese government is to avoid an explosive increase in patients that would exceed the limit of intensive or critical care units in hospitals in urban areas to meet this goal the government policy consists of three strategies early detection of clusters and rapid response enhancement of the early diagnosis of patients and intensive care for severely affected patients and strengthening of the universal healthcare system and public behavioral change7with regard to the first and second strategies the ministry of health labour and welfare mhlw strongly promotes contact tracing social distancing and pneumonia surveillance under the direction of the patient cluster countermeasure group in the mhlw headquarters for novel coronavirus disease control regional public health centers conduct the contact tracing asking infected persons and their close contacts to maintain social distancing for 14 days and allocating available hospital beds or hospital wards in designated local communities to covid-19 patients in clinical settings the large number of computed tomography ct scanners in japan 11149 per million population8 supports physicians in investigating suspicious pneumonia cases in the absence of conducting massive pcr tests in the population this policy approach might lead to a relatively slower increase in the number of cases and deathsregarding the third strategy public behavioral change by the middle of february 2020 the mhlw encouraged the japanese public to practise frequent handwashing and coughing etiquette using a handkerchief or sleeve instead of hands to catch a cough or sneeze furthermore the mhlw had prioritized access to healthcare for elderly people people suffering from fatigue or shortness of breath and people with underlying health conditions the mhlw had also asked the public younger than 65 years old not to visit clinics for at least four days if they experience cold symptoms or a fever of 375c or higher until 8 may 20209 this restriction might be a shock to japanese citizens who are typically allowed free access to clinics and hospitalsin analyses of contact tracing it was found that one infected person tended to infect more than one other person at locations with certain characteristics on 24 february the expert meeting on the control of novel coronavirus infection asked the public to refrain from attending places involving close face-to-face contact between people within an arms length of each other in conversations and similar interactions for more than a given length of time in crowds since then but prior to other similar slogans that have appeared around the world the government has been campaigning for avoidance of these situations with the slogan avoid the overlapping 3 cs closed spaces with poor ventilation crowded places with many people nearby close-contact settings such as close-range conversations in addition to regular ventilation and wiping of shared surfaces such as door handles knobs and bed fences and goods with diluted household chlorine bleach avoid the overlapping 3 cs has been the core and unique message against covid-19 in japanthis study examines three research questions 1 how do japanese citizens especially those who are relatively active in terms of work and life activities and therefore have increased opportunities to spread infections to others including older people vulnerable to the covid-19 implement the governments three cs precautionary measures 2 how effective are these requests from the government 3 who has changed their daily precautionary behaviour and who has notseveral previous studies have investigated changes in precautionary behavior against the coronavirus for example an online survey conducted on 29 january of 3083 mainland chinese respondents revealed that adults living in urban areas had stronger awareness of the issue than those in rural areas 727 vs 661 p000110 another online survey conducted between 23 february and 2 march in the us n  2986 and the uk n  2988 showed that adult residents have a good understanding of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms although they also have important misconceptions and discriminatory attitudes toward people of east asian ethnicity due to covid-19s origin in china11 the latest study in italy clarified the three types of attitude to covid-19 among italian citizens people who trust authority and choose isolation fatalists who are keen on social media and uninformed youth 12 the gallup international association also recently conducted a snap poll in 28 countries including 1115 japanese participants asking about precautionary procedures and their findings indicated that 71 percent of japanese participants had adopted more frequent handwashing13 what is still unclear however is the trigger for behavioural change around covid-19 and who is more actively implementing prevention measures in the gallup survey the response period and sample attribution are also unclear furthermore this survey is not necessarily informative for policymaking as it does not reveal who is not implementing prevention measuresusing a large sample of cross-sectional survey data this study investigates how and at what point japanese citizens changed their precautionary behaviour in this situation in which the government has only requested rather than mandated their cooperationthis study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted via an online platform of an online research company macromill inc japan from a pool of approximately 12 million registered individuals residing in japan we recruited a total of 11342 males and females aged from 20 to 64 years we limit our sample to those under 65 years of age in order to focus on the behavioural changes of the working-age population who tend to be relatively active and have more opportunities to spread infections to others in the recruitment process for this study quota sampling was conducted so that the sample distributions among gender male or female age group 20s 30s 40s 50s or 60s and employment status regular employee non-regular employee self-employed or not working were representative of the japanese population based on statistics from the labor force survey ministry of internal affairs and communications our survey was conducted between 26 and 28 march 2020 we originally determined the target number of participants as 11000 and accepted participants until the target number was reached due to the timing of closure the final number of participants exceeded the target please note that we automatically eliminated duplicate answers from a single respondent and that there was a monetary incentive for participationin addition to providing individual characteristics the participants were asked to answer 11 items rating their prevention measures against novel coronavirus infections such as social distancing and coughing etiquette on a scale of 1 to 5 thus after summarizing demographic characteristics based on the total male and female and under-40 and over-40 categories we aggregate and compare the proportion of participants who have been taking those prevention measuresthe participants were also asked what kind of events caused them to change their behaviours and rated the reliability and frequency of consulting of 10 information sources about the coronavirus on a scale of 1 to 5 thus we calculate and compare the frequency and reliability by information sourcenext to detect factors associated with behavioural change the participants were also asked about their drinking and smoking habits personality traits were measured by the five factor personality questionnaire ten-item personality inventory tipi 14 the five personality traits assessed by tipi are extraversion agreeableness conscientiousness emotional stability and openness to experienceswe estimate a logit model where the dependent variable is a dummy indicating 1 if the participant chose not at all or not true to the question do you avoid the three overlapping cs and where independent variables are individual characteristicswe analyzed the data using statamp version 160 for mac statacorp college station tx united statesour survey falls outside the scope of the japanese governments ethical guidelines for medical and health research involving human subjects and there are no national guidelines in japan for social and behavioural research therefore our study was carried out in accordance with the ethical principles for sociological research of the japan sociological society which do not require ethical reviewsall survey participants gave their consent to participate in the anonymous online survey by macromill inc the authors did not obtain any personal information about the participants after being informed about the purposes of the study and their right to quit the survey participants agreed to participate they were provided with the option i dont want to respond for all questions completion of the entire questionnaire was considered to indicate participant consentthe characteristics of the sample both as a whole and separated by gender male or female or age under or over 40 years old are summarized in table 1 the total sample size is 11342 with almost equal gender distribution gender and age distribution are proportional to that of the japanese population university or college graduates constituted about 5060 percent of respondents about half of the total sample is composed of regular employees usually indefinite and full-time employees about a quarter of respondents had a household income of 45 million yenin the survey the participants were asked to answer to the question have you taken any measures to prevent novel coronavirus infections or outbreaks table 2 shows a variety of prevention measures taken aggregating a proportion of the participants who answered very true and true for each prevention measurelooking at the first four prevention measures which have been continuously requested by the japanese government and the expert meeting on control of novel coronavirus infection it was found that 80 percent have attempted to avoid the overlapping three cs of the total 57 percent have attempted avoid conversations or shouting in close proximity which was a relatively low figure among the three cs looking next at the fifth prevention measure more than 85 percent of all participants reported practising social distancing by avoiding mass gatherings regarding gender and age differences more females than males and more older than younger participants are supportive of social distancing as shown by the differences in the confidence intervalsregarding hygiene practices frequent handwashing is conducted by about 86 percent of all about 91 percent of female and about 88 percent of over-40 participants coughing etiquette was implemented by 77 percent of the participants many also answered that they have avoided going out when ill with a coldas for the measures to strengthen individual immunity around 70 percent of the participants reported getting sufficient rest and sleep or eating a nutritious diet again focusing on gender and age differences prevention measures are conducted more often by females and older peoplehowever regardless of gender and age about 40 percent of participants have prepared consultation and transportation methods to use in the event they become illto explore the triggers of the behavioural changes and preparedness observed above the participants were asked what was the most important event influencing these actions the responses are summarized in fig 1 the figure shows that about 23 percent of the participants cited the infection aboard the diamond princess cruise ship15 that occurred around early february 2020 when there were still few domestic cases the diamond princess is a british-registered cruise ship on which an 80-year-old passenger from hong kong tested positive for covid-19 on 1 february 2020 because the ship was in japanese waters it was quarantined in february 2020 for nearly a month with about 3700 passengers and crew on board other participants noted events from the end of february including the alert from the expert meeting 56 percent the statement of emergency by the governor of hokkaido northern island of japan 74 percent and the request by the prime minister to not attend mass gatherings 78 percent the next large trigger was the request by the prime minister for nationwide school closures in japan on 28 february 2020 about 14 percent finally worldwide outbreak around early march 22 percent also attracted participants attentionto explore what kinds of information affected their behavioural change and preparedness the survey asked participants to report the frequency at which they consult certain sources about the novel coronavirus infection and to rate the reliability of the information source as they perceive it the results are summarized in table 3table 3 shows that almost 90 percent receive information from tv news programs and internet news sites and that about 50 percent trust such information mainstream scientists have expressed annoyance at the fear-mongering on tv talk and variety shows and these formats are slightly favoured but considered less credible among the public meanwhile information from the central and local government received by 60 percent including the prime minister and the expert meeting is relatively trusted by the participants 50 percent among official sources the local government is the most trusted newspapers national and local are read by only about 42 percent of the participants and about 48 percent answered that they trust information from newspaperslooking at the differences in gender and age females tend to seek more information and trust it more than males except for the information from newspapers participants over 40 years old tend to access and trust the information from tv newspapers and officials more than those under 40 years old do while young people often seek and trust news from the internet and sns appsas we confirmed in table 2 more than 80 percent of the participants have been implementing social distancing measures and most japanese citizens seem to be exhibiting some behavioural change to prevent coronavirus infections however this also means that about 20 percent may not be conducting sufficient prevention measuresto detect what kind of individuals are included in the group not conducting prevention measures we conducted a multivariate analysis table 4 shows the estimation results of the multivariate logit model all the variables in the first column in table 4 were included as independent variables like the other tables table 4 shows the results based on the total male and female and under-40 and over-40 categories the number shown in the table is an odds ratio so the estimates that are significantly higher than 1 indicate a higher tendency to not conduct proper social distancinglooking at the estimation results in table 4 males people in their 20s and unmarried people exhibit significantly higher odds ratios indicating that these groups tend not to conduct preventive social distancing although work status is not generally associated with this prevention measure females regular employees and non-regular employees tended to exhibit higher odds ratios than self-employed or unemployed peopleregarding household annual income the lowest group less than 2000k jpy has significantly higher odds ratio for the total female and under-40 categorieshigher odds ratios for not conducting social distancing are associated with drinking for males and smoking for females furthermore those with higher extraversion scores also tend to exhibit significantly higher odds ratio in many cases while conscientiousness and agreeableness are associated with lower odds ratio in most casesbefore this survey was conducted the request by the japanese government for self-restraint in avoiding mass gatherings had become an issue for example on 22 march 2020 the k-1 grand prix a martial arts event was held despite the ministers and local governors pleas for restraint and 6500 participants were packed into the saitama super arena on 23 march more than 50000 gathered in sendai to see the olympic flame which had recently arrived from greece16 we asked the participants whether they supported this policy approach as shown in table 5 about 29 percent of participants support the idea that the government should now allow mass gatherings males tend to support allowing mass gatherings more than females on the other hand 65 percent supported government limitations on movement in addition to self-restraint in avoiding mass gatherings in order to shorten the period of the pandemic there are no significant differences among gender and age categories for this questionunder circumstances in which there is no enforced ban on mass gathering or travelling beyond the home region our findings indicate that a large portion of japanese citizens seem to be implementing proper prevention measures on their own before the end of march 2020we found that more than three-quarters of the survey participants have taken some preventive actions including social distancing handwashing coughing etiquette and strengthening immunity because the previous empirical studies did not include developed countries like japan 17 there is little scientific evidence that japanese people prefer cleanliness and tend to wash their hands relatively more frequently than other countries in japanese communities water facilities for handwashing with soap and hand sanitizers are normally placed various public places such as train stations and supermarkets moreover handwashing became a regular practice at home and school through post-war education18 in general japanese people have developed the discipline of washing their hands before eating meals and after using the toilet it is also well known that japanese people greet others with a bow instead of a handshake kiss or hug this cultural behavior implies that the frequency of body contact among japanese people may be lower than those in cultures with more tactile forms of greeting during hay fever season japanese citizens regularly wear surgical-style masks for prevent symptoms wearing a mask may be a less popular preventive measure than some of the others in this study due to shortages of these products these already-habitual practices may be aiding behavioural changes among japanese citizens during these unusual timeswe also found that in the survey more than half of the participants had not prepared access to consultation centres or transportation methods in the event they become ill implying that they had not planned for the possibility of contracting covid-19 we must advise the public to prepare for such an event to talk to family and close friends about unexpected advanced care planning and to imagine not having access to a ventilator or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at the severe stageit was also found that one of the main motivations for behavioural change was the infection aboard the diamond princess cruise ship in early february 2020 at that time only a few cases of domestic infection had been reported in japan but news of the quarantine and positive test results among the passengers was broadcasted daily this may have contributed to japanese citizens changing their mindset and behaviour toward precautionary measures earlier than in europe and the us the sudden request by the prime minister for nationwide school closures in the end of february might also have been an effective measure for changing the mindsets of japanese citizens toward prevention even though this move was scientifically questioned and confusing to the public especially to single parents and double-income householdsour survey shows that information from the expert meeting and centrallocal governments including the prime minister are relatively trusted by survey participants the expert meeting and centrallocal government have held frequent press conferences to clarify the tentative scientific risks and encourage citizens to conduct prevention measures such crisis communication attempts may have caused behavioural changes in japanese citizens the most trusted resource in this study was information from the local government which was a hopeful result as the countermeasures against the virus are decided and conducted at the local levelin the past when japan experienced natural disasters such as earthquakes typhoons and tsunamis the local governments contributed to providing timely and organized information to disadvantaged residents through the government alert system based on those experiences it may be important that for local governments to provide information or predictions about covid-19 through these systemsregarding the information from newspapers it is problematic that although about half of the people say they trust newspapers not everyone accesses them people may be inclined instead to use electronic-based media which is easier to accessdespite the overall trend toward behavioural change however the results also show that about 20 percent of the participants are reluctant to implement proper prevention measures the statistical analysis indicates that those people are typically male younger under 30 years old unmarried and in lower-income households and have a drinking or smoking habit and a higher extraversion score to prevent the spread of infection in japan it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioral change in various ways that will reach and move them it is notable that approximately 65 percent of the participants support stricter countermeasures such as limitation of movement as we mentioned in the introduction as of yet the government has not issued mandatory stay-at-home orders or offered financial aid to those affected by such measures the current requests from centrallocal governments are not legally binding and individuals and businesses must arrange financial compensation independent of the government we should observe how effective these measures are in japan over the long term to determine whether the current law should be revised to allow for more forceful enforcement in preparation for the next pandemicthere are several limitations to this study first the data were self-reported and participants actual behaviours have not been observed second our sample includes people from 20 to 64 years of age but not those 65 and older so the external validity for older peoples behaviour is rather limitedthird the sample was not collected based on random sampling from the whole population of japan but through quota sampling from individuals who were recruited by or who self-enrolled in the internet panel of the online research company macromill inc participation involved monetary incentives quota sampling ensured a similar distribution to the japanese population among demographic groups gender age and work status but the sample within each group does not necessarily reflect the population for example our sample may induce a healthy respondents bias or similar selection bias since any persons including those who often use the internet those incentivized by monetary gain and those who have a vested interest in the prevention measures taken against covid-19 were able to participate in our survey in fact as has been the case with previous studies 19 our sample was found to have a higher socioeconomic status than the general population in terms of income and educationfourth in our survey the income variables are not available for approximately 25 percent of the participants thus the number of observations used in the regression shown in the table are limited which may bring about selection bias however please note that even though income variables are not included in the regression the results are robust in terms of the sign significance and magnitude of the estimatesfifth we obtained this dataset at the end of march 2020 when the infection is not explosively widespread in japan this study should be repeated to find more effective solutions at various periods during and after the covid-19 pandemicsince december 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases infected with novel coronavirus have been reported in wuhan china through genome-wide sequencing and culture identification of patients sample a new type of betacoronavirus has been identified it was named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and became the seventh member of the coronavirus family that can infect humans 1because the outbreak of this new coronavirus pneumonia coincided with the chinese lunar new year the cross-provincial transfers of people in china have provided excellent opportunities for the virus to spread throughout the country current evidence shows that the new coronavirus has a high infectivity with the basic reproduction number r0  22 95 ci 14 to 39 2 in order to prevent the transmission of 2019-ncov the chinese national health commission 3 has implemented different measures including centralized treatment for confirmed cases home-isolated or centralized medical observation for close contacts suspected cases mild cases and asymptomatic casesas a city with a large number of immigrants millions of migrant workers are returning to shenzhen after the chinese lunar new year which bringing great challenges to the prevention and control of the novel pneumonia people with travel history in hubei province or close contacts with confirmed cases were investigated and isolated at home or at designated hotels as required in shenzhen however the basic characteristics contact history self-protect measures and overall infection rate of people who receiving medical observation at home is not yet well understoodin this study we estimated the demographic characteristics travel history contact history self-protection measures infection situation and other key information of people who were quarantine at home to provide information for prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19people who were identified as close contacts with confirmed cases or had travel history in epidemic provinces were at higher risk of infection both of them need to be self-isolated for 14 days according to the shenzhens guideline for covid-19 prevention and control people who had travel history in epidemic provinces are required to be isolated at home and receive medical observations including regular temperature measurement and syndromic surveillance we regarded this group of people as our target population and used the formula nz2p2p1p to calculate sample size we set infection rate of 19-ncov as 5 the relative error  as 10 and  as 005 the sample size was calculated to be 1825 people considering the sample attrition we planned to recruit 2000 people in our studywe applied a stratified multistage random sampling process to recruit participants in this study first we randomly selected 2 streets from 10 districts in shenzhen then we randomly sampled 2 communities from the selected streets if the total number of people who receiving medical observation at home in selected community was less than 50 we merged the community with its neighboring community to ensure that the total number of target people in the sampling unit at this stage was more than 50 people finally we used simple random sampling method to choose 50 target people each from the selected community or merged communitieswe collected data from feb 5 2020 to feb 10 2020 self-reported questionnaires and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were used to collect information of people under home quarantine considering that our participants might have been infected we developed online questionnaire and asked respondents to fill the questionnaire by themselves we collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens and employed the 2019-ncov real-time pcr kit to detect virus all the laboratory tests were conducted by the beijing genomics institution bgi shenzhenproportions and frequencies were used to report the results of categorical variables mean and range were used to express continuous variable statistical analyses were conducted using the stata software version151a total of 2004 people were involved in our study of which 1637 participants finished the questionnaire with a response rate of 817 table 1
shows the demographic characteristics of the study sample the prevalence of underlying diseases in this sample was 947 and the mean age was 337 range 03802 years old
table 2
shows the travel history of the sample in this study a total of 1213 subjects 7410 traveled to epidemic areas within 14 days before the home quarantine from them 129 people have traveled to wuhan city 1046 people have traveled to other cities in hubei province and 40 participants have been to other provinces such as sichuan and beijing most of the subjects drove private car for traveling and 1520 of the sample used public transportations excluding people who were long-term resident in the epidemic areas the average length of their stay was 42 days most of the participants arrived at shenzhen between jan 24 2020 to jan 27 2020 fig 1
 less than 1 of the participants reported any contact history with confirmed or suspected cases see table 2in our study sample more than 85 have taken various self-protection measures such as wearing masks washing hands and reducing outdoor events recommended by the specialist however there were still 96 subjects 588 who seldomly wearing masks table 3
we conducted nucleic acid testing for a total of 2004 people and three of these in our study tested positive for 2019ncov after recheck by shenzhen centers for disease control and prevention these persons were confirmed as covid-19 cases the incidence of covid-19 in the sample was 15 95 ci 031437 none of the three patients had obvious symptoms during the time of home quarantine table 4
 also they did not report any history of contacts with confirmed cases during their stay in wuhanhubeithis is the first population-based study to estimate the characteristics and the incidence of 2019-ncov infection among people who were quarantined at home using data collected from a stratified multistage random sample it presents results from a comprehensive descriptive analysis of the travel history and laboratory results and provides information for policy makers to produce guideline for the management of people who have travel history in epidemic areasthree quarters 7407 of our study population had travel history in january and february 2020 of which 9670 have been to hubei province most of the subjects 5901 arrived at shenzhen between jan 24 to jan 27 2020 right after the travel bans on jan 23 2020 considering that 2019-ncov is a highly contagious infectious disease 4 and the number of confirmed cases increased rapidly in hubei province people participated in our study have potentially been exposed to the virus during their travel therefore it is important to provide effective management measures to prevent the outbreak onset in our study population especially to stop transmission during the incubation period 5 we also recruited 424 people who did not have any travel histories but lived together with those personsincidence of confirmed covid-19 cases in our study population is 15 95 ci 031437 which is lower than the incidence 11 95ci 0431 calculated from the evacuation of korea japan germany singapore and france 6 this may be explained in two ways first most of participants in our study returned to shenzhen after the travel bans and the first level emergency response of guangdong province began on jan 23 2020 which resulted in restricted travel and strict temperature screening in and out of hubei province people who had symptoms such fever or cough were detected and isolated before entering shenzhen second less than 1 of the participants reported contact history with confirmed case and more than 85 of the subjects have taken self-protection measures wearing masks washing hands reducing outdoor events cancelling gatherings and following cough etiquette recommended by the government during their stay in epidemic areas since the common person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-ncov are direct transmission and contact transmission 7 the risk of getting infected is low without close contactsthree out of 2004 persons have confirmed 2019-ncov infection in our study which highlighted the importance of home quarantine quarantine is defined as restricting movement of people who have potentially been exposed to infectious diseases to prevent the transmission 89 it has been widely used in response to plague e g the black death severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and ebola outbreaks 10 11 12 13 in current covid-19 outbreak the three in one task force composed of community work stations community health centers and community police is responsible for home quarantine and medical observation in shenzhen during the 14 days of quarantine people are required to stay at home and daily necessities are ordered and delivered by community workers the task force members take their body temperature and record their health status twice a day and health workers in the task force need to assess if he or she need further investigation people who have travel history in epidemic areas and their cohabitants have red code on a smart phone application called ishenzhen people who staye at shenzhen have green code community workers and community polices take temperature and check codes for everyone in and out of the community at the entrance and only people with green code could pass after 14 days of home quarantine if people with travel history in epidemic areas do not have any symptoms they will receive a green code and a proof of complete quarantine consistent with previous experience home quarantine for people who have travel history in epidemic areas has been proven effective to prevent community transmission during the incubation period and the period of early onsethowever one of the three cases was confirmed as 2019-ncov infection 16 days after his arrival case 1 this patient had a transient high body temperature 374 c and another case had dry cough during the home quarantine moreover previous case reports suggested a high risk of severe illness for elderly people and those who had underlying health conditions 14 in our study 446 of the sample aged above 60 years old and 947 had at least one type of underlying disease such as hypertension diabetes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease et al awareness of incipient symptoms of covid-19 during the quarantine is important to speed up early detection and reduce poor clinical outcomes therefore regular training for community health workers and comprehensive instruction for people under home quarantine are requiredas of march 31 2020 there was no other case reported in the study population or in close contacts with our study population there was also no case reported in people who finished home quarantine in shenzhen this indicates that although there was case tested positive after 14 days of home quarantine in our study the risk of second outbreak due to people who complete home quarantine may be low however further information and study is required to estimate if asymptomatic patients are highly contagiousthe main limitation of this study is that nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected only once according to previous reports 1516 there were cases who were tested negative several times before they confirmed as 2019-ncov infections and laboratory results may show false negatives however as of feb 29 2020 there was no other case reported in the study population another limitation is that this is a sampling survey not a census incidence calculated in this study may not be representative for all the people under home quarantine in shenzhen we used a stratified multistage random sampling method and recruited participants who traveled from epidemic areas within 14 days before the home quarantine although further study is needed to get a more accurate incidence our findings provides preliminary evidence to improve measures of prevention and control of covid-19 especially for areas and cities that need to reduce early transmission from imported casesthis study suggests that home quarantine has been effective in reducing the early transmission of covid-19 but that more needs to be done to improve early detection of covid-19 infection regular training and systematic supervision for community health workers as well as comprehensive and feasible instructions for people under home quarantine should be provided since the 2019-ncov has been transmitted in multiple countries caused severe illness and huge disease burden experiences in china should be considered across the

reviewed and edited the manuscriptcoronaviruses are a large group of viruses that belong to the coronaviridae family they were named for the crown-like spikes on their surface and were reported to cause diseases in humans and few animal species with wide spectrum of severity to date four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses have been identified named alpha beta gamma and delta 1 considered one of the largest among known rna viruses the genome size of coronaviruses which are enveloped with a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry ranges from approximately 27 to 34 kilobases with a diameter of around 125 nm 2 the first known severe illness in humans caused by a coronavirus emerged in 2003 in china and resulted in the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic 3 a second outbreak of severe infection occurred in 2012 in saudi arabia and led to the middle east respiratory syndrome mers 4 a novel strain of coronavirus causing severe illness was recently reported in december 2019 in wuhan china and was subsequently named sars-cov-2 figure 1 on 30 january 2020 the world health organization who emergency committee announced a global health emergency based on significant number of confirmed cases and on 11 february 2020 gave the disease an official name covid-19 which stands for corona virus infectious disease - 2019 the virus has raised world concern because of its high transmission rate as well as high mobility and mortality 5 the number of confirmed cases is increasing daily and can be tracked in almost real time on the website of the who website 6person-to-person transmission of sars-cov-2 is expected to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced during coughing sneezing and talking and largely resembles the spread of influenza 8 however transmission can occur when an infected person with or without symptoms are in close contact with a healthy one or when one touches an infected surface and then touches his or her eyes nose or mouth 9 the period between infection and symptom onset might range from 2 to 14 days 10 it is mainly believed that sars-cov-2 droplets do not typically travel for more than 2 meters and do not remain in the air however van doremalen n et al reported under experimental conditions that sars-cov-2 aerosols can remain viable for up to 3 hours in aerosols 4 hours on copper 24 hours on cardboard and 2 to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel 11studies have shown that patients with underlying diseases such as hypertension lung disease and cardiovascular disease may have higher mortality risk than other patients 12 13 another study suggested that other risk factors related to developing acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and progressing to death include age neutrophilia organ failure and coagulation dysfunction 14 however these studies are still limited due to the lack of sufficient information about this novel covid-19 disease and the limited number of patients included in these studiesthis article will first review the proposed conventional treatments that are currently under extensive research and clinical trials then the advantages of theranostic nanoparticles with a special focus on the optimal formulations for intranasal administration of the various therapeutic agents will be discussed finally a special focus will be devoted to the development of nanoparticles-based treatment modalities that are projected to considerably improve covid-19 therapycurrently there are no validated vaccines or specific antiviral treatments for covid-19 most treatments currently used including cardiovascular hemodynamic or respiratory are supportive that is they support patients suffering from the virus unfortunately these treatments are given to relieve complications and side effects but do not efficiently kill the virus therefore extensive research and clinical trials evaluating potential therapy are still imminently necessaryto develop a successful treatment for covid-19 one must understand well the mechanism of action of the virus resembling sars and mers coronaviruses this novel sars-cov-2 uses a lock and key mechanism in which the angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 acts as a key to enter specialized cells holding its lock 13 these target sites can be found in the lungs heart arteries kidneys and intestines cells once inside the virus will use the host cells organelles to replicate and infect other cells based on that a treatment that prevents the viruss entry into the cell may be of benefitwhat is common about all target cells for sars-cov-2 is the ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 a key regulator of endocytosis richardson p et al proposed using a machine learning software benevolentai that drugs associated with aak1 may suppress viral access into the target cells 15 however high doses of these inhibitors such as oncology drugs sunitinib and erlotinib will be required but could unfortunately lead to serious side effects 16 furthermore the simulations also showed that not all aak1 inhibitors could cause severe side effects for example baricitinib a janus kinase jak inhibitor can bind to another endocytosis regulator cyclin g-associated kinase and inhibit aak1 thus preventing the virus entry into the cell in addition to being used in cases of rheumatoid arthritis it can be investigated as a potential treatment to fight against covid-19 17other potential inhibitors to fight covid-19 include the complementary use of human immunodeficiency virus hiv protease inhibitors such as lopinavir and ritonavirin that have been shown to suppress the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease of sars and mers 18 several phase iii and phase iv clinical trials have been initiated to assess the efficacy of these antiviral drugs for instance phase iv open prospectiveretrospective randomized controlled cohort study was designed to assess the efficacy of lopinavirritonavirin antiviral drugs in the treatment of covid-19 viral pneumonia nct04255017 a clinical study is projected to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of baricitinib vs lopinavirritonavir along with 2 other medications in hospitalized persons with moderate to severe covid-19 disease nct04321993other suggested alternative treatments under extensive investigation include virally targeted agents mainly remdesivir a nucleoside analogue that targets the rna-dependent polymerase and suppresses viral rna synthesis in a broad spectrum of rna viruses including human coronaviruses remdesivir is an approved hiv reverse transcriptase inhibitor that has shown broad-spectrum activities against rna coronaviruses in cell cultures and animal models 19 20 holshue m et al reported the successful recovery of a sars-cov-2 infected patient receiving intravenous administration of remdesivir with no adverse events 21 to further assess its safety and efficacy several phase 3 clinical trials were initiated in patients with covid-19 nct04292899 nct04292730 and nct04252664a very promising treatment option that started to be applied in several countries involved the use of chloroquine or hydroxy-chloroquine antiviral and wide spread drugs previously used against malaria and autoimmune diseases 22 a protocol comprising the use of hydroxy-chloroquine reinforced by azithromycin revealed encouraging outcomes for efficient treatment of covid-19 however potential effectiveness was mainly observed in the early impairment of contagiousness and treatment should be administered under close monitoring of physicians due to concerns about the risk of arrhythmic death a chloroquine-based drug was reported to inhibit the fusion of sars coronavirus with the cells by acidifying the lysosomes and thus inhibiting catherpsins that require a low ph for optimal cleavage of sars-cov-2 spike protein 23 it is assumed that chloroquine can either alter the molecular crosstalk of sars-cov-2 with its target cells through suppression of kinases ie mapk or interfere with proteolytic processing of the m protein and affect virion assembly and budding furthermore chloroquine can indirectly act by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines andor by activating anti-sars-cov-2 cd8 t-cells 24 cortegiani a et al have recently reviewed the efficacy and safety of chloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 25however despite these proposed treatment options currently under extensive research and clinical trials the death toll of patients infected with this novel coronavirus is still increasing therefore efforts should in parallel focus on alternative approaches in order to achieve an effective treatment while minimizing side effects although mucosal vaccination mostly intranasal is the preferred route of vaccination against infectious diseases treatment modalities currently under investigation use the systemic route this is mainly because intranasal treatment needs to overcome many hurdles such as low intrinsic permeability for some drugs limited volume of administration rapid mucociliary clearance and enzymatic degradation before they reach the targeting site due to the unique characteristics of the mucosal environment therefore the delivery of most proposed therapies to specific sites of the body by means of nanoparticles np ensures that these agents achieve a concentration several times higher than those obtained via conventional methods in the targeted sites of infection while limiting any side effects on normal cellsnanoparticles made from lipids are particularly attractive for biomedical applications owing to their enhanced biocompatibility imparted by the lipid material among the various lipid-based formulations adapted for intranasal delivery are liposomes which are spherical capsules having an outer phospholipid bilayer and an inner hydrophilic core designed to hold aqueous therapeutic agents 31 liposomes offer numerous advantages including efficient encapsulation of the conjugated agents and simple modification to further enhance their mucosal and cellular uptake and improve their biocompatibility 32 like any other type of nanoparticles surface charge plays an important role in affecting the pharmacokinetic properties of liposomes in fact studies carried on cationic liposomes following intranasal administration showed higher absorption and enhanced bioavailability compared to their negatively charged counterparts this is due to the negative charge of the mucosal membranes leading to electrostatic attraction of these positively charged nanoparticles as well as reducing their clearance by the mucosal cilia 33 furthermore liposomes were reported to have great potential for mucosal vaccinations as their retention in the nasal cavity induces a high immune activity leading to the production of higher levels of immunoglobulins 34polymer-based nanoparticles were reported as an attractive delivery system mainly due to the possibility of tailoring their properties and functions to a specific application they can be synthesized by the addition of several monomers into various configurations including linear branched and 3d networks ie highly branched 35 and thus their size shape and surface charge can be easily optimized to allow a controlled release of their cargo under external conditions 36 out of the many formulations of polymer nanoparticles those made of chitosan attracted particular interest for intranasal administration due to their nontoxic nature biocompatibility biodegradability into non-toxic products in vivo capability to open up tight junctions between epithelial cells 37 and ability to be easily modified into desired shapes and sizes 38 upon conjugation with therapeutic compounds chitosan can enhance persistence of polymeric np in mucosal environment and penetration to mucosal tissuedendrimer are radially symmetric molecules with well defined homogeneous and monodisperse structure similar to polymer dendrimer np can be synthetized in highly branched 3d networks with greater ability of attaching many functional groups on their surface and encapsulating non-water soluble hydrophobic therapeutic agents in their core 39 this allows the potential use of these nanoparticles in various therapies against tumors bacterial and viral infections 40with the strong interactions that they make with viruses dendrimers showed enhanced antiviral activities preventing the infection of the host consequently they became an important tool in the treatment of viral infections such as hiv and influenza virus infections 41nandy b et al reported the development of poly-l-lysine pll-based dendrimeric nanoparticles with anionic naphthalene disulphonate surface that can block the entry of hiv viruses by binding to the viral envelope protein gp120 and preventing the formation of the cd4-gp120 complex 42 chahal j et al developed dendrimer np encapsulating an antigen-expressing replicon mrna this nanoformulation offered vital cd8 t-cell and antibody responses that can efficiently protect against lethal exposures to several deadly pathogens including ebola h1n1 influenza and toxoplasma gondii pathogens 43engineered inorganic nanoparticles are attracting special interests due to their ability to not only act as conventional delivery systems to efficiently deliver loaded cargo to target sites but also to allow stimuli-responsive characteristics and intrinsic capability of some types ie magnetic or gold nanoparticles to be monitored following in vivo administration to human body using noninvasive medical imaging 44 while inorganic np are extensively investigated in preclinical and clinical studies for the detection diagnosis and treatment of many diseases some concerns are still arising about their safe clinical applications 45 to overcome this researchers are working on functionalizing inorganic np with various types of biocompatible materials thus offering the potential benefits of both organic and inorganic nanoparticlesgold nanoparticles have shown special interest in vaccine development as they can easily trigger the immune system via internalization by antigen presenting cells the synthesis methodologies significant progress and future prospects of the use of gold np for new mucosal vaccines were reviewed 46 gold nanoparticles can be easily adapted and customized for intranasal delivery and can have the advantage of being readily diffused into lymph nodes thus activating cd8 t-killer cell-mediated immune response 47 furthermore gold nanoparticles owing to their high atomic number can also function as excellent highly stable and biocompatible contrast agent for x-ray based medical imaging especially in computed tomography ct 48virus-like np vlnp are sphere-shaped nanoparticles composed of several molecules with sizes ranging between 20 and 200 nm these nanoparticles result from the self-assembly of proteins derived from viral capsids they were introduced as attractive nanomaterials as they do not contain genetic material but have the ability for accurately mimicking the real virus or antigen in terms of structure and antigenic determinants this makes these nanomaterials highly attractive to antigen presenting cells that can be readily identified and consequently can trigger an immune response 49 studies performed following intranasal delivery of vlnp derived from the influenza virus lead to enhancing the immunity against this virus by triggering significant types of immune responses cellular and humoral hence they act as a vaccine that can prevent further infections ie influenza virus by producing a significantly high amount of antibodies and t-cells 50 another advantage of vlnp is their high potential to be used as a vector in gene therapy where they can be used as a smart system to accurately deliver a transgene to the site of the mutation or repair genes in aim of changing gene expression or encoding a protein 51 moreover vlnps promising treatment rely on the fact that they can easily prevent enzymatic degradation compared to the naked administration of viroids viral dna segments and they have extremely small size allowing their penetration into the cellular nucleus 52 interestingly these innovative vlnp can be also adapted to be detected using various noninvasive medical imaging modalities ie mri and pet and thus offering a theranostic platform for next-generation diagnosis and treatment of viral infections 53self-assembling protein nanoparticles sapn are novel type of np obtained from the oligomerization of monomeric proteins with a dimeter ranging from 20 to 100 nm self-assembly is defined as the autonomous organization of molecules into a more stable structure by using non-covalent bonding mechanisms to achieve equilibrium 54 it has paved the way for developing robust and functional np for various applications these nanoparticles can be engineered using many biomaterials with peptides being the most favorable due to the fact that these protein-based np can be easily developed and modified for numerous applications 55 they were assessed in drug delivery given their distinguishing ability to cross the cellular membrane and specifically and safely deliver drugs genes and nucleic acids directly to the cells nucleus 56kanekiyo m et al reported the synthesis of sapn that elicit broader and more effective immunity ie tenfold higher haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres than traditional influenza vaccines following intranasal inoculation and thus provide a promising platform for developing broader vaccine protection against emerging viruses and other pathogens 57as previously mentioned drugs associated with aak1 may suppress virus access into the cells however high doses of these suppressors such as oncology drugs sunitinib and erlotinib will be required but could unfortunately lead to serious side effects therefore the use of np as smart nanocarriers that can selectively enhance the delivery of such drugs to target cells will certainly reduce the required doses and arising side effects while providing a more efficient treatmentdrug delivery system dds conjugated with either sunitinib 58 59 or erlotinib 60 were extensively assessed for treatment of cancerous diseases as an example xu h et al investigated a dds-based on erlotinib-conjugated liposomes for treatment of lung cancer results showed that this nanoformulation can considerably enhance the drug targeting improve the drug biodistribution following in vivo administration in the body ie 3 months stability and significantly increase the relative bioavailability of the drug ie fast and sustained release within the first 4 hours 61 once such oncology drugs that are associated with aak1 are validated to effectively suppress viral access into the target cells in covid-19 np formulations conjugated with these drugs and optimized for either intranasal or intravenous delivery are expected to provide positive outcomes for covid-19 treatmentsince coronaviruses are positive ssrna viruses that use orf1a and orf1b replicases rna interference rnai could be an efficient approach to control the virus by silencing the viral mrna at particular stages in human cells 62 rnai technology inhibits the expression of the homologous sequence in a target rna by incorporating small non-coding rnas into cells to a multi-protein rna-induced silencing complex risc after identifying the sequence to be inhibited small interfering rnas sirna will be separated from risc and link to that specific section 63 complementary strands of appropriate mrna will then get degraded using special enzymes therefore sirnas can play a crucial role in regulating virus infections and replication 64sirna were reported as a very successful candidate to fight against viruses as they can be identified designed and synthesized to attack every possible viral mutation 65 several studies reported the efficacy of sirna in inhibiting viral replications such as in hepatitis c virus hcv 63 however one of the essential factors that lead to the success of this potential treatment is their specific and selective delivery to target sites the administration of naked or unprotected sirna will be potentially exposed to degradation by enzymes and lead to several side effects including toxicity instability and filtration by kidneys and reticuloendothelial system res 66 therefore optimizing specific nanocarriers to deliver this fragile molecule to its target is essentialsohrab s et al recently reviewed the design and delivery of therapeutic sirnas for treating mers-coronavirus 65 the delivery of sirnas was enhanced by using novel nanocarriers such as lipid inorganic or polymeric nanoparticlesthe effective delivery of sirna via lipid nanoparticles revealed promising results against several viral diseases 67 various formulations of lipid nanoparticles lnp such as liposomes solid semisolid or liquid state or nano-emulsions were evaluated lnp protect sirna from nucleases improve their biodistribution ensure selective delivery to the desired sites and enhance the bioavailability of therapeutic compounds with low solubility 68inorganic nanoparticles such as gold magnetic iron oxide and silica nanoparticles in addition to quantum dots qds and carbon nanotubes cnts were evaluated as potential carriers for sirna 69 gold np emerged as attractive nanocarriers and were investigated as sirna carrier and target-specific gene silencing against viral and cancerous diseases owing to their unmatched biocompatibility flexible configurations and surface modifications and effective delivery mechanism 70polymeric nanoparticles either natural ie chitosan or synthetic ie polyethyleneimine pei have been also assessed as drug or gene carriers and can be potentially used to specifically deliver sirna in covid-19 cases chitosan-based np have proven efficient in inducing protective immunity against various infectious diseases 37 and have been investigated in the formulation of various vaccines including hbv vaccines 71 newcastle disease vaccines 72 and dna vaccines 73as previously discussed knowing sars-cov-2 infection mechanism will help developing a successful treatment luckily mers-cov and sars-cov-2 share the same membrane protein the key which is the spike protein s protein therefore both viruses infect host cells using the s protein mediated fusion between their membranes 74 the s protein which is the base for mers infections contains 2 subunits s1 and s2 that control the host cells binding to the virus through dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 receptor 75 therefore inhibiting this fusion will offer a promising approach to similarly treat sars-cov-2huang x et al proposed the use of pregnancy induced hypertension pih as powerful heptad repeat 1 hr1 peptide inhibitor that suppresses hr1hr2-mediated membrane fusion between mers coronavirus and host cells as the key pathway of mers-induced host infections they showed that this peptide inhibitor when delivered via gold nanorods revealed 10 times enhanced inhibitory activity when compared to free pih 76 moreover this nanocomplex showed high stability and biocompatibility with promising prospective application for mers treatment and similar coronaviruseswith the continuous evolution of new and mutated strands of viruses the development of effective and safe antiviral treatments to that specific strain becomes more challenging due to the variation in their genetic compositions and the need for specific antiviral agents theranostic nanoparticles can also play a major role in not only killing the virus inside the body but also preventing the virus entry into the cells owing to their high specific surface area and the ability to adhere to multiple antigens andor compounds on their surface nanomaterials such as gold np and carbon quantum dots cqds were reported as promising tools for interacting with viruses and preventing their entry into cells 77a study carried on boronic acid conjugated carbon dots np demonstrated efficiency and success in inhibiting hiv entry by suppressing syncytium formation 78 in another interesting study oczechin a et al showed that boronic acid ligands conjugated with cqds interfered with the function of coronavirus s protein and considerably stopped its entry into the host cells 79 it was reported that the addition of these np to the cell culture medium before and during infection with coronavirus considerably reduced the infection rate of the cells remarkably after one viral life cycle ie 55 hours for coronavirus a great inhibition activity was also detected at the viral replication step these nanomaterials with an average diameter of 10 nm and excellent water solubility showed as promising candidates for winning the battle against coronavirus because they easily enter the cell through endocytosis and interact with the viruss protein thereby preventing viral genome replicationwith the significant advances in vaccine development great interest and huge efforts have focused on developing vaccines that mimic the virus using virus-like nanoparticles vlnp np were reported to enhance transport in the lymphatic system compared to smaller subunit antigens 80 moreover np have the ability to display several antigens on their surface facilitating the stimulation of the immune system compared to antigen presenting cells apcs that can only present one type of antigen on their surface 81 this has shed the light on the importance of np not only as carriers of therapeutic material but also as efficient stimulants of the bodys immune system thus having a double synergetic functionnp are known for their high surface energy that leads to strong adhesion of biomolecules 82 this ability can be exploited in order to imitate viral features and characteristics efficiently and thus stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies and immune cells to fight viral infections 83in a study combining 100 nm gold np with the s protein of infectious bronchitis virus ibv chen h et al reported increased stability when using the developed vlnp as well as significant retention of these s proteins about 900 s proteins per particle compared to viral antigens 84 moreover this study emphasized the delivery enhancing abilities of gold np compared to free circulating compounds especially in the lymphatic system where the strong adhesion between np and the s protein increased the delivery 6 times most importantly it was concluded that these vlnp resulted in the synthesis of higher igg levels due to the enhanced delivery by the gold np that lead to increased uptake by cells and intensified complement activation 84in another study coleman c et al reported protection induced by vaccination with a recombinant mers-cov s np vaccine and matrix-m1 adjuvant combination that were able to efficiently and completely block mers-cov replication in the lungs of mice 85 the mers-cov s np vaccine produced high titer anti-s neutralizing antibody and protected against mers-cov infection in vivo in mice these studies proved the promising advantage of np conjugated with s protein as a potential and successful vaccine to not only stimulate the immune system but also to protect humans from mers-cov and thus can be applied to sars-cov-2 as both coronaviruses have the same key ie spike proteinthe highly contagious novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 that has infected so far more than 2 million people in 210 countries triggered an unprecedented economic crisis as a consequence of forced lockdown to limit the transmission and put the life of many infected people at high risk around the world covid-19 patients are mainly managed with supportive care that includes cardiovascular hemodynamic or respiratory procedures while there is currently no specific treatment for covid-19 several drugs approved for other indications are being investigated in clinical trials these treatments are based on the administration of agents that either block the virus entry inside the host cells stopping virus replication and infection of other cells or potentially inhibit protease activity ie lopinavir ritonavirin antiviral drugs other potential treatments under clinical investigations use either nucleoside analogues that target the rna-dependent polymerase suppressing viral rna synthesis ie remdesivir or directly act on the virion assembly and budding and alter the molecular crosstalk of sars-cov-2 while indirectly reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines andor activating anti-sars-cov-2 cd8 t-cells ie hydroxy-chloroquine however despite some promising results the death toll of infected patients is still increasingalthough the administration of proposed conventional treatment is mainly performed via intravenous route as intranasal administration faces several challenges associated with mucosal environment the use of nanoparticle-based delivery system ensures effective treatment while minimizing side effects of therapeutic agents the theranostic nanoparticles ensure that therapeutic moieties such as drugs vaccines sirna and peptide achieve a concentration that is many times higher than expected in the targeted sites while protecting the therapeutic agents from enzyme degradation several types of theranostic nanoparticles that can be divided in 3 broad categories organic ie lipid polymer dendrimer inorganic ie gold and virus-like or self-assembling protein nanoparticles were investigated for intranasal administration the shape size and surface charge of the designed nanocarriers are considered as crucial factors that should be taken into consideration when optimized for intranasal delivery and thus play a crucial role in the success of the treatmentdelivered via intranasal route biocompatible theranostic nanoparticles can thus be a very promising approach to fight against this novel sars- cov-2 as previously investigated against various viral infections including sars or mers coronaviruses using several approaches

in vero e6 cells with ec50 under 100 m table 1
 importantly we observed that some of the compounds currently undergoing clinical trials such as ribavirin favipiravir oseltamivir or baloxavir showed no apparent antiviral effect against the sars-cov-2 virus in vitro at concentrations under 100 m table 1 remdesivir is a 1-cyano-substituted adenosine analogue that has been shown to inhibit human coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 brown et al 2019 sheahan et al 2017 de wit et al 2020 it is currently evaluated in phase 4 clinical trials for sars-cov-2 a recent study fitted viral load in linear scale eg the percentage of inhibition under increasing concentrations of remdesivir reported ec50 against sars-cov-2 virus at 077 m wang et al 2020 we fitted viral load in logarithm scale log10tcid50ml and log10 viral rna copiesml under increasing concentration of remdesivir and determined ec50 at 2315 m and 2690 m respectively fig 1
a and table 1 two mutations f476l and v553l in the rna-dependent rna polymerase nsp12 of a murine hepatitis virus have been previously reported to confer resistance to remdesivir agostini et al 2018 due to insertions and deletions in nsp12 these two conserved residues are mapped at f480 and v557 in the sars-cov-2 isolate gisaid epiisl412028 used for the experiments which should remain sensitive for remdesivir other adenosine analogues galidesivir tenofovor or fludarabine phosphate or nucleoside analogues favipiravir ribavirin r-1479 did not inhibit viral replication under 100 m table 1 however nucleoside analogues require metabolic activation into their triphosphate forms by host cellular nucleoside kinases which may differ among cell types further evaluation of the effect of nucleoside analogues in primary human airway epithelial cells would facilitate the interpretation of the resultslopinavir in combination with ritonavir are fda approved hiv-1 protease inhibitors lopinavir was more potent in inhibiting hiv-1 than ritonavir in vitro but showed poor bioavailability in vivo ritonavir inhibits not only hiv-1 protease but also the hosts cytochrome p450 3a4 enzyme that metabolizes lopinavir kempf et al 1997 lopinavirritonavir in combination prolongs bioavailability of lopinavir in vivo sham et al 1998 lopinavir but not ritonavir showed antiviral effect against sars-cov mers-cov and hcov-229e in vitro with mean ec50 ranged from 66 to 171 m de wilde et al 2014 lopinavirritonavir in combination with ribavirin were used previously to treat sars-cov patients under a non-randomized clinical trial less sars patients developed into ards or death after receiving the combination of lopinavirritonavir with ribavirin than historical controls who received ribavirin and corticosteroids chu et al 2004 efficacy of lopinavirritonavir with or without ribavirin is currently evaluated in sars-cov-2 patients under randomized control trials in agreement with previous reports we observed antiviral effect of lopinavir ec50 at 261 m but not ritonavir against sars-cov-2 in vitro fig 1b and table 1 hiv-1 patients treated with 400 mg of lopinavir and 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily may reach the minimal lopinavir serum concentration at 94 m iqr 72121 m which is below the ec50 against sars-cov-2 virus in vitro lopez-cortes et al 2013 currently lopinavirritonavir at 400mg100 mg twice daily with or without ribavirin are part of the recommended treatment for managing covid-19 patients in china china national health commission 2020 a recent randomized control trial reported no significant benefit of lopinavir-ritonavir in hospitalized sars-cov-2 patients than standard care as the time to clinical improvement mortality at 28 days and viral loads at various time points were comparable between the two groups cao et al 2020 combinational therapy of lopinavir with the other effective compounds against sars-cov-2 virus may increase synergy and reduce the inhibitory concentration of lopinavirhomoharringtonine is a plant alkaloid derived from cephalotoxus fortunei it exhibits anti-tumor activity by binding to the ribosomal a site to inhibit protein translation leading to rapid loss of short-lived proteins including mcl-1 and c-myc that promote the survival of leukemia cells dong et al 2018 lu and wang 2014 omacetaxine a semi-synthetic form of homoharringtonine is approved by fda for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia homoharringtonine has also been reported to exhibit potent anti-viral activity against

viruses hepatitis b virus newcastle disease virus and echovirus 1 dong et al 2018 andersen et al 2019 here we observed homoharringtonine inhibits sars-cov-2 with ec50 at 210 m fig 1c and table 1 previous pharmacokinetic study showed that patients treated with 125 mgm2 omacetaxine every 12 h by subcutaneous injection may reach the maximal plasma concentration at 251 ngml 0046 m and 362 ngml 0066 m on days 1 and 11 respectively nemunaitis et al 2013 which were below the ec50 against sars-cov-2 virus in vitroemetine is a protein synthesis inhibitor that was used as anti-protozoan approved for treatment of ameobiasis it also inhibits malaria by binding to the ribosomal e site of plasmodium falciparum grollman 1966 wong et al 2014 however its potential cardiotoxicity has restricted its clinical use in the recent years it was found to process antiviral activity against a broad range of rna and dna viruses including zika virus ebolavirus cytomegalovirus rabies virus hiv-1 echovirus 1

valadao et al 2015 khandelwal et al 2017 macgibeny et al 2018 mukhopadhyay et al 2016 yang et al 2018 emetine was also identified to inhibit hcov-oc43 hcov-nl43 sars-cov mers-cov and mhv-a59 in vitro with ec50 reported at low micromolar range dyall et al 2014 shen et al 2019 we observed emetine at around 05 m may effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 virus replication fig 1d and table 1 the therapeutic plasma concentration of emetine may reach 0075 gml 0156 m regenthal et al 1999 which is below the ec50 against sars-cov-2 virus in vitro the toxic plasma concentration is 05 gml 104 m regenthal et al 1999to reduce the effective concentration of individual compound below the maximal therapeutic plasma concentration we explored the combinational effect of remdesivir and emetine in vitro drug interaction was evaluated using the checkerboard assay with serially 2-fold diluted remdesivir 050 m and emetine 00781 m in combination remdesivir at 625 m in combination with emetine at 0195 m may achieve 649 inhibition of viral yield which can be further tested in vivo fig 2
a the loewe additive model and the bliss independent model malyutina et al 2019 were used to analyse the interaction of the two compounds using synergyfinder ianevski et al 2017 remdesivir and emetine in combination yielded a loewe synergy score of 0306 fig 2b and a bliss synergy score of 20234 fig 2cwe confirm the antiviral activity of four compounds that have been reported to inhibit other coronavirus or sars-cov-2 replication in vitro our results suggest that combinational therapy may help to reduce the effective concentration against sars-cov-2 under the maximal therapeutic plasma concentration there is an urgent research need to identify optimal dose combination of effective compounds against the sars-cov-2 virus for better clinical benefithuman coronaviruses hcovs are positive-stranded enveloped rna viruses classified within the family coronaviridae genus coronavirus hendley et al 1972 they are associated mainly with respiratory tract illness but are also involved in enteric and central nervous system diseases resta et al 1985 murray et al 1992 stewart et al 1992 until recently only three human coronaviruses were thoroughly studied human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 and human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e were identified in the 1960s hamre and procknow 1966 and are well recognized as important pathogens that cause the common cold a third novel human coronavirus sars-cov was identified as the causal agent during the 20022003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars drosten et al 2003 the increase in research on these viruses soon led to discovery of 2 other human coronaviruses hcov-nl63 in the netherlands and hcov-hku1 in china van der hoek et al 2004 woo et al 2005 both detected in respiratory tract specimens of patients with lower respiratory tract illnesses since july 2003 when the last case of sars associated with the epidemic was reported only four human coronaviruses are known to continuously circulate in the human population results from epidemiological studies have led to the conclusion that these viruses are worldwide distributed and circulate with biennial prevalence mcintosh et al 1970 vabret et al 2003 van elden et al 2004 chiu et al 2005 gerna et al 2007 however there are few studies that have described the epidemiological and clinical features of human coronaviruses infection among different populations such as at-risk children or adults patients with underlying conditions those hospitalized the immunocompromised patients and others mainly in south america in the present study we retrospectively looked for the presence of hcovs in different populations of sao paulo presenting acute respiratory tract infections aris from 2001 to 2010 to assess the prevalence that hcovs infections have on different groups of brazilian patients and to describe the clinical presentation of the aris caused by this virus and their circulation trends in brazilduring the nine-year span

coronaviruses were detected in every month except january with a 203 peak on winter months july figure 1 peaks detection frequency was observed during 20022004 and 20082009 with the highest detection in 2008 figure 1 coronaviruses-positive cases were found from patients ranging in age from 2 months to 80 years with a median age of 33 years the majority 59 was female twenty percent of coronaviruses-infected patients presented underlying diseases other than cardiac andor transplanted conditions fifteen patients had hypertension 5 had diabetes mellitus 1 patient was hiv infected and 1 had congenital kidney disease the prevalence of hcov was higher among children with heart diseases 246 patients under stem cell transplantation program 243 and renal transplanted patients 202 than others patients groups adults from community and healthcare workers showed similar infection rates despite of the occupational risk of the last group the lowest ratios of coronaviruses-positive cases were obtained in children from community and hospitalized patients 33 and 18 respectively table 1 coronaviruses-infection was significantly different p  005 among the studied populations children with

fever were the most common symptoms at presentation reported in 86 80 and 49 of positive cases respectively clinical characteristics of coronaviruses-infected patients are shown in table 2 differences on clinical expressions were obtained among the studied populations p  005 fever was less found among both renal and patients under stem cell transplantation program when compared with the other groups cyanosis was only reported in 1 child with heart disease and wheezing was reported only among hospitalized patients and children both from community and with heart diseases dyspnea another lower respiratory tract infection symptom besides wheezing was documented among patients under stem cell transplantation program children with heart diseases children from community and hospitalized patients healthcare workers presented more sore throat and myalgia than the other studied populationsviral respiratory diseases are the leading cause of medical attendance worldwide exerting a great economic impact on the health-care system human coronavirus is considered one of the most common respiratory viruses associated with respiratory tract infections mainly among children epidemiological and clinical data of hcovs infectious in the brazilian population are scarce and restricted to one or two group of patients bellei et al 2008 reported 42 of human coronaviruses in brazilian adults cabea and bellei 2012 described a fatal case of hcov-nl63 associated with pneumonia in a brazilian adult and albuquerque et al 2009 reported 19 among brazilian children this is the first brazilian report of hcovs from distinct brazilian population over a period of nine yearsdetection of coronaviruses by culture isolation or serological methods is difficult a pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay is a usefull molecular tool to test for all coronaviruses in a clinical sample in addition quick screening for several pathogens in one assay allows the identification of previously unknown coronaviruses however the pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay used could have led to some limitations in our study first hcovs subtypes were not identified and the prevalence of our study could be overestimated andor underestimated once the assay included non specific primers that target all human and animal coronaviruses therefore the use of degenerate primers set in a conventional rt-pcr may enhance detection of coronavirus genome variations but may also miss samples with less genome copies to have a better understanding about it and mainly to rule out the possibility of a bias we sequenced a portion of the coronaviruses positive cases detected in the present study using pancoronavirus primers set the positive cases detected among hospitalized patients from 2009 to 2010 were sequenced and all samples were confirmed as human coronaviruses cabea et al 2012coronaviruses can display a typical biennial seasonality different than occur with other respiratory viruses mcintosh et al 1970 monto et al 1974 vabret et al 2003 in this regard we identified peaks of detection frequency of hcovs during 20022004 and 20082009 with high detection frequencies in winter months but few or no detections in the summerthe prevalence of 115 found in our study corroborated with other research that identified coronaviruses as responsible for 1030 of common colds and 039 associated with pneumonia tyrrell and bynoe 1965 bradburne and somerset 1972 larson et al 1980 dare et al 2007 we demonstrate the presence of hcovs infection in all studied populations with a significant prevalence among some at-risk group patients such as patients under stem cell transplantation program and children with heart diseases this higher frequency of hcovs may be related to the functional condition of these patients on the other hand a lower prevalence was observed among children from community when compared with our different studied populations since the majority of these children presented influenza-like illness instead of common cold symptoms the clinical pattern can explain this lower frequency among this group of patients underlying conditions other than cardiactransplantation were observed among 20 of coronaviruses-infected patients this data along with the higher prevalence of coronaviruses-infected cases found in specific at-risk group patients pointed to the relevance of coronaviruses causing respiratory tract illness in patients with comorbiditiesin conclusion our results provided a novel insight into the epidemiology and clinical knowledge of coronaviruses in different groups of the brazilian population supporting the notation that hcov may have an important role among patients with underlying conditions and transplanted ones
