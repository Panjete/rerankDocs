coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern 3  as of march 26 2020 the number of covid-19 cases surpassed 500000 globally and the epidemic registered a total of 1978 cases and 25 deaths in sub-saharan africa ssa at this time 39 of ssas 48 countries excluding burundi comoros lesotho sierra leone south sudan and sao tome and principe all reported confirmed cases of coronavirus and imported transmission as the major mode of spread despite aggressive response by ssa countries to stymie the outbreak the number of reported new cases and deaths continue to increase as of march 30 2020 south africa is the only country with more than 1000 cases and eight countries burkina faso cameroon cote divoire senegal ghana mauritius and nigeria including south africa account for 80 of ssas covid-19 disease outbreak  figure 1  as reported by huang et al 4 patients with covid-19 present primarily with fever myalgia or fatigue and dry cough although most patients are thought to have a favorable prognosis older patients and those with chronic underlying conditions may have worse outcomes certain epidemiological features and clinical characteristics of covid-19 have been previously reported 56 however these findings were based on prediction models or studies from america asia and europe countries and the use of these findings might be inappropriate for ssa context the spatial distribution pattern of coronavirus disease outbreak and the risk factors leading to poor clinical outcomes have not been well understood and delineated in this study we employed the exploratory data analysis eda technique to maximize insights from our study data uncover patterns and summarize risk factors associated with the coronavirus disease outbreak in ssa eda is an approach for data analysis that employs a variety of technique for summarizing and visualizing important characteristics of a dataset this will be the first study to use supervised machine learning algorithm least absolute selection shrinkage operator lasso regression as the principle method for variable selection predict important variables associated with covid-19 and for statistical inference confirm or establish relationship of risk factors and covid-19 disease and empirical bayesian kriging ebk used to create a raster estimating the temporal spatial distribution of covid-19 disease outbreak in ssa we collected and analyzed time series aggregate data on the 1978 confirmed cases and 25 deaths of covid-19 disease outbreak across ssa between february 28 2020 through march 26 2020 according to the united nations ssa consists of all african countries that are fully or partially located south of the sahara we focused on 48 of africas 54 countries excluding algeria djibouti egypt libya morocco and tunisia in accordance with the world bank lists of countries in ssa we accessed the covid-19 data resource hub developed by the tableau community and utilized nearreal time data compiled by johns hopkins university jhu and includes data from world health organization who and the centers for disease control and prevention cdc additional data from socio-demographic and health indicator surveys was derived from resources of the world bank unicef who and unaids this additional data was merged with the jhu covid-19 data to establish the dataset that was used for this study the dataset included the most recent and available data across ssa and period of the data spanned between 2013 and 2019 for data on health systems performance index these was derived from the who publication in 2001 entitled measuring overall health systems performance for 191 countries the target variable included in the supervised machine learning model was confirmed cases of coronavirus

training datasets we used to select our model and group 2 our testing datasets we used to test the prediction we used lasso because of its greater prediction accuracy and increased model interpretability for the inferential statistics we used the cross-fit partialing out lasso technique to estimate the coefficients robust standard errors p-values and confidence intervals of the specified variables of interest while the other covariates were selected as controls in the model we georeferenced all confirmed cases and deaths from coronavirus that was reported across 39 countries

2020 time 2 march 14 2020 and time 3 march 26 2020 and overlaid the coronavirus transmission classification type second we used spatial autocorrelation global morans i statistics to measure the degree to which coronavirus infection is clustered dispersed or randomly distributed the expected value under the null hypothesis is that there is no pattern of coronavirus infection in selected ssa countries morans i values range from -1 indicating perfect dispersion to 1 indicating perfect spatial clustering a zero morans i value indicates a random spatial distribution third we used ebk technique in the geostatistical analyst tool of arcgis 108 software to estimate the distribution of coronavirus across ssa we analyzed 39 of ssa 48 countries that reported confirmed cases and deaths from coronavirus between february 28 2020 through march 26 2020 we plotted a matrix graph to explore the strength and association between 17 continuous variables and covid-19 overall in figure 2a the matrix graph showed that a majority 82 1317 of the continuous variables indicated strong to moderate positive linear relationships while two variables out-of-pocket expenditure and hiv incidence rate in children aged 0-14 years showed strong negative linear relationships prevalence of smoking was weakly correlated with coronavirus approximately 31 1239 of the ssa countries had missing information on smoking prevalence and this may have impacted on this variable as evident with the significant chi-square goodness of fit 2 1  577 p 0016 all other variables included in the analysis had complete data for almost all countries however in few countries where data was missing this was  5 in figure 2b  spearmans rank-order correlation was run to determine the relationship between the two categorical variables and covid-19 there was a moderate positive correlation between transmission classification and covid-19 disease rs 37  0411 p  0009 with transmission classification explaining 17 of the variance in covid-19 disease we calculated time days between the first and last reported coronavirus cases by country and plotted a quadrant chart of confirmed covid-19 cases against time in figure 3  majority 32 82 of the countries reported imported transmission as the main way coronavirus is spreading 2 1  1603 p 00001 while south africa ghana senegal cameroon kenya rwanda and liberia indicated local transmission as the source of covid-19 transmission there was a strong positive correlation between time days and covid-19 rs 37  0599 p  0001 with time days explaining 36 of the variation in covid-19 the result is suggestive that new cases of coronavirus tend to rise with rise in time days cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who

cluster 5  figure 5  overall the result revealed an upward trend and similarities in the way coronavirus is presenting across certain countries in ssa lasso for prediction and model selection all the explanatory variables 17 continuous and 2 categorical were included as possible contributors to the lasso model evaluating association with coronavirus disease the rows for all three models were sorted so that the variables with the highest standardized coefficients are listed on top table 1a  ten explanatory variables with the highest relative importance were simultaneously selected by all the three learning techniques these were hiv incidence rate among adolescence aged 10-19 years hiv incidence rate among children aged 0-14 years time days hiv prevalence among persons aged 15-49 years infants who received third-dose of pneumococcal conjugate-based vaccine incidence of hiv among individuals aged 15-24 years incidence of malaria per 1000 persons at risk incidence of tb per 100000 people smoking prevalence 15years and above and diarrhea treatment children under-5 years we accessed the goodness-of-fit over our training sample and testing sample table 1b  show that the adaptive lasso model has the smallest mean square error mse 272 10 -28 and the largest r-squared 100 in the testing datasets the top ten important variables selected by adaptive lasso was included as variables of interest in the lasso for inference model using the cross-fit partialing out technique the remaining variables included in the model were trained as controls the lasso regression for inference established that hiv incidence rate among adolescence aged 10-19 years p00001 hiv incidence rate among children aged 0-14 years p0001 time p00001 infants who received third dose of pneumococcal conjugate-based vaccine p0001 incidence of hiv among individuals aged 15-24 years p002 incidence of malaria p0001 and diarrhea treatment p0002 could statistically significantly predict coronavirus disease outbreak in ssa table 2  for better interpretation of results we exponentiated the coefficients subtracted the output from 1 and expressed the new coefficients as percentages the exponentiated values are included in the lasso for inferential statistics table all seven variables added statistically significantly to the prediction p  005 the global spatial autocorrelation morans i statistics confirmed the random distribution pattern of coronavirus outbreak among ssa countries  figure 6 figure 7 shows that coronavirus is increasing per day and spreading outwards coronavirus appears to be severally confined in south africa and increasing in the west african region ie burkina faso ghana senegal cote diviore cameroon and nigeria figure 8 shows that coronavirus deaths tend to be

three are in sub-saharan africa 10  currently in ssa region there is paucity of research on coronavirus and no documented evidence on how coronavirus disease is affecting or behaving in people living with hiv plhiv however global and local hiv organizations and public health experts believe plhiv not on treatment has cd4 count 200 copiescell a recent opportunistic infection and or not virally suppressed may be at greater risk of coronavirus infection 11  our study indicated that hiv incident rate among pediatrics aged 0-14 years adolescents aged 15-19 years and middle-aged adults 15-24 years were good predictors of coronavirus our research shows that new hiv infections raise the risk of coronavirus infection by 273 percent p0001 in pediatrics 0-14 years 419 percent p00001 in adolescents aged 15-19 years and 23 percent p002 in middle-aged adults 15-24 this finding collaborates with a recent study by su l et al 12  which showed that children and youth are also infected and can spread coronavirus a retrospective study by tang a et al 13 revealed that there had been several and far more severe pediatric cases of covid-19 in wuhan hospitals than reported pneumonia affects children and families everywhere but is most prevalent in south asia and sub-saharan africa 14  people who get pneumonia may also have a condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome ards its a disease that comes on quickly after infection from coronavirus and causes breathing problems the pneumonia vaccine protects against a kind of bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae not the coronavirus but can support overall health especially in older individuals or people who have a weak immune system 15  more than three-quarters 79 95 ci 725-856 of surviving infants 12 to 23 months across ssa received the third dose of pneumococcal conjugate-containing vaccine pcv our study indicates that surviving infants who received pcv were good predictors of coronavirus disease it is evident from our results that increased cases of pneumonia among infants increases risk of infection from coronavirus by 468 p00001 malaria infection is common in sub-saharan africa and it is often stated that the continent bears over 90 percent of the global p falciparum burden 16  and generally young children bear the brunt of the mortality burden in 2017 four ssa countries nigeria democratic republic of the congo mozambique and uganda accounted for nearly half of all malaria cases worldwide according to our results incidence of malaria was 189 per 1000 persons iqr22 -411 across ssa and study results suggest that for every oneunit increase in the incidence of malaria the risk of covid-19 disease increases by 368 p00001 diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old and is responsible for killing around 525000 children every year recent studies have demonstrated that there is an association between diarrhea and coronavirus transmission a study among 200 covid-19 patients at three hospitals in wuhan china indicated that among all patients who presented with digestive symptoms 117 patients about 67 58 had diarrhea and of these 13 20 experienced diarrhea as the first symptom of their illness 17  in our study less than half 43 95ci 28-56 of children under 5 with diarrhea received oral rehydration salts ort or the recommended homemade fluids across ssa study result suggests that for every one-unit increase in diarrhea cases among children under-5 the risk of coronavirus increases by 375 p0002  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made

rate the trend cluster analysis from our study suggests a combination of linear and exponential growth trends across ssa the trend in new coronavirus cases appears to be doubling in south africa at every time increment compared to the other countries demonstrating an exponential trend for countries in cluster 1 and in cluster 4 the trend is linear suggesting increases by less than 10 cases per day countries in cluster 2 and 3 on the average indicated increases by 10 cases or more at every time increment spontaneous transitions from low reporting 10 cases on average to high clusters reporting more than 10 cases on average was evident among countries previously in cluster 3 ie cote diviore cameron nigeria and ghana in the coming weeks our study suggests that countries in cluster 2 burkina faso ghana senegal cote diviore mauritius cameroon nigeria congo kinshasa and rwanda are the most likely to present an exponential trend growth similar to south africa in cluster 5 our study indicates the doubling time in new coronavirus cases reported across ssa is 3 days covid-19 who surveillance reports indicate that the ssa countries have responded actively to the pandemic since the first case identified on 28 february 2020 many countries are requesting individuals to stay at home in self-quarantine closing borders and imposing lockdowns and curfews schools were ordered to close in the nigerian federal capital territory of abuja after only eight cases were confirmed nationwide in the month of february 2020 south africa banned visitors from high-risk countries closed schools and quickly opened drive-through testing centers in johannesburg the steady decline in the roc of coronavirus as indicated in our study from 37 on march 23 2020 to 23 on march 26 2020 suggests that measures instituted by countries to stem the outbreak is showing signs of future success this finding fits with a recent modeling study showing that a combination of multiple approaches ie social distancing home isolation of cases augmented by school and university closures has a substantial effect on slowing coronavirus transmission in a short term on the other hand the declining roc may be attributed to low testing capacity in ssa marius gilbert et al in a modelling study highlighted differences in african countries capacity to respond to the coronavirus outbreak countries with the highest importation risk ie egypt algeria and south africa have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks countries at moderate risk ie nigeria ethiopia sudan angola tanzania ghana and kenya have variable capacity and high vulnerability 18  so far in ssa only a handful of countries ie south africa senegal ghana and nigeria have provided official figures on covid-19 testing data spatial autocorrelation analysis using the global morans i statistics indicated that coronavirus was spreading randomly across ssa a major limitation in this study was that geocoordinate data used for this analysis represents locations of ssa countries not necessarily where covid-19 disease was detected and this may have influenced results at the time of this analysis geocoordinates of counties districts andor testing locations for coronavirus were not publicly available the interpolated maps in our study show that coronavirus is increasing and spreading outwards per day to countries in central africa and the virus appears to be severely confined in south africa and in the west african region the interpolated maps also suggest that countries in the west african region are most likely to repot increased number of deaths in the coming weeks compared to countries in central and southern africa in conclusion lasso was a good fit for variable selection and inference the lasso regression model indicated that new hiv infections among pediatrics adolescents and middle-aged adult plhiv time pneumococcal conjugate-based vaccine incidence of malaria and diarrhea treatment could significantly predict coronavirus disease in ssa this study can be repeated using more detailed patient-level granular data to provide more insight into the essential characteristics of patients diagnosed with covid-19 our study suggests that experiences learned from the hiv epidemic can be applied to the fight against covid-19 as in the aids response governments should work with communities and civil society organizations to find local solutions and health interventions delivered in an integrated manner integrated and efficiently delivered interventions to reduce hiv pneumonia malaria and diarrhea are essential to accelerating global health efforts lessons learned from the hiv epidemics have shown that restrictive stigmatizing and punitive measures can lead to significant human rights abuses with disproportionate effects on already vulnerable communities they can often undermine epidemic responses sending people with symptoms underground and failing to address the underlying barriers that people face in attempting to protect their own health and that of their community an approach that moves away from compulsory restrictions towards a focus on reaching and serving those who are most vulnerable scaling up screening and testing for those most in need empowering people with knowledge and tools to protect themselves and others eg for covid-19 increased socialspatial spacing and the removal of barriers mirrors the learnings from the hiv response the consistent three days decline in the roc of coronavirus outbreak from 37 to 23 is suggestive of the positive effect of measures instituted by countries to stymie the outbreak to gain better understanding on how the pandemic is progressing and possibly ensure a sustained decline in the roc of coronavirus outbreak all countries should scale screening and increase their testing capacity and provide detailed and reliable testing data recent non-randomized control studies have confirmed that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been found to be efficient on sars-cov-2 and reported to be efficient in chinese cov-19 patients we propose a silver bullet approach to controlling the outbreak this silver bullet approach here implies the use of presumptive malaria treatment or the use of mass drug administration mda-which have proved useful in some previous emergencies through mda all individuals in a targeted population will be given hydroxychloroquine and azithromycinoften at regular intervalsregardless of whether they exhibit symptoms of the disease aao conceived of the study including design

information about covid-19 misconceptions about the modes of transmission of sars-cov-2 and about the course and severity of covid-19 were common for example two thirds of respondents believed that everyone with covid-19 would eventually become severely ill increased hand washing and avoiding crowds were the most reported strategies to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 use of face masks was more

have projected that close to 25 of africas population could become infected with sars-cov-2 in 2020 2  resulting in significant burden on health systems and between 82000 and 189000 deaths as of early june 2020 the progression of the pandemic appears to be accelerating in several areas of the continent in the absence of an effective vaccine behavioral changes are essential for mitigating the impact of the pandemic according to the world health organization 3  controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 in local communities requires adopting preventive behaviors that either a reduce the extent of contacts between population members or b limit the likelihood that the coronavirus will be transmitted if such contact occurs this includes for example maintaining an increased distance between individuals enhancing hand hygiene or limiting mass gatherings 3  wearing facial masks is also increasingly recommended to limit the emission of infective droplets 4 5  the adoption of such behaviors requires having adequate information about patterns of disease transmission and the severity of symptoms according to standard frameworks in public health 6 7  adoption also depends on whether individuals perceive themselves as susceptible to acquiring a new disease or health threat and whether they consider that this disease would have serious consequences for their health and well-being in this paper we investigate sources of information knowledge and risk perceptions related to the covid-19 pandemic among a sample of malawian adults we then measure the prevalence of preventive behaviors during the first few weeks of the pandemic in the country  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to

of preventive behaviors they adopted if they believe that this might be the more acceptable answer finally our study results might be affected by non-response during the mobile survey only 80 of the individuals for whom a phone number was available participated in the mobile interview if their characteristics and behaviors differed systematically from those of other respondents the results from the study might be biased despite these limitations our study has important implications on the one hand they indicate that additional information campaigns might be needed to fill knowledge gaps about the transmission and courseseverity of the disease such campaigns might use the radio as their primary medium but they could also make use of other media including social media platforms to reach individuals in urban areas on the other hand these information campaigns along with other interventions should aim to better align individual risk perceptions with epidemiological estimates of

to covid-19 relies on accurate and timely surveillance of local pandemic spread as well as rapid characterization of the clinical course of disease in affected individuals de novo diagnostic testing methods developed for emergent pandemics are subject to significant development delays and capacity limitations there is a critical need for complementary surveillance approaches that can function at population-scale to inform public health decisions in real-time internet search patterns provide a number of important advantages relative to laboratory testing we conducted a detailed global study of internet search patterns related to covid-19 symptoms in multiple languages across 32 countries on six continents we found that internet search patterns reveal a robust temporal pattern of disease progression for covid-19 initial symptoms of fever dry cough sore throat and chills are followed by shortness of breath an average of 522 days 95 ci 330-714 after symptom onset matching the precise clinical course reported in the medical literature furthermore we found that increases in covid-19-symptom-related searches predict increases in reported covid-19 cases and deaths 1853 days 95 ci 1598-2108 and 2216 days 95 ci 2033-2399 in advance respectively this is the first study to show that internet search patterns can be used to reveal the detailed clinical course of a disease these data can be used to track and predict the local spread of covid-19 before widespread laboratory testing becomes available in each country helping to guide the current public health response  accurate real-time surveillance of local disease spread is essential for effective pandemic response informing key public health measures such as social distancing and closures as well as the allocation of scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators and hospital beds 1 2 during the current covid-19 pandemic surveillance has primarily relied on direct testing of individuals using a variety of de novo laboratory testing methods developed specifically for the emergent pandemic 3 while laboratory testing serves as an important gauge of epidemic spread it suffers from a number of important limitations 1 during the early stages of a novel pandemic laboratory tests specific to the pandemic do not yet exist and therefore must be developed de novo  leading to significant delays before test-based surveillance can begin 2 even once a test has been developed scaling of manufacturing distribution and test processing capacity takes a significant amount of time resulting in limited testing capacity in many countries 4 it is therefore difficult to achieve population-scale surveillance with laboratory testing in the crucial early stages of an emergent pandemic 3 even after tests are widely available delays in test administration and processing make laboratory testing a lagging indicator relative to disease onset 5 4 laboratory testing often requires individuals to leave home and congregate at testing centers increasing exposure both for those being tested and for the health workers administering the tests 5 laboratory tests are typically invasive involving blood draws or deep nasal swabs 6  laboratory testing can be expensive especially when testing large numbers of people 5 alternative surveillance approaches are needed to overcome these limitations and serve as a complement to laboratory testing especially during the critical early stages of a pandemic aggregated de-identified internet search patterns have been used to track a wide range of health phenomena including influenza 6  mers 7  measles 8  abortion 9 and immunization compliance 10 and are a potential alternative source of information for surveilling pandemic spread previous uses of these data have yielded valuable lessons in their appropriate use with an emphasis on avoiding non-specific search terms and avoiding complex models that tend towards overfitting 11 6 12 when harnessed appropriately internet search patterns possess a number of powerful advantages relative to laboratory testing 17 these studies relied on a limited number of patients and were published weeks and months after the initial spread of the pandemic it would thus be beneficial to pandemic tracking case diagnosis and treatment if these clinical patterns could be ascertained earlier and at population-scale we conducted a detailed global study across 32 countries on six continents to determine whether internet search patterns can provide reliable real-time indicators of local covid-19 spread and whether these data can reveal the clinical progression of covid-19 we selected 32 countries from diverse regions of the world table 1  in which robust search data were available for the search terms of interest we obtained data on reported covid-19 cases and deaths for each of these countries from a publicly available dataset maintained by the center for systems science and engineering at johns hopkins university 18 we collected daily relative search volume rsv data on a per-country basis for the period of january 1 2020 through april 20 2020 from google trends 19 using the pytrends api 20  google has limited availability in china we accessed search trend data from the search engine weibo 21 we accessed data for the following common symptoms of covid-19 fever cough dry cough chills sore throat runny nose and shortness of breath as well as the general terms coronavirus coronavirus symptoms and coronavirus test we also looked at other less common symptoms such as loss of smell and loss of taste but the search data on those terms were too sparse for many countries since daily search data are inherently noisy all search data were smoothed with a 5-day moving average 22 and confirmed that robust data were available for these translated search terms on google trends 19 we conducted temporal correlation studies to characterize the relationships between search data and reported covid-19 cases and deaths for each country and search term we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of search volumes for that search term and the time series of covid-19 cases we then shifted the search term data by a variable lag and identified the lag that yielded the highest correlation we computed the mean and standard deviation of these optimal lags for each search term across all countries we then repeated these analyses substituting reported covid-19 deaths for reported covid-19 cases we then investigated whether internet search data can be used to characterize the clinical course of covid-19 symptoms over time we used coronavirus symptoms as the index search term since it peaked first among all other search terms for each country the date of peak search volume for the index search term was defined as the index date and the dates for all other search data for that country were defined in relation to this date day 0 day 1 day 2 etc with the data from all countries thus aligned cross-country ensemble average curves were calculated for each search term eg day 1 values for fever searches in each of the 32 countries were averaged together to calculate the day 1 value of the ensemble average fever curve the same was done for day 2 etc the ensemble average curves for all search terms were then overlaid on one plot providing a search-data-based view of the clinical course of illness as above all results were calculated using search data smoothed with a 5-day moving average for  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

individual countries figure 1 shows search volumes for the terms fever and dry cough alongside reported covid-19 cases and deaths for china iran italy united states and india even though outbreaks occurred at different times in each country the temporal relationships between the search terms and reported covid-19 cases and deaths are similar across countries figure 2a shows the lags between search volumes for the term fever and covid-19-related deaths across 32 countries along with a histogram showing the distribution of these lags figure   2b shows the same information for the term dry cough the average lags between searches and reported cases are shorter than those between searches and reported deaths since cases are usually diagnosed and reported before deaths the cross-country variability of the average lags between searches and reported cases is greater higher standard deviation and larger confidence intervals than that for reported deaths likely since case reporting is more sensitive to local testing capacity and rates which vary greatly between countries we found that the general term coronavirus has greater variability in its lags to reported cases and deaths largest standard deviation and confidence intervals compared to other symptom-specific terms as would be expected for a non-specific search term we examined the progression of symptom-related search terms over time in order to characterize the clinical course of covid-19 figure 3 shows examples from individual  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder

across 32 countries figure 4a shows the ensemble average search volumes for fever cough dry cough and shortness of breath indexed by searches for coronavirus symptoms alongside reported covid-19 cases and deaths figure 4b shows this same analysis for additional search terms sore throat runny nose chills and coronavirus test also indexed by searches for coronavirus the clinical progression that emerges from these data presents the following picture as the pandemic begins to take hold in a country people search for coronavirus symptoms and coronavirus test followed by initial symptoms fever cough runny nose sore throat and chills followed by searches for shortness of breath about 5 days after the search for initial symptoms the medical literature reports the clinical progression of covid-19 in terms of the number of days between initial symptom onset and shortness of breath dyspnea therefore we examined a range of possible search-term-based definitions for initial symptom onset based on various combinations of the earliest-peaking search terms fever cough coronavirus symptoms and coronavirus test table 3 shows the lags between these different definitions for initial symptom onset and searches for shortness of breath the average lag between the searches for fever and shortness of breath was 522 days 95 ci 330-714 for cough it was 516 days 95 ci 313-718 these lags and lags deriving from other symptom onset definitions are all around 5 days precisely matching the clinical course of the disease reported in the literature 14 15 16 17  this is the first study to show that

officials not only with predictions of local pandemic spread but also with a detailed understanding of the stage of illness and the manifestations of the disease in the local environment recent studies have indicated that the spread and severity of the disease can be affected by local conditions 23 24 25 and search volume data can be a valuable complementary tool in studying potential local variations in disease presentation we found that increases in symptom-related searches such as fever predict increases in reported the use of search data is subject to a number of important limitations 11 6 12 internet infrastructure and digital access levels differ across countries and communities some countries currently lack sufficient search volume to support robust search-based tracking though in the long-term digital access rates are increasing worldwide search data may be subject to socio-economic geographic or other biases inherent in the local digital divide 1326  27 even though selecting specific search terms increases the signal to noise ratio changes in search volumes for symptom-related terms such as fever could result not only from increases in covid-19 cases but also general curiosity about the pandemic other diseases eg influenza lassa fever 28  news coverage or other factors due to privacy considerations search data are provided as aggregated relative search volumes rather than raw counts so while it is possible to predict an increase in cases it may be difficult to infer the magnitude of such an increase while search data have important limitations laboratory testing is subject to a wide range of limitations listed above in addition to reliability issues which cause certain types of laboratory tests to need to be repeated in order to increase reliability 29 30 recent studies have examined internet search data related to the current covid-19 pandemic some studies looked only at the search term coronavirus 31  32  33  34 while others looked at additional search terms such as handwashing face masks 35 36 quarantine hand disinfection 37 sars mers 38 antiseptic and sanitizer 39 none of these studies  cc-by-nc-nd 40

coronavirus have a greater variability in their relation to reported cases and deaths this is likely due to the fact that individuals seeking general information on the pandemic may search for coronavirus even if they are not experiencing specific symptoms themselves at that time a few studies have examined internet search data using terms related to covid-19 symptoms but these covered only one country or a small number of countries one study looked at coronavirus and pneumonia only in china and found that internet searches were correlated with daily incidences of covid-19 40 another looked at covid covid pneumonia and covid heart only in the us and found that these terms were correlated with covid-19 daily incidence and deaths 41 yet another study looked at loss of smell in 8 countries and found these to be correlated with covid-19 cases  42 another study developed a model incorporating a large selection of search terms including some symptom-related terms in 8 countries however this latter study focused on optimizing the performance of a predictive model rather than studying the detailed temporal relationships between patterns of symptoms  43 the present study is the first to conduct a detailed investigation of multiple covid-19 symptom-related search terms across a large number of countries it is also the first to conduct a detailed analysis of the temporal relationships between different symptom-related searches in order to characterize the clinical course of illness for covid-19 future work includes training a robust predictive model with various machine learning techniques to provide more granular predictions for increases in covid-19 cases and deaths such models can also take into account additional sources of data such as news reports testing capacity public health mitigation measures climatological and air quality variables among others the ability of search data to not only predict future increases in cases but also reveal the clinical course of symptoms in emergent pandemics is significant given the numerous limitations of laboratory testing search data are a valuable complementary source for population-scale tracking of

infections were not identified while the transmission rate of undocumented cases was estimated to be at least 55 of the total of reported infections 34  in the region ecuador has been highlighted due to its covid-19 pandemic management and the rapid geographic spread of the novel coronavirus 35  this equatorial country received worldwide attention due to the excessive number of undocumented deaths upon the arrival of the sars-cov-2 virus within the region 35  according to the official figures published by the national emergency management committee ecuador reported in april 16 th  at least

the government has not officially stated that the excessive numbers of deaths are due to covid-19 a significant number of these deaths are likely covid-19 related especially when other violent causes of deaths traffic accidents and homicides have been reduced due to the partial cuff implemented in the country during the first week of march 36 37 38  brazil the most populated country in the region

affected in the region has almost 120 more positive cases per every test performed than italy 1500 more than south korea and almost 7000 more than vietnam 30  it is important to empathize that the figures reported rely on national government statistics nevertheless is critical to understand that testing capabilities are widely reduced in some countries in the region without adequate mechanisms of efficiently testing as much population as possible contact tracing strategies and effective isolation of suspected cases becomes a real challenge 29  the analysis of these trends is an interim insight into the current situation in the region the best action that countries can take is implementing social distancing measures and reducing travel so individuals are less likely to come into contact with each other therefore reducing the rate of transmission and alleviating pressure on health systems during the performance of this study a disparity of the reports obtained from the different freely accessible published databases was evidenced regarding the reporting dates of the first case confirmed cases and registered deaths values for this reason to maintain uniformity of the data johns hopkins university database was used for graphs and tables regarding the rates used its evident that cfr and ptr are highly variable during the pandemic therefore they dont reflect correctly the impact of deaths and tests carried out in a country furthermore the recovered case data was not used because until the end of the study any country reported more than a thousand cases and it is suggested that these variables and the adjusting for outcome delay in cfr estimates should be analysed in subsequent studies it is important to understand that there is lack of reliable diagnostic tests rt-pcr data in the region on top of that some countries do not report the results of private providers thus the analysis is often performed with the available data another critical limitation is the lack of information for most of the countries when distinguishing between tests that were collected versus those which were processed  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

antiviral activity has an immune-modulating effect 5  the 90 effective concentration ec90 value of chloroquine against the 2019-ncov in vitro was demonstrated to be clinically achievable in the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients who received 500 mg 6  the metabolism of chloroquine after oral administration occurs mostly in the liver its excretion is slow and maintains a plasma half-life of 25 to 10 days furthermore individuals with impaired or compromised liver function at baseline eg ventilated patients in itu with multiple fat-soluble infusions running are more likely to experience accumulation in-vivo and require close monitoring of liver function test and risk of liver failure the adult acute lethal dose of chloroquine is between two to four grams in ages 18 to 65 according to the wuhan institute of virology 7  the study does not to stop at what medication is appropriate but also requires knowing when it is better to start treatment from sars we know that clinical worsening of individuals in week 2 is apparently more related to immunopathological damage than to uncontrolled coronavirus replication 8 keyaerts et al 9 observed that chloroquine displayed significant anti-sars-cov activity 9  but that inhibitory capability sharply declined if not administered within five-hour post infection 9  yet advantages of chloroquine such as low cost and well-established safety could allow its use as prophylaxis in individuals at high risk such as healthcare workers 10  the aim of this research is to report the existent clinical evidence of chloroquine and

hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times per day for 10 days were virologically cured at day six post inclusion compared to 125 of patients in the control group p0001 in another group 100 of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were virologically cured at day 6 post inclusion compared with 571 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone and 125 in the control group p0001 gautret et al 17 carried out a cohort study where they looked at the outcomes of patients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg three times per day for 10 days for four days and antibiotic azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg per day for next four days reporting positive results from the study a broad-spectrum antibiotic ceftriaxone was added in those who developed pneumonia the case report study by spezzani et al 18 reported that patients treated with darunavircobicistat and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily in combination with a triple antibiotic therapy levofloxacin piperacillin plus tazobactam had a better outcome compared to darunavircobicistat and hydroxychloroquine combined with double therapy of ceftriaxone and azithromycin both italian patients started treatment at admission seven days after initial symptoms despite this the couple achieved remission on different weeks as the course of the disease differed due to individual risk factors patient one had metastatic breast cancer and recent exposure to antineoplastic chemotherapy which had produced leukopenia immunosuppression at admission whereas there was no hint of a significant immunosuppression of patient two however patient one had a rapid recovery compared to a prolonged and more severe course compared to patient two who had a relatively low risk profile

in resource constrained settings with reference to india they provide the current dosage guidelines on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use from china south korea united states netherlands canada and belgium for the treatment of covid-19 using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine 13  dosage recommendations for adults from each of these sources vary depending on the severity of the cases based on the results of the study the authors conclude that because of its limited side effects availability and costeffectiveness the drugs should be worthy for fast track clinical trials for treatment of covid-19 however another systematic review by sarma et al 14 found that when compared to conventional treatment there was no difference observed in virological cure death clinical worsening of disease or safety the main benefit was that treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone resulted in a lower number of cases showing radiological progression of lung disease additional benefits included less days to temperature normalisation and lowered total cough days compared to conventional treatment the authors recommended that more data is acquired before making a definitive conclusion on the safety and effectiveness of the drugs the results of this systematic review indicate a positive trend favouring the use of chloroquine singularly or the combination of hydroxychloroquine with antibiotic therapy regardless of added bacterial infection at the beginning of the treatment evidence was insufficient to favour a treatment start on week one versus week two or vice  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

versa of symptoms appearing however spezzani et al 18 showed that immunosuppression may actually enhance treatment effectiveness by the use of the combination of hydroxychloroquine antibiotic therapy and darunavircobicistat in patients who started treatment seven days after initial symptoms these findings have implications for clinical practice and policy in the current pandemic despite the potential therapeutic effect of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine fears exist that excess demand may lead to a shortage for people with other diseases who are currently taking these drugs 19  chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are usually safe and well tolerated in normal dosage but can be extremely toxic in overdose potential adverse effects that should be considered before prescribing include prolongation of the qt interval especially in pre-existing cardiac disease or if combined with azithromycin hypo-glycemia neuropsychiatric effects drug-drug interactions and idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reactions 20  moreover chloroquine is not as widely available as hydroxychloroquine in some countries and is associated with greater adverse effects such as interaction with lopinavirritonavir resulting in prolongation of the qt interval 21 to our knowledge this systematic review is the first attempt to gather evidence from fully published studies that focus on the treatment to date of coronavirus outbreaks in human subjects contrasting to ours previous research explores the suitability of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in treating coronavirus by relying on findings from animal studies and dosage recommendations from unpublished trials our search identified six eligible studies two scored highly in the methodological quality assessment this

chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has increased focus on repurposing the drugs to combat the covid-19 pandemic this has prompted the world health organisation to reconsider leaving both drugs out from a large trial to study the effectiveness and safety of promising medications suitable for treating covid-19 patients 24 other institutions have also began launching fast track trials to understand whether they help in the recovery time and outcomes but these types of studies come with issues of design bias which is unlikely to provide important data on the true effects of the drugs

populations it will difficult to provide them to those who need them the most future research should adhere to the rigorous standard guidelines for the randomised control and observational cohort studies as best as possible so that valuable and unbiased information is provided on these medications the current evidence that exists on real human patients is weak despite effectiveness shown in in-vitro cultures for past coronavirus outbreaks and with the covid-19 variant it is unclear if there is an effect on the effectiveness depending on early or late stage of administration nevertheless recent clinical trials suggest a more positive outcome for those patients treated with chloroquine singularly or hydroxychloroquine combinations off-label use of these drugs for covid-19 could raise the demand which would require a counterbalance in production otherwise this may lead to a negative impact for those treated for malaria lupus and other rheumatic diseases further randomised trials

agnihotri puneet nirmal sukhbir kaur   coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in humans mammals and birds in humans the virus causes respiratory tract infections which are mild but may be lethal in some cases coronaviruses are a group of an rnavirus and also known as a 2019-ncov virus coronaviruses are viruses in the subfamily orthocoronaviridae of family coronaviridae in the order nidovirales coronaviruses are enveloped viruses and have a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome with a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry 8 31 the genomic size of coronavirus varies from 26 to 32 kilobase 7 coronaviruses are categorized into four genera ie alpha beta delta and gamma where alpha and beta are responsible for causing infection in humans 17 there are seven strains of human coronaviruses viz human coronavirus 229ehcov-229e human coronavirus oc43hcov-oc43 sars-cov human coronavirus nl63hcov-nl63 new heaven coronavirus human coronavirus hku middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov previously known as novel coronavirus 2012 and hcov-emc novel coronavirus 2019-ncov also known as wuhan pneumonia or wuhan coronavirus the coronaviruses hcov-229e -nl63 -oc43 and -hku1 frequently circulate in human population and cause respiratory infection in adults and children the incubation period for human coronavirus is 25 days 15 as it is communicable disease and transfer from one person to another person through a droplet and direct contact 9 the recent identification of fourth human coronavirus hcov-nl63 was diagnosed from a 7-month-old child who suffers from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis symptoms of coronavirus are feeling tired difficulty in breathing fever coughing and sore throat as the symptoms are similar to other respiratory diseases including flu and common cold in this review we have explained the actual mechanism of coronavirus and its overexpression in the cell membrane fig 1 for identification of active infection serology test was performed for the surveillance purpose serology test was performed however it has its own limitation ie it cannot be considered as diagnostic test in this test antibodies to mers-cov can be finalized from previous infections 34 the populations of certain places which are disease-ridden with mers infection are suspectable for molecular test and clinical tests to identify active infections of mers-cov 22 to identify the viral rna within reckonable samples a molecular test called real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr are vividly used for identification and confirmation of mers-cov infection entails as per central for disease control and prevention cdc there must be either a positive rrt-pcr result for at least two definite genomic targets or single positive target with the sequencing of a second target as per cdc the united states has approved an rrt-pcr assay for mers-cov the test is thru under the buff of an emergency use authorization but human error poor laboratory conditions and ignorance while testing the samples is such prevalent factors which could affect the capability and proficiency of rrt-pcr test for this rrt-pcr assay cdc recommended collecting multiple samples including lower and upper respiratory sample serum and stool specimen cdc considers a patient under examination to be negative for active mers-cov infection when one negative rrt-pcr test on the mentioned specimen cdc consider mers patient to be negative for active mers-cov infection followed by two successive negative rrt-pcr tests on all samples 1 the peoples who had infection to mers-cov serology test helps to identify antibody from them these types of antibody have the capability to attack attenuate kill the hosted virus within the immune system the presence of antibodies to mers-cov shows that a person had been formerly diseased with the virus and develops an immune response confirmation to date recommends there may be a wider range of mers disease than was initially thought for example a public health investigator has recognized individuals who are pcr-positive but have no mers symptoms we do not know if mers-cov can be spread by these people cdc has a two-phase methodology for serology testing using two screening tests and one confirmatory test to distinguish antibodies to mers-cov 6 the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa is a screening tests to detect the occurrence and concentration of specific antibodies that is bind to a viral protein cdc recommended elisa test for antibodies against two different mers-cov proteins viz nucleocapsid n and spike s to identify the neutralizing antibodies the microneutralization assay is a good confirmatory test which helps to measure specific antibodies in serum specimens however compared to elisa the microneutralization assay is a laboratory intensive and time-consuming method and requires at least 5 days before the result are available if a clinical sample is found to be positive either by elisa or microneutralization the specimen is determined to be confirmed positive 5 if a clinical sample is found to be positive by both elisas and negative by microneutralization the sample is determined to be intermediate if a clinical sample is found to be positive by only one elisa and negative by microneutralization the sample is determined to be negative 18 in the end a final determination of a confirmed positive serology the result needs to be a positive elisa test and confirmation by microneutralization assay mers-cov serology test is used for surveillance test not for diagnostic purpose-these are the tools which developed in response to the mers-cov outbreak in 1965 two scientists tyrell and bynoe studied the human coronavirus named b814 found in human embryonic tracheal organ cultures obtained from the respiratory tract of a person with common cold the existence of an infectious agent was demonstrated by inoculating the medium form these cultures in human volunteers in this experiment colds were produced but the growth of agents does not occur at the same time other two scientists hamre and procknow got to succeed in growing virus with unusual properties in tissue culture from samples which were picked up from adults with colds hamre named this virus as 229e hamres virus 12 in the late 1960s tyrell with a group of scientists worked on human strains and other animal viruses which included infectious bronchitis virus mouse hepatitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine which were morphologically the same as seen through electron microscopy 12 this new category of viruses was called coronavirus and was accepted as new genus of viruses further research gives more information about the epidemiology of human respiratory coronaviruses like it was found that in temperate climates respiratory coronavirus infections occur more often in the winter and spring 29 after three decades of discovery human strains oc43 and 229e were studied like many other viruses the reinfection was common as the research continues to explore the pathogenicity and epidemiology of the human coronavirus the importance and number of animal coronaviruses were growing rapidly in 2003 the new virus sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was identified which first infected humans in southern china sars-cov killed 774 people and at least 8000 people were infected 23 sars infection affected 29 countries since 2004 there have not been any known cases in the world 16 the transmission of sars is primarily from person to person symptoms are like influenza-like and include fever malaise headache diarrhea and shivering the evolution of this virus demonstrated that this virus is not stable virus and can adapt to become more virulent even lethal to humans after that another outbreak in saudi arabia in 2012 cause many deaths and later spread to other countries it was called middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov as its origin was middle east the spread of infection occurred worldwide however most cases of deaths occurred in the middle east from2012 to 2018 the total number of cases reported was 2274 from 27 countries out of which 817 associated deaths were reported there are no further reports of cases of mers-covbut now in december 2019 there was an epidemic of new novel coronavirus in the city of wuhan china and was named as 2019-ncov 14 this infection is closely related to sars-cov and mers-cov 30 in december 2019 wmhc reported 27 cases of viral pneumonia most of the people who were infected had exposure to the huanan seafood market where poultry bats snakes and other wildlife animals were sold the cause of viral pneumonia was not sars mers influenza virus or adenovirus on january 10 reports came that the newly identified 2019-ncov has been isolated from patients with the help of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction methods on jan 2020 217 patients were infected with 2019-ncov out of which 9 patients died there are more than 20623 confirmed cases and at least 427 people have died as of 3 feb 2020 the virus has spread to at least to 20 countries including us australia thailand hong kong taiwan macau singapore japan south korea france malaysia canada germany nepal india and uae after close introspection from the chinses government it was tangible that the outbreak of covid-19 was ignited from fish and wild animal market of wuhan city china during november 2019 33 the virus has prominent intention to grown itself within the serum or raw blood within the mutilated bodies of animals birds and fishes after proper incubation within the animal blood the virus transmission occurs due to the human trespassing and mobilization as per who guideline to prevent an individual from contamination one can frequently wash hisher hand using sanitizer containing 70 ethanol 15 hydrogen peroxide 15 deionised water avoid unprotected animal contacts use of ffp1-3 mask as per whos most recent guideline march 31 2020 a patient with acute respiratory illness with certain symptoms of cough shortness of breath and a history of traveling in foreign territory is susceptible for community transmission of covid-19 disease heshe must be treated in quarantine at list for 14 days chloroquine has some devastative and quandary effects against any kind of rna virus ie hepatitis a and c rabies polio hiv influenza a and b influenza a h5n1 lassa zika hendra nipah and ebola virus 27 chloroquine has also some lethal effects against some dna virus as well such as hepatitis b virus and herpes simplex virus but unfortunately very few clinical researches have been carryforward to detect the antiviral activity of chloroquine as far as the corona virus pandemic is concerned benefits of chloroquine were remarkably reported for sars-cov-1 in in-vitro cell line studies it was confirmed that chloroquine has significant inhibitory effects on the replication of hcov- 229e in epithelial lung cell cultures the chloroquine has been most prominently active against middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov the chloroquine has significant impact on establishing endolysosomal pathway as sars-cov-1 virus try to vandalize this pathway hence chloroquine could be very effective against novel corona virus a recent paper stated that both chloroquine and antiviral remdesivir inhibited sars-cov-2 in vitro and proposed that these drugs to be assessed in human patients suffering from covid-19 as far as its mechanism of action is concern against novel corona virus it has multiple mechanisms in which in step-by-step it inhibits the pre entry of virus penetration within the cellular surface receptors the chloroquine was found to have inhibitory effects against enzyme called quinone reductase 2 a structural neighbor of udp- n -acetylglucosamine 2-epimerases which is involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acids the chloroquinoline interferes the biosynthesis of sialic acid by which human coronavirus hcov-o43 and the orthomyxoviruses cannot utilize sialic acid moieties as receptor due to which the virial glycosylation on virus cell surface receptor would stop due to alkylation of endosome chloroquine shows in-vitro anti-viral effect when added to vero cells prior to virus exposure the mechanism is likely to be rapid annulment of virus endosome fusion with fluctuation of endosomal ph through endocytosis based on the initial studies and positive outcomes of chloroquine indian council of medical research icmr on march 24 2020 suggested that those patients who are corona positive and the doctors and other healthcare professionals who are handling covid-19 patients are advised to take hydroxychloroquine a chloroquinoline derivative as a preventive drug as hydroxychloroquine an antimalarial drug has assumed prophylactic effects against covid-19 but as per forbes article by willam a haseltine march 25 2020 hydroxychloroquine has ineffective treatment of patients hospitalized with covid-19 the small controlled trails were conducted in shanghai public health clinical center china with 15 patients by giving 400 mg hydroxychloroquine dose for 7 days the results are not that much surprising when the treatment group was compared with the controlled group after ct scans it was observed that treatment group has less significance difference than the controlled group total 93 of patients in the control group tested negative for covid-19 after 7 days compare to 867 of patients in the hydroxychloroquine treated group the results were not that much favorable and statistically indistinguishable as per who on march 31 2020 no new country reported new cases on covid-19 for the last 24 h however the numbers of infected cases are alarming globally almost 75890 confirmed cases and 36405 deaths were reported till march 31 2020 as per who report more than 800000 surgical masks 873000 gloves 54000 n95 masks and 24000 face shields were exported in 75 countries along with covid-19 testing kits to 126 countries by operations support and logistics osl on 15 january 2020 the case of coronavirus 2019-ncov was reported by ministry of health labor and welfare japan mhlw from wuhan hubei province china 19 the patient was male age 3039 years living in japan the patient traveled to wuhan china in late december and had a fever on 3 january 2020 while staying in wuhan he did not visit the huanan seafood wholesale market or any other live animal markets in wuhan 13 he has indicated that he was in close contact with a person with pneumonia on 6 january he returned to japan and tested negative for influenza when he visited a local clinic on the same day 21 on 10 january 2020 due to his continued symptoms of cough sore throat and fever he visited a local hospital and was found to have abnormal chest x-ray with infiltrates 32 he was admitted to the hospital on the same day and had remained fevered 10 on 14 january his attending doctor notified the case to a local public health authority under the surveillance system for unidentified serious infectious illness samples were collected and sent to the national institute of infectious diseases niid and at niid polymerase chain reaction pcr testing and sequencing were performed twice which identified very small amount of

in wuhan and was initially diagnosed with a cold on 19 january the case-patient was detected with fever 383 c upon arrival at the incheon international airport the case-patient was transferred to a nationally designated isolation hospital for testing and treatment the patient was tested positive was confirmed positive for novel coronavirus 2019-ncov on 20 january by sequencing at the korea centers for disease control and prevention kcdc the patient had chills runny nose and muscle pain the case-patient did not report visiting any markets including huanan seafood wholesale market nor did she have known contact with confirmed 2019-ncov cases or wild animals in wuhan city the case-patient is currently under isolation receiving treatment and is in a stable condition 4 on 13 january 2020 the first imported case of coronavirus was reported by the ministry of public health mph thailand from wuhan hubei province chinathe patient was a 61-year-old chinese woman living in wuhan city hubei province china on 5 january 2020 she developed fever with chills sore throat and headache on 8 january 2020 she took a direct flight to thailand from wuhan city together with five family members in a tour group of 16 people the traveler with febrile illness was detected on the same day by thermal surveillance at suvarnabhumi airport bkk thailand and was hospitalized the same day 26 after the temperature check and initial assessment she was transferred to the hospital for further investigations and treatment 2 she reported a history of visiting a local fresh market in wuhan on regular basis however she did not report visiting the huanan south china seafood market from where most of the cases were detected 3 samples tested positive for coronaviruses by reverse

and the thai national institute of health thai nih department of medical sciences confirmed that the patient was infected with the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov which was isolated in wuhan china for more information please see the disease outbreak news published on 12 january 2020 in india the patient was detected with novel coronavirus in keralas thrissur district and the patient kept in an isolation ward while the number of people under observation 28 the condition of the woman patient a medical student from wuhan university was stable 11 the woman now in an isolation ward at the general hospital in thrissur is likely to be shifted to the medical college hospital there soon health officials were awaiting a result of one more testgene sequencing only after which it can be stated that the patient was affected with the virus 24 three others who had returned from china are also in isolation wards in thrissur of the four students who returned from china one of them has tested positive of the total 1053 people under observation after traveling to china as many as 247 arrived in the state on thursday while 15 people including seven who got admitted on thursday are under observation in isolation wards at various hospitals across the state the remaining are under home quarantine so far a total of 24 samples have been sent to the national institute of virology in pune for testing and 15 of them turned out to be negative while that of the woman tested positive 20 after long hurdle and extensive research scientists have come to a conclusion that flavilavir an anti-viral drug has the potential to eradicate novel coronavirus this drug now subsequently promoted for marketing by national medical products administration since the outburst the flavilavir was developed by zhejiang hisun pharmaceutical company from the clinical research data it is postulated that flavilavir could play a game changer in the management of novel coronavirus in the above study of corona virus there are the various recent cases of corona virus affected patient human beings are addressed in the latest by 2020 so in the above article various causative agents and the mechanism of action of the corona virus are determined and studied the corona virus is of the various kinds and the most lethal corona virus is wuhan corona virus 2019 there are the two different diagnostic tests of the corona virus are discussed in the above study now days corona virus is spreading in the various regions of the world so maintain good hygienic conditions so that one should live a healthy

the fast transmission of covid-19 with a basic reproductive number 56 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in wuhan no changes in transmission have been noted across generations by evaluating different control strategies through predictive modeling and monte carlo simulations a comprehensive quarantine in hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach government action to immediately enforce this quarantine is highly recommended  the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 originated in wuhan a city located in central china in early december is fast spreading to more than 30 countries benvenuto et al 2020 she et al 2020  in less than 3 months the disease has infected more than 70000 people globally and has caused more than 2000 deaths on january 30 th  2020 the world health organization declared covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern upon composing this manuscript the coronavirus is concurrently spreading and claiming more than 100 lives per day this outbreak induces an urgency to determine the characteristics of covid-19 transmission and implement optimal strategies to control the epidemic coronavirus is an enveloped positive-sense single stranded rna virus found in a variety of mammals including bats civets camel and pangolins ge et al 2013 kandeil et al 2019 liu et al 2007 rockx et al 2011  two strains of coronaviruses sars-cov-1 and mers-cov have been reported to cause severe respiratory syndromes resulting in deadly epidemics in 2002 and 2012 respectively fung and liu 2019 luk et al 2019  this current coronavirus denoted as sars-cov-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans benvenuto et al 2020  to effectively fight and end the covid-19 epidemic the transmission of the disease and zoonotic source of origin must be accurately identified leading to the discovery of an optimal strategy to control this outbreak by studying the cases and clinical features from early reports this paper illustrates rigorous epidemiological models and the associated statistical methods to estimate the transmission rates in different stages and scenarios and predict the outcomes for different control strategies the numbers of cases from january 21 st to february 20 th  2020 were obtained from the daily reports by national health commission nhc of china as nhc did not release case reports until january 21 st  the case numbers prior to january 21 st were obtained from two recent clinical reports huang et al 2020 li et al 2020  the number of patients diagnosed out of wuhan was obtained from the report by which summarized 1099 cases confirmed by january 29 th  2020 the case numbers for the diamond princess cruise were obtained from the daily reports by yokohama port quarantine center a susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine model was used for transmission analysis and prediction of epidemiological spread cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

were linked to the huanan seafood market which retails seafood and wild animals it is believed that an enclosed and crowded environment is favorable for coronavirus transmission however the epidemiological data is lacking to test the hypothesis the recent diamond princess cruise epidemic was used as a comparable case study a clear disease outbreak was reported on this cruise a passenger who visited china on january 10 th  was on board from january 20 th and january 25 th before being confirmed with a sars-cov-2 infection all people on board have been quarantined at sea since february 5 th and 621 out of 3711 people were confirmed positive for sars-cov-2 as some of the patients were known to be infected after the quarantine possibly due to central air conditioning and family infection only the confirmed cases n135 by february 10 th five days incubation plus one day diagnosis were used for a conservative estimation of transmission using a seiq model while q0 the daily transmission rate  was found to be 104 95 ci 069-187  figure 1b  which is twice as much as the transmission rate in open cities using the infection period of 125 days the effective reproductive number on the cruise rc was 130 95 ci 863-23375 the link between many of the december cases and the huanan seafood market indicates that the huanan seafood market is one of the zoonotic origins of sars-cov-2 if not only after the forced shutdown of the huanan seafood market on january 1 st  the effectiveness of the zoonotic infection and a potential secondary source of sars-cov-2 that continued to infect the wuhan people remained in question  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  httpsdoiorg10 1101 to characterize the zoonotic infection of covid-19 a seiq model was constructed to analyze for the epidemic from the hunan seafood market in december 2019 the first sars-cov-2 onset was found on december 1 st 2019 huang et al 2020  and by the 1 st of january 41 patients were confirmed and quarantined using the 58-day interval between disease onset and clinical visit 136 cases diagnosed in the first 6 days of january were included bringing the total number of infections to 177 given 0044 the development of the epidemic was simulated by initializing with a range of numbers from 1 to 5 of infections on december 1 st using the seiq model it showed that at most one infected patient can be allowed in the model which induced a mean of 174 infections 95 ci 161-187 by january 1 st  instead of one if two unrelated people were infected by december 1 st  the 95 ci would be 291 318 on january 1 st  significantly larger than the expected 177 cases thus the transmission would be so minimal that it would not substantially contribute to the final number of infections even if there existed a second zoonotic source in the same sense the results did not support a continuous zoonotic source within the huanan seafood market which would have resulted in a higher overall number of infections in the later trajectory as an rna virus coronavirus conveys a high mutation rate benvenuto et al 2020  raising concerns whether the transmission would change between generations the significantly higher mortality rate observed in wuhan suggested that the transmission may attenuate over generations to test this hypothesis the patients infected in december 2019 were considered as the first generation because most of the cases had links to the huanan market while the patients infected in january 2020 were considered the second-or-later generation given the data from december assuming there is only

0045 obtained between january 1 st and 20 th  furthermore the transmission rates between wuhan and other cities were also compared based on guan et als analysis of 1099 patients confirmed by january 29 th  616 were identified outside of wuhan out of the 616 patients193 had recently visited wuhan using a mean infectious period of 5 days  was calculated to 0438 616-19319350438 which was within the 95 confidence interval of the previous estimation of 0 in wuhan 044 95 ci 043-047 therefore no evidence of attenuation of transmission was found unprecedented measures were taken in wuhan to stop the spread of covid-19 immediately after the official announcement of the novel coronavirus home isolations and personal protection equipment such as face masks and gloves were enforced public transportation was limited and eventually all canceled on january 23 rd  the government suspended all plane train and bus travel in and out of wuhan on february 2 nd  a comprehensive quarantine strategy was taken by the chinese government all home-isolated patients were mandated to be hospitalized in the newly built square cabin hospitals and all people who had suspected symptoms or had close contacts were demanded for mandatory isolation in the quarantine stations the effects of these steps may not be clear until the end of the epidemic nevertheless an intermediate analysis is needed for evaluating various control strategies considering the one-day delay in the quarantine of the patients in the square cabin hospitals the seiq model was used to fit the data into two phases from january 23 rd to february 2 nd  and from february 3 rd to february 20 th  in the first phase  was chosen to be 16 based on the analysis by  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

basic transmission rate 0044  figure   2a  in the second phase the time interval from disease onset to quarantine was assumed to drop by another 50 due to the implication of the square cabin hospitals thus 16 the transmission rate  decreased to 010 which was an 815 reduction from the first phase and a 773 reduction from the basic transmission rate in conclusion the aggressive quarantine strategy of building square cabin hospitals has effectively decreased the transmission whereas the usefulness of the travel ban home isolation and personal protection is still unclear to further investigate the timing of the comprehensive quarantine given 010 and 16 simulated isolations were employed to track the numbers of confirmed cases q at various starting dates january 1 st  10 th  20 th  and 30 th  the initial number of cases was estimated by the seiq model the predicted q value was plotted on a logarithm scale up to february 29 th  figure 2b  it was noted that all curves tended to stabilize after the quarantine measures and the time interval to stabilization increased as the number of initial cases increased beginning the quarantine on january 1 st  136 initial cases were reported curve stabilization was achieved after about 10 days with 235 cases reported at the end of this period january 10 th started with approximately 1250 cases and ended with 1834 cases and january 20 th started with about 8250 and ended with about 12000 the january 30 th quarantine took almost 20 days to reach stabilization and the final number of cases 62635 was nearly double the initial number of cases 38397 it was noted that the prediction was rather accurate as illustrated by the small 95 ci gray area and the ci decreased to negligible as the initial number of cases increased  cc-by-nc-nd 40

to be 3 with 95 ci being 2 to 4 dye and gay 2003  however contrary to public knowledge the earlier reports from the covid-19 outbreak provided a r0 number less than or equal to that for sars wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020  this may have resulted from an inaccurate number of clinical cases due to delayed clinical visits overloading of clinical resources and a low sensitivity of the covid-19 diagnosis kit with more clinical reports published the case numbers were adjusted based on the information presented which gave a more accurate transmission estimation the basic reproductive number for covid-19 was then found to be 56 which is substantially higher than that for sars in an enclosed and crowded environment the transmission of sars-cov-2 was thought to significantly increase the diamond princess cruise provided an excellent case study as the development of covid-19 on the cruise line has a clear infectious source exposure time quarantine time and total number of infections the transport of the virus through the central air conditioning system and the ineffective quarantine of the ships crew however raised some concerns nevertheless a conservative estimation of transmission using only 50 of the confirmed cases has proven the high transmission rate in an enclosed crowded ship this suggested that the initial offense within the huanan seafood market could be at a high level the likely zoonotic origin also raised questions about additional sources other than the huanan seafood market this argument was partially supported by several early cases with no

holder for this preprint  known links to the huanan seafood market rigorous statistical models were used to test the hypothesis of a second zoonotic source and the development of case numbers did not support this hypothesis though our model cannot completely exclude the possibility of additional zoonotic sources it suggested a minimal effect by such sources furthermore the model did not support the constant zoonotic infection within huanan seafood market throughout december if the zoonotic transgression was sustained a larger number of infected cases would have been observed based on the data from the diamond process cruise the transmission rate was higher in an enclosed and crowded place like the huanan seafood market however similar transmission rate was observed in december as in january this is likely due to the markets daytime only operating hours reducing the contact time this result further suggested similar transmission rate between generations which was confirmed by comparing the transmission in wuhan and other cities high mutation rates have been observed in the genome sequences collected from more than 100 human specimens however the effect that these mutations have on transmission may not be observed in such a short time period the chinese government took unprecedented measures to fight the new epidemic and those measures raised global controversy for their necessity and effectiveness the restrictive travel ban and home isolation enforced in wuhan was expected to largely decrease the transmission and prevent further spread of the disease within weeks nevertheless the coronavirus infection was continuously increasing exponentially in late january and early february in wuhan in this model an increase in the transmission rate from 044 to 054 was observed during this time period it suggested that the travel ban and home isolation cannot effectively prevent the disease spread this was likely due to the probable cross-contamination in the long waiting lines at the  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not

symptoms to be hospitalized a low sensitivity of diagnosis further increased the waiting time for a confirmed case insufficient hospital beds resulted in a large number of home isolated patients often leading to family infection observing the tremendous epidemic the chinese government built square cabin hospitals with more than twenty thousand beds and quickly moved all patients into these hospitals all people with suspected symptoms or with close patient contacts were isolated in the government-managed quarantine stations this comprehensive quarantine method has successfully reduced the transmission rate by 815 and also greatly shortened the infectious time interval the analysis in this study showed that the epidemic can be controlled within a few weeks if the comprehensive quarantine was conducted on january 20 th or earlier concurrently with the development of this manuscript it was reported that south korea had more than 1000 home isolations in the city of daegu for a suspected sars-cov-2 infection it is highly recommended that other countries immediately quarantine all suspected patients this model was developed using the cases up to february 20 th  as the case numbers increase the transmission features may change and some of the assumptions such as the infectious period may vary the cases reported in wuhan were known to be less than the actual number in january due to overloading of clinical resources and the low sensitivity of diagnosis this study attempted to overcome these limitations by using the clinical information verified by several reports and relying only on the beginning and ending cases therefore this model tended to reflect the real trend of this critical epidemic and it provides more convincing evidence to guide the control of this

during clinical observation in this study we found a decrease in prealbumin in 15 cases 4167 and no previous studies have reported prealbumin changes prealbumin is usually used in clinical evaluation of the nutritional status of the body and the half-life of serum prealbumin is short so its changes may occur before albumin in this study there were only 5 patients with decreased albumin all of which were with a slight decrease but 14 patients 4167showed decreased prealbumin the pulmonary ct findings of the patients were basically consistent with previous reports twenty-two 6111 of the

coronavirus pneumonia experience a decrease in t-cell subsets on admission and in combination with clinical typing we speculate that immune function may be suppressed or impaired in the early stage of the disease as a commonly used indicator to evaluate nutritional status in clinical practice prealbumin is often utilized to evaluate tumor and postoperative recovery 4  domestic scholar cai chuanqi et al 5 found that hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for the severity of disease in elderly pneumonia patients this study found that the albumin in the disease group was basically normal while the prealbumin was significantly lower than that in the normal control group we analyzed the relationship between prealbumin and cd3  t cells cd4  t cells and cd8  t cells respectively the regression model showed that there is a linear and positive correlation between the level of prealbumin in the serum of patients and cd3  t cells cd4  t cells and cd8  t cells with the strongest correlation among cd8  t cells proalbumin is an acute reactive protein synthesized by liver cells with a half-life of 19 days 6  in the early stage of the disease proalbumin changes which may be caused by the consumption of proalbumin by the body after infection with the virus leading to the reduction of proalbumin in peripheral blood recent studies have found that inflammation is an effective inhibitor of protein synthesis and it may also inhibit the synthesis of visceral prealbumin during the occurrence and development of the disease leading to a low level of prealbumin 7  due to fever and infection the body is in a state of high decomposition and high energy demand if at the same time with lack of energy and loss of appetite the patient cannot ensure sufficient food intake through the mouth to meet the needs of the body meanwhile if combined with basic diseases of other viscera moderate or severe malnutrition can easily appear in pneumonia patients clinical studies have found that malnutrition rates in patients with severe pneumonia are as high as 60 with immune dysfunction enteral nutrition or other forms of nutritional support are usually provided only to patients

the analysis of the relationship between prealbumin and t cell subsets the decreased value of prealbumin indicates that the patients cellular immune function is impaired which plays a certain role in clinical condition monitoring according to the current outbreak reports most of the patients are mild and normal type in this study we concluded that lymphocyte changes are not significant in the

coronavirus out of 43 studies with 5204 patient samples in total over half n  24 of all included studies reported over 90 sensitivity and specificity almost a quarter n  10 of all included studies reporter 100 sensitivity and specificity lndor of each and pooled study data are high indicating overall good diagnosis accuracy subgroup analyses showed that the type of coronavirus and the publication status has no significant impact on lndor studies with smaller number of samples have significantly lower lndor than studies with larger number of samples however six out of nine studies in the small samples size subgroup reported 100 sensitivity and specificity thus the observed difference lndor between subgroup with small sample number and large sample number is likely to result from continuity correction rather than diagnostic performance of the test itself based on data from our included studies the key determinants of diagnosis accuracy is the type of assay and whether crude sample or purified rna was used for diagnosis at the time of this writing the only published meta-analysis study on the accuracy of isothermal nucleic acid test for rna virus is on rt-lamp performance for enterovirus 71 69  the meta-analysis includes 907 clinical samples from 10 studies all performed on purified rna pooled data have lndor of 674 95 cis 568-779 with no observed heterogeneity this level of performance for enterovirus detection was almost equal to our calculated lndor of rt-lamp for purified rna from covid-19 patients lndor  650 95 ci of 525-776 i 2  0 thus our reported rt-lamp performance is likely to reflect the true performance of this isothermal nucleic acid test as the performance value is generalisable across different target viruses this could serve as a reference point for assessing the performance of other diagnosis methods among rt-lamp studies on purified rna the studies by kitakawa et al thi et al and yan et al 38 45 46 are of the highest quality large number of tested samples and no quadas-2 domain with high risk of bias or concern of applicability notably these three studies reported contrasting results with respect to diagnosis performance while kitakawa et al 38 and yan et al 46 demonstrated 100 diagnostic sensitivity thi et al 45 reported only 70 sensitivity generally the sensitivity of diagnosis test decreases when concentration of viral rna in the samples decreases for example thi et al showed that rt-lamp sensitivity is at 100 when the samples have viral rna concentration equivalent to ct  0-25 the sensitivity decreases to about 30 at rna concentration ct30-35 and to sensitivity less than 6 at rna concentration  35-40 approximately a third of positive samples in thi et al study has ct  30-40 this could explain why rt-lamp in this study appear to have such a low overall sensitivity yan et al and kitakawa et al did not report the distribution of viral rna level in their tested samples thus it is possible these two studies appear to achieve 100 sensitivity simply because most of their positive samples had high viral rna level viral rna levels in samples depend on several factors including severity of the disease sample collection timing type of samples and sample handling process without such information it is difficult to determine whether the difference in observed sensitivity results from the performance of the test itself or the properties of the samples used in the test unfortunately most included studies provided no information about viral rna level in the infected samples as determined by a standard reference test eg rt-qpcr information about disease severity and sample collection timing ie days after disease onset are often missing future work  cc-by

rt-lamp lndor within 95 ci of each other fig 4a 5a  additionally reported limits of detection of these crispr diagnosis tests 73-100 copiesreaction are within the same range as that of rt-lamp 2-120 copiesreaction  table 1  given available data it cannot be concluded that crispr diagnosis can outperform rt-lamp at least for purified rna samples existing crispr diagnosis also requires rt-lamp or other isothermal techniques to pre-amplify nucleic acid targets before crispr detection the use of cas12 or cas13 enzyme adds to the cost of crispr diagnosis test kit making it likely to be more expensive than rt-lamp future study should directly compare and highlight unique strength of crispr diagnosis relative other isothermal techniques for example its ability for multiplex detection and identifying single base difference in targeted genomes 70 71 72  our systematic review and meta-analysis also included one study each on diagnosis accuracy of rt-iipcr rca and rt-raa using purified rna samples the two studies using rca and rt-iipcr reported perfect or near perfect sensitivity and specificity 65 67  however the number of tested samples in these studies was too small to draw conclusion about their diagnosis performance relative to other pocts on the contrary the study using rt-raa had almost a thousand tested samples the largest number among all 43 studies in our systematic review 68  this study was peer-reviewed and has only one high risk of bias in reference standard domain as different standard tests were applied to different patient groups still these reference standard tests were merely different variants of rt-qpcr this study reported up to 98 sensitivity and specificity and had the narrowest 95 ci among all included studies subgroup analysis implies that rt-raa accuracy is significantly higher than that of rt-lamp on purified samples ci 95 confident interval not overlapping each other future work should directly compare this assay to other nucleic acid pocts such as rt-lamp using the same sample set in order to determine the actual difference in diagnosis performance nearly all published peer-reviewed studies 13 out of 15 studies applied diagnostic assays on viral rna purified from patient samples however rna extraction step increases assay cost and time and often requires trained personnel in order to accommodate large scale field deployable poct more recent studies aimed to develop assays that can bypass or automate this purification step our meta-analysis showed that diagnosis accuracy of patient samples is still generally lower than that of purified rna fig 4a and 5a  all six studies that used rt-lamp on crude patient samples report sensitivity or specificity at 90 or below on the contrary the majority 14 out of 18 studies that used rt-lamp on purified rna samples reported over 90 sensitivity and specificity half of these studies reported 100 sensitivity and specificity pooled data from studies using rt-lamp on purified rna also have higher lndor than that from studies using rt-lamp on crude samples additionally studies on crude sample diagnosis with other methods including iamp rt-rpa and id now

further our r estimates could be further improved using additional data collected by field investigations second we cannot rule out the possibility that some cases with contact history with the huanan

which the group profiled global gene expression in balf and pbmc specimens of covid-19 predictably we detected viral rna in all balf samples 2 patients 2 replicates each with an average abundance of 215 of the total rna in those samples which included human rna however we identified two paired-end reads in rna isolated from pbmc from only one accession 9  cc-by 40 international license it is made

sars-cov-2 rna in covid-19 pbmc crr119891  out of three patients which aligned to the sar-cov-2 genome expectedly no sars-cov-2 rna was detected in the pbmc from healthy controls 3 donors these rna traces are certainly quite rare however they confidently and specifically belong to sars-cov-2 one viral rna read translates into polyprotein pp1ab accession np828849  which is the largest protein of coronaviruses and involved in the replication and transcription of the viral genome the other viral rna translates into surface spike glycoprotein accession yp009724390  which mediates the entry of the viral into the human cells expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 hace2 ou et al 2020 walls et al 2020   although we are not rejecting the possibility of cross-contamination or barcode bleeding mitra et al 2015 kircher sawyer and meyer 2012 for detecting the viral rna in one pbmc rna-seq sample such possibility is unlikely given that control samples had zero hits to sars-cov-2 rna we are also considering the possibility of sar-cov-2 being sampled by antigen-presenting cells most likely dendritic cells or presented to t lymphocytes which are in the pbmc population one more possibility which we believe needs many more samples to consider is that sars-cov-2 may be specifically or coincidentally internalized by one of the mononuclear cell types which may suggest a mechanism for the chronicity of the sar-cov-2 infection this hypothesis requires further testing however in the light of our data it is hard to support the early reports that sars-cov-2 targets t-lymphocytes in vivo  as suggested earlier in a correspondence based on cell culture experiment with pseudotyped viruses x wang et al 2020   with more data becoming publicly available it will be possible to revisit this hypothesis and others to improve our understanding of the progression and replication of sar-cov-2 in infected individuals  cc-by 40 international license it is made available

2020 the first case of a person contracting covid-19 within the uk occurred at the end of february bbc news 2020a as the risk grew an initial set of health protection regulations were adopted to enable action to be taken by the uk government to minimise the spread of covid-19 in the population the health protection coronavirus regulations 2020 uk si 2020 no 129 at the same time the government and their scientific advisors continued to support what was described as a herd immunity approach to managing the disease this involved allowing the virus to spread naturally through the british population in order to build up population immunity conn  lewis 2020 by mid-march however the findings from pandemic modelling by experts at imperial college revealed that such an approach would soon overwhelm capacity to manage covid-19 cases within the national health service nhs indeed there were very real concerns that if the government did not take immediate mitigation measures then the uk might face more than 500000 deaths from covid-19 ferguson et al 2020 in the wake of such findings the uk government switched tack and announced a range of new lockdown measures designed to restrict peoples movements involving social distancing working from home and only undertaking essential travel leading to the cancellation of large social and sporting events doherty 2020 by the end of march both the prime minister boris johnson and the secretary of state for health and social care matt hancock were in self-imposed isolation with covid-19 symptoms as were several members of the government leadership team involved in managing the response to the pandemic proctor  weaver 2020 in order to place the lockdown measures on a legislative footing the uk government introduced the coronavirus bill into the uk parliament on 19 march 2020 uk parliament 2020a in putting forward the bill it was clear the uk government was seeking a wide range of legal powers to manage the lockdown measures as well as to address a myriad of issues that had arisen in relation to responding to the covid-19 pandemic with this in mind the decision was taken to replace the initial health protection regulations passed in february which had drawn on health protection powers available under the public health control of disease act 1984 uk public general acts 1984 c 22 instead the preferred way forward now was bespoke primary legislation it was argued that this approach would provide the uk government and the devolved administrations with greater flexibility and a wider range of regulatory options to respond to the pandemic as well as enabling the uk parliament to undertake more detailed scrutiny of the use of government powers in the round institute for government 2020 the purpose of the legislation was to respond to an emergency situation and manage the effects of the covid-19 pandemic given that it was likely to lead to a reduced workforce increased pressure on health services and death management processes in doing so the aims were to increase the health and social care workforce to ease the burden on frontline staff in health and other public bodies to contain and slow the spread of the virus and to manage the deceased in a respectful and dignified manner uk parliament 2020b in drafting the legislation the decision had also been taken that there would be a uk-wide approach save where specific measures were required in the devolved administrations following a short period of scrutiny by both houses the bill was quickly passed by the uk parliament in the face of minimal opposition the coronavirus act 2020 coronavirus act received royal assent on 25 march 2020 the act is due to expire two years from this date subject to a limited number of exceptions in contrast to other emergency legislation such as the civil contingencies act 2004 the acts parliamentary review mechanisms are more limited and spread over an extended period they involve bi-monthly government reporting in addition to the uk parliament being able to express its views at six months or vote at twelve months on whether the act should remain in force uk public general acts 2004 c 36 uk public general acts 2020 c 7 ss 89  90 health is a devolved matter to northern ireland under constitutional arrangements in the uk therefore it is ordinarily a matter for the northern ireland executive and assembly to make policy and law in the area northern ireland act 1998 uk public general acts 1998 c 47 given the need for a uk-wide approach the assembly adopted a consent motion to permit legal measures for managing the covid-19 pandemic in northern ireland to be included in the coronavirus act northern ireland assembly 2020a given the urgency of the situation there was little opportunity for the assembly to engage in detailed scrutiny of the coronavirus bill before it was passed by the uk parliament and the act came into force northern ireland assembly 2020b walker  butler 2020 once the act was in force the northern ireland government quickly moved to adopt its own health protection regulations which set out the approach to be taken to lockdown measures locally they were brought into force at 11 pm on 28 march 2020 the health protection coronavirus restrictions regulations northern ireland 2020 ni sr 2020 no 55 specific measures contained in the health protection regulations include powers to enforce the closure of schools and businesses restrictions on peoples movement without reasonable excuse and enforcement powers for the police service of northern ireland ss 51  2 these regulations are required to be reviewed by the northern ireland department of health every twenty-one days to determine whether the measures should remain in place while regular reviews continue to take place mccormack 2020a the northern ireland executive has also published its plan for exiting lockdown outlining its principled and incremental approach to easing the restrictive measures imposed through the regulations in doing so the executive reaffirmed its commitment to north-south as well as east-west co-operation in managing the pandemic northern ireland direct government services 2020 northern ireland executive 2020 the article focuses on examining the changes made to mental health and capacity laws in northern ireland through section 10 and schedules 10 and 11 of the coronavirus act emergency legislation we proceed by providing a brief overview of such laws before going on to explore the policy rationale for such changes as well as elaborating on how key aspects are likely to be operationalised in practice we also consider how these changes may potentially impact upon existing human rights protections for persons assessed as lacking mental capacity in northern ireland in undertaking this examination we acknowledge that it is necessarily at a preliminary stage given the recent implementation of such legislative changes a more detailed critical analysis of their impact and consequences can only be made following the end of the public health emergency with this caveat in mind we argue that it is important that regular parliamentary oversight is maintained in relation to the potential impact and consequences of such changes during the period they are in force this should be done in order to assess whether they remain a necessary proportionate and least restrictive response to the challenges faced in managing mental health and capacity issues in northern ireland during the covid-19 pandemic northern ireland is a devolved nation of the uk comprising six counties in the north-east of the island of ireland while the jurisdiction was formally created in 1921 its constitutional status including whether it should remain part of the uk or form part of a united ireland was one of the factors in a violent conflict commonly known as the troubles this conflict lasted for over twenty-five years in the twentieth century with its legacy continuing to resonate in northern ireland up until the present day see mcgarry  oleary 1995 mcgrattan 2010 mckittrick  mcvea 2012 during this period devolved government in northern ireland was suspended direct rule was imposed which involved the uk government assuming primary responsibility for governmental decision-making in northern ireland institute of government 2020 in 1998 a peace accord was reached  known as the good friday agreement or belfast agreement  which provided for the re-establishment of devolved power-sharing institutions the agreement was based on the principle of consent in the context of the constitutional position of northern ireland and a right to self-determination subject to the consent of the majority in northern ireland and ireland good fridaybelfast agreement 1998 due to the nature of politics in northern ireland the devolved government has collapsed on a number of occasions in the past twenty years since the peace accord which has led to periods of direct rule being re-imposed by the uk government in january 2020 it was restored again following an agreement between the main political parties nevertheless political tensions continue to persist over the border between northern ireland and ireland most recently such tensions have been exacerbated by the uks decision to leave the european union colloquially known as brexit given that the north-south border on the island of ireland has now become the sole land border between the uk and the european union indeed it is the border question which has also led to a range of difficulties in facilitating a coordinated response to the covid-19 pandemic on the island although there is now evidence of increased north-south cooperation across a range of public health measures memorandum of understanding 2020 scally 2020 there are two key pieces of legislation that are relevant to examining mental health and capacity laws in northern ireland the mental health northern ireland order 1986 mho northern ireland orders in council 1986 no 595 ni 4 and the mental capacity northern ireland act 2016 mcani acts of the northern ireland assembly 2016 2020 c 18 for present purposes we exclude consideration of the potential impact upon the criminal justice provisions of the mho and mcani the mho has been in force since 1986 and has been described as traditional mental health legislation harper davidson  mcclelland 2016 it provides for involuntary treatment of mental disorder which is defined as mental illness mental handicap and any other disorder or disability of mind mho article 31 this is based on diagnosis and risk presence of mental illness or severe mental impairment and failure to detain leading to substantial risk of serious physical harm to self or others mho articles 3  4 the mho is accompanied by a short code of practice and what is known as the gain guidelines which set out detailed information about the provision of mental health care in line with the mho guidelines on the use of the mental health northern ireland order 1986 in the early 2000s the bamford review began what would be a lengthy examination of law policy and provisions affecting people assessed with mental health needs and learning disabilities in northern ireland the review produced a number of reports including one which recommended comprehensive reform of mental health and capacity laws in northern ireland such law reform was to be grounded in a rights-based approach in which the key principles of respect and autonomy were embedded bamford review of mental health and learning disability 2007 davidson mccallion  potter 2003 following the completion of the bamford reviews work there ensued a further lengthy period of consultation and executive review before a draft proposal for legislative reform  the mental capacity bill  was eventually introduced into the northern ireland assembly in 2015 following detailed scrutiny it was eventually passed and received royal assent in 2016 since such time the northern ireland department of health has been working on a phased implementation and once the act is fully implemented the mho will be repealed the mcani is an innovative ground-breaking piece of legislation both in the uk and internationally campbell brophy davidson  obrien 2018 northern ireland has opted for a form of fusion legislation bringing together capacity and mental health law across medical specialities see dawson  szmukler 2006 what this means is that impairment of decision-making capacity and best interests are the only criteria to be used when making decisions across health and social care lynch taggart  campbell 2017 at the heart of this reform of mental health and capacity laws is a recognition of both the moral and legal importance of a persons autonomy and rights it applies in all circumstances where a persons autonomy might be compromised on health grounds it acknowledges the importance of recognising parity of esteem between mental and physical illness the aim is to treat mental and physical illness equally under the law with the objective of reducing stigma associated with separate mental health legislation notwithstanding this innovative rights-based approach to fusing mental health and capacity laws in northern ireland it has nevertheless attracted criticism on the grounds that the mcani is not fully compliant with the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities crpd un general assembly 24 january 2007 ares61106 article 1 of the crpd clarifies that the term persons with disabilities includes persons with mental and intellectual impairments the mcani has been criticised on the grounds that it does not recognise legal capacity as set out in article 12 of the crpd which affirms that persons with disabilities have the right to recognition everywhere as persons before the law the united nations committee on the rights of persons with disabilities has interpreted legal capacity under article 12 as including the capacity to be both a holder of rights and an actor under the law  which entitles a person to full protection of his or her rights by the legal system in the circumstances legal capacity and mental capacity should be viewed as distinct concepts with the latter referring to the decision-making skills of a person therefore perceived or actual deficits in mental capacity must not be used as justification for denying legal capacity united nations committee on the rights of persons with disabilities 2014 paras 1213 the approach to supporting a person assessed as lacking mental capacity in exercising their legal capacity forms part of broader academic debates about whether and to what extent compliance with the crpd is achievable under domestic law see arstein-kerslake  flynn 2016 donnelly 2016 flynn 2013 harper et al 2016 mcsherry  wilson 2015 series 2015 stavert 2018 szmukler daw  callard 2014 the first phase of the mcani implementation programme was commenced on 2 december 2019 this involved the introduction of the deprivation of liberty safeguards dols scheme through the dols regulations which was accompanied by a code of practice mental capacity deprivation of liberty no 2 regulations northern ireland 2019 ni si 2019 no 199 northern ireland department of health 2019b the dols code of practice reiterates that under the mcani mental capacity is to be presumed and the burden of proof balance of probabilities is on those seeking to assert incapacity to show otherwise and on the basis of reasonable belief taking account of the factors noted below the test for capacity is whether or not a person aged 16 years or over is unable to make a decision for themselves because of an impairment of or disturbance in the function of the mind or brain whether temporary or permanent and whatever its origin mcani s 31  2a a determination of incapacity is time and decision specific mcani s 31 and any intervention must be taken on a best interests basis mcani ss 2  7 dols code of practice chapter 7 factors to be taken into account in determining whether a person has the capacity are based on a functional assessment which includes their ability to understand use weigh and appreciate communicate and retain the information relevant or required to the process of making the decision in question see mcani s 4 dols code of practice chapter 5 the statutory principles set out in the mcani underpin the operation of the dols scheme mcani ss 1  2 in line with such principles the dols code of practice makes clear that if a person is assessed as lacking capacity to make a decision they should nevertheless be included as far as possible in any discussions about deprivation of liberty and to be able to make their views and opinions known they are entitled to know and be given all the information used in any assessments no assumptions can be made about a person and they have the right to make unwise decisions as far as is possible they must be supported to make any decision regarding their care and treatment mcani s 5 dols code of practice paras 32311 they can ask a nominated person to let people know what they would want and what would be in their best interests mcani s 69 where a person does not appoint a nominated person then one can be appointed from a default list which are prioritised in the following order carer spouse or civil partner child parent brothersister grandparent grandchild auntuncle niecenephew provided they are aged 16 years or over mcani s 73 dols code of practice para 921 if a person is to be deprived of their liberty then all necessary legal safeguards should be put in place and they have the right to challenge new and existing authorisations made under the dols scheme to what is known as the review tribunal during the first phase of implementing the mcani the review tribunal can only consider a specified range of authorisations made under the dols scheme such as a trust panel authorisation interim authorisation trust panel extension authorisation short-term detention authorisation or an extension authorisation dols code of practice paras 142155 the dols code of practice also makes clear that an application for a dols authorisation is only required when a person is deprived of their liberty as opposed to having their freedom restricted in short the deprivation of liberty has to be necessary to protect a person from harm be proportionate and be in their best interests the criteria for determining whether there has been a deprivation of liberty is whether the person in question is under continuous supervision and control and whether they are free to leave this draws on the acid test set out by baroness hale in cheshire west p by his litigation friend the official solicitor v cheshire west and chester council p and q by their litigation friend the official solicitor v surrey county council 2014 uksc 19 paras 48 59 dols code of practice paras 26218 in the event that a person is deemed to have met the criteria then a suitable authorisation must be sought under the dols scheme with the exception of needing to receive life-saving medical treatment deprivation of liberty of a person lacking capacity for medical treatment in a hospital setting requires a short-term detention authorisation this form of authorisation can be put in place by two specified healthcare professionals for fourteen days which can be extended for a further fourteen days based on specified criteria dols code of practice paras 123 1291212 219222 mcani schedule 2 outside the hospital setting a dols application can be authorised by a suitably constituted trust panel whether the person is based at a care or nursing home day centre respite facility any other health or social care setting or in a private home dols code of practice para 721 the panel must make a decision about a dols authorisation within seven working days after the trust has received the application dols code of practice para 113 the use of the term trust panel in this context refers to the fact that the entity charged with making dols authorisations is situated within one of the five trusts which manage hospitals and other health and social care facilities in northern ireland the trusts form part of the northern ireland health service known as health and social care which is equivalent to the national health service in england wales and scotland health and social care online 2020 to be properly constituted under the dols scheme the panel must consist of members appointed by the relevant trust comprising three suitably qualified persons one medical practitioner one approved social worker and one other healthcare professional who could be a registered nurse or midwife registered dentist occupational therapist speech and language therapist practitioner psychologist in addition panel members must have undertaken the requisite training in making formal assessments of capacity under the mcani as well as specific training for sitting on these panels dols regulations reg 2 dols code of practice paras 144145 we recognise that the dols scheme which operates in england and wales has attracted significant criticism to date bartlett 2014 fanning 2016 law commission 2017 uk parliament 2018 and will shortly be replaced with the liberty protection safeguards scheme see mental capacity amendment act 2019 uk public general acts 2019 c 18 series 2020 however it is too soon to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness or otherwise of the operation of the northern ireland dols scheme given it has only been operational since early december 2019 besides being premature any such assessment is now further complicated by the introduction of changes to the scheme brought about by the emergency legislation to address the covid-19 pandemic key aspects of the dols scheme which are impacted by such changes include which suitably qualified persons can now making formal assessments of capacity the role and functions of the nominated person how applications are now to be made for dols authorisations the composition and methods of decision-making by trust panels making dols authorisations and the appeal mechanisms to the review tribunal we now turn to consider these changes in more detail in the following sections of the article the coronavirus act 2020 introduces changes to both the mho and the mcani following the passing of the emergency legislation these changes were brought into force by statutory instrument on 30 march and 2 april 2020 respectively see mental health northern ireland amendment order 2020 ni si 2020 no 46 mental capacity deprivation of liberty amendment regulations northern ireland 2020 ni si 2020 no 57 these statutory changes were accompanied by two emergency codes of practice which provide more detailed guidance as to how these changes will work in practice both offer a similar rationale for the changes first there is a need to address the consequences arising from a likely reduced workforce of health and social care professionals as a result of illness suffered due to the covid-19 pandemic second the changes are designed to mitigate this impact third pursuing mitigation in this way will ensure that persons can still be either compulsorily admitted and detained under the mho or be legally deprived of their liberty while still ensuring safeguards are in place under the mcani northern ireland department of health 2020a northern ireland department of health 2020b specific reference is made to the use of detention powers in both emergency codes of practice although recognising that the covid-19 pandemic has necessitated rapid health emergency planning it is made clear that the use of such powers should not be seen prima facie as operating pursuant to the mhos emergency provisions without further justification in the case of detention powers under the mho it is also emphasised that due processes and proper safeguards must be adhered to mho emergency code of practice para 6 similarly in the case of the mcani reference is made to the fact that even where a person may have tested positive for covid-19 they cannot be detained deprived of liberty or secluded without proper processes and legal support the code also emphasises in bold type that if a person who lacks capacity is isolated and therefore prevented from leaving it is likely that the person is deprived of liberty this necessitates adherence to legal processes including the dols scheme mcani emergency code of practice para 9 given such emphasis it is surprising that no further detail is provided as to what is meant by the need to adhere to legal processes apart from the dols scheme while it is our view that the use of existing mental health and capacity law is much more appropriate in the case of persons assessed as lacking capacity with covid-19 who either needs medical treatment or who may pose a risk of transmitting covid-19 infection to others it is important to keep in mind that there is a range of legal processes that could potentially be used in the context of a public health emergency for example this could include the use of the new health protection powers in part 1a of the public health northern ireland act 1967 acts of northern ireland parliament chapter 36 such powers were imported into the 1967 act through s 48 schedule 18 of the coronavirus act 2020 and they provided the legal basis for the adoption of the northern ireland health protection regulations in late march 2020 which imposed lockdown measures locally in response to the covid-19 pandemic the new part 1a provisions mirror many of the general health protection powers contained in part 2a of the public health control of disease act 1984 which applies in england and wales but they are focused on addressing the covid-19 pandemic with this in mind the term infection or contamination is defined in part 1a as an infection or contamination with coronavirus which presents or could present significant harm to human health in circumstances where coronavirus means severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 s 25a2 regulations which would seek to enable these special restrictions or requirements would need to be proportionate and in response to an imminent threat to public health which could include making provision for persons with coronavirus to be detained quarantined or otherwise kept in isolation for the protection of the public health in specified circumstances s 25d it is also emphasised in both emergency codes of practice that the usual legal processes which apply in the case of use of the mho and the mcani should continue to be used in the first instance making use of the emergency provisions should be seen as a matter of last resort in circumstances where there is no other option eg mcani emergency code of practice para 6 to the authors knowledge there has been little use made of these provisions to date we do recognise that there are or will be circumstances where the use of the emergency provisions might be justified particularly where for example a significant covid-19 outbreak occurs in a closed mental health unit resulting in a substantial depletion of the available psychiatric care workforce campbell  grierson 2020 it is nevertheless important that where the use of the provisions is contemplated or take effect then the emergency codes exhortation that a persons human rights should remain at the forefront of decision making during this emergency period should be adhered to with specific reference to the protections provided by article 2 right to life article 3 prohibition against inhuman and degrading treatment article 5 the right to liberty and security and article 8 the right to respect for private and family life as enshrined in the european convention on human rights echr see mho emergency code of practice para 2 mcani emergency code of practice paras 1 8 in the context of healthcare staff numbers being low due to sickness or isolation the emergency provisions allow for an approved social worker who makes the application for involuntary admission to hospital to be replaced by a relevant social worker if the former is not available mho emergency code of practice para 22 in addition a responsible medical officer who provides the medical reports for continued detention for assessment and then treatment can also be replaced by a relevant medical practitioner in circumstances where it would be impractical to wait for the former to be available mho emergency code of practice para 38 while the mho emergency code of practice provides minimum experience requirements for both the relevant social worker and the relevant medical practitioner both healthcare professionals are stepping into roles they might not have relevant experience of given the legal requirements in this regard set out in the mho in addition there is no mention within the mho emergency code of the need for specialised training to perform this role this presents a number of potential risks for example a prescribed form authorising the detention may be incorrectly completed due to inexperience or a replacement for the approved social worker andor responsible medical officer may misinterpret the law or act in error when applying the criteria for detention both events would have obvious implications for whether detention powers are being used appropriately in accordance with the law as well as giving rise to a potential interference of a patients human rights specifically under articles 3 5 and 8 of the echr the time limits within the mho provide important safeguards for the patient in relation to the detention powers exercised being proportionate and the least restrictive option mho emergency code of practice paras 18 526 the mho provides precise periods of time for each stage of compulsory admission to be reviewed and reported on by the responsible medical officer who reviews detention in the form of providing reports through completion of further prescribed forms and ultimately the review tribunal mho art 71 if these time limits are breached then detention under the mho would ordinarily lapse the mho emergency code of practice extends a number of these time limits as an example the initial period of detention under the mho is for assessment and prior to the changes introduced via the emergency provisions can last for a period of fourteen days in total from the date of admission mho arts 97 8 during this period the patient can appeal their detention to the review tribunal this assessment period has now been extended to twenty-eight days mho emergency code of practice para 34 by extending the assessment time limit there could be a delay to an appeal before the review tribunal and the implication is that a patient could be detained for longer than is necessary this again raises the prospect of a potential interference of the patients human rights on the grounds noted previously it also begs the question as to whether these time extensions are actually required in the present circumstances as there are already modifications addressing potential sickness in the workforce which allow others to step into the roles usually performed by the approved social worker and responsible medical officer it is not clear why any additional measures are required in order to ensure that the original statutory time limits are met individual health and social care trusts must monitor the use of emergency provisions on an individual basis and prepare a report on whether or not their use was appropriate in a given set of circumstances this report is to be forwarded to the northern ireland department of health within fifty-six days following the end of the emergency period with temporary prescribed forms having been created to assist in this monitoring exercise mho emergency code of practice para 21 annex a there is also a requirement to inform the patient and the nearest relative that the emergency modifications are being used mho art 32 mho emergency code of practice paras 1921 while disclosure about the use of the provisions is to be welcomed in the interests of transparency the question is whether this retrospective monitoring will be sufficiently robust or even appropriate in terms of dealing with an issue of this magnitude namely the compulsory detention and treatment of a patient while there are few details provided as to how trusts will monitor the use of the emergency provisions in practice or justify their use it will inevitably require additional work and perhaps more staff this can hardly be the desired outcome given the objective in introducing such provisions was in large part to mitigate the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on an already depleted workforce during the covid-19 pandemic the approach taken by uk courts and tribunals has been to minimise risk to judges tribunal members legal representatives and the parties courts and tribunals judiciary 2020a northern ireland department of justice 2020 northern ireland lord chief justices office 2020 in practice this has resulted in a shift to remote hearings where possible eg re a children remote hearings 2020 ewca civ 583 re b children remote hearing interim care order 2020 ewca civ 584 the review tribunal is an independent judicial body which hears and determines applications appealing decisions made under the mho and the mcani on specified grounds as a result of the covid-19 pandemic the tribunal has also been conducting remote hearings predominantly by telephone in the context of mental health the obvious issue is whether or not this is the appropriate environment for an acutely ill patient to challenge their detention although there has been positive support overall on the part of the uk judiciary and the legal profession for the shift towards remote hearings in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic harrison 2020 a report on a recent hearing before the court of protection which deals inter alia with dols authorisations under mental capacity legislation in england and wales called into question whether it was an equally positive experience for applicants or their family members kitzinger 2020 ruck keene 2020 clearly more empirical research is needed which examines the experiences of those challenging detention or deprivation of liberty under uk mental health and capacity laws including in northern ireland courts and tribunals judiciary 2020b this would enable a more nuanced examination of the experiences of applicants and supporting family membersfriends as well as other parties to remote hearings including whether the right to a fair trial under article 6 of the echr is engaged under the dols regulations an application for a dols authorisation to a trust panel must contain a medical report dols regulations reg 11 while this requirement remains the mcani emergency code of practice goes on to state there may be circumstances where it is deemed that a deprivation of liberty is necessary and not putting one in place would cause an unacceptable risk of harm to p the person if it is not reasonably possible to carry out a medical examination d the doctor can rely on the emergency provision in the absence of the additional safeguard of trust panel authorisation mcani emergency code of practice para 17 the above statement presumably refers to section 56 of the mcani which sets out what constitutes an emergency this situation will arise if at the time when the doctor making the report determines what would be in the persons best interests that person a knows that the safeguard in that section is not met but reasonably believes that to delay the report until that safeguard is met would involve an unacceptable risk of harm to the person or b does not know whether the safeguard is met but reasonably believes that to delay the report until it is established whether the safeguard is met would involve an unacceptable risk of harm to the person while this does not strictly represent a change to the existing law its inclusion in the mcani emergency code of practice has the potential to be over relied upon during the covid-19 pandemic as it would lessen the burden on an already under-pressure workforce this over reliance could in turn lead to a reduction in confidence in the ability of the mcani and the dols scheme to provide safeguards and protect persons from arbitrary decision-making in line with article 5 of the echr notwithstanding claims to the contrary in the emergency code even prior to the emergence of the covid-19 pandemic the implementation of the dols scheme has required a substantial change in working culture for many healthcare professionals in northern ireland indeed it was recognised that training was needed to understand the nature scope and practice of the new scheme training became a legal requirement for a range of healthcare professionals who would be working in the area dols regulations reg 23 as noted previously the dols regulations provide that only suitably qualified persons are to conduct formal assessments of capacity see reg 22 however one of the changes set out in the mcani emergency code of practice is the removal of the need for the suitably qualified person making formal assessments of capacity or participating in trust panels to have relevant training and experience in capacity mcani emergency code of practice para 47 this dispensing of training and the likelihood of minimal if any practical experience in working with the dols scheme on the part of healthcare professionals who may now be called upon to provide formal capacity assessments under the emergency provisions raises the potential for incorrect interpretation and application of the dols regulations and the mcani more generally the composition of trust panels which determine dols authorisations has now been changed under the emergency provisions as noted previously the panels are usually constituted under the dols scheme to include one medical practitioner one approved social worker and one other suitably qualified person dols regulations reg 411b the emergency provisions dispense with the requirement for a medical practitioner and an approved social worker instead allowing for any three suitably qualified persons mcani emergency code of practice para 52 bearing in mind the infancy of the dols scheme it is only the medical practitioner and the approved social worker out of the suitably qualified persons who will have had sufficient professional experience in dealing with mental health and capacity laws prior to the dols scheme coming into force with the removal of the requirement for specialised training under the emergency provisions a trust panel could conceivably be composed of three healthcare professionals from disciplines that are neither sufficiently experienced nor trained in assessing capacity under the mcani particularly with regard to what constitutes deprivation of liberty under the dols scheme the absence of experience and training raises the potential for incorrect application of the dols regulations depending on an individuals circumstances this could also raise concerns about a potential infringement of their human rights under article 5 as well as articles 2 3 and 8 of the echr as with the mho emergency code of practice there is also a requirement for individual trusts to monitor the use of the mcani emergency code of practice and to report to the northern ireland department of health no later than three months following the end of the period of emergency mcani emergency code of practice para 24 as noted previously concerns about exactly how this monitoring will take place in the case of the mho emergency code of practice are also mirrored with respect to the mcani emergency code since 2 december 2019 the review tribunal has also been empowered to review dols authorisations and applications for the appointment or removal of nominated persons under the mcani as noted previously the tribunal is currently conducting remote hearings and there are similar concerns about how such hearings will work in the context of considering applications for dols authorisations arguably matters coming before the tribunal during the covid-19 pandemic might be more serious than has been the case to date particularly where existing safeguards in relation to such applications have been relaxed under the mcani emergency code of practice this begs the question as to whether remote hearings will always be appropriate in the circumstances while we have considered how the dols scheme applies in the context of the hospital setting during the covid-19 pandemic how might this apply in the case of dols authorisations outside such setting such as for residents in nursing and residential care homes it is a particularly pressing question at the current time given evidence that care homes across the uk have become hotspots for the spread of covid-19 booth 2020 coker 2020 this has proved to be particularly problematic in the northern ireland context with well over half of all covid-19 deaths in the first wave of the pandemic occurring in such settings mccormack 2020b in relation to the risk posed by covid-19 in northern ireland care homes we focus solely on dols authorisation for present purposes rather than any other potential legal issues that might arise in relation to potential civil or criminal liability or non-compliance with quality assurance requirements rqia northern ireland 2020 erwin 2020 in focusing on this particular issue it would be important to take account of both patients lacking capacity who have been discharged from a hospital to what is known as a step-down facility such as a care home and those persons lacking capacity who are already resident in such facilities in the first case the initial rationale for the hospital discharge may have been that the person was likely to be at much less risk of contracting covid-19 in addition to the fact that the discharge was likely to create additional bed capacity for those suffering from covid-19 who require hospital admission propper stoye  zaranko 2020 whilst an inpatient the person would most likely to have been subject to a dols authorisation on the basis of a best interests assessment that they did not have capacity to recognise their current care needs however in the event of a transfer to a care home there would be an urgent need to revisit the dols authorisation for that person in order to establish whether suitable safeguards were in place including those addressing the risk of covid-19 infection in relation to persons lacking capacity already resident in northern ireland care homes many are elderly which is a recognised high-risk group for contracting covid-19 as discussed previously the relative infancy of the dols scheme means that it may be the case that some such residents do not as yet have the relevant dols authorisation in place where this is the case it could lead to a prima facie assertion that care homes would be in breach of the mcani and the dols regulations however care homes could seek to rely upon mcani emergency provisions providing protection from liability even if additional safeguards have not been met in the particular circumstances this would be on the grounds that all reasonable steps had been taken to put such safeguards in place persons in charge of care homes where the person has been deprived of their liberty would need to be able to establish that they have a reasonable belief that the person lacks capacity that it is in their best interests to deprive them of their liberty and that the prevention of serious harm condition has been met mcani ss 911 6567 dols code of practice 2019 chapters 4 7 paras 717720 10 where this has been satisfied then the deprivation of liberty could be treated as authorised even if this had not as yet been formally authorised by a trust panel although it would be expected that an application for dols application would be made as soon as possible as highlighted previously it would be important to reach this decision on a case-by-case basis involving an individual residents circumstances rather than those in charge of care homes using this as a general approach for not putting safeguards in place to manage the risk posed to residents from covid-19 northern ireland department of health 2020c given the exponential rise in infections and deaths from covid-19 of residents in care homes in northern ireland a more pressing question is whether the barring of visits by family members andor their continued residence in such facilities represents a potential infringement of their human rights under articles 2 3 5 and 8 of the echr in terms of family visits a recent judgment by the court of protection england  wales found there was no interference in an elderly residents rights under articles 5 and 8 in light of the refusal on the part of the care home to reinstate in-person family visits and to instead only permit indirect contact given the risk posed by covid-19 the court found that this approach represented a balanced and proportionate way forward in the circumstances bp v surrey county council  anor 2020 ewcop 17 at 36 per hayden j in another case an application was made alleging interference with articles 5 and 8 arising from a care homes refusal to allow an elderly terminally ill resident who lacked capacity to leave the facility in order to be cared for at her daughters home in this case the court of protection decided that the resident should be able to live with her family on the basis of a best interests assessment under s 4 of the mental capacity act 2005 uk public general acts 2005 c 9 the court also found that the refusal on the part of the care home to allow the resident to leave the facility represented a disproportionate interference with her article 8 rights in handing down judgment justice lieven was at pains to make clear that no arguments had been put to the court that the resident should not be allowed to leave the care home because of the risk posed by covid-19 or that the public interest in not allowing her to leave the home outweighed her best interests or article 8 rights ve v ao by her litigation friend the official solicitor the royal borough of greenwich and south east london ccg 2020 ewcop 23 at 3442 per lieven j both cases were decided in the absence of covid-19 testing being available to residents in the care homes in question at the time so the court of protection was unable to reach a conclusion as the extent of the risk posed to the residents as well as to those caring for them notwithstanding a call by the northern ireland deputy first minister for universal testing to be instituted in care homes in early may it appears that it will take until the end of june 2020 for this to be completed bbc news 2020b bbc news 2020c this stands in stark contrast to the position in ireland for example where all such testing had been completed by may 2020 mcmahon 2020 as highlighted previously the reported death rate in care homes has been an escalating problem which suggests that residents in such facilities might bear the brunt of the first wave of the covid-19 epidemic in northern ireland without further pro-active intervention it raises serious concerns about the extent to which public authorities per s 6 human rights act 1998 with responsibility for northern ireland care homes have taken appropriate preventative measures to protect residents from the deadly risk posed by covid-19 pursuant to the right to life under article 2 of the echr during the first wave of the covid-19 pandemic in northern ireland hundreds of people have died from the disease with residents in care homes being disproportionately represented in the overall death toll it is to be hoped that the combination of an expanded covid-19 community testing programme and the implementation of a contact tracing strategy will now result in a better understanding of the nature and extent of the spread of the disease in northern ireland northern ireland department of health 2020a this will enable a more pro-active approach to be taken to controlling the spread of covid-19 in the community as well as anticipating subsequent waves in the future as noted previously the northern ireland executive has also now published its strategy for easing lockdown measures as well as its coronavirus recovery plan setting out the guidelines that will inform its approach notwithstanding such plan the need for caution remains given persisting uncertainty about the ongoing risk posed by covid-19 to the northern ireland population while an effective vaccine to inoculate the population against the virus would bring more certainty to the situation it is unlikely that this will be forthcoming in the short to medium term thompson 2020 in the circumstances the changes made to northern ireland mental health and capacity laws through emergency legislation look set to stay in place for the foreseeable future and up to a maximum of two years with the length of time these changes are likely be in place there is always a danger of mission creep whereby what was initially viewed as a temporary measure in a time of public health emergency becomes a normalised part of everyday practice in the field of mental health this should be resisted as what they represent is a deviation from accepted legislative parameters involving matters such as involuntary treatment and detention and deprivation of liberty for persons assessed as lacking capacity such parameters were agreed following extensive stakeholder consultation as well as detailed executive and parliamentary reviews in the lead up to the adoption of the mcani in 2016 much of the legislative focus in responding to the first wave of the covid-19 pandemic in northern ireland has been on addressing concerns about health and social care workforce shortages and resources as well as meeting hospital surge capacity however it is important that action taken by key decision-makers as a result of changes made under emergency legislation constitute a necessary proportionate and least restrictive response in the circumstances in this regard the northern ireland assembly as well as its specialist committees the committee for health and the ad hoc committee on the covid-19 response have an important role to play the mcani is in the early stages of implementation with the majority of the provisions yet to come into force it will therefore be some time before the long-nurtured vision of an innovative internationally leading piece of legislation which fuses both capacity and mental health law across all medical specialities in health and social care is fully operational with the world watching it is important that political leaders in northern ireland provide sufficient financial support and resources to allow for the realisation of this vision this is in addition to ensuring that the changes made to mental health and capacity laws through emergency legislation to address the covid-19 pandemic are only in place for as long as is absolutely necessary and that adequate human rights protections remain in place during this period for those assessed as lacking capacity in northern ireland

alarmist people around maybe that is why sometimes even the most serious warnings may not be heard by the authorities on time the first patients may be lost without a proper diagnosis when everybody realizes there may be a big problem in the horizon sometimes it is too late that is why it is very important to monitor contagious diseases and follow the warnings and releases of national and international disease control centers and other related organizations but what happens if they are also late in terms of covid-19 the first cases were reported from wuhan on the last day of 2019 people were celebrating new year all over the world first the new disease attracts attention of the scientists medical world then media and hall world the number of the cases increased dramatically

modern world had different tools to limit the sars-cov-2 outbreak modern laboratories were ready to investigate the new virus produce new diagnostic tools modern hospitals were ready to accept patients national and international authorities were communicating with each other technology was on our side so the 2020 pandemic could be controlled easily more than ever but is that what was

association between repeat infections and symptom severity 248 instead it provides evidence of possible genetic determinants of innate immune response as 249 individuals asymptomatic during first infection did not experience symptoms during subsequent 250 infections and members of the same families reported similar symptom severity we recognize 251 that the self-reporting of symptoms is an important limitation in this analysis and that parents 252 reported symptoms for their dependents which possibly introduced bias moreover the majority 253 of the repeated coronavirus infections were

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 3  sars-cov-2 causes coronavirus disease coronaviruses predominantly cause respiratory tract infections in humans 1  specifically the main symptoms of covid-19 have been reported as fever cough and shortness of breath 5  with a less abrupt onset of symptoms compared to sars 6 7  data are still emerging regarding the epidemiology of covid-19 though initial reports estimate a transmission rate basic reproduction number r0 of 22 8 and a case fatality rate that increases among older adults 9  given the current pandemic there is an urgent need to identify effective safe treatments for covid-19 two such proposed treatments are chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which are well-established medications predominantly used to treat malaria lupus and rheumatoid arthritis in vitro studies have shown that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are effective at inhibiting sars-cov-2 infection with the latter appearing to have more potent antiviral activity 10 11  thus repositioning of these drugs as antiviral therapies for covid-19 is of global interest however clinical data are limited and inconclusive currently there are multiple ongoing clinical trials for use of these treatments in covid-19 while the us food and drug administration fda has issued an emergency use authorization eua for oral formulations of chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate for patients hospitalised with covid- 19 12  to date whilst there have been many publications which have described the main effectiveness and safety concerns with these

significant risk of cardiac arrhythmias 21  short term use as expected for the treatment of covid-19 is likely to pose a lower risk of cardiac toxicity nevertheless the risk cannot be overlooked as patients are expected to be on higher doses possibly concomitantly taking other qt prolonging agents in addition to having a potentially elevated risk due to the disease itself one of the most serious toxic effects of hydroxychloroquine chloroquine are ocular side effects notably retinopathy 22 23 24 25 26  although the risk for hydroxychloroquine is considered to be lower 27  both duration of use and weight-based dosing dose per kg are important parameters for the risk of developing retinopathy 26  the risk of retinal damage over a short time period may be negligible even with high doses 25  however given the seriousness of the outcome we have identified this as a key risk in the benefit-risk framework in addition whilst the most robust evidence for safety concerns associated with

the benefit of virological clearance three studies with very small sample sizes were identified these studies examined virological clearance at different time points as their primary outcome meaning results from these studies could not be pooled only one study revealed a significant risk difference between hydroxychloroquine and the comparator group standard of care though given the small sample size and biases in the study design this should be interpreted with caution for the risk of abnormal lfts only one studied was identified with a small sample size no significant risk difference between hydroxychloroquine and the comparator group standard of care whilst there is a paucity of comparative data from the literature search at this stage we identified a number of reports in

instead all available comparative data for key benefits and risks are presented in a summary table further data from clinical trials and observational studies are required in order to determine whether the benefit-risk profile of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in treating covid-19 is favourable an important point for discussion regardless of the benefits and risks of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for covid-19 treatment is the availability of these medicines inadequate  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

guaranteed for those using these treatments for licensed indications or covid-19 this must be taken into consideration in addition to the benefit-risk assessment since there can be no benefit from a medication which is unobtainable sample sizes for each outcome were limited to those available in the original studies and may not have adequate power to detect differences in risk between groups especially where the outcomes examined were not the primary outcome of interest the benefit-risk assessment is limited by the availability of data in the published literature however this assessment can be subsequently updated once further data from clinical trials are available in addition given the public health urgency of the covid-19 pandemic it is important to provide a systematic assessment of the benefits and risks of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine treatments with evidence available to date and create a framework which can be used to rapidly update the assessment when further data are available data quality is not reflected in this benefit-risk assessment though all data included were extracted from peer-reviewed manuscripts of note a statement was issued by the international society of antimicrobial chemotherapy 32 regarding the gautret et al paper published in the international journal of antimicrobial agents 18  the paper was not considered to meet the societys expected standards and though it was peer-reviewed the editor-in-chief was not involved in this process 32  confirmation of causality was not a requirement for inclusion of data in the brat assessment patients may have been on other concomitant medications or had other medical conditions at the time of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment finally we considered hospitalisation of patients to reflect severe covid-19 but we acknowledge that severity of disease may vary regardless of hospitalisation overall no conclusion can be made on the benefit-risk profile of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 compared to standard of care placebo or other treatments at this time whilst the availability of comparative data are limited the current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks as further data from clinical trials and real world use on these benefits and risks becomes available this can be incorporated into the framework for an ongoing

of the world cheikh faye cheikh wade tidiane ibrahima demba dione  humanity has experienced outbreaks for millennia from epidemics limited to pandemics that have claimed many victims and changed the course of civilizations the advent of vaccines has eradicated some of the serious pathogens and reduced many others however pandemics are still part of our modern world as we continue to have pandemics as devastating as hiv and as alarming as severe acute respiratory syndrome ebola and the middle east respiratory syndrome the covid-19 epidemic with 0-exponential contamination curves reaching 3 million confirmed cases should not have come as a surprise nor should it have been the last pandemic in the world in this article we try to summarize the lost opportunities as well as the lessons learned hoping that we can do better in the future the objective of this study is to relate the situation of covid-19 in african countries with those of the countries most affected by the pandemic it also allows us to verify how according to the observed situation the african ecosystem seems to be much more resilient compared to that of other continents where the number of deaths is in the thousands to verify this the diagnosed morbidity and mortality reported for different states of the world are compared to the ages of life and the average annual temperature of these states the results show that the less dramatic balance of the african continent compared to other continents is partly linked to the relatively high temperatures on the continent but also to the relatively young character of its population the world is more globalized and more vulnerable connectivity has dissolved the boundaries between countries transcending the barriers of distance while the disease is believed to have started in one city in china it has spread to all continents despite administrative boundaries the situation is very different from the 1918 influenza pandemic known as the spanish flu where travel and urbanization were much less pronounced than for use under a cc0 license  humanity has experienced outbreaks for millennia from epidemics limited to universal pandemics that have claimed many victims and changed the course of civilizations the advent of vaccines has eradicated some of the serious human pathogens and mitigated many others however pandemics are still part of our modern world as we continue to have pandemics as devastating as hiv and as alarming as severe acute respiratory syndrome ebola and middle east respiratory syndrome saqr and wasson 2020  the covid-19 epidemic with exponential curves reaching 3 million confirmed cases should not have come as a surprise however we seemed to ignore the past peeri et al 2020 morse 2007  unfortunately covid-19 is not the last pandemic in the world and we need to learn what we missed and how to avoid failures today while border closures and travel restrictions within countries may be helpful this is much less effective than in the past pandemics require a stronger who with sufficient resources morse 2007  failure to manage a pandemic in one country can have repercussions for the entire planet therefore pandemics require more solidarity and coordination so that fragile countries can find the resources to treat isolate and combat severe epidemics there are good signs that such efforts are being implemented for example the european union has announced eur 15 billion to combat the current pandemic in developing countries and hopefully these efforts are being consolidated to become systemic proactive and organized in other words pandemics require global efforts with a strong and resourceful world health organisation having appeared in china in the city of wuhan covid-19 initially a zoonosis has spread throughout most of the world to become a pandemic affecting all social strata and relatively all ages of life today more than 3 million people are affected and the spread of covid-19 continues to grow beyond the worlds best performing health systems however it is clear that the geography of covid-19 disease shows significant disparities between countries and age groups in terms of the level of disease and the extent of mortality this differentiated prevalence prompts reflection on possible explanations by taking into account a set of endogenous and exogenous factors geographical environmental biological socio-cultural political contexts etc  new epidemiological trends on transmission and mortality in africa and the most affected regions of the world suggest that better studies of this infection in sub-saharan africa than in other regions of the world are needed the covid-19 pandemic has lower rates of local transmission and mortality in africa the region where the virus was the last to arrive imaralu 2020  the daily statistics emanating from the high infectious property of the new strain of coronavirus covid-19 particularly its rapid worldwide transmission and the nature of the resulting deaths sweeping across countries call for concerted efforts to limit local transmission in already colonized territories there is currently no known consensual cure for covid-19 infection and there is currently no evidence to recommend specific anti-covid-19 treatment for patients confirmed to have this disease who 2020a the news of very high mortality rates in industrialized countries with stronger health systems and sophisticated infrastructure is cause for concern who 2020b facilities and equipment in industrialized countries that have so far provided assistance to developing countries are overwhelmed and not even sufficient to meet the current challenges facing these countries as of 13 april 2020 1850527 confirmed cases of covid-19-positive persons and 114245 deaths worldwide had been reported to who who 2020c  there was concern about the impact of this virus on african nations given the weakness of prevailing health systems with suboptimal infrastructural support who 2020c the recent mass exodus of health workers to europe and the americas and the continuing security threats of terrorism and violent crime make this new deadly viral threat a source of concern for governments in this subregion imaralu 2020  on the basis of the above the social and health implications of intervention measures to limit the spread of covid-19 virus should be considered and interventions carefully planned000 this study thus proposes a diachronic reading of the evolution of covid-19 with as inputs the diagnosed morbidity and mortality reported in different states of the world on the one hand and on the other hand the life expectancy and the average annual temperature of these states for a comparative study in order to draw all the specificities generated this contribution focuses on the factors explaining this disparity in a statistical sociodemographic and geographical analysis it is based on a statistical treatment of aggregated data with a plural input taking into account the specificities of the prevalence of covid-19 at the level of the countries of the world the covid-19 statistics used in this study are from the world health organization database and are as of monday april 13 2020 httpswwwweather-atlascom or httpdataunorgdataaspxdclinoelementcode3a11 figure 1  for this study 60 countries were selected 30 countries in africa these are indeed the african countries that have counted the most cases of covid-19 as of monday 13 april 2020 and 30 countries generally located in other continents 18 countries in europe 6 in america 5 in asia 1 in oceania indeed these are the 30 countries in the world that have counted the most cases of covid-19 as of monday 13 april 2020 the objective of this study is to relate the situation of covid-19 in african countries with those of the countries most affected by the pandemic it also allows us to verify in what way the african ecosystem seems according to the observed situation much more resistant compared to that of other continents where the number of deaths is counted in thousands to verify this state of affairs two key hypotheses are raised one natural this is the average annual temperature of the country and the other anthropogenic this is the structure of the population according to several scientists the less dramatic balance of the african continent compared to other continents would be linked to the relatively high temperatures on the continent but also to the relatively young character of its population

different countries under study to a principal components analysis in order to determine the affinities between these countries and to deduce the most characteristic parameters to do this a correlation matrix was used and the components were determined according to the type of rotation of the orthogonal axes the first factorial axis f1 of this representation is such that it determines the maximum inertia of the cloud and thus the variance the second axis f2 perpendicular to the first expresses the maximum remaining variance the third axis always perpendicular to the other two is defined by the maximum remaining inertia etc principal component analysis or pca is a method of reducing the number of variables allowing the geometric representation of observations and variables this reduction is only possible if the initial variables are not independent and have non-zero correlation coefficients bouroche and saporta 1980  the method was applied to 60 countries 30 in africa and 30 in other continents and 6 variables which are the covid-19 situation on monday 13 april 2020 confirmed cases and reported deaths the mean annual temperature and the structure of the proportion 0 to 14 years 15 to 64 years and over 65 years the final reconstitution of the distribution of the countries allowed us to define the factor axes or factors responsible for this distribution and consequently to highlight the affinities between the different countries and to deduce the variables linked to the covid-19 pandemic that best characterize them analysis of tables 2 and 3 and the eigenvalue curve  figure 2 shows that the first three factors represent the maximum amount of information thus the first three factor axes express 933 of the total variance with 6317 for the first

warmer a country is the less likely it is to be affected by the coronavirus pandemic and vice versa the opposing relationship between the covid-19 pandemic confirmed cases and reported deaths and the proportion of elderly andor young is apparent suggesting that generally the younger a countrys population is and therefore the fewer vulnerable people the less likely it is to be affected by the coronavirus pandemic and vice versa the number of confirmed cases is well correlated with the number of deaths weakly correlated with the ageing character of the population and negatively correlated

negative the correlation of the covid-19 pandemic variables studied with this axis whether positive or negative is weak these different characteristics of the covid-19 pandemic-related variables and of the countries studied are represented in circles and planes respectively figures 3 and 4  which illustrate the projection of the variables and the variables on factorial planes 1 and 2 each variable related to the covid-19 pandemic is associated with a point whose coordinate on a factorial axis is a measure of the correlation between that variable and the factor axis 1 or axis 2 or axis

determined by variables related to the covid-19 pandemic such as the mean annual temperature of the country and the proportion of young people in the total population which are opposed to the number of confirmed covid-19 cases the number of reported deaths and the proportion of elderly people in the total population the purpose of this representation is to provide approximate planar images of the cloud of the countries located in the plane thus the x-axis represents the thermal component mean annual temperature of the country and the anthropogenic component proportion of young people in the total population of the countries while the y-axis represents their profile in terms of number of confirmed covid-19 cases and number of reported deaths indeed a country represented on the positive part of axis 1 generally has a high temperature and a young character of its population this is the case for example of african countries in the us plan plan i-ii highlights three groups the first group is made up of the countries that have recorded the greatest number of cases of contamination and deaths eg united states spain italy germany france etc these are the countries with the highest form values a p kg  l and l in this group the united states stands out clearly from the others due to its higher number of contamination and deaths the second group is made up of european countries belgium netherlands switzerland american countries canada brazil peru asian countries israel south korea japan and oceania australia which have recorded a lower number of cases of contamination and deaths than those in the first group despite certain common characteristics such as temperature and the ageing of the population the last group is made up of african countries with the lowest number

exceptions because among these countries there are a few that are located in the tropical zone such as brazil and are in this group some african countries such as mauritius are also located in the

africa the spread of the disease appears to be progressing more slowly than elsewhere since the first cases of covid-19 infection detected in africa in mid-february as of 1 may 2020 there have been just over 26663 reported cases including those already cured and 973 deaths in africa compared with over 3175207 cases of illness and 224172 deaths worldwide who 2020d  statistically many experts still point to the african anomaly and link it to climate geography and in the most extreme cases even to a kind of biological resilience savana 2020  africa with 17 per cent of the worlds population is home to only 083 per cent of the worlds sick and 07 per cent of its dead better still with already more than 12000 recoveries it seems to be much more resistant than others to covid-19 for the time being in any case no one denies that the spread of the virus seems to be singularly slow on the continent and many reasons are cited to try to explain this marbot 2020  climate like influenza coronavirus is believed to be a disease that thrives in the cold season and does not tolerate heat drought or even heavy sun exposure the hypothesis seems to be supported by the fact that the countries most affected by the pandemic have a rather temperate climate and that most cases are concentrated either in the extreme north of the continent or in the extreme south where heat and drought are less overwhelming on the research side a british study confirms that on average fewer respiratory illnesses are found in hot and dry countries and an american report of april 24 states that the half-life of the virus ie the period required for its infectious power to be halved may increase from 18 to 6 hours if heat and humidity increase marbot 202000 researchers nevertheless remain very cautious like the director of international affairs at the pasteur institute pierre-marie girard who stresses that during in vitro experiments it was found that the coronavirus multiplied very well in heat sun heat and humidity could weaken the covid-19 virus according to a study of the american government presented thursday april 23 in washington the virus responsible for the pandemic of covid-19 weakens in a hot and humid atmosphere as well as under the rays of the sun our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that sunlight seems to have in killing the virus both on surfaces and in the air said a senior department of homeland security official bill bryan 2020 despite this health minister olivier vran was sceptical and the who believes that high temperatures do not prevent the virus from being contracted the youth of the population this is the other major explanation put forward in englishspeaking countries it has even become a slogan the virus isold and cold and africa is young and hot doctors confirm that the majority of severe cases of covid-19 involve people over 60 years of age which would be fortunate for the continent where the median age is 194 years and 60 of the population is under 25 years of age it is also pointed out that one of the hardest hit countries italy has 231 per cent of its population aged 65 and over compared to 5 per cent in africa there is almost unanimous agreement on this hypothesis but scientists qualify it by pointing out that although the african population is young it is unfortunately more affected than others by diseases such as hiv or malnutrition which can make it vulnerable finally some researchers note that in europe and the united states the elderly often live among themselves in old peoples homes which encourages the spread whereas in africa they more frequently live with their families this could protect them average and that cities such as lagos or abuja have record population densities today this position must be put into perspective because in some countries it can be observed that most cases of infection concern localities with dense populations including cities another rational explanation that is difficult to circumvent is that the african population moves less on average than that of many advanced countries and the risks of contamination are therefore necessarily lower as a reminder there is only one african airport in the list of the worlds 50 sites with the highest concentration of air traffic johannesburg the experience of epidemics as many point out this is not the first epidemic in africa and there have been far more deadly ones including the recent ebola crises healthcare workers and populations alike are therefore used to dealing with health crises lessons have been learned and good practices have been put in place certain methods of detection isolation of patients and precautions during care developed previously are duplicable in the face of the coronavirus the authorities also took the measure of the danger more quickly than others and put in place very early on the control or closure of borders distancing or containment this led dr moumouni kinda who has faced several crises with the non-governmental organization alima to say epidemics like ebola have given us experience on communication and awareness which are key points in breaking the chains of transmission of the virus for some african scientists the continent also has the advantage of practicing true solidarity when one country lacks masks or test kits neighbouring countries that are less affected are likely to provide them lesotho which does not yet have an operational laboratory has its samples tested in south africa and a network for detecting seasonal influenza used against covid-19 already brings together some 20 countries on the continent without being overly optimistic it must be said that solidarity sometimes seems to work better in africa than in certain richer regions where we see the major laboratories jealously watching over their discoveries in the hope of being able to market a treatment or a vaccine not to mention a donald trump trying to get his hands on the patents of drugs under development for the sole financial benefit of the united stateson a much more local scale it is also pointed out that the community-based functioning of many african populations makes it possible to better convey prevention messages but also to detect patients more quickly since few people are likely to be left to their own devices this hypothesis is the subject of much controversy and the who in particular is very cautious however some doctors have noted some disturbing coincidences there are reportedly fewer coronavirus contaminations in the countries most affected by malaria or tuberculosis or in those that massively vaccinate their population with bcg would contracting certain diseases be a barrier to covid-19 it will take time to prove it but many doctors believe that antimalarial treatments such as chloroquine have some effectiveness thats partly why french professor didier raoult and teams like the drug discovery and development centre h3d at the university of cape town are giving priority to testing antimalarial drugs the who is critical noting that some countries such as burkina faso nigeria and senegal where malaria is devastating are not spared by the virus more recently 20 april the malagasy president announced that his country was in possession of a vita malagasy remedy made in madagascar with preventive and curative virtues against the coronavirus covid-organics the name given to this treatment is an herbal tea made from dried artemisia leaves produced by the malagasy institute for

improved traditional remedy proposed by imra faced with the fight against the covid-19 pandemic africans have chosen to put forward the unity and solidarity of africa madagascar was able to demonstrate to the world that we africans can cooperate and help each other not only in an economic situation but above all in a health and humanitarian situation a genetic immunity what if africans were protected by their dna which for some reason yet to be determined would be more robust against the coronavirus the hypothesis is far from unanimous -at the pasteur institute pierre-marie girard doesnt really see why such a specificity would exist -and will take time to be explored the cameroonian professor christian happi specialist in genomics who divides his time between harvard university and nigeria does not completely rule out this possibility africans are exposed to many diseases so it is possible that their bodies react better youll have to look for antibodies to find out but its possible after ebola we saw that many people in nigeria had been exposed to the disease but had not developed it  another version of the virus an idea that is similar to the previous one since it now seems that several different strains of covid-9 are present on the planet up to eight distinct forms perhaps the one present in africa is less aggressive this could also explain the fact that there seem to be more asymptomatic cases there than elsewhere the hypothesis remains audacious insofar as the virus arrived through patients who contracted it elsewhere could it have mutated afterwards the who does not rule out the idea but stresses that in order to validate it it will be necessary to sequence the genome of covid-19 which is currently underway better masks when asked about the specificities that could work in favour of africa matshidisomoeti who africa director points out that the continent has a very active and competent textile industry especially in brazzaville where the organizations offices are located this particularity perhaps allows the population to benefit from more and better quality cloth masks than in some rich countries where scarcity is the rule in conclusion the scientists point out that what probably explains the low number of cases observed on the continent is above all the fact that most countries took drastic protection measures very early on and perhaps also the fact that because the disease initially affected people who were travelling rather better informed than average and living mostly in cities it was easier to identify the first cases than in other epidemics but the modesty of the figures continues to amaze as congolese biologist francine ntoumi notes in some countries on the continent people eat bats people live on top of each other in fact everything is done to make it explode but it doesnt its up to african scientists to find out why however caution should be exercised in the face of the figures because even if africa is not the continent most affected by covid-19 the damage could be considerable according to virologist denis chopera in addition the contamination rate would be underestimated due to the lack of medical facilities in the context of this sars-cov-2 virus transmission can take place during the last days of viral incubation before symptoms appear or at least are significant this is a viral strategy that has certainly allowed the virus to spread so impressively another risk of under-evaluating cases is the lack of diagnostic tests or one of the reagents that make them up given the international demand the whole world is struggling to obtain everything necessary to fight the pandemic and africa is not always in an ideal position to be able to negotiate prices compared to other regions of the world at the moment patient management is going relatively well in the hospitals that have been identified to play this role and the system is not overwhelmed although some tools such as respirators are sorely lacking at present as of may 1 2020 just under 1000 973 deaths for approximately 27 times the number of identified confirmed cases which would correspond to for use under a

spread of the novel coronavirus which is causing huge detrimental effects all around the world the ultimate goal is to slow the spread of the virus using evidence based public health interventions which includes early case recognition isolation and contact tracing this disease has grown from being a small cluster of pneumonia in china to a global pandemic causing huge loss of life therefore there is a huge need for modeling the disease and simulation of various control strategy implementation is necessary to make well informed decisions incidence is the number of new cases of coronavirus in a particular population in a period of time in general incidence is reported for each countrys population the table below gives the incidence of all the country that has been affected majorly 27 april 2020 1 the incidence per 1million calculated in the table gives a better picture than the number of cases on how the country is affected for example by comparing india and singapore india has twice the number of cases than in singapore and it does not mean that india more is affected the incidence per 1 million for singapore is more than 100 time to that of indias it is because the population of singapore is far less than india the death per 1million data also gives the information on how each country is handling the infected cases among all the countries spain is in a very bad state with a mortality rate of 1116 the united states of america has the most number of cases 12 million as of may 8th 2020 and has more than 75000 deaths the coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets from an infected person via coughs or sneezes these droplets can go into people who are nearby it spreads when people are near to each other the droplets do not hang around in the air and can not go more than six feet from the source about two meters covid-19 spreads sustainably in a community in many affected regions people are getting infected with the virus mostly without knowing where they are infected people also get infected when they come in contact with an infected surface and then touches their eyes or face symptoms for covid-19 is not constant and ranges from mild disease to severe illness symptoms usually appears 14 days after being exposed to the virus major indications of covid-19 are cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing fever chills muscle pain sore throat new loss of taste or smell 2  medical attention should be sought immediately if the following symptoms are noticed trouble breathing persistent pain or pressure in the chest new confusion or inability to arouse bluish lips or face 2  with the restricted availability of testing kits not everyone is eligible for being tested if it only causes mild illness people are asked to recover at their home itself decisions on who to be tested are made by health departments and healthcare providers by the end of april a viral test has been authorized by the us food and drug administration fda that lets people to collect a respiratory sample a swab inside of the nose at home and send it to a laboratory for analysis in most areas the collection kits were made available via healthcare workers 3   things to do to implement social distancing avoid contact with people who could be at risk avoid public places gathering and crowds avoid clinics and hospitals and avoid restaurants it is every individuals responsibility to prevent this virus from spreading and social distancing is a way collective effort in stopping the spread of this disease in case of 3 emergencies in which we can not avoid going to different places one should maintain at least a distance of 6 feet from one another contact tracing is carried out by a public health staff they get data from the patients with coronavirus to help everyone they have had contacted during the previous weeks while they were infectious the identity of the patient is not revealed for their privacy traced individuals are given information on the risk of being infected and are asked to separate themselves from other susceptible people and check for symptoms and illness they are asked to monitor their body temperature twice a day and if they have symptoms they should isolate themselves and report to a health care worker hospitalization or isolation is the process of separating the sick people from the non sick ones with a steady rise in new cases of coronavirus hospitals are working at maximum capacity and infected individuals are admitted only when they show severe symptoms or have extreme illness temporary medical clinics can be setup in areas where most infections occur can reduce the spread of the disease quarantines are used by governments to prevent the spread of the virus it is especially for individuals have no symptoms but were exposed to the sickness it is important to keep them separated from susceptible people so that they dont infect others without their knowledge quarantines are used during an outbreak or an epidemic or during a pandemic it has been debated whether masks are effective or not the truth is that it works the effect of face masks is illustrated very clearly in the paper to mask or not to mask 14  both hands should be cleaned before wearing the mask there should be no gaps between ones face and the mask never touch the mask and discard them in a closed bin quickly once they are damp masks are effective only if the hands are washed properly and the used masks are disposed properly individuals with medical conditions like heartlung disease or diabetes are at a greater risk for developing serious illness due to the disease 4  people who are most affected are ones with the following conditions asthma immunocompromised conditions severe obesity chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis and liver diseases the kermack-mckendrick model 5 is a sir epidemiological model it explains the rapid rise and fall in the number of infected cases reported in an epidemic the model assumes that there is no change in the total population size ie no vital dynamics and deaths due to disease and that there is no incubation period the model has three nonlinear odes where s is the number of susceptible people i is the number of infected people r is the number of recovered people who gained immunity  is the infection rate and  is the recovery rate the reproduction number of this model is was called as epidemiological threshold to control the disease outbreak r 0 should be less than 1 this basic model structure first published in 1927 have been developed into many complex epidemiological models over a century and currently there are thousands of published models this paper also uses the same type of modeling methodology as there are many uncertainties in hoe the corona-virus is spreading there is is a huge need for modeling the spread of the disease many papers are being published once the pandemic began the most predominant modeling papers are discussed here a mathematical model for simulating the transmission of wuhan novel coronavirus 6 is a different paper than other modeling papers being published they

compartmentconcentration of the coronavirus in the environmental reservoir at the end the model also includes the vital dynamics of the population they got a high reproduction number estimate of 425 the inclusion of the vital dynamics in the model seems to have increased the ability of the disease to spread more it is also noticeable that they have modeled three different transmission rate for every class that can be infectious the paper is concentrated towards wuhan and therefore the dynamics vary a little from other modeling papers report 9 impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions npis to reduce covid19 mortality and healthcare demand 16 this report is a very important because many policies in the uk and other countries are made based on it it discusses about various non-pharmaceutical interventions that are aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and the conclusion was that no intervention can impact the contact rate if they are implemented separately all interventions should be implemented to achieve a synergistic effect forecasting the impact of the first wave of the covid-19 1 pandemic on hospital demand and deaths for the usa and 2 european economic area countries 8  this paper used data identification tools and statistical modeling to model the disease they have predicted a huge demand for hospital and icu bed-days and their estimation of the number of deaths of around 1584737 in usa from the first wave of seems unlikely this gives us an idea on how compartmental modeling is better than statistical data analysis for epidemiological models flattening the curve before it flattens us hospital critical care capacity limits and mortality from novel coronavirus sars-cov2 cases in us counties 9  this paper concentrates on the relation between available critical care and deaths that occurs when critical care bed limits are exceeded they have devised for 4 critical care surge response scenarios their concern is that the mortality data does not include normal patients with injury who could not get treated due to suddenly overloaded healthcare system to mask or not to mask modeling the potential for face maskuse by the general public to curtail the covid-19 pandemic 14  this paper considers the importance of face mask in the prevention of the disease two models one with no mask use and the other with mask use and control strategies are created simulations are done in both these models and the results are compared it talks about inward efficiency prevention from catching the disease and outward efficiency preventing the transmission of the disease the model for the exponentially decaying infectious contact rate in this work is inspired from this paper the model is parameterized for the data for new york and washington they found that the usage of masks have a huge impact than what we already believed it to have a case study of the covid-19 coronavirus mathematical modeling of epidemic diseases 10  this

seir models for the coronavirus the paper also compares two scenarios where in one the recovered people gets lifetime immunity and the other has re-susceptible factor in the model other simulations such as short lock down and healthcare system saturation is also presented refined compartmental models asymptomatic carriers and covid-19 11  this paper talks about the various possible compartmental models which can be used as the base model for the novel coronavirus a discussion on these models modified seir splitting the exposed group into different compartments and including asymptomatic population explains them well this paper is highly illustrative with many simulations construction of compartmental models for covid-19 with quarantine lockdown and vaccine interventions 12  many epidemiological models are formed and the dynamics are analysed they also explore the transmissibility of the viral infection during different control strategies like quarantine lock-downs and vaccinations the dynamics of coronavirus is simulated for the data in ghana it is interesting to see that the basic reproduction number is less than 1 and they expect that the disease will be gone in two to four months the graphical representation of the model framework used in this work is inspired from this paper modeling the spread of covid-19 with comsol multiphysics 13  comsol multiphysics is a virtual dynamical simulation software they have used the software to simulate the compartmental models with an aim to flatten the curve they have presented a basic seir model an a seir model with

days in icu if critical care is required with 30 of hospitalised cases requiring criticalcare they obtained an overall mean duration of hospitalisation of 104days slightly shorter than the duration from hospital admission to discharge observed for covid-19 cases internationally therefore if someone needs critical care on an average they stay in the hospital for 6 days before moving to icu so  h

hospitalization of the symptomatic people to reduce the value of this whole fraction  i h needs to be increased by reducing the number of days it takes to admit individuals after symptom onset this can be implemented by increasing the number of temporary hospitalization facilities in places where the cases are increasing steadily and by increasing testing speed and availability if the maximum possible  i h 0033 is considered the second part is calculated to be 27846 the third part f cta h  a  a  with default values for the uncontrollable variables  f  a   a  and  a h  the only controllable

even when the hospitalization rates are increased and the contact tracing is implemented at full potential as presented in the report from the center of evidence based medicine 20  the percentage of people remaining asymptomatic varies drastically in many different case studies therefore analyzing uncertainty in f is important as seen in the figure 4  even 10 deviation of f from the default value

implementation of contact tracing of asymptomatic individuals is crucial and it must be maintained as high as possible the correlation between r 0 and  i h all the parameters in the equation is positive therefore r 0 and  i h also has a negative correlation when  i h is increased r 0 decreases therefore to keep the reproduction number as low as possible the hospitalization rate should be be maintained as high as possible one key difference between isolation by contact tracing and hospitalization is that when people are traced they dont even know that they could be sick but for hospitalization a patient need to have a severe illness simulations of the epidemiological model is performed in matlab the differential equations are solved using the function called ode45 which solves non-stiff differential equations using medium order method the sample code is given in the appendix for reference three control strategies social distancing contact tracing asymptotic population and increasing hospitalization rate are simulated and the parameters responsible for implementing these strategies are varied and plotted together to analyze and compare these kind of simulations helps in making decisions during a pandemic strict rules on social distancing should be implemented and followed to prevent the spread of the disease the simulation in figure 6 shows that if strategies to increase social distancing are implemented that is reducing  the number of new cases can be reduced and the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is quicker the number of estimated deaths also decreases by a significant amount in the order of 10 5  two new conditions with   1 and   05 are simulated along with previously simulated model and the plots are shown in figure 6 for comparison the time taken to reach reasonably low number of cases is reduced by at least two weeks considering that the control measures are implemented continuously the best possible time to remove social distancing without getting the disease back again would be by early august of 2020  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv

the government stuggling to handle the economy the social distancing control measure is expected to be stopped in may2020 bringing a lot of concern on how to stop the spread the plot of simulations in 7 shows what will be the situation if that happens say from 0520 the number of cases will start to rise again this eventually will force us to maintain social distancing again therefore there will be a bigger peak in the number of reported cases and it will take 5 more months to get out of this situation the number of deaths will also increase as it takes longer to stop the spread of the disease

force us to maintain social distancing again even though the peak in the number of reported cases is not increased more than what was already reached it will take more than 8-9 months to get out of this situation this shows us how important social distancing is  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 18 2020  distancing at all after 0609 the simulation is frightening as the number of cases goes upto 40 million the majority of new infections are created by infected people who is showing no symptoms they can either be totally asymptomatic or presymptomatic to reduce the spread through them contact tracing should be implemented it is done by finding about all the people who were contacted by symptomatic individuals in the last two weeks if they are tested to be positive of the disease then they are hospitalised it is also possible that the person traced was the one actually who got infected when they got in contact with this symptomatic person either way contact tracing is a way to find and isolate people who could potentially carry the virus around and causing new infections this process of isolating those who could potentially carry the disease around is not executed at full potential because not everyone who are exposed or asymptomatic can be found out by tracing previous contacts the simulations in figure 10 shows the predictions for two new values for the percentage of contact tracing implementation  ct  03 and ct  07 along with the default value of 01 there is significant reduction in the number of cases over the month of may and after it can also be seen that the number of recorded death estimate increases this is because the people who will die from this disease without knowing they had the disease are now found and tested using contact tracing and their deaths are recorded hospitals are struggling to handle the load of new cases therefore it is reasonable to increase the number of temporary facilities and in many areas as possible this will reduce the time taken from symptom onset to hospital admission and thus the hospitalization increases  i h is increased in the simulations as shown in figure 11  two new rates - i h  004 in which takes 5 days to hospitalize someone and  i h  005 in which takes 4 days to hospitalize someone are simulated it can be seen that there is a decrease in the number of reported case estimate increasing  i h did not impact the number of cumulative deaths very much as seen in the simulations below from the simulations of the three control strategies social distancing seems to have a bigger reduction in the number of diagnosed cases no single control meothod will give the best result it is only when all the control strategies are implemented the considerable change is seen a good compartmental framework of the model is designed by including all major classes of people the most unnoticed classes during the modeling process of the coronavirus are the pre-symptomatic people and those that are in need of critical care they are included in the model and the model parameters are defined using the data from various research papers official reports and interviews once the parameters are fixed model is fitted to the cumulative case and mortality data given by john hopkins university the fit gave the values for  0 to be 133877 and i0 to be 5849 which actual infected cases in the us on march 1 2020

this version posted may 18 2020  different aspects of the model have been analyzed and the effect of various control strategies have been simulated the disease free equilibrium is discussed and using the threshold analysis basic contact rate to achieve dfe is calculated to be 0215 the basic reproduction number is also calculated using the default values and is found to be 271914 which is in the range similar to what most modeling papers produce uncertainty in the fraction of the infectious people being asymptomatic and in the infectiousness of people with no symptoms are simulated and the worst case scenarios are found in the worst case the number of cases can go up to 19 million by second week of march 2020 the death toll can go up to 05 million by the end of august 2020 basic sensitivity analysis is performed and the correlation between different control parameters and the basic reproduction number are found  0 is the positively correlated and therefore should be reduced the contact tracing implementation and hospitalization rate of symptomatic people are inversely correlated and therefore they must be increased as much as possible the control strategies are simulated and the results are analyzed the social distancing strategy seem to be best possible one right now with the absence of vaccines it is better to prevent the disease if the social distancing strategy was highly implemented as shown in the simulations the number of cases during the peak can be reduced up to 11 million the duration of the implementation is also reduced by at least two weeks other simulations have also been added to discuss what will happen if the social distancing is stopped in mid of may 2020 or june 2020 and then the control measure is followed again if the distancing is stopped in may and implemented again it will take till the end of the year to recover from the disease if the distancing is stopped in june and implemented again it will take us to first few months of next year which is not a welcomed situation another simulation in which the social distancing is stopped totally on 0609 is plotted and the results are alarming the peak will drastically rise up to 40 million and the death toll will go upto 45 million fortunately this will not happen because the control measure can not be stopped abruptly as done in the simulations and the government will take actions before something like that happens another control strategy is contact tracing of asymptomatic individuals the simulations shows that the number of cases can be decreases though the change is not as predominant as it was in the case of social distancing anyhow implementing contact tracing along with social distancing will produce a good improvement of the control of the disease the last control measure simulated was the hospitalization rate increasing this rate is difficult  but even minor changes can bring a huge change the current time it takes to hospitalize someone showing symptoms is 7 days the simulation shows the effect of reducing this time to 5 and 4 days as the rate increases to 005 that is 4 days for  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

 background 12  abstract 10 11 background 12 the emergence of a novel coronavirus in wuhan china at the end of 2019 has caused 13 widespread transmission around the world as new epicentres in europe and america have arisen of 14 particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 cases 15 in africa where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe we aim to estimate the number 16 of covid-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in europe and america to each african 17 country as well as the probability of reaching 10000 infections in total by the end of march april 18 and may following viral introduction 19 20 we used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in europe and 22 america to singapore as well as flight data to estimate the number of imported cases in each 23 african country under the assumption that singapore has detected all the imported cases the 24 estimates for africa were thus conservative we then propagated the uncertainty in the imported 25 case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus until 10000 infections are reached 26 or the end of may whichever is earlier specifically 1000 simulations were run separately under 27 two scenarios where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 28 15 and 10 respectively 29 30 findings 31 we estimated morocco algeria south africa egypt tunisia and nigeria as having the largest 32 number of covid-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres based on our 1000 simulation 33 runs morocco and algerias estimated probability of reaching 10000 infections by end of march was 34 close to 100 under both scenarios in particular we identified countries with less than 100 cases in 35 total reported by end of april whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10000 infections by then 36 was higher than 50 even under the more optimistic scenario 37 38 conclusion 39 our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach or have reached 10000 infections 40 far earlier than the reported data suggest calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the 41 further spread of the epidemic 3 background 46 47 in late december 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 was identified among patients presenting 48 with viral pneumonia in wuhan city china 1  since then the number of coronavirus disease 2019 49 cases and deaths increased rapidly 23  and the city was locked down by the chinese 50 government on 23 rd january 2020 by late february there had only been limited importations from 51 and to places outside china 4  however new epicentres in europe and america emerged shortly 52 thereafter causing a second wave of importations that further accelerated the spread of the 53 pandemic 4  most countries have since then imposed travel restrictions to prevent further 54 importation of covid-19 cases 5  by 30 th april 2020 over three million cases and 200000 deaths had 55 been confirmed worldwide 4  56 a particular area of focus has been on countries in africa with worries about missed imported cases 57 and what the impact will be of widespread transmission given the other heavy health burdens in 58 these countries the first confirmed case in africa was reported in egypt on 14 th february 2020 and 59 two weeks later the virus was found in sub-saharan africa with a reported case in nigeria 4  by the 60 end of april over 37000 cases had been reported in the whole of africa with substantial variation in 61 the reported cumulative incidence across different countries 4  this inter-country heterogeneity can 62 be due to a wide range of factors such as the number of imported infections the capacity to 63 conduct tests for covid-19 surveillance efforts as well as travel and movement restrictions which 64 vary widely from country to country depending on the local context 5  the reported data alone thus 65 do not provide a clear depiction of the outbreak situation especially in countries with very limited 66 surveillance capacities and additional studies are needed to narrow the knowledge gap between the 67 reported data and the real disease burdens 68 previous work has estimated the risk of importation from china at the early stage of the pandemic 6  69 assessed each african countrys capacity to respond to outbreaks 6  systematically collated 70 information on the importation events reported by the sub-saharan countries 7  and projected the 71 spread of the epidemic seeded by the early cases represented in the world health organization 72 situation reports 8  it is still unclear how many infections may have been introduced to africa from 73 the new epicentres in europe and america although the reported case data do suggest that the size 74 of this second wave of importations has been much larger than the first wave of importations from 75 china 7  in this study we aim to estimate the number of covid-19 cases imported from the major 76 epicentres in europe and america and the magnitude of onward spread in each african country 77 this method is insensitive to the different testing and reporting systems that are in place in different 78 countries 79  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity

due to the increase in the number of returning singaporean 144 students studying overseas 15  this change in flight patterns however may not be applicable to all 145 african countries therefore to be even more conservative we also derived the imported case count 146 estimates excluding united kingdom and united states from the 12 epicentre countries previously 147 considered the resulting

imported from the 12 new epicentres in europe and america table 1  176 and figure 1  all of these countries had their lower bound estimate of the imported case count 177 exceeding 100 table 1  by contrast nine countries eg lesotho eswatini and south sudan were 178 found to have a very low risk of importation with the upper bound estimate of the imported case 179 count below 10 table 1  in a more conservative scenario where united kingdom and united states 180 were excluded from the list of epicentre countries the estimated number of imported cases did not 181 change drastically for most countries albeit with some exceptions such as kenya whose estimate 182 decreased from 97 95 ci 75-120 to 27 95 ci 16-41  table 1  183 based on our 1000 simulations of the onward sars-cov-2 spread both morocco and algerias 184 estimated probability of reaching 10000 infections by end of march was close to 100 under both 185 scenarios that we considered figures 2a 2d  whilst the reported total number of cases in each 186 country by end of march was 500  figure 2g  under the assumption that stay-at-home order 187 reduces the reproduction number to 15 we found four african countries where the estimated 188 probability of reaching 10000 infections by end of march was higher than 50  figure 2a  this 189 number quickly rose to 34 countries reaching this number of infections by the end of april and 47 190 countries by end may figures 2b 2c  for the alternative scenario where the reproduction number 191 is reduced to 10 by stay-at-home order the numbers of african countries with a higher-than-50 192 estimated probability of reaching 10000 infections by end of march april and may were 3 23 and 193 32 respectively figures 2d-2f  notably four countries angola gambia mozambique and

places outside china we 207 estimated that most places at risk were in asia europe and usa 19  though there were links between 208 china and african countries these were fewer than those between china and the rest of asia 209 europe and usa 19  the shut down in china severely curtailed continuing importations out of china 210 and so these importations rapidly stopped 211 lower initial importations into africa compared to asia and europe certainly tallies with what has 212 been seen there have been very few reported cases in africa in the first wave of importations and 213 no reports of onward transmission there was much discussion at the time whether the lack of 214 reported imported cases in africa was because imported cases were not being picked up this may 215 be some of the story but our analysis would suggest that this was not the whole story and it was 216 more that the early risk of importation into africa was lower than other places 19  however the 217 results we present in this paper estimate that this risk has dramatically increased with the spread of 218 the virus in europe and the usa this also tallies with what we have seen as countries in africa 219 started to report their first imported cases from europe and the usa 4  as of april 30 th 2020 south 220 africa had reported the highest number of cases at 5350 4  and we estimated south africa to have 221 had one of the highest numbers of imported cases from the new epi-centres although it was also 222 rated highest at risk in africa of importations from china in previous analysis 6  senegal is one of the 223 countries for whom the risk has notably increased from the risk of importation from china as 224 estimated in previous analyses 6 19  we only considered importations from the major epicentres in 225 europe and america and so the number of importations from all countries will be even higher 226 our study provides countries with information on the estimated timing of reaching 10000 227 infections which can be used for planning under the assumption that stay-at-home order reduces 228 the reproduction number from 20 to 15 our estimates suggest that a number of african countries 229 will reach or have reached 10000 infections even earlier than the predictions of pearson et al 8 230 this could be due to a number of imported infections being undetected and hence not reflected in 231 the situation reports as well as the delay from infection to reporting both of which were accounted 232 for in our study notably we estimated two countries in north africa namely algeria and morocco 233 as having the highest probabilities of reaching 10000 infections by the end of march which may 234  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder

than previous estimates suggest 8  on the other hand we projected that countries such as 239 seychelles will reach 10000 infections later than pearson et als forecasts 8 owing to the stay-at-240 home order the epidemic was found to be further slowed down in many countries when we 241 assumed the reproduction number to be reduced by 50 due to stay-at-home order 242 many countries in africa have considerable experience in dealing with other infectious disease 243 outbreaks most notably ebola and will be able to call upon that experience for covid-19 countries 244 hit in this third wave of transmission including those in africa have some advantage as there have 245 been a variety of responses from around the world from which to assess what to do or not to do 246 however there will need to be consideration of how effective measures can be adapted to different 247 settings 20  issues such as high hiv prevalence in some countries and a younger demographic may 248 both affect the cases and deaths observed in different ways this relationship however is yet to be 249 determined and there will need to be rapid research in countries in africa to determine what the risk 250 of disease is in different populations and how best to respond in light of many other competing 251 health priorities 252 many countries in africa are on high alert for incoming cases from europe and usa taking measures 253 such as quarantine of arrivals or shutting down travel from affected countries this is a sensible 254 response given the vast amount of transmission on-going in these places however as travel is either 255 maintained or reopened between countries closer by risk of importations from other countries 256 should continue to be considered close attention should therefore be paid to where will be the next 257 epicentre perhaps within africa and how this could translate into imported cases for each country 258 particularly for those countries that we estimate to have experienced lower numbers of imported 259 cases previously and therefore lower onward transmission 260 not accounted for in our study currently is the impact of less stringent interventions on the local 261 sars-cov-2 spread such as the effect of prohibiting large public gatherings closure of social venues 262 and schools and restrictions on inter-district travels it is still unclear as to whether and to what 263 extent these interventions were effective in their local context and hence in our simulations we only 264 considered stay-at-home order for all non-essential workers as an effective intervention to reduce 265 local transmission future modelling work considering the impact of different interventions in 266 different places will be vital for determining how each country can continue to respond 267 in addition we have made simplifying assumptions about the change in travel patterns in response 268 to the pandemic in each african country relative to that in singapore due to the unavailability of

xincheng qiu yao zeng  for useful comments and suggestions all remaining errors are our own we quantify the causal impact of human mobility restrictions particularly the lockdown of the city of wuhan on january 23 2020 on the containment and delay of the spread of the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov we employ a set of differencein-differences did estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect virus effect and the spring festival effect we find that the lockdown of wuhan reduced inflow into wuhan by 7664 outflows from wuhan by 5635 and within-wuhan movements by 5415 we also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from wuhan and other hubei cities the epicenter of the 2019-ncov outbreak on the destination cities new infection cases we find using simulations with these estimates that the lockdown of the city of wuhan on january 23 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of wuhan even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities we find that the covid-19 cases would be 6481 higher in the 347 chinese cities outside hubei province and 5264 higher in the 16 non-wuhan cities inside hubei in the counterfactual world in which the city of wuhan were not locked down from january 23 2020 we also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-ncov outbreak in wuhan and other cities of hubei province but over time the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated actual cases narrows significantly we also find evidence that enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 chinese cities outside hubei province are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in hubei province on the spread of 2019-ncov virus in the destination cities elsewhere 3 with a population of over 11 million wuhan is the largest city in hubei the most populous city in central china and the seventh most populous city in china the city is also a major transportation hub with dozens of railways roads and expressways passing through and connecting to other major cities and home to 82 colleges and more than 1 million college students  human mobility contributes to the transmission of infectious diseases that pose serious threats to global health indeed in response to pandemic threats many countries consider and impose measures that restrict human mobility flows as one of their response plans bajardi et al 2011 wang and taylor 2016 charu et al 2017  however restrictions on human mobility are controversial not only because of their negative economic impacts but also because of the uncertainty about their effectiveness in controlling the epidemic even if restricting human movement could lead to improvements in disease control and reductions in health risks it is empirically challenging to quantify the impact of human mobility on the spread of infectious diseases and to understand the detailed spatial patterns of how the infectious disease spreads both granular disease occurrence data and human mobility data charu et al 2017  are hard to obtain moreover it is difficult to disentangle the impact of human mobility from other potential contributing factors in the spread of epidemics hollingsworth et al 2006  in this paper we exploit the exogenous variations in human mobility created by lockdowns of chinese cities during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and utilize a variety of high-quality data sets to study the effectiveness of an unprecedented cordon sanitaire of the epicenter of covid-19 and provide a comprehensive analysis on the role of human mobility restrictions in the delaying and the halting of the spread of the covid-19 pandemic 1 the fast-moving 2019-ncov that infected 266073 people and claimed 11184 lives as of march 21 2020 is deteriorating into one of the worst global pandemics 2 the virus emerged in the city of wuhan in the hubei province of china in early december of 2019 spread mainly through person-to-person contact chan et al 2020  and rapidly reached more than 183 countries as of march 21 2020 3 currently there are no licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics to combat covid-19 the lockdown of 11 million people in wuhan from january 23 2020 represents by then the largest quarantine in public health history and offers us an opportunity to rigorously examine the effects of the city lockdown and understand the relationship between human mobility and virus transmission specifically this paper studies five research questions first how does the lockdown of the city of wuhan amid the novel coronavirus outbreak affect population movement second how do population flows among chinese cities particularly outflows from wuhan and other cities in hubei province affect virus infection in the destination cities third is there evidence of and if so what is the magnitude of undocumented cases of covid-19 cases in wuhan and other cities in hubei province during the early stages of the epidemic and how does the extent of undocumented infection cases evolve over time fourth how many covid-19 cases elsewhere in china were prevented by the unprecedented wuhan lockdown fifth are social distancing policies in destination cities effective in reducing the spread of the infections we utilize reliable datasets on population migration among pairs of chinese cities and the within-city population movements of each city at the daily level from baidu migration and the city-level daily numbers of confirmed covid-19 cases recovered patients and death tolls from the chinese center for disease control and prevention ccdc during a sample period of january 1-february 29 2020 covering 22 days before and 38 days after the city lockdown on january 23 2020 as well as the matched data from the same lunar calendar period in 2019 we first employ various difference-in-differences did estimation strategies to disentangle the effect of wuhan lockdown on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect virus effect and the spring festival effect-the spring festival of the chinese new year is on january 25 2020 table 2  we find that the lockdown of wuhan reduced inflow into wuhan by 7664 outflows from wuhan by 5635 and within-wuhan movements by 5415 we also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from wuhan and other hubei cities the epicenter of the 2019-ncov outbreak on the destination cities new infection cases  figure 4  we discover that the estimated effects of the different lags of inflows from wuhan and hubei both show a clear inverted u -shape with respect to the lags with the largest impact on the newly confirm cases today comes from the inflow population from wuhan or other cities in hubei about 12 to 14 days earlier we find using simulations with these estimates that the lockdown of the city of wuhan on january 23 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of wuhan even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities we find that the covid-19 cases would be 6481 higher in the 347 chinese cities outside hubei province and 5264 higher in 16 non-wuhan cities inside hubei in the counterfactual world in which the city of wuhan were not locked down from january 23 2020 we also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-ncov outbreak in wuhan and other cities of hubei province but over time the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated actual cases narrows significantly we also find evidence that imposing enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 chinese cities outside hubei province is effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in hubei province on the spread of 2019-ncov virus in the destination cities elsewhere by providing a rigorous estimation of the impact of within and cross-city migration on the spread of the 2019-ncov virus in china our study contributes to fast-growing literature on 2019-ncov infection mostly in the medical and public health fields huang et al 2020 describe high rates of respiratory distress intensive care admission and abnormal findings on chest computed tomography ct in the first 41 patients hospitalized from december 16 to january 2 in wuhan as well as a 15 death rate chan et al 2020 investigate a family cluster and confirm the human-to-human transmission of this novel coronavirus within hospitals and families the basic reproduction number r0 for covid-19 in 12 studies has a mean of 328 and a median of 279 liu et al 2020  compared to 3 for sars wto 2003  this study is also related to disaster-induced migration which has often occurred during flooding gray and mueller 2012  drought munshi 2003  earthquake lu et al 2012  and other destructive climatic phenomena given that the 2019-ncov has rapidly spread worldwide due to human travel and caused severe illness and significant mortality it is therefore essential to understand the impact of various control measures on human mobility and the virus transmission qiu et al 2020 apply machine learning tools and use exogenous temperature wind speed and precipitation in the preceding third and fourth weeks as the instruments to show that the massive lockdown and other control measures significantly reduced the virus transmission their results highlight that the population outflow from the outbreak source city poses higher risks to the destination cities than other social and economic factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions our results are also in line with the results of the latest modeling exercises which mostly rely on model calibrations of various parameters such as generation time incubation period detection rates and changes in travel flow using the global epidemic and mobility model chinazzi et al 2020 project the impact of travel limitation on the national and international spread of the 2019-ncov the study finds that only 244 of infected cases were reported as of february 1 and the wuhan lockdown reduced the cases by 10 in cities outside wuhan by january 31 the study most closely related to ours is li et al 2020  which shows that contagious but undocumented covid-19 cases facilitated the geographic spread of the epidemic in china using a networked dynamic meta-population model and bayesian inference li et al 2020 find that 86 of all infections were undocumented before the wuhan lockdown and reported infections would have been reduce by 787 in china without transmission from undocumented cases between january 10 and january 23 lai et al 2020 build a travel network-based susceptibleexposed-infectious-removed seir model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland china they use epidemiological parameters estimated from the early stage of outbreak in wuhan to parameterize the transmission before the non-pharmaceutical interventions npi were implemented the npis they consider include travel bans and restrictions contact reductions and social distancing early case identification and isolation through their sim-ulations they find that the npis deployed in china appear to be effectively containing the covid-19 outbreak but the efficacy of the different interventions varied with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective moreover deploying the npis early is also important to prevent further spread relative to our study it is important to point out that in their simulations they assumed that the pattern of population movements was the same in years when there were no outbreaks and interventions to the best of our knowledge this paper is the first to provide a causal interpretation of the impact of city lockdown on human mobility and the spread of 2019-ncov and to clearly disentangle the lockdown effects from other potential contributing factors such as panic and virus effect as well as the seasonal spring festival effect see section 3 the remainder of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we describe the data sets used in our analysis in section 3 we present different difference-in-difference estimation strategies to separate the lockdown effect panic effect virus deterrence effect and the spring festival effect on population movements in china in section 4 we estimate the distributed lag effects of inflows from the epicenter cities of the 2019-ncov outbreak on destination cities daily infection cases in section 5 we study how the enhanced social distancing policies or lockdown policies in the destination cities impact the effects of the population inflows from the epicenter cities in section 6 we conclude population migration data we obtain inter-city population migration data from baidu migration a travel map offered by the largest chinese search engine baidu 4  the baidu migration data set covers 120142 pairs of cities per day for 364 chinese cities between january 12 and march 12 in 2019 and between january 1 and february 29 in 2020 note that by the lunar calendar the data covers the same period of 24 days before and 36 days after the spring festivals respectively for year 2019 and year 2020 the daily inter-city migration data consist of 2977899 city-pair observations each year in addition baidu provides the daily within-city mobility data for each city in the sample period which is a panel consisting of 21655 city-day level observations each year the baidu migration data is based on real-time location records for every smart phone using the companys mapping app and thus can precisely reflect the population movements between cities 5 for each of the 364 cities baidu migration provides the following informa- tion 1 the top 100 origination cities oc for the population moving into the city and the corresponding percentages of inflow population that originated from each of the top 100 oc 2 the top 100 destination cities dc for the population moving out of the city and the corresponding percentages of the outflow population that go into each of the top dc in the data the cumulative percentages of the inflow population from the top 100 origination city and the cumulative percentages of the outflow population into the top 100 destination cities reach 97 per city on average this ensures that the baidu migration data capture near complete inflows and outflows for each of the 364 cities in the data in addition the baidu migration data provides three migration intensity indicators the daily in-migration index imi of a city the daily out-migration index omi of a city and the daily within-city migration index wcmi the intensity indicators are consistent across cities and across time to convert the index to the number of people we use the actual number of inflow population into shanghai by airplanes trains and busescars and the number of within-shanghai trips using subways buses and expressways collected by the national earth system science data center for the period of february 6 to february 22 2020 using this data we estimate that one index unit in the imi and omi corresponds to 90848 person movements and one index unit in wcmi corresponds to 2182264 person movements we are thus able to calculate the number of daily inflow and outflow migrants in each city-pair as well as the number of within-city population movements 6 table 1 presents the summary statistics of the population flows at the city-pair-day level and city-day level it shows drastic declines in the average inflows average outflows and average within-city migration in 2020 compared to a sample period in 2019 matched by the lunar calendar date the plummeting of the migration statistics due to the wuhan lockdown is also depicted in figure 2  the three figures on the top show the inflows into wuhan outflows from wuhan and within-wuhan flows for year 2020 solid line and year 2019 dashed line matched by the lunar calendar and the bottom shows the corresponding figures for the national city averages the first vertical line indicates the date of january 20 2020 when experts confirmed that 2019-ncov could transmit from human to human and the second vertical line indicates the date of january 23 2020 when wuhan was locked down it is clear that while the flows in 2020 tracked that of 2019 well until january 20 the 2020 level dropped to a fraction of their corresponding 2019 levels particularly after the lockdown of wuhan  table 1 about here  figure 2 about here 6 it is important to emphasize here that the mobility data is about the movement of people from one city to another based on geo-location services of the smartphones as such a person flowing out of city a to city b is not necessarily a resident of city a but heshe must have been to city a before moving to city b  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in

dead and recovered covid-19 cases in each city 7 from january 11 to february 29 2020 the data covers 77105 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases 2778 death cases and 39392 recovered cases in 296 cities in china panel b of table  1 presents the summary statistics of covid-19 data and figure 3 plots the trends of daily statistics of covid-19separately for the epicenter city of wuhan for other cities in hubei province and for cities outside of hubei 8 there are many possible reasons for us to treat the officially reported numbers of confirmed cases in wuhan and other cities of hubei with more caution and to treat them differently from the data of cities outside of hubei as the epicenter of covid-19 the health care systems in wuhan and other cities in hubei were overwhelmed by the sheer number of patients who needed laboratory testing especially in the early phases of the virus outbreak as such the over-extended medical system in wuhan and other cities in hubei might have caused delays in the testing of the patients who contracted covid-19 and because of the delay some patients who contracted covid-19 might have self-recovered or might have died before being officially tested and some who were infected with the virus might be asymptomatic there is also a possibility that government officials in the epicenter cities had incentives to downplay the severity of the outbreak at least initially these considerations impact how we use the outbreak data in section 4 the incubation period of 2019-ncov is long in comparison with sars moreover the virus can transmit while the person is still asymptomatic which increases the probability a person with the novel coronavirus will travel and unknowingly spread the virus to others 9 to suppress the spread of 2019-ncov the central government of china imposed an unprecedented lockdown in wuhan starting from 10 am of january 23 2020 and in other hubei cities several days later as of february 29 2020 80 cities in 22 provinces issued different 7 source http2019ncovchinacdccn2019-ncov 8 the spike of confirmed cases observed on february 12 in hubei province is for the most part the result of a change in diagnosis classification for which 13332 clinically rather than laboratory confirmed cases were all reported as new cases on february 12 2020 even though they might have been clinically diagnosed in the preceding weeks also on february 12 2020 a new communist party secretary of hubei province was appointed who started his position on the next day 9 the range of the incubation period for 2019-ncov is estimated to be 2-14 days or even as long as 24 days the median incubation period is about 5 days see lauer et al 2020  in contrast the incubation period for sars is 2-7 days in addition sars transmits only after showing symptoms  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the

mobility control in different cities we also plot the geographic distributions of sample cities and cases in figure 1   figure 1 about here there are several confounding factors in our attempt to causally quantify the impact of lockdown on human mobility and on the spread of infectious viruses first the virus outbreak happens right before the spring festival of the chinese lunar new year which causes the largest annual human migration every year 11 second the virus itself even in the absence of a mandatory lockdown may lead to curtailed human movement as people attempt to avoid exposure to the virus in the journeys and public spaces we refer to this deterrence effect as the virus effect third for the city of wuhan and other cities in hubei that are close to wuhan there is also the possibility of a panic effect in reaction to the virus the panic effect can lead to an increase in the population outflow from the epicenter of the virus outbreak and a decrease of the population inflow to the epicenter particularly the city of wuhan the panic effect is likely to peak when the government officially confirmed on january 20 2020 that the novel coronavirus can transmit from person-to-person in our analysis below we create a specific pre-lockdown period before 2t  which includes the threeday period between january 20 and january 22 202 to capture the panic effects 12 note that while the virus effect applies to movement into and out of all cities the panic effect is more specific to the cities in the epicenter especially wuhan and can have a positive effect on outflows and a negative effect on inflows 10 within hours of the wuhan lockdown travel restrictions were imposed on the nearby cities of huanggang and ezhou and were eventually imposed on all 14 other cities in hubei affecting a total of about 57 million people on february 2 the city of wenzhou implemented a partial lockdown in which only one person per household was allowed to exit once every two days and most of the highway exits were closed following wenzhou another six cities hangzhou zhumadian ningbo haerbin fuzhou and zhengzhou also launched similar partial lockdowns on february 4 in another 56 cities surveillance and tighter controls applied to each neighborhood in the provinces of liaoning and jiangxi as well as major cities such as shenzhen guangzhou nanjing ningbo chengdu and suzhou checkpoints have been set up to control the inflow population 11 the migration across china which officially begins from about two weeks before and ends about three weeks after the lunar new year is often referred to as chunyun meaning spring movement in 2019 approximately 3 billions trips were made during chunyun see httpswwwcnncomtravelarticle lunar-new-year-travel-rush-2019indexhtml 12 the large outflow from wuhan is possible because many people in wuhan are migrant workers and college students with hometowns elsewhere  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  we first examine the impact of city lockdown on inter-city population mobility including inflow and outflow between a city pair i j to disentangle the contributions of these confounding factors on human mobility we exploit many unique sources of variations in the data and employ several did estimation strategies by comparing different treatment and control groups the did specification can be described as follows where i j and t respectively index the destination city origination city and date the dependent variable lnflow ijt  is the logarithmic population flows received by city i from city j at date t the definition of treat varies by specific did designs and we will be explicit about its definition below the city-pair fixed effect  ij is included to absorb the city-specific and the city-pair specific heterogeneities that may contaminate the estimation of our interested coefficient  3  we also control for the date-fixed effect  t to eliminate the time-specific impact including the spring festival travel effect the standard errors are clustered at the daily level in equation 1 we include two pre-lockdown period indicators before 1t is a dummy that takes value 1 for the period from january 11 to january 19 2020 4 to 11 days before the wuhan lockdown which can be used to examine the parallel trend assumption in the did analysis before 2t is a dummy that takes value 1 for the period from january 20 to january 22 2020 three days before the unprecedented wuhan lockdown but after the official announcement that the novel coronavirus can spread from person to person 13 before 2t allows us to capture the panic effect finally after t is a dummy that takes value 1 for the sample period after the wuhan lockdown between january 23 and february 29 2020 the omitted benchmark period is from january 1 to january 10 2020 13 on january 20 2020 an expert at china cdc confirmed that the novel coronavirus can spread from human to human the confirmation highlighted the increasing risk of an epidemic prior to the january 20 announcement the experts assessment of the virus was that it was preventable and controllable and at this time there is no evidence of person to person transmission 8  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  we also estimate the effect of lockdown on the within-city population movement utilizing the city-level data and a variety of did specifications where i and t index the city and date lnwithincityflow it  is the logarithmic within-city population mobility measure for city i at date t similar to equation 1 treat will be defined according to the did design before 1t  before 2t and after t are defined in the same way as in equation 1 we include the city fixed effects  i and date fixed effects  t  the standard errors are clustered at the daily level  table 2 about here in table 2  we report the results from three sets of regressions specified according to equation 1 for inter-city inflows panel a and outflows panel b and according to equation 2 for within-city movement panel c we implement three models that differ in the estimation sample and the definition of the variable treat model 1 wuhan 2020 vs 284 unlocked cities in 2020 the estimation sample used in the regressions reported in column 1 is the 2020 data for wuhan and 284 cities that were never locked down during the coronavirus outbreak 14 in panel a when we examine the inflow population treat takes value 1 if the destination city i is wuhan in panel b when we examine the outflow population treat takes value 1 if the origination city j is wuhan the control group consists of 284 cities that are not subject to any mobility restrictions in panel c when we examine the within-city mobility treat takes value 1 if city i is wuhan we interpret the coefficient estimate of treat  before 2t as measuring the panic effect of wuhan relative to the unlocked cities and the coefficient estimate of treat  after t as measuring the lockdown effect 15 the coefficient estimate of treat  before 1t allows us to examine whether the parallel trend assumption for did is 14 recall that baidu migration data covers 364 chinese cities 80 cities implemented some level of mobility restrictions see table a1  15 if the virus effect is stronger in wuhan than in the unlocked control cities then the coefficient estimate of treat  after t also includes the excess virus effect on the population in wuhan over the average virus effect experienced by the population in the control cities  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  satisfied it is important to note that the possibly time-varying spring festival effects and the virus effects are both absorbed in the day fixed effects based on the coefficient estimate of the term treat  after t  we find that wuhans lockdown reduces the inflow population to wuhan by 8806  1  exp2215 the outflow population from wuhan by 7444  1  exp1364 and within-city population movements in wuhan by 7379 1  exp1339 relative to all other unlocked cities in the post-lockdown period in 2020 in panel c we also find that the coefficient of treat  before 2t is significantly negative at -0323 suggesting that the official confirmation of the person-toperson transmission reduces the within-city movement in wuhan by 276 from jan 20 to jan 22 in 2020 this points to a panic effect for the within-city population flow in wuhan but we do not observe a significant panic effect for inter-city flows in and out of wuhan in model 1 model 2 wuhan 2020 vs wuhan 2019 model 1 could be criticized on the ground that wuhan may not be comparable to the 284 unlocked cities -after all these 284 cities that never imposed any mobility restrictions in the covid-19 outbreak could be very different from wuhan in model 2 we compare the population movements of wuhan in 2020 to itself in the same matched lunar calendar period in 2019 during which wuhan is free of lockdown and coronavirus outbreak thus the estimation sample in model 2 is the daily inflows into and outflows out of wuhan as well as the daily within-city movements in wuhan for years 2019 and 2020 under model 2 in panel a when we examine the inflow population treat takes value 1 if the destination city i is wuhan and year is 2020 in panel b when we examine the outflow population treat takes value 1 if the origination city j is wuhan and the year is 2020 the control group is wuhan 2019 in panel c when we examine the within-city mobility treat takes value 1 if the year is 2020 under model 2 the coefficient estimate of treat  before 2t measures the panic effect related to the virus outbreak in wuhan and the estimate of treat  after t measures the sum of the lockdown effect and the virus effect the coefficient estimate of treat  before 1t still allows us to examine whether the parallel trend assumption for did is satisfied the day fixed effects absorb the possibly time-varying spring festival effects notice that the interpretation of the coefficient estimate of the term treat  after t differs from that in model 1 because of the differences in the treatment and control groups under model 2 the estimated coefficients on treat  after t  which as we explained above capture both the lockdown and the virus effects remain negative and economically and statistically significant in all panels the estimates suggest that the lockdown of wuhan together with the deterrence effect of the virus the virus effect on average reduces the 10  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which

exp1871 respectively relative to the same lunar calendar days in 2019 we also find that the coefficient on treat  before 2t is significantly positive in panel b and significantly negative in panel c suggesting that the official confirmation of person-to-person spread of covid-19 creates a panic effect causing an increase of outflow from wuhan of 10709  exp0728  1 and a decrease of within-city movements in wuhan of 2419  1  exp0277 during the three days after the announcement but before the city lockdown however we do not observe a statistically significant panic effect for the population inflow into wuhan suggesting that people in other cities were not yet sufficiently concerned about the virus outbreak in wuhan and did not avoid traveling to wuhan even after the official confirmation of the personto-person transmission finally we should also point out that the coefficient estimates for treat  before 1t are all statistically insignificant which suggests that the parallel trend assumption for the dids are plausible model 3 wuhan 2020 vs seven other lockdown cities 2020 in model 2 the coefficient estimates of treat  after t provide us with an estimate of the sum of the lockdown and the virus effects in order to isolate the lockdown effect from the virus effect we consider model 3 where the estimation sample consists of data of the city of wuhan and seven other cities that went into partial lockdown on february 2 and february 4 2020 12 to 14 days after the lockdown of wuhan in an effort to curtail the spread of the virus 16 as we show in table a2 in the appendix these seven cities are more comparable to wuhan than other unlocked cities in terms of the epidemic situation and other economic indicators and thus provide a reasonable control group to partial out the virus effect in particular it is much more plausible than in model 1 where the control cities are cities that were never locked down to assume that the deterrence effect of the virus on human mobility in the seven cities is similar to that in wuhan the estimation sample for model 3 consists of data from wuhan and the seven cities for the period between january 1 and february 2 2020 note that during this period none of the seven control cities were locked down yet even though they were soon eventually locked down the definition for treat variables are as follows in panel a treat takes value 1 if the destination city i is wuhan in panel b treat takes value 1 if the origination city j is wuhan in panel c treat takes value 1 if city i is wuhan the control group consists of the 16 these seven cities are wenzhou which was partially lockdown from february 2 2020 and ningbo zhumadian hangzhou zhengzhou haerbin and fuzhou which were partially locked down on february 4 2020 as summarized in table a1 in the appendix partial lockdown includes closed-off management on highways railways and public transport systems and sets up checkpoints to control the inflow population and implements surveillance and tighter controls in each neighborhood  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the

related to the virus outbreak in wuhan relative to the seven control cities and the estimate of treat  after t measures the lockdown effect only the coefficient estimate of treat  before 1t still allows us to examine whether the parallel trend assumption for did is satisfied the possibly time-varying spring festival effects and the virus effects are both absorbed in the day fixed effects we find that the wuhan lockdown significantly reduces the inflow into outflow from and within-city movements in wuhan by 7664  1  exp1454 5635  1  exp0829 and 5416  1  exp0780 respectively we interpret these as the pure lockdown effect on population mobility related to wuhan summary based on our preferred estimation models which are models 2 and 3 table  3 summarizes our estimates of the panic effect the virus effect and the lockdown effect on inflows into outflows from wuhan and within-city population movements in wuhan  table 3 about here in table 3  the lockdown effects are directly calculated from the corresponding coefficient estimates of treat  after from model 3 discussed above the panic effects are from the coefficient estimates of treat  before 2 in model 2 for the virus effect we recognize that the coefficient estimates of treat  after in model 2 incorporate both the lockdown and the virus effects thus we calculate the virus effect on inflows into wuhan to be exp2522  1454  1  6563 on the outflows from wuhan to be exp1287  0829  1  3675 and on the within-city flow in wuhan to be exp187107801  5415 because our models assume that the different effects enter exponentially in explaining the flows -recall the natural log specifications in equations 1 and 2-when we would like to calculate the impact of two or more effects on the population flows we should not simply add the individual effects for example the joint impact of the panic and virus effects on outflows out of wuhan is 1  10709  1  3675  1  3098 instead of the simple sum of 10709  3675  7034  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  we now examine the impact of human mobility on the transmission of 2019-ncov considering that almost all the new covid-19 cases outside the city of wuhan were confirmed after the wuhan lockdown while almost all inter-city population flows occurred prior to the wuhan lockdown see figures 2 and 3  we investigate the imported infections by specifically looking at the impact of population inflows from cities in the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak namely wuhan and other cities in hubei province on the new cases in the destination cities recognizing that 2019-ncov has a long incubation period we estimate a dynamic distributed lag regression model taking into account that inflows from wuhan with different lags may have differential impacts on the current new cases in the destination cities most of the medical literature states that the 2019-ncov virus has a median incubation period of five days and some can have an incubation period of 14 days or more see lauer et al 2020  eg luckily our data allows us to incorporate the possibility that contact with an infected person from wuhan or other cities in hubei can result in confirmed infections in the destination city for up to 22 days the analysis focuses on the daily new confirmed covid-19 cases in the post-wuhan lockdown period from january 23 to february 29 2020 for cities i that are outside of hubei province specifically we run the following regression 17 where i indexes the cities outside of hubei and t  23  60 indicate the date 18   1  22 indicates the time lapsed from the inflows from wuhan or other hubei cities till the current date t ln1newcase it  is the logarithm of the number of new confirmed cases in city i at date t inflow iwht and j ij whjhb inflow ijt are the inflows from wuhan and the inflows from the 16 other cities in hubei to city i respectively  days prior 17 our log-log specification is based on the classical susceptible-infectious-removed sir model

effects  i and date fixed effects  t  note that in this regression we include only cities outside of hubei province for two reasons first wuhan and other cities in hubei province are the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak and we are interested in how population outflows from these cities to other cities outside hubei affect the destination cities covid-19 cases second the confirmed covid-19 cases in wuhan and other cities in hubei province are likely to be inaccurate for the following reasons first as widely reported the health care systems in wuhan and other cities in hubei were totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of covid-19 patients this made it impossible to conduct laboratory tests on all patients which can lead to delayed confirmation of infected patients second during the delay some of the infected may have healed on their own or have died before being confirmed third local government officials may face strong incentives to under-report the number of infected cases in section 42 we will evaluate the possible downward biases of the officially reported cases in wuhan and other cities in hubei based on our estimates in contrast the confirmed cases in other cities are likely to be accurate as their numbers are not large enough to overwhelm their local health care system and the incentives to under-report are much weaker in cities outside of hubei the estimated coefficients  1 and  2 in equation 3 respectively represent the impact of the inflows from wuhan and other cities in hubei   1  22 days ago on the destination cities new cases today they are respectively plotted in the top and bottom panels of figure  4  we also fit a spline smoothed curve of the estimated effects of the different lags of inflows from wuhan and hubei which both show a clear inverted u -shape with respect to the lags interestingly both graphs show that the largest impact on the newly confirm cases today in chinese cities outside hubei comes from the inflow population from wuhan or other cities in hubei about 12 to 14 days ago the pattern exhibited in figure 4 is consistent with the hypothesis that the incubation period of the 2019-ncov is up to 12 to 14 days but also consistent with a shorter incubation period coupled with secondary infections  figure 4 about here anecdotal evidence suggests the official statistics of covid-19 cases in wuhan may have been under-reported due to the shortages of testing equipment and other medical resources with the estimated dynamic effects as shown in figure 4  which is estimated under the plausible assumption that the reported cases outside hubei province are reliable we can estimate the actual number of infection cases in wuhan and other cities in hubei 14  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  to estimate the actual number of infection cases in wuhan using the estimated equation 3 we technically need to impute a value for inflow whwht  that is inflows from wuhan to wuhan we proxy these inflows by the daily within-wuhan population movement from january 1 to february 29 ie by withincityflow wht  similarly to estimate the actual number of infection cases in other cities in hubei we need to replace the inflow from city j to itself by the corresponding daily within-city-j population movements we need to make an additional assumption about the city fixed effects recall that cities in hubei province were not included in the estimation sample for equation 3 as such there are no city fixed effects estimated for cities in hubei luckily it is plausible to assume that the city fixed effects in hubei is the average of the city fixed effects of all chinese cities outside hubei according to world banks respectively imfs method of estimating per capita gdp hubeis per capita gdp in 2018 was usd 10067 respectively usd 10054 and the average per capita gdp of mainland china was usd 9769 respectively usd 9750 hubei is not only geographically and demographically in the center of mainland china it is also economically the average of china thus we believe it is defensible to proxy the fixed effects of hubei cities by the average of the city fixed effects outside of hubei  figure 5 about here in figure 5  we plot the estimated daily new cases according to the above-described method using the estimated equation 3 as well as the corresponding cumulative cases for wuhan panel a and 16 other cities of hubei panel b for the period of january 23 to february 29 2020 we also plotted the corresponding daily and cumulative officially reported ie documented cases we find a persistent gap between the estimated and reported laboratory-confirmed cases in wuhan before february 11 2020 just before the announcement of a new party secretary for hubei province on february 12 2020 the estimated actual number of infection cases is 248 times the reported cases during the first 20 days after the wuhan lockdown on average in particularly we estimate that on january 23 2020 the day of the wuhan lockdown 4217 of our estimated infections in wuhan were undocumented in the sense that the number of officially reported cases on that day was only 5783 of our estimated infection cases this gap widened over time possibly as a result of the overwhelmed health care system and peaked at 8003 on january 26 the proportion of undocumented infections started to decline gradually afterward when more medical support and resources were mobilized across china to support wuhan as of february 29 we estimate that there were 54689 total covid-19 infections in wuhan which is 1133 higher than the official reported statistics for wuhan -a total of 49122 cases the 1133 discrepancy can be plausibly be explained by the unaccounted for self-healing and death that might have occurred during the early periods of the outbreak between january 23 and early february  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  thus we are led to conclude that the almost all infection cases in wuhan were able to be treated over time as the stress on the health system was relieved and moreover the official statistics were mostly accurate as can be seen from the left figure on the daily new cases in panel a in figure 5  it is useful to note that the general pattern of the undocumented covid-19 infections in wuhan before and after the lockdown based on our estimates is consistent with that reported in li et al 2020  they use a networked dynamic meta-population model and bayesian inference to estimate the proportion of undocumented infections in the epicenter of the outbreak as well as the respective inflection rates for documented and undocumented cases they estimate that 86 of all infection cases as of january 23 2020 were undocumented our interpretation of these undocumented cases is broader than the asymptomatic cases ie covid-19 cases that do not show symptoms we believe that some of the undocumented cases were due to the lack of ability to test the rapidly increasing infection cases in the early period of the outbreak most of the undocumented cases become documented over time as the care capacity was strengthened in wuhan in the bottom panel of figure 5  we plot our estimated daily new confirmed cases and total infection case for 16 cities other than wuhan in hubei province together with the officially reported series we find that in the 16 cities infections were more seriously underreported in the first week after the wuhan lockdown when our estimated infected cases are 187 times of the reported cases our estimate reveals a very high rate of undocumented infections on the first day of wuhan lockdown 798 the gap narrowed gradually with more medical resources provided and more stringent control measures implemented in those cities by the end of our study period on february 29 2020 the estimated actual number of infections is 17999 cases in 16 other cities in hubei which is 174 higher than the officially reported cumulative cases 15 330  again the discrepancy between the estimated and officially reported cumulative cases can at least be partially attributed to the unaccounted for self-healing and death that might have occurred during the early periods of the outbreak locking down wuhan a city of 11 million residents was an unprecedented measure to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus an important policy-relevant question is then how many covid-19 cases were actually prevented by the wuhan lockdown in china to answer this question we must estimate the counterfactual number of covid-19 cases that would have occurred in other cities in the absence of wuhan lockdown which would in turn  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  require a counterfactual estimate of the outflows from wuhan to other chinese cities had there been no lockdown of wuhan in section 3 we provided the estimates of how panic effect and virus effect will separately affect the outflows from wuhan to other cities in china separate from the lockdown effect these effects are summarized in table 3  it suggests that in the absence of the wuhan lockdown the virus effect and panic effects would have led to a 3675 decrease and a 10709 increase in the outflow population from wuhan respectively based on these effects therefore in the absence of wuhan lockdown we would expect that the outflows from wuhan in days after january 23 -the date of wuhan lockdown -to be 1  03675  1  10709  131 4 times higher than the normal outflows from wuhan to other cities we use the daily level of outflows from wuhan to a city in 2019 on the same lunar calendar day as a measure of the normal outflow and multiple the number by 131 to obtain the daily counterfactual inflows from wuhan to the city had there been no lockdown of wuhan from january 23 2020 using this estimation method we find that on average the estimated counterfactual outflows from wuhan to 16 other cities in hubei between january 23 and february 29 2020 would be 16568984 a level that is 597 times the actually observed inflow population observed in the data in 2020 with the lockdown which is 2774793 similarly the average inflows from wuhan to the 347 other cities outside hubei in china would be 2274455 314 times the actual inflow population to those cities during the same period in 2020 which is 723574 19 we denote the counterfactual inflows from j  wuhan into city i at date s  23  60 from the above calculation as inflow iwhs  we assume that the wuhan lockdown did not impact the population movements within other cities and population flows among other cities we also assume that all the control measures implemented by other cities after the wuhan lockdown remain in place thus the parameter estimates of the dynamic lag effects of inflows from wuhan and other cities in hubei estimated in equation 3 remain valid as an epidemiological diffusion equation that is not affected by human mobility restrictions that result from the wuhan lockdown the lockdown only affected the human flows with these considerations in mind we simulate the counterfactual number of covid-19 cases had there been no wuhan lockdown on date t  23  60 ie from january 23 to 19 recall that outflows from wuhan are not just residents of wuhan any travelers who entered wuhan for whatever reason and then leave wuhan would be included in the wuhan outflows measured by baidu migration data  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

february 29 2020 in cities i outside hubei province by the following equation inflow ijt  i 5 where 1 and 2 are coefficient estimates obtained from regressions specified in equation 3 and reported in figure 4  and and i are the estimated city fixed effects from the same regression note that in predicting the counterfactual covid-19 cases without wuhan lockdown we use the counterfactual inflows from wuhan to city i for days after january 23 inflow iwhs discussed previously we are also interested in predicting the counterfactual cases in other non-wuhan cities in hubei province using the same method as that described above with two differences first since hubei cities are not included in the estimation of equation 3 we do not have the city fixed effects for the hubei cities as we argued in section 42 it is plausible to assume that the fixed effects of hubei cities are the average of city fixed effects of the cities outside hubei we maintain this assumption as well in this counterfactual exercise second following the same strategy of section 42 for a non-wuhan city j in hubei province we use the within-city-j population movement at date t to proxy for the inflow to city j from city j when we implement equation 5 for non-wuhan hubei cities in figure 6  we present the counterfactual estimates of covid-19 cases had there been no wuhan lockdown in solid curve and the officially reported cases in dashed curve for cities outside hubei province panel a and non-wuhan cities of hubei panel b the left figure in each panel depicts the models counterfactual prediction and the actual of daily infection cases and the right figure depicts the evolution of cumulative cases from january 23 to february 29 2020 the gap between the estimated counterfactual number of infection cases the solid curve and the officially reported cases the dashed curve on the right figure represent the number of covid-19 cases prevented by the wuhan lockdown as of february 29 2020 the officially reported number of covid-19 in the 347 cities outside hubei province was 12626 but our counterfactual simulation suggests that there would have been 20810 cases had there been no wuhan lockdown similarly the officially reported number of covid-19 cases in the 16 non-wuhan cities in hubei was 15330 by february 29 2020 but our counterfactual simulation suggests that the number of infection cases would have been 23400 had there been no wuhan lockdown that is the covid-19 cases would be 6481 higher in 347 cities outside hubei and 5264 higher in 16 other cities in hubei as of february 29 in the counterfactual world in which the city of wuhan were not locked down from january 23 2020 our findings thus suggest that the lockdown of the city of wuhan from january 18  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

2020 played a crucial role in reducing the imported infections in other chinese cities and halts the spread of 2019-ncov virus our model also allows us to project when the new infection cases would have peaked in other cities in the absence of wuhan lockdown as shown by the solid curves in the left figures of each panel our model projects that in the absence of wuhan lockdown the new daily infection cases in the 16 non-wuhan cities in hubei would have peaked on february 2 the 9th day after the lockdown of wuhan at a level of 1466 daily new cases and elsewhere in china it would have peaked on february 3 2020 the 10th day after the lockdown of wuhan at a level of 1082 daily new cases we also find that the estimated daily new cases in the counterfactual world gradually converge to the reported daily cases from february 22 suggesting that the social distancing measures implemented elsewhere in china would have worked eventually to contain the spread of 2019-ncov virus even if the city of wuhan was not locked down on january 23 2020 but the initial onslaught on the medical system in all cities in china would have been much more severe and the total number of infection cases elsewhere would have been significantly higher  figure 6 about here as the 2019-ncov virus spread throughout the world many countries are also implementing lockdown measures and mandate social distancing as a policy response to contain the spread of the virus up to now our analysis has focused on the events of the lockdown of wuhan -the epicenter of the novel coronavirus outbreak it would also be interesting to study the impact of lockdowns andor the social distancing measures in the destination cities in reducing and containing the spread of virus indeed chinazzi et al 2020 point out that travel restrictions to and from mainland china impact the global pandemic of the covid-19 only if transmission within the community is simultaneously reduced by 50 or more which suggests that social distancing at the destination cities is crucial in preventing the possibly asymptomatic transmission from the source city moreover quantifying the effect of social distancing on virus transmission is especially relevant to the stage of pre-epidemic community spread when a person who is not known to have traveled to affected countries or to have had contact with an infected person becomes infected as shown in table a1 in the appendix within the few weeks after the wuhan and hubei lockdowns various human mobility restrictions were imposed on 63 other chinese cities outside hubei as described in table a1  the lockdowns in destination cities varied in their 19  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  degree of strictness from building entrances checkpoints to establishing quarantine zones and from public transit shutdowns to strict limits on the inflows into the city outflows out of the city as well as within-city population movements we interpret the human mobility restrictions in the destination cities as an enhanced social distancing policy because the lockdown rules in the destination cities are not as strict as those implemented in wuhan in this section we use the variations in the destination cities lockdown policies to study how the effects of inflows from wuhan and other cities in hubei province on the spread of covid-19 cases in the destination cities are impacted by the changes in the destination cities lockdown policies which would drastically impact the within-city population movements in the destination cities 20 specifically we estimate the following specification that is a modified version of the regression specification described by equation 3 where the new variable lockdown it is a dummy that takes value 1 if time t is a date after destination city is lockdown date if at all and 0 otherwise where the lockdown dates of the 63 cities outside hubei are listed in table a1  if city i never implemented any formal lockdown policy the dummy is always 0 therefore the coefficients  1 and  2  respectively measure the impact of the lagged inflows from wuhan and hubei  days earlier on the destination cities current new cases before the citys imposition of its lockdown while  1 and  2 represent the effect on destination cities of wuhan and hubei inflows after the imposition of the citys lockdown if enhanced social distancing that comes from the lockdown policies imposed at the 63 chinese cities outside hubei is effective in reducing the spread of the virus from population flows from the epicenter of the virus then we expect that  1 and  2 to be smaller than  1 and  2  respectively 20 see panel c of table 2 for the evidence from wuhan lockdown on within-wuhan population movement  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  in figures 7 respectively figure 8  we plot the estimated coefficients  1 and  1 respectively  2 and  2  in panel a and their differences in panel b for the lagged effects of inflows from wuhan respectively 16 non-wuhan cities in hubei on the daily new cases in destination cities outside hubei province we find that the estimated lagged effects of inflows from wuhan and other cities in hubei before the destination citys lockdown if any show little change compared to the coefficients in figure 4 however the coefficient estimates of lagged inflows after the destination citys lockdown policies appear to be insignificant and indifferent from zero on almost all lags in panel b of figures 7-8  we plot the differences between the estimated effects pre and post the destination cities lockdown policies we find that the differences between the estimated coefficients pre and post destination city lockdowns are positive and statistically significantly at at-least 10 level for 7 respectively 5 of the first ten lagged population inflows from wuhan respectively 16 other cities of hubei and the other differences in lagged estimates are statistically insignificant these results suggest that the enhanced social distancing policies in the destination cities are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the source cities of wuhan and other cities in hubei on the spread of 2019-ncov virus in the destination cities this in turn implies that population inflows from the epicenter contribute to the spread of infection in the destination cities only before the social distancing measures are applied it appears that after implementing their various control measures cities adopting an extended lockdown can flatten the upward trajectory of the virus in this paper we quantify the causal impact of human mobility restrictions particularly the lockdown of the city of wuhan on january 23 2020 on the containment and delay of the spread of the novel coronavirus and estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from wuhan and other hubei cities the epicenter of the 2019-ncov outbreak on the destination cities new infection cases we find that the lockdown of wuhan reduced inflow into wuhan by 7664 outflows from wuhan by 5635 and within-wuhan movements by 5415 using counterfactual simulations with these estimates we find that the lockdown of the city of wuhan on january 23 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of wuhan even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities we find that the covid-19 cases would be 6481 higher in the 347 chinese cities outside hubei province and 5264 higher in 16 non-wuhan cities inside hubei in the counterfactual world in which the city of wuhan were not locked down from january 23 2020 we also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-ncov outbreak in wuhan and other cities of hubei province 21  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not peer-reviewed the copyright holder for this preprint  but over time the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated actual cases narrows significantly we also find evidence that imposing enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 chinese cities outside hubei province is effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in hubei province on the spread of 2019-ncov virus in the destination cities elsewhere the results from our analysis provide valuable causal evidence on the role of human mobility restrictions on the containment and delay of the spread of contagious viruses including the 2019-ncov virus that is now ravaging the world enhanced social distancing in the destination cities and if an epicenter can be identified as was the case for the city of wuhan in china a lockdown can play crucial roles in flattening the daily infection cases curve giving the stressed medical system a chance to regroup and deal with the onslaught of new infection cases although our study focuses exclusively on the effect of human mobility restrictions on the spread of 2019-ncov virus in china our estimated results can have general implications to other countries in their fight against the novel coronavirus  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in

peguero a   the novel coronavirus covid-19 was first detected in wuhan china in late 2019 and within months had upended much of the normative activities of daily economic social and governmental life the criminal justice system was not spared as virtually all aspects of the american legal system were faced with increased logistical and public health concerns overnight the strain on criminal justice was felt perhaps nowhere as acutely as in new york city the epicenter of the outbreak where the nypd to date may 25 2020 has lost 43 officers with another 5793 testing positive for covid-19 police and correctional officers have become front-line workers during the pandemic with heightened exposure to high-risk situations and locations often lacking the requisite personal protective equipment ppe necessary to reduce potential exposure contact with the public combined with the health dangers posed by correctional and detention facilities generally have placed these workers squarely in the midst of a system-wide crisis in a may 2020 survey of 32 state health departments the cdc reports that at least 4893 inmates and 2778 staff have been diagnosed with covid-19 while 88 and 15 respectively have been lost to the virus across 420 separate prisons and jails cdc 2020 the numbers are almost certainly higher the immigration system similarly has been impacted by covid-19 this is especially true given the criminalization of immigration processes more generally in recent years nowhere is this more so the case than in immigrant detention policies and practices immigrant detention a practice rarely utilized during most of the twentieth century has increased since the 1980s and reached its peak during the trump administration tens of thousands of immigrants are currently being held in detention facilities and local jails on any given day far exceeding the number of beds reported by the department of homeland security dhs these conditions are ripe for spread of communicable diseases and indeed early reports indicate that these detention facilities may be hidden covid-19 hotspots legal activity related to immigration policy and practice if anything has increased during the pandemic with lawsuits being filed by detainees staff and legal organizations on behalf of immigrants the aclu alone has filed 90 legal actions regarding covid-19 including state and city chapters that have filed lawsuits against us immigration and customs enforcement ice detention centers and processing centers in california maryland massachusetts michigan ohio pennsylvania texas and washington aclu 2020a 2020b as early as march 2020 a federal court in harrisburg pa ruled that ice must release 10 individuals who had sued on the basis of being at high risk of contracting coronavirus aclu-pa 2020 similar decisions were handed down in new jersey and massachusetts in april 2020 a federal judge in california ordered an ice detention facility to release detainees and facilitate social distancing kopetman 2020 a ruling followed by a federal judge in miami who ordered three ice facilities in south florida to release detainees due to the pandemic madan 2020a most recently another federal judge ordered the government to better explain why it had yet to release more than 350 parents and children from three family detention centers merchant 2020 on march 15 a coalition of immigration system functionaries including judges attorneys and ice officers sent a letter to the us department of justice requesting an emergency closure of the nations immigration courts brennan center 2020 subsequently a lawsuit was brought to suspend in-person immigration court processing during the outbreak a petition denied by a federal judge in washington dc kruzel 2020 the judge ruled that since the immigration system writ large had already modified its practices and protocols in light of covid-19 no sweeping stoppage of cases was warranted the coronavirus outbreak has also provided the trump administration with a pretext for alterations to existing immigration policies early on in the outbreak dhs moved to close the southern border immediately removing any migrants encountered by cbp by sending them back to mexico or central america within about two hours those from other nations are transferred to ice for rapid deportation including those potentially seeking asylum and children associated press 2020 this order was first issued in march and has since been renewed in april and may the latter of which notably had no end date on may 19 2020 the doj asked the 9th circuit court of appeals to replace the flores agreement which would allow the administration to modify the rules governing the detention of migrant children and families in dhs facilities though this too was predicated on stopping the spread of the coronavirus the administration announced as early as 2019 its desire to modify the court settlement flores was what also was used to justify family separation policies in 2018 stracqualursi et al 2019 due to the public health and economic threat posed by the virus the administration has also suspended immigration to the us for at least 60 days beginning in april to limit competition for jobs associated press 2020 the legal issues discussed above are myriad and dynamic impacting various aspects of the immigration system from lawful immigration to asylum seekers and refugees to unaccompanied children and detention center conditions while each of these deserve full empirical attention this paper focuses on three particular areas of immigration policy and practice during covid ice enforcement actions immigrant detention and deportations we summarize the current state of extant data and evidence on each of these and examine questions that remain for further research on march 18th 2020 ice announced that it would cease enforcement actions during covid-19 except for individuals who have committed crimes or pose a threat to public safety in an effort to decrease the spread of the virus and to encourage those who need medical attention to seek it specifically ice stated that during the covid-19 crisis ice will not carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities such as hospitals doctors offices accredited health clinics and emergent or urgent care facilities except in the most extraordinary of circumstancesindividuals should not avoid seeking medical care because they fear civil immigration enforcement ice 2020 ice also temporarily suspended in-person reporting requirements as well as home visitations despite this announcement ice conducted immigration raids in states such as california even after the governor had declared a state of emergency and issued a stay at home order los angeles times 2020 though it did make fewer arrests in april compared to march ice still conducted operations leading to the arrest of at least 80 people in the los angeles area alone perrett 2020 other ice enforcement actions since the start of the coronavirus pandemic have taken place as well including an arrest of an 18-year-old on his birthday residing in an office of refugee resettlement shelter in westchester ny sidahmed 2020 this individual was then transferred to immigrant detention at a nearby county correctional facility at the height of new yorks coronavirus surge residents in san diego and riverside counties in southern california report increased border patrol checkpoints along i-15 a major throughway running north through the state from the mexican border as well as checkpoints along state roads increased use of roving patrols and at least four arrests since march 23 have also been reported to the media srikrishnan 2020 in the weeks prior to the march 18th announcement reports surfaced that immigrants were being targeted at hospitals courthouses and their childrens school burness and hindi 2020 lanard 2020 the miami herald reported that new arrests continued throughout the end of march including for those with non-criminal offenses madan 2020b these arrests were particularly notable as these individuals were then detained in several south florida detention facilities which have since become plagued with coronavirus these facilities have also been the target of legal action and ordered by the federal courts to release detainees due to unsafe conditions madan 2020a though ice pledged to limit enforcement actions during the pandemic the current situation in its detention facilities are significantly impacted by the administrations immigration crackdown in early 2020 when new york for example saw initial court appearances double in february and march compared to the december and january in the weeks prior to the march 18th announcement ice ramped up enforcement actions including a march 6 raid in new rochelle ny just hours before the area being designated a containment zone by governor andrew cuomo devereaux 2020 major ice operations were also carried out in michigan and ohio in early february well after coronavirus had gotten a foothold in the us warikoo 2020 prior to covid 19 a growing body of evidence was accumulating that immigrants are exposed to dangerously poor health conditions and services within ice detention centers immigrant adults and children in detention centers experience detrimental physical and mental health outcomes as do family units and households outside the immigration detention centers long 2018 ornelas et al 2020 for example detained immigrants have increased levels of musculoskeletal gastrointestinal respiratory and neurologic symptoms while being detained and also commonly experienced anxiety depression posttraumatic stress disorder difficulty with relationships and self-harming behavior immigration detention itself undermines family authority and ability to respond to their childrens needs this difficulty is complicated by parental mental health problems in more extreme cases immigrants mortality and death have been associated with being detained long 2018 ornelas et al 2020 a 2018 report titled code red the fatal consequences of dangerously substandard medical care in immigration detention reviewed fifteen deaths that occurred in ice detention between december 2015 and april 2017 long 2018 with the help of medical experts the report concludes that in more than half of those cases substandard medical care including unreasonable delays botched emergency responses and poor practitioner care contributed to the deaths many have argued that because immigration detention centers are private the lack of transparent policy health procedures and practices contribute to poor health conditions and services common in these detention centers ackerman and furman 2013 hernndez et al 2018 others suggest that poor health conditions and services are common in immigration detention centers because of the social political and cultural construction as undocumented or illegal immigrants are inherently criminal who do not warrant public healthcare attention and care ackerman and furman 2013 miller and peguero 2018 zarrugh 2020 this leads us to our question for this section are immigration dentition centers a shrouded hotspot for covid-19 although the situation changes on a daily basis ongoing reports indicate that this system of inadequate medical access care and resulting poor health conditions and outcomes has only been exacerbated by covid-19 because the demand for medical needs are greater for everyone generally the gap between need and supply has only become more apparent in detention centers it is especially dire for people in such facilities given that exposure to the virus can lead to relatively quick and life-threatening consequences like many facilities tasked with providing medical care these detention facilities must now concern themselves with need for covid tests personal protective equipment like gloves and masks and increased access to medical treatments such as oxygen and ventilators due to the highly contagious nature of covid-19 the crowded conditions of detention centers exacerbates the situation placing those held in these facilities at greater risk for contracting and spreading the virus this is true for those who are detained as well as employees at these facilities as of this articles writing ices website reports that as of may 11 2020 there are 29675 people being detained with 869 confirmed covid-19 cases with 1686 having been tested the website states that 42 ice employees working at detention centers have confirmed cases numbers are updated on ices website under the tab confirmed cases httpswwwicegovcoronavirus the heightened risk at detention centers can be evaluated in more concrete terms against cdc guidelines in short detention centers cannot meet those basic general guidelines social distancing of an ideal six feet is impossible to implement within detention centers given the spatial and physical limitations this inability also means that if someone at a detention center an employee or a detainee contracts the virus the likelihood of spread is increased along with the potential speed and magnitude of spread the danger of the situation is intensified in that many people may be asymptomatic carriers and spread the virus without knowing johns hopkins university 2020 in cramped quarters by the time symptoms start to show many may have already been infected additionally people who are detained have limited ability to use disease prevention measures like hand-washing both due to access and supplies it is harder to practice medical isolation which the cdc defines as confining a confirmed or suspected covid-19 case ideally to a single cell with solid walls and a solid door that closes to prevent contact with others and to reduce the risk of transmission ncird 2020 and it is more difficult to institute a quarantine which the cdc defines as the practice of confining individuals who have had close contact with a covid-19 case to determine whether they develop symptoms of the disease ncird 2020 acknowledging that facilities like jails prisons and detention centers possess significant impediments to these recommendations the cdc has produced the article interim guidance on management of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in correctional and detention facilities ncird 2020 in it guidance for correctional and detention facilities is organized into three sections 1 operational preparedness which aims to prepare a facility for the situation of transmission of covid-19 into the facility 2 prevention which concerns preventing the spread from outside to inside of the facility and 3 management of covid-19 which describes how to manage confirmed and suspected cases yet still numerous reports internal strikes and resulting lawsuits indicate that many facilities fail to meet these guidelines per the lancet ice facilities do not have the staffing capacity or facilities to screen quarantine to monitor for symptoms isolate infected individuals or deliver medical management in a setting with high rate of infection meyer et al 2020 other reports have found a lack of needed supplies and ppe such as cleaning supplies masks gloves trevizo 2020 and some have noted that detainees are not being given ppe nor are they being tested even when they are sick and showing symptoms of covid-19 lippa 2020 detainees have reported that access to soap hand sanitizer and disinfecting equipment is very limited or non-existent montoya-galvez 2020d as a result of these conditions detainees at facilities across the country have organized related strikes and protests some examples include hunger strikes that have been organized across california including a 200 person strike at otay mesa detention center in san diego where at the time 120 detainees had confirmed cases plevin 2020 and a strike at adelanto ice processing center prompted by staffs failure to provide detainees ppe including masks gloves and cleaning supplies castillo 2020 protests have also been organized in detention centers in louisiana montoya-galvez 2020d and at least five hunger strikes have taken place at an ice processing center in pearsall texas alone  some because detainees are asking for information as detainees have reported being given false information about numbers and not being told about who has the virus and some for greater testing after positive cases trevizo 2020 since the spatial parameters of detention centers precludes the cdc guidelines of medical isolation and quarantining many are instead using a practice of cohorting which refers to isolating cases in groups and quarantining groups of people together who have possibly been exposed while the cdc outlines this practice in its guidelines for detention centers it is intended as a last resort one federal lawsuit has already been filed which alleges immigration officials are violating cdc guidelines by using cohorting instead of releasing immigrant detainees where possible joffe-block and fernndez 2020a since immigration detention is a civil and not criminal matter ice has the broad authority to release its detainees including by placing them in programs in which officials monitor them through ankle bracelets or check-ins montoya-galvez 2020f and many similar lawsuits have been filed pushing for releases as of may 15 2020 the aclu website states that it has filed 90 legal actions regarding covid-19 wwwacluorg these include state and city chapters that have filed lawsuits against ice detention centers and processing centers in california maryland massachusetts michigan ohio pennsylvania texas and washington american civil liberties union 2020a american civil liberties union 2020b aclu massachusetts 2020 aclu pennsylvania 2020 carmody 2020 coleman 2020 hancock 2020 morrissey 2020 an ongoing list of other organizations also filing lawsuits includes the university of miami school of laws immigration clinic the southern poverty law center rapid defense network legal aid service of broward county and the law firm of prada urizar pllc splc 2020 many of these lawsuits are seeking the release of detainees some with focus on high risk groups other groups like the new york lawyers for public interest nylpi have published reports documenting the poor conditions of detention centers and the increased urgency of these conditions in this era of covid-19 the nylpi report still detained and denied found serious often life-threatening deficiencies in the medical care provided to new yorkers in area immigration detention centers nylpi 2020 federal judges in some states have allowed for the release of small numbers of detainees who are at high risk for contracting the virus but many advocacy groups and lawmakers say it is not enough to address the dangerous conditions in which detainees are being forced to exist montoya-galvez 2020c at the end april a group of 26 senators signed a letter calling on the department of homeland security to investigate ice detention facilities to assess whether they have adopted necessary guidelines in regard to covid-19 us sentator d feinstein 2020 reports suggest a lack of transparency when it comes to number of confirmed cases some inaccuracy comes from the testing rate only about 5 of the population of people detained have been tested trevizo 2020 some reports note ices initial unwillingness to share numbers about cases and that it took lawsuits to prompt ice to share this information splc 2020 other reports highlight instances in which ice has released information that is later contradicted thus leading to questions about the accuracy of information provided joffe-block and fernndez 2020b lack of transparency is a similar issue for employee cases while ice reports numbers of confirmed cases among its employees at detention centers this does not include the many other employees at these facilities who are not directly employed by ice those who work for the county or private health care companies etc gomez et al 2020 detainees are also facing greater impediments to having their concerns heard and their experiences during the pandemic shared some detention centers are requiring lawyers to bring their own ppe to meet detainees gomez et al 2020 and many facilities do not have teleconferencing that allows for confidentiality due to unsecure connections or having to have conversations in earshot of employees gomez et al 2020 reports have also been surfacing about liability waivers detainees being required to sign liability waivers in exchange for ppe democracy now 2020 proctor 2020 rivlin-nadler 2020 and detainees being coerced into signing a paperwork that provides a positive evaluation of conditions in the detention center acevedo 2020 ice has also been minimizing and in cases outright denying some of the aforementioned strikes and protests in detention centers despite reports and evidence otherwise brown 2020 castillo 2020 beginning in the 1980s immigration law reforms merged practices from criminal law and justice with immigration law and enforcement the cumulative effect of which was to create a murky area in which immigration policing practices and court processes are not regulated by the constitutional protections afforded to individuals within the criminal justice system garca hernndez 2013 namely the 4th search and seizure 5th due process and 6th right to counsel amendments individuals within 100 miles of us international borders may be subjected to warrantless searches chacn 2010 noncitizens can legally be deported without judicial review menjvar et al 2018 though immigrants appearing in immigration court technically have a right to counsel the immigration courts are in no way obligated to provide them with counsel if they do not provide their own most are unable eagly and shafer 2015 this trend towards the tightening of immigration allowances while limiting protections increased under the obama administration as was evidenced through an upsurge in detention and deportation miller and peguero 2018 ricciardelli et al 2019 yet under the trump administration the rate of detentions and deportations has escalated to unprecedented levels policies enacted in the past three years that have contributed to this increase include promotion of a us southern border wall implementation of zero-tolerance which ordered the separation of children from their families and their subsequent detainment without a clear means to facilitate reunion deployment of 5000 us soldiers to the southern border and sanctioned use of teargas on children and families trying to cross and industrial tent facilities that housed over 3000 separated children adolescents without due process hernndez et al 2018 van hook and glick 2020 zarrugh 2020 it is important to note these policies and lack of protections for context as we move into our final considerations first how immigration policies both prior to covid-19 and under its guise are accelerating the us towards a near total dismantling of protections for immigrant men women children and families second through implementation of these policies is the us government spreading and deporting covid-19 since march 21 2020 the southern border of the united states has been in effect sealed the day before the centers for disease control and prevention cdc had issued a largely unnoticed but sweeping order authorizing the summary expulsion of noncitizens arriving at the border without valid documents guttentag 2020 by application of a medical quarantine authorization the order supersedes the protections of the immigration and refugee laws through the use of an unreviewable border patrol health expulsion mechanism unrelated to any finding of disease or contagion guttentag 2020 in the six weeks between the order and the beginning of may the us expelled over 20000 migrants montoya-galvez 2020a through either deportation to their country of citizenship or for cross-border migrants by processing and then returning them to mexico or canada montoya-galvez 2020b a process that takes on average 96 min hernndez and miroff 2020 access to us immigration courts is denied as is the opportunity to file a claim for humanitarian protection montoya-galvez 2020a individuals seeking refuge through asylum and unaccompanied children groups that are normally protected by both us and international law have been pointedly targeted in the enforcement of this measure between 2016 and 2018 the us government initiated two immigration policies that were designed to function as barriers specifically to migrants seeking asylum metering and the migrant protection protocols mpp according to the immigration and nationality act ina any alien who is physically present in the united states or who arrives in the united states whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the united states after having been interdicted in international or united states waters irrespective of such aliens status may apply for asylum immigration and nationality act 1952 the practice of metering contrary to the ina works by requiring all requests for asylum to cross the border at a port of entry and then limiting the number of people who are able to access asylum at each port of entry frederick 2019 american immigration council 2020a guards at these border crossings direct individuals who are barred from the process to a point-person on the mexican side of the border where his or her name is placed on a waiting list the backlog of which can require days or months of waiting in mexico with daily check-ins regarding an individuals list status lu and watkins 2019 under mpp or the remain in mexico program if access to make a claim of asylum is granted the individual is given notice to appear in immigration court and then as the program title suggests returned to mexico to await the court date american immigration council 2020a in 2019 over 60000 people were returned to mexico under mpp miroff 2020 as a result improvised camps have sprung up along the border in mexico outside of ports of entry camps that are lacking in basic sanitation reliable access to medical services food or water sources and security glass et al 2019 the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr has issued a statement that they are prepared to fold them under their protection and management as refugee camps van fossen 2020 and yet the us and mexico have both been unwilling to declare the situation on the border officially an emergency the mechanism required for the unhcr to take over van fossen 2020 unhcr refugee status would allow for three broad protections 1 basic needs in the form of shelter and security 2 the implementation of infrastructure necessary to support large-scale health initiatives and 3 access to a lawyer van fossen 2020 mexicos stated reasoning for denying the unhcr is they do not want permanent settlements glass et al 2019 the united states logic is less well-defined unless juxtaposed next to the goal of ending asylum along the southern border according to elora mukherjee professor of law and director of the immigrants rights clinic at columbia law school given the complexity of immigration law and language and cultural barriers the process of seeking asylum when someone is in the united states is hard enough requiring asylum seekers to remain in mexico makes navigating the process virtually impossible as it severely limits migrants access to legal counsel mukherjee 2020 only 4 of those who remain in mexico under mpp have been able to access a lawyer mukherjee 2020 in 2018 the year before mpp was enacted the us granted asylum to 13248 people miroff 2020 as of december of 2019 one year after mpp began 29309 cases had been processed and 187 people were granted asylum mukherjee 2020 until the public health order of march 20th 2020 one group that was exempt from the asylum processes discussed above was that of unaccompanied minors defined by us law to be a child who is under the age of 18 has no lawful immigration status and either does not have a parent or legal guardian in the united states or that parentlegal guardian is unable to care for them homeland security act of 2002 resulting from the us supreme court decision reno v flores the flores agreement set standards of legal protections for unaccompanied minors in the custody of us immigration agencies wu 2018 these standards were codified by the william wilberforce trafficking victims protection reauthorization acts of 2000 tvpra reauthorized in 2003 2005 2008 and 2013 under tvpra unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries must be transferred from cbpice custody to health and human services hhs office of refugee resettlement orr within three days montoya-galvez 2020b orr is mandated to keep the minors in the least restrictive setting until they can be released to either family members or approved sponsors while they wait for their immigration court proceedings cheatham 2020 under tvpra dhs is mandated to the greatest extent practicable that unaccompanied children in hhs custody have counsel  not only to represent them in legal proceedings but to protect them from mistreatment exploitation and trafficking american immigration council 2020b in march of 2020 orr received 1852 from cbp custody in april that number fell to just 58 montoya-galvez 2020g understanding the scope of this issue is challenging due to the same transparency issues discussed previously in the section on detention under covid-19 the number of children specifically unaccompanied minors who have been expelled under cdc order is not reported by the dhs though multiple news sources have put that number for the month of april between 400 and 700 children montoya-galvez 2020a guttentag and bertozzi 2020 though immigration officials in guatemala have reported receiving 417 minors alone from us custody since march otoole and carcamo 2020a now under the covid-19 public health order the asylum system is in effect shut down for both accompanied minors and adults the mpp courts have been closed through june 19 2020 though that date could easily be pushed back us department of justice 2020 many of those awaiting asylum hearings are forced to continue to wait in the border camps discussed above without access to basic needs or medical services like the detention centers the camp conditions are primed for the proliferation and rampant spread of the virus the legality of such a closure has been questioned by immigrant rights groups and legal experts guttentag 2020 the one avenue to protection that remains open is through the convention against torture cat miroff 2020 a form of relief for which the barriers to attainment are higher than those of asylum but with fewer the protections granted american immigration council 2020a limitations of cat that are allowed through asylum status include the inability to apply for a green card to bring family members to the united states and ever leave us soil without losing their cat status american immigration council 2020a between march 21 and the beginning of may 2020 59 screening interviews were conducted by uscis 54 applicants were rejected and three cases were pending only two people had been granted cat protections miroff 2020 although it is under the auspices of a public health emergency that the united states has temporarily stopped processes for the issuing of green cards and asylum claims limited access to immigration courts prevented the placement of children with foster families and turned away hundreds of unaccompanied minors at the border ice air the transportation arm of immigration and customs enforcement ice responsible for arranging transportation and deportation of immigrants by air is part of the pre-coronavirus system that has continued to function with efficiency since march these deportations are pulling individuals from detention facilities where as discussed previously both physical structures and covid-19 cohorting policies provide a perfect storm for rapid spread of the disease and the scope of disease incidence is not well known due to limited testing thus far one out of every two people who have been tested had positive results though as of this writing that accounts for less than 57 of detainees ice 2020 since president trump declared covid-19 a national emergency on march 13 2020 united states government 2020 a good deal of evidence exists to suggest that the united states the epicenter for coronavirus is actively exporting the disease particularly to central america and the caribbean while statistics on the number of detainees who have been deported through ice air since the us declaration of a national emergency are not publicly available an analysis conducted by the center for economic policy and research determined that between march 15th and april 24th ice air made 71 flights collectively to guatemala honduras el salvador brazil nicaragua ecuador haiti and the dominican republic johnston 2020 as of april 17 2020 the ice screening process for detainees boarding ice air flights consisted of a temperature check in the flight line those with a fever above 99 degrees are removed for medical evaluation us immigration and customs enforcement 2020 according to an ice spokesperson they lack capacity to administer tests to all passengers on ice air flights prioritizing who gets tested depends on evolving operational considerations montoya-galvez 2020e deportees to haiti mexico jamaica guatemala and columbia have all tested positive for the virus upon arrival in their home countries mohammed et al 2020 twenty-percent of guatemalas covid-19 cases have been traced directly to the covid-positive status of returned detainees montoya-galvez 2020e haiti already on the edge of famine has only 62 ventilators for a population of over 11 million people sieff and miroff 2020 its capacity for quarantine exists within four hotels with 111 beds since april all 111 have been designated to migrants returned on ice deportation flights charles 2020 in recognition of this the governments of both guatemala and haiti have repeatedly asked the us to temporarily cease ice air flights charles and madan 2020 otoole and carcamo 2020b guatemala has gone so far as to stop deportations from the us three times first on march 17th by suspending all incoming flights in order to create the space and time for both their government and the us government to establish health protocols to help them address the covid-19 deportation crisis mcdonnell et al 2020 madan and charles 2020 as of late april the us began testing immigrants prior to deportation narea 2020 but as noted above the testing is in no way comprehensive the danger covid-19 poses to health systems in countries with already vulnerable public health infrastructure is both direct and potentially catastrophic it will overwhelm marginal economic systems further exacerbating living conditions that demand of many that they must migrate in order to survive the issues examined here confirm three realities for the us immigration system first despite a stated moratorium on ice enforcement ie police actions issued in march agents continue to conduct immigration raids set up checkpoints and make arrests while ice cautioned that it would continue to take action against undocumented immigrants that pose a public safety risk the criminal records of many of those targeted are hardly what one might expect to justify police raids during a pandemic eg drunk driving drug possession there are also reports of ice detaining other immigrants along with the original targets of the raids including family members or associates that are simply nearby these anecdotes coupled with a distrust of ice more generally has reportedly led to widespread fear that these continued enforcement actions may prevent the sick from seeking medical treatment if they are undocumented evidence to date also indicates that ice detention facilities are likely shrouded covid-19 hotspots insofar as detention facilities generally are unable to adhere to cdc guidelines and testing is limited and sporadic it is improbable that these locations can effectively detect and control the virus when it is present indeed a litany of legal actions have been undertaken to remedy some of the most obvious problems and facilities in the ice detention system though the agency generally has been slow to respond to these directives moreover there is evidence that instead of releasing detainees many are simply shuffled around to other facilities with more space available in some cases such as in south florida these receiving facilities have already experienced a covid outbreak finally data gathered to date indicate that deportations have continued during the pandemic and the asylum system has been in effect dismantled by the administrations response these deportations are concerning for at least two main reasons first that the us continues to violate its own and international law regarding asylum claims second that us policy is contributing to the spread of coronavirus throughout latin america and the caribbean as noted above deportees to haiti mexico jamaica guatemala and columbia have already tested positive for the virus upon arrival in their home countries mohammed et al 2020 and 23 of guatemalas coronavirus cases have been traced directly to the covid-positive status of returned detainees montoya-galvez 2020e as additional data are gathered there are sure to be further cases linked to the us immigration system though the production and acquisition of empirical data related to covid-19 and the immigration system are in its infancy this paper sought to highlight how covid-19 global pandemic has changed our current understanding of the relationships between immigration policy and justice in the us it is also important to note that we are only in the initial stages and logically the beginning of even understanding or hypothesizing how covid-19 will impact us immigration policy and justice as well as how other nations attempt to grapple with the complexities of immigration and justice during a pandemic the emerging reports arguments and conceptualizations of us immigration and justice discussed here only highlights the important advances to be made towards better understanding the correlates contexts and interactions of us immigration policy and justice during a global pandemic we encourage future research to further expand our evidence-based understanding of how covid-19 has impacted us immigration policies and practices particularly in regard to the pursuit of justice but more importantly it is vital to utilize evidence-based research to pursue just us immigration policies and practices in this covid-19 era  title page decontamination of n95 masks against coronavirus a

uncertain which method to decontaminate n95 is most suitable and should be recommended to healthcare professionals worldwide objectives the aim of this scoping review was to map and compile the available evidence about the effectiveness of decontaminating n95 masks against coronavirus we selected studies written in english assessing or discussing decontamination strategies of n95 masks against coronavirus the search and study screening were performed in pubmed and scopus by two independent researchers a descriptive analysis was performed considering the study design of included studies we included nineteen studies eight articles were letter to the editors five were in vitro studies three were literature reviews and three were classified as other study designs the use of vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation were the strategies most cited however there is a lack of evidence and consensus related to the best method of n95 masks decontamination the evidence towards decontamination strategies of n95 masks against coronavirus remains scarce vaporized hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet irradiation seem the current standard for n95 masks decontamination  the novel coronavirus known as sars-cov2 has produced a social disruption globally with severe consequences for general health of the population at the present moment there are more than 11 million confirmed cases with a cumulative number of deaths of over 500000 according to world health organization who updated data can be accessed in httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus currently vaccines are still under trial and there are no effective drugs for the treatment of this disease 1  indeed most of the available evidence provided is that social distancing wearing masks and eye protection are effective in the prevention of transmission 2  also better hygiene hand washing and use of sanitizers are supported to detain spreading of the disease 3 4 5  the use of masks has been recommended by who and around the world governments have established face protection policies in public space 6  the resulting increase in demand and a shortage in their availability in the market have led to price spikes for masks 7 8 9 10 11  health professionals are at high risk for infection with the new coronavirus and a lack of adequate protective equipment during critical procedures in infected patients is increasing that risk considerably 12 13  in brazil for example more nurses and nurses assistants have died due to covid-19 than anywhere else 14 and most of them have been infected during their work with infected patients n95 masks are a type of respirator mask used as a facial protection specifically by healthcare providers 9 15  they have the capacity to filter over 95 of pollutant particles 03 m in the air and have been suggested to be used to reduce the risk of covid-19 spreading too 16  due to their high costs and limited availability 8 15

methods for n95 masks decontamination hydrogen peroxide vapor decontamination is a common method used in different fields and facilities including scientific pharmaceutical and medical ones the method has low toxicity and uses the catalytic reduction of peroxide to oxygen and water 35  however it needs a specific room and equipment to achieve an effective decontamination and hence is rather expensive ultraviolet irradiation is a method of decontamination using ultraviolet light to inactivate microorganisms through dna damage and jeopardizing cell functions 36  the use of this decontamination method has limitations due different mask needing different irradiation dosages high dosage in turn could result in high toxicity and structural damage of the mask moreover it also needs specific equipment limiting its availability ideally any decontamination method should eliminate all pathogens maintain mask integrity and filter capacity at low toxicity and costs until a method does not fulfill these criteria the extended use of masks seems to be a good and low-cost approach to overcome the discussed limitations in availability current recommendations consider mask wearing periods between 4 and 40 hours 28  notably additional protection such as use of face shield and strict adherence to hand hygiene practices are needed especially if extending mask wearing periods 37  outcomes such as mechanical integrity and performance of n95 masks should be observed when assessing decontamination strategies of n95 masks as decontamination may come at a price

not conduct a risk of biasquality assessment of the included studies second we included only studies in english third the included studies present different designs and protocols making it difficult to compare the results specially because many brands of n95 are available on the market different regimens were tested and individual scenarios of wearers such as influence of as cosmetics or sunscreens use for ultraviolet decontamination are difficult to test finally we included article discussing decontamination methods based on opinions over evidences making it difficult better

be doffed without touching its surface and the doffed mask should be put directly into a plastic bag or stainless-steel box for steam and avoiding contamination of the surface of other items they also presume that the masks can be used for up to seven or ten days if they keep clean and fitted and have not been damaged by other factors therefore this study is valuable for solving the great shortage of masks in many countries for fighting the covid-19 pandemic it can also minimize unnecessary waste and protect the environment for discarding reusable masks narla et al  the study states that it

neurologic complications stroke is a major concern as there is at this point a trend in the rise of neurovascular cases especially stroke from large arteries and to a great extent in young patients although the pathophysiology is still not fully explained it is known that patients with covid-19 are prone to a hypercoagulability or dyscrasia states in the same fashion as happens with other viruses such as hiv 68 cytomegalovirus varicella-zoster 69 hepatitis c epstein-barr 70 sars-cov 6 and mers-cov 10 of the 43 mentioned cases of stroke 38 88 were ischemic and the remaining 5 22 were hemorrhagic this series is proportional to data previously described of vascular events unrelated to infections that is the ratio of ischemic to hemorrhagic strokes in neurovascular services is usually between 80 to 90 ischemic to 10-20 hemorrhagic strokes which could raise a suspicion that in a few cases infection of covid-19 could be coincidental however this line of though seems to be invalid for most cases due to the undoubtful increase in cases of young people or people without comorbidities that raise the risk of stroke to the occurrence of multi infarctions in both hemispheres without proven cardioembolic etiology usually the culprit in bilateral manifestations and to the confirmation by some author like kiok of a greater than usual incidence of thrombotic complications of any sort not only neurological special attention to immediate care and to thrombolysis or thrombectomy should be sought in cases of ischemic stroke especially the ones from large cerebral arteries prone to graver outcomes and death on the other hand the greater risk of bleedings due to the coronavirus septic dyscrasic state is to be considered finally higher risk of renal impairment by the multi-organ failure due to sars-cov-2 is worrying especially in patients receiving iodine contrast for cts and angiographies and plays against optimal outcomes from stroke specifically about anosmia it is probable that trans-synaptic or transcribrial invasion proposed by baig et al 71  ie via axonal retrograde path of the olfactory nerve explains only partially this symptom as many patients that

olfactory bulb invasion by the virus and also to the fact that in one case galougahi performed an mri of a patient with covid-19 and found no alterations in the olfactory bulb -more cases with imaging are needed to warrant the confirmation of no acute injury detected in the olfactory bulb dysgeusia could be due to edema andor inflammation as happens with other airborne infections but also to direct damage of gustatory papillae taste buds in the same fashion of invasiveness to the olfactory nerve by binding to ace-2 receptors as theorized by finsterer and stollberger 72  moreover it is not clear how patients with anosmia could be less prone to severe forms of covid-19 as the study by yan et al found one theoretical explanation is that in patients where trans-synaptic invasion occurs nervous system damage by other pathways ie via bloodstream or cytokine storm as proposed by wu et al 73  is mitigated however this needs further exploration and research also the prevalence of anosmia varied widely in studies -51 35 47 586 and 75 in 5 reportsinferring that it may be possible that milder degrees of smell impairment go unnoticed as the study leaded by moein concludes after confronting self-declaration and diagnosis after application of the upsit test which is more reliable than self-awareness of smell loss regarding gbs it is becoming increasingly clear that neurological deficits from polyneuropathy may arise earlier than expected to the extreme of starting before respiratory symptoms as reported by zhao this case specifically is an odd manifestation as the vast majority of neurological symptoms in gbs start weeks after the original infection usually but not exclusively respiratory or from the gastrointestinal tract or systemic like in dengue and zika viruses this may be because nerve damage results from direct damage para-infectious and not from crossed immunity against components of the myelin sheath or the axon the usual mechanism of polyneuropathy in gbs

authors consider it to be a demyelinating form due to absence of some f waves there is also reduction of amplitude in the antidromic sensitive conduction study of the left median and ulnar nerves and in the motor conduction study of the left peroneal nerve which is commonly found in axonal forms however study was performed on day 5 of symptoms a bit early to define more precisely by nerve conduction techniques the gbs form and could be repeated later for better clarification finally miller-fisher syndrome consisting of ataxia areflexia and ophthalmoplegia sometimes not all of those was observed by gutirrez-ortiz and dinkin it is noticeable that although there is a considerable number of guidelines and protocols proposed by sub-specialty associations a substantial level on uncertainty is perceptible for instance there are doubts about maintenance of steroids and at which dosage and the same applies to ace-2 inhibitors widely used by many neurological patients such as people with muscular dystrophy stroke and neuroimmune diseases in this paper we proposed a chronological review of information available of 41 papers of cases and also declarations issued by neurological sub-specialties about the impact of covid-19 regarding clinical aspects -the prevalence of neurologic symptoms manifestations in the cns pns and neurovascular system and guidelines concerning specific handling of disease groups populations in neurology most of the data so far comes from reports from countries where covid cases were or are significantly high -80 of reports come

seems that patients with severe disease tend to display more frequent alterations of the nervous system than patients with mild or moderate cases patients with a particular complaint -anosmia seemed less prone to aggravation and need of hospitalization as one study found that patients that were hospitalized were more frequently with intact olfactory and gustatory senses prevalence of this symptom varied widely -51t o 75 in five different reports data published so far points to less severity of neurological complications in 80-90 of times patients manifest a non-life-threatening neurological complaint and the remaining might require hospitalization and are in risk of sequelae and even death among the latter stroke is a major concern as there is at this point although still not clearly explained in terms of pathophysiology a trend in the rise of neurovascular cases and up to 5 of patients with covid could manifest stroke especially brain ischemia from large arteries and also cases in young patients with little or no comorbidities with time we expect to have a much broader learning of explanations for the causality of neurological symptoms by the new coronavirus due to more publications and also to better strength and quality of further published papers with more detailed and precise descriptions which tend to be peer-reviewed and vetted also recommendations from specialized organizations and associations tend to come with greater level of certainty finally acknowledging the fact that among all patients with neurological complications rt-pcr for covid-19 was positive in the csf in only one patient arises an intriguing question and needs further elaboration authors declare no conflicts of interest regarding the subjects discussed in this paper  cc-by-nc-nd

socio-economic determinants of the coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic  viktor stojkoski zoran utkovski petar jolakoski dragan tevdovski ljupco kocarev  the magnitude of the coronavirus disease pandemic has an enormous impact on the social life and the economic activities in almost every country in the world besides the biological and epidemiological factors a multitude of social and economic criteria also govern the extent of the coronavirus disease spread in the population consequently there is an active debate regarding the critical socio-economic determinants that contribute to the resulting pandemic in this paper we contribute towards the resolution of the debate by leveraging bayesian model averaging techniques and country level data to investigate the potential of 35 determinants describing a diverse set of socio-economic characteristics in explaining the coronavirus pandemic outcome  this is a preliminary report which includes data gathered up to 11th april 2020 it will be updated weekly so as to only include results based on data that is not older than two weeks  the coronavirus pandemic began as a simple outbreak in december 2019 in wuhan china however it quickly propagated to other countries and became a primary global threat it seems that most countries were not prepared for this pandemic as a consequence hospitals were overcrowded with patients and death rates due to the disease skyrocketed in particular as of the time of this writing 11th april 2020 there have been over 15 million cases and over 100 thousand deaths worldwide as a cause of the coronavirus induced disease covid-19 1  figure 1  histogram based on probability density estimation for the cases and deaths per million population using country level data the x-axis describes the observed value whereas the y-axis is the estimated probability density data taken on 11th april 2020 in order to reduce the impact of the disease spread most governments implemented social distancing restrictions such as closure of schools airports borders restaurants and shopping malls 1 in the most severe cases there were even lockdowns -all citizens were prohibited from leaving their homes this subsequently lead to a major economic downturn stock markets plummeted international trade slowed down businesses went bankrupt and people were left unemployed while in some countries the implemented restrictions had a significant impact on reducing the expected shock from the coronavirus the extent of the disease spread in the population greatly varied from one economy to another as illustrated in fig 1 a multitude of social and economic criteria have been attributed as potential determinants for the observed variety in the coronavirus outcome some experts say that the hardest hit countries also had an aging population 2 3  or an underdeveloped healthcare system 4 5  others emphasize the role of the natural environment 6 7  in addition while the developments in most of the countries follow certain common patterns several countries are notably outliers both in the number of documented cases and in the disease outcomehaving in mind the ongoing debate a comprehensive empirical study of the critical socio-economic determinants of the coronavirus pandemic would not only provide a glimpse on their potential impact but would also offer a guidance for future policies that aim at preventing the emergence of epidemics motivated by this observation here we perform a detailed statistical analysis on a large set of potential socio-economic determinants and explore their potential to explain the variety in the observed coronavirus casesdeaths among countries to construct the set of potential determinants we conduct a thorough review of the literature describing the social and economic factors which contribute to the spread of an epidemic we identify a total of 35 potential determinants that describe a diverse ensemble of social and economic factors including healthcare infrastructure societal characteristics economic performance demographic structure etc to investigate the performance of each variable in explaining the coronavirus outcome we utilize the technique of bayesian model averaging bma  bma allows us to isolate the most important determinants by calculating the posterior probability that they truly regulate the process at the same time bma provides estimates for their relative impact while also accounting for the uncertainty in the selection of potential determinants 8 9 10  based on the current data we observe patterns that suggest that there are only few determinants factors that have explanatory power for the coronavirus outcome as we will discuss in more detail in the sequel we observe that some of these factors are strongly related to the level of economic development and to the effect of population size in social interactions however we stress that at this point in time our observations require a careful interpretation for several reasons including the following i the analysis is based on aggregate quantities ie averages across geographic locations as such it does not include spatial inhomogeneity and hence can not capture potentially significant interactive local dynamics ii the parameters governing the time evolution of the disease spread and pandemic outcome are themselves dynamic and depend on the stage of the countrys epidemic and on the changing social response efforts while being aware of these potential shortcomings of our formulation in the absence of realistic models that adequately cover all relevant aspects this study provides the first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic factors of the coronavirus pandemic we expect that with the availability of new data and the improved understanding of the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic some of these shortcomings will be overcome yielding a more reliable interpretation of the results in a formal setting both the log of registered covid-19 cases and the log of covid-19 deaths are a result of a disease spreading process 11 12  the extent to which a disease spreads within a population is uniquely determined by its reproduction number this number describes the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population in which all individuals are susceptible to infection 13 14  obviously its magnitude depends on various natural characteristics of the disease such as its infectivity or the duration of infectiousness 15  and the social distancing measures imposed by the government 1 also it depends on a plethora on socio-economic factors that govern the behavioral interactions within a population 16 17  in general we never observe the reproduction number but instead its outcome ie the number of casesdeaths hence we can utilize the known properties of the reproduction number to derive a linear regression model m m for the coronavirus outcome as where for simplicity we denote both the log of registered covid-19 cases per million population and the log of covid-19 deaths per million population of country i as y i  we focus on registered quantities normalized on per capita basis for the dependent variable instead of raw values 3 as a means to eliminate the bias in the outcome arising as a consequence of the discrepancies in the sizes of the studied countries in the equation x m i it is a k m dimensional vector of socioeconomic explanatory variables that determine the dependent variable  m is the vector describing their marginal contributions  0 is the intercept of the regression and u i is the error term the s i term controls for the impact of social distancing measures of the countries and  is its coefficient finally we also include the term d i  with  capturing its marginal effect that measures the duration of the pandemics within the economy this allows us to control for the possibility that the countries are in a different state of the disease spreading process a central question which arises is the selection of the independent variables in m m  while the literature review offers a comprehensive overview of all potential determinants in reality we are never certain of their credibility in order to circumvent the problem of choosing a model and potentially ending up with a wrong selection we resort to the technique of bayesian model averaging bma bma leverages bayesian statistics to account for model uncertainty by estimating each possible model and thus evaluating the posterior distribution of each parameter value and probability that a particular model is the correct one 18  the bma method relies on the estimation of a baseline model m 0 that is used for evaluating the performance of all other models in our case m 0 is the model which encompasses only the effect of government social distancing measures and the duration of the pandemics in the country we measure the duration of pandemics in a country simply as the number of days since the first registered case whereas in order to assess the effect of government restrictions we construct a stringency index mathematically the index quantifies the average daily variation in government responses to the pandemic dynamics as a measure for the daily variation we take the oxford covid-19 stringency index 2  the oxford covid-19 stringency index is a composite measure that combines the daily effect of policies on school closures reduction of internal movement travel bans and other similar restrictions for each country we construct a weighted average of the index from all available data since their first registered coronavirus case up to the last date of data gathering to emphasize the effect of policy restrictions implemented on an earlier date in calculating the average value we put a larger weight on those dates this is because earlier restrictions have obviously a bigger impact on the prevention of the spread of the virus the procedure implemented to derive the average government stringency index is described in greater detail in section s21 of the supplementary material sm fig 2 visualizes the results from the baseline model we observe that the countries which had stringer policies also had less covid-19 cases and deaths as expected in addition the countries with longer duration of the crisis registered more cases and deaths per million population though the effect of this variable is negligible 2 more about the index developed by the oxford group can be read at wwwbsgoxacukresearchpublicationsvariation-government-responses-covid- 19

the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted april 17 2020  it is apparent that the baseline model can explain only a certain amount of the variations in registered covid casesdeaths a fraction of the rest we believe can be attributed to various socioeconomic determinants present within a society to derive the set of potential determinants we conduct a comprehensive literature review from the literature review we recognize a total of 35 potential socio-economic determinants listed in table 1  for a detailed description of the potential effect of the determinants we refer to the references given in the same table and the references therein in what follows we only describe in short the potential determinants on the basis of the socio-economic characteristic they exhibit healthcare infrastructure the healthcare infrastructure essentially determines both the quantity and quality with which health care services are be delivered in a time of an epidemic as measures for this determinant we include 4 variables which capture the quantity of hospital beds nurses and medical practitioners as well as the quality of the coverage of essential health services on the one hand studies report that well structured healthcare resources positively affect a countrys capacity to deal with pandemic emergencies 19 20 21 22 23 24 25  on the other hand the healthcare infrastructure also greatly impacts the countrys ability to perform testing and reporting when identifying the infected people in this regard economies with better structure are able to easily perform mass testing and more detailed reporting 26 27 28  national health statistics the physical and mental state of a person play an important role in the degree to which the individual is susceptible to a disease it is expected that a nation composed of unhealthy individuals should also experience greater consequences of an emergent epidemics 29 30 31 32  specifically metabolic disorders such as diabetes may intensify pandemic complications 33 34  whereas it has been observed that communicable diseases account for the majority of deaths in 5  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under

addition there is empirical evidence that adequate hygiene greatly reduces the rate of mortality 36 37  to quantify the national health characteristics we include 6 variables that asses the level of healthiness among the studied countries economic performance we evaluate the economic performance of a country through 6 variables this performance often mirrors the countrys ability to intervene in a case of a public health crisis 38 39 40 41 42  variables such as gdp per capita have been used in modeling health outcomes mortality trends cause-specific mortality estimation and health system performance and finances 43 44  for poor countries economic performance appears to improve health by providing the means to meet essential needs such as food clean water and shelter as well access to basic health care services however after a country reaches a certain threshold of gdp per capita few health benefits arise from further economic growth it has been suggested that this is the reason why contrary to expectations the economic downturns during the 20th century were associated with declines in mortality rates 45 46  observations indicate that what drives the health in industrialized countries is not absolute wealth or growth but how the nations resources are shared across the population 47  the more egalitarian income distribution within a rich country is associated with better health of population 48 49 50 51  nevertheless it is also known that in better economies the trade interactions and mobility of people is faster which may enhance the propagation of an transmitted disease 17 19 42 52 53  societal characteristics the characteristics of a society often reveal the way in which people interact and thus spread the disease in this aspect properties such as education and media usage reflect the level of a persons reaction and promotion of self-induced measures for reducing the spread of the disease 54 55 56 57 58  governing behavior such as control of corruption

infectious diseases 17 53 64 65 66  to measure the characteristics of a society we identify 9 variables demographic structure similarly to the national health statistics the demographic structure may evaluate the susceptibility of the population to a disease certain age groups may simply have weaker defensive health mechanisms to cope with the stress induced by the disease 67 68 69  in addition the location of living may greatly affect the way in which the disease is spread 70 71  to express these phenomena we collect 6 variables natural environment a preserved natural environment ensures healthy lives and promotes well-being for all at all ages in contrast countries where natural sustainability is deteriorated and observables such as air pollution are of immense magnitude are also more vulnerable to epidemic outbreak 6 7 72 73  however healthy natural environments also attract a plethora of tourists and thus may help in an easier transformation from epidemic to a pandemic we

determinants and estimate two distinct bma models in the first model the dependent variable is the log of covid-19 cases per million population whereas in the second model we investigate the critical determinants of the log of the mortality rate due to the coronavirus the data gathering and preprocessing procedure is described in section s1 whereas the mathematical background of bma together with our inference setup is given in section s22 tables 2 and 3 display the respective results in both tables the determinants are ordered according to their posterior inclusion probabilities pip given in the second column pip quantifies the posterior probability that a given determinant belongs to the true linear regression model besides this statistic we also provide the the posterior mean post mean and the posterior standard deviation post std post mean is an estimate of the average magnitude of the effect of a determinant whereas the post std evaluates the deviation from this value in the estimation procedure we a priori assume that the true model consists of the baseline model and 3 additional independent variables this implies that the prior inclusion probability of each potential determinant is around 009 hence we can divide the determinants into four groups according to their posterior inclusion probability value 74  determinants with strong evidence pip  05 the first group describes the determinants which have by far larger posterior inclusion probability than the prior one and thus there is strong evidence to be included in the true model we find two variables for which there is such evidence in explaining the coronavirus cases population size and gdp per capita pc the population size is negatively related to the number of registered covid-19 cases per million population whereas the gdp pc exhibits a positive effect on the same variable in the situation of coronavirus deaths however only the gdp pc remains a strong predictor with a positive magnitude determinants with medium evidence  05  pip  01 one variable displays medium evidence for being a crucial socio-economic determinant of the registered covid cases 19 -the government health spending with a positive impact when looking at the bma estimation of covid-19 deaths besides this determinant government effectiveness also shows a medium pip size determinants with weak evidence 01 pip 001 these are determinants which have a lower posterior than the prior probability to be included in the true model but still may account for some of the variations in the coronavirus outcome for the cases per million population there are 5 such determinants out of which 2 have a negative impact the percentage of the population using internet and the mortality rate from lack of hygiene the results suggest that life expectancy population density and a population consisting of majorly catholic population have a low evidence for having a negative marginal effect on the observed covid-19 cases there are 7 determinants for which there is low evidence to be included in the true model describing the coronavirus deaths four of them have a negative post mean population size rule of law control of corruption and mortality rate from lack of hygiene whereas the presence of catholic religion and the number of physicians pr capita exhibit a positive post mean value  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted april 17 2020  both coronavirus cases and coronavirus deaths is the level of economic development wealthier countries display larger susceptibility to the disease interestingly besides the level of economic development the population size is also a credible predictor of the registered coronavirus cases per million population with more populated economies showing greater resistance to being infected by the virus a plentiful of reasons can be used as a possible interpretation for these results for instance it is known that in structured populations the degree of epidemic spread scales inversely with population size 75  this is because everything else considered in larger populations it is easier to identify and target the critical individuals that are susceptible to the disease 76  in a similar fashion various explanations can be found for the observed effect of economic development such as increased population mobility and aging population however it could also be the case that more developed countries have a bigger testing power and provide better evidence for the coronavirus situation in fact this may be suggested by our discovery that there is a medium evidence for past government health expenditure to be positively associated with the coronavirus outcome clearly the interpretation of our analysis requires a more detailed background due to several reasons among these reasons is the fact that we include several potential determinants only through crude approximations in particular the level of social mixing is given simply as the average number of persons in a household or the dominant religion in the country we do not follow the exact social network structures within a population it is evident that the inhomogeneous nature of these spatial patterns has an essential role in propagation of diseases 17  in this regard in future versions of this study we aim to incorporate more detailed measures which capture the essence of social connectedness 77 the degree of individualism 78 andor community mobility data 3  in addition the spread of the coronavirus is obviously still in a transient regime even though we include a proxy for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic in each country this essentially hinders the development of a coherent modeling framework these underexpressed effects may play a significant role in the final outcome of the coronavirus pandemic nonetheless in the absence of a unifying framework covering all relevant aspects our investigation acts as the starting point for the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic factors of the coronavirus pandemic we believe that with the availability of new data and the improved understanding of the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic some of these shortcomings will be overcome yielding a more reliable interpretation of the results 1 neil ferguson daniel laydon

inclusion probabilities offer a more robust way of determining the effect of a variable in a model as opposed to using p-values for determining statistical significance of a model coefficient because they incorporate the uncertainty of model selection according to equations s3 and s4 it is clear that we need to specify priors for the parameters of each model and for the model probability itself to

association of humidity rh and ah with daily covid-19 cases persons r-062 -037 we have also investigated the role of aerosol in spreading the pandemic across india because its possible airborne nature for this we have investigated the association of aerosols aod and other pollutions no 2  with covid-19 cases during the study period and also during the first lockdown period 25 march-15 april in india we found a negative association in march when there were few cases but in april it shows positive association when the number of cases is more for aod it was r-041 and r028 respectively during the lockdown period aerosols aod and other pollutants no 2  an indicator of pm 25  reduced sharply with a percentage drop of about 36 and 37 respectively this reduction may have reduced the risk for covid-19 through air transmission due to the unavailability of aerosol particles as a base hysplit forward trajectory model also shows that surface aerosols may travel up to 4 km according to wind and direction within three h of its generation if coronavirus becomes airborne as suggested by many studies then it may have a higher risk of transmission by aerosols particles so relaxing in the lockdown and environmental rules in terms of pollutant emissions from power plants factories and other facilities would be a wrong choice and could result in more covid-19 incidences and deaths in india therefore the current study although limited suggests that it is doubtful that the spread of covid-19 would slow down in india due to meteorological factors like high temperature and high humidity because a large number of cases have already been reported in the range of high tem high relative and high absolute humidity regions of india thus our results in no way suggest that covid-19 would not spread in warm humid regions or during summermonsoon so effective public health interventions should be implemented across india to slow down the transmission of covid-19 if covid-19 is indeed sensitive to environmental factors it could be tested in the coming summer-monsoon for india so the only summer is not going to help india until monsoon is coming only government mitigations

in hot and humid conditions similar comments about the covid-19 have repeatedly been made by health officials as well as world leaders that the outbreak will slow down by summer due to decreased transmissivity bukhari and jameel 2020  also found a similar result in his model study they suggested that during the coming summer in the northern hemisphere the spread of coronavirus will be reduced in tropical regions it is also important to note that sars-cov which is a type of coronavirus loses its ability to survive in higher temperatures which may be due to the breakdown of their lipid layer

us states however their overall growth rate was lower but now the rate is much similar to the europe and usa he suggested that it could be due to a lower number of testing such as in india pakistan indonesia and african countries many countries such as singapore uae saudi arabia australia qatar taiwan and hong kong have performed more 2019-ncov tests per million people than the usa italy and several european countries it was suggested that non-testing was not an issue at least for the tropical countries at the beginning of april thousands of new cases have been documented in regions with tem 18 c suggesting that the role of warmer temperature in slowing the spread of the covid-19 as suggested earlier might only be observed at much higher temperatures unlike temperature most of the covid-19 cases were reported in the range of ah has consistently been between 3 and 9 gm 3 bukhari and jameel 2020  bukhari and jameel 2020 also suggested that if new cases in april and may continue to cluster within the observed range of ah ie 3 to 9gm 3  then the countries experiencing monsoon ie having high absolute humidity 10 gm 3  may see a slowdown in transmissions due to climatic factors but for india it is not true as many states having high temperate and high humidity are still leading in covid-19 cases in india like maharashtra and tamil nadu  fig 1  as for india the average ah is

defined as the water content in ambient air is a strong environmental determinant of other viral transmissions barreca and shimshack 2012 luo et al 2020  for example influenza viruses survive longer on surfaces or in droplets in cold and dry air -increasing the likelihood of subsequent transmission thus it is key to understand the effects of environmental factors on the ongoing outbreak to support decision-making about disease control especially in locations where the risk of transmission may have been underestimated such as in humid and warmer locations we examine variability in temperature tem relative humidity rh and absolute humidity ah and transmission of covid-19 across india we show that the observed patterns of covid-19 are not completely consistent with the hypothesis that high ah may limit the survival and transmission of this new virus bu et al 2020 found from a global perspective cities with a mean temperature below 24 c are all high-risk cities for 2019-ncov transmission before june in our case it is not true as in india the temperature was always high when the covid-19 growth rate is high few studies supporting the hypothesis that high temp and high humidity will reduce the case like wang et al 2020 find in their study under a linear regression framework high temperature and high humidity significantly reduces the transmission of covid-19 they reported that a onedegree celsius increase in temperature and a one percent increase in relative humidity lower r by 00225 and 00158 respectively the transmission of coronaviruses can be affected by several factors including climate conditions such as temperature and humidity population density and medical care quality  therefore understanding the relationship between weather and the transmission of covid-19 is the key to forecast the intensity and end time of this pandemic the number of 2019-ncov cases detected in a countrystate depends on multiple factors including testing population density

done earlier on covid-19 cases in china europe and the usa studying wuhan guangzhou and beijing covid-19 cased bu et al 2020 found a meteorological condition with the temperature between 13-19c and humidity between 50 and 80 was suitable for the survival and transmission of the coronavirus they also speculated that from february to the end of may 2020 the areas ranging the temperature 13  -24  are all key areas for disease prevention especially densely populated cities from june and after that the disease in regions with a mean temperature over 24 c will begin to subside they suggested before june 2020 cities with a global average temperature below 24 c are all under high-risk of the transmission of new coronaviruses after june the risk of disease transmission will be significantly reduced in the cities with a mean temperature reaching 24 c or higher our results for the indian case did not match with the hypothesis said above as average temperature for the indian region for march and april is above 24c even the covid-19 cases are increasing rapidly in india even though restrict lockdown is there based on their study of the spread of 2019-ncov bukhari and jameel 2020 hypothesize that the lower number of cases in tropical countries might be due to warm-humid conditions under which the spread of the virus might be slower as has been observed for other viruses they found that the relation between the number of 2019-ncov cases and temperature and absolute humidity observed is strong however the underlying reasoning behind this relationship is still not clear similarly they do not make clear that which environmental factor is more important it could be that either temperature or absolute humidity is more important or both may be equally or not important at all in the transmission of 2019-ncov the humidity dependency may be due to the less effective airborne nature of the viruses at higher absolute humidity thus reducing the overall indirect transmission of 2019-ncov at higher levels of humidity although higher humidity may increase the amount of virus deposited on surfaces and virus survival time in droplets on surfaces the reduction of the virus spread by indirect through air transmission may be the factor behind the reduced 2019-ncov spread in the humid climate these explanations are speculative and based on patterns observed for other coronaviruses urgent studyexperiments on the association between coronavirus transmission against temperature and humidity in laboratories are needed to understand these associations  cc-by-nd 40

et al 2020 as well as the open environment wang and du 2020  these studies suggest that covid-19 may be airborne and can give a high risk of transmission through aerosols aerosols are particles formed by solid or liquid particles dispersed and suspended in the air they contain soil particles industrial dust particles particulates emitted by automobiles bacteria microorganisms plant spore powders and other components when a person who was infected with the virus coughs sneezes breathes vigorously or speaks loudly the virus will be excreted from the body it may dissolve with the aerosol and become the bio-aerosols bio-aerosols ranging in size from 10 to 50 m generally remain in the air whereas larger particles are deposited on surfaces droplets spread in the space of about 1 to 2 m from the source of infection however aerosol can travel hundreds of meters or more wang and du 2020  in his many case studies of covid-19 speculated that the spread of the virus might be due to the aerosols because new patients in inner mongolia and wuhan were never in direct contact with the confirmed cases they found that covid-19 may transmit through aerosol directly but it needs to be further verified by experiments if the aerosols can spread covid-19 prevention and control will be much more difficult many of the information regarding 2019-ncov are still emerging such as the virus being airborne for more than 3 hours and having very different survival times on metals cardboards and plastics van doremalen et al 2020  doremalen et al 2020 found in his experiment that the covid-19 virus can remain viable in aerosols throughout his experiment 3 hours similar to that observed with sars-cov-1 santarpia et al 2020 in their clinical study found that sars-cov-2 is shed during respiration toileting and fomite contact indicating that infection may occur in both direct and indirect through aerosols contact although this study did not employ any size-fractionation techniques to determine the size range of sars-cov-2 droplets and particles the data was suggestive that viral aerosol particles are produced by individuals that have the covid-19 disease even in the absence of cough therefore the covid-19 may spread through the aerosols if the sufficient amount of aerosols is present in the environment also the reduction in aerosol concentration during the lockdown may reduce the risk of transmission of covid-19 through aerosols  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the

covid cases compared to europe and the usa and also affect the environment due to the strict lockdown in india all public transport industries and individual activities were shut which was reflected in air quality and aerosols over india the aerosols decrease sharply over india in comparison with the average value of aod of the last three years fig 5  we have found a clear decrease in aod value from the first day of lockdown with little increase in value in the coming days due to some relaxation in lockdown also april month is harvest month so aerosols are increased due to harvesting and crop residue burning in the april month which can also be seen in averaged data now the first 21 days lockdown 25 march-15april period is over and the second lockdown 15 april-3 may is going on but with some relaxation in few important activities so it may increase the aerosol concentration if a lockdown is followed strictly till may 3 2020 then a big reduction in aod may be observed which may restrict the risk of further new covid-19 cases by its transmission through aerosols no 2 is a marker of the particulate matter pm 25 for the study of pollutions strict lockdown in india reduces the tropospheric column no 2 also which again lowers the risk of covid transmission through pm 25 for the indian region fig 6  its very clear from the plot that the concentration of no 2 is reduced after the lockdown in comparison to the threeyear average value of no 2  figure 7 shows the percentage dropdown in the values of aod and no 2 in comparison to the average value of the last three years over india we found maximum dropdown during the lockdown period of 2020 up to 36 for aod and 37  for no 2 in comparison to the average value of 2017-2019 we have also investigated the correlation of aod with the daily new confirmed case in india for march and april we found the negative correlation during march when there were fewer cases of covid-19 but in april the correlation turned in to positive

the hysplit trajectory model for calculation of the forward trajectory not shown here of surface aerosols as van doremalen et al 2020 found in his study that covid-19 virus can be stable at aerosols surface for about 3 hours so if a coronavirus is attached to the aerosols then it may travel for longer distances and become airborne this may be a reason for the high number of cases in the usa and other european countries as in earlystage they did consider covid-19 may not transmit through the air and not using the face mask so when we run hysplit forward trajectory model for the surface level air for 3 hours period we found that in normal condition in april month in india a surface level aerosol can travel up to 4 km distance in 3 hours according to the wind speed and direction so there is a great risk of transmission of covd-19 through aerosols if their concentration is high and viruses have plenty of bases to stick it therefore our study suggests that there must be strict lockdown for all factors affecting the concentration of aerosols otherwise it may be an invitation to a disaster to give relax in lockdown in india like a country with high aerosols in coming months before in march 2020 many studies speculated that the places with higher temperatures are in less risk and it appeared that temperature might play an important role in the spread of the virus however more new cases were recorded in regions with a temperature between 16 and 18 o c in march even more up to 30 o c in india during march and april 2020 which is now challenging the hypothesis that a rise in temperature would minimize the spread of the 2019-ncov nonetheless the observation of more than 10000 cases in the last ten days in india makes it clear that the effect of rising summer temperature if any would not be observed in the current hotspot of india as the mean temperature for most of the major cities in india is above 30 o c for most of april and may indeed laboratory experiments performed between 21-23 o c at a relative humidity of 40 showed that the virus survived for several days on plastics and metals van doremalen et al 2020  therefore temperature may affect similar to the relationship observed between sars-cov and temperature bukhari and jameel 2020  still we cant say at what temperature and to what extent it would help in reducing the spread of 2019-ncov under any circumstances we believe that large gatherings both indoor and outdoor should be avoided across india  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has

is spreading easily in regions with absolute humidity 10 gm 3 bukhari and jameel 2020  this has serious implications on the assumption that the 2019-ncov spread would slow down during summer in the current hotspot of india as in many regions the absolute humidity might be above 10 gm 3 fig4  on the other hand if new cases in april and may continue to cluster within the current observed range of ah ie 9 to 11 gm 3  then the states experiencing monsoon having a high absolute humidity 11 gm 3  may see a slowdown in transmissions due to climatic factors if it is then for india it has long waiting time up to june 15 when the monsoon will come and up to then only government mitigation policies are going to reduce the covid-19 spread over india the novel coronavirus pneumonia is caused by 2019-ncov which is a new pathogen for the human being due to its outbreak during the spring and summer it is spreading very fast in a short period faced with this new disease we lack reliable epidemiological information for effective treatment and prevention however any infectious disease origins and spread occur only when affected by certain natural and social factors through acting on the source of infection the mode of transmission and the susceptibility of the population the weather and meteorological factors also may play a part in the coronavirus outbreak besides the social factors also aerosols may play a crucial role during the spread of covid-19 following conclusions and suggestion may be drawn from the current study 1 we have studied the effect of environmental factors and aerosols on the spread of covid-19 during march and april in india we have studies the total number of daily confirmed cases of covid-19 and its association with the temperature relative

would be helpful whether their totals lockdown or strictly imposing the social distancing for the community two coastal states of india kerala and maharashtra are the example for rest of the india who has an almost same meteorological environment and had same numbers of covid-19 patient on 29 th march but during first lockdown period their governments strategies made a big difference as now kerala is on 11 th position and maharashtra is at the top in the total number of covid-19 patient in india fig1 3 there is a thin hope that increasing temperature in coming months in india may reduce the number of new covid-19 cases because in india during summer crop residue burning and major dust storms occur kumar et al 2015  which further will degrade the air quality especially in the north indian region and will create the health emergency by producing respiratory diesis due to increased particulate matter ultimately which may enhance the number of death of patient suffering from the covid-19 also will increase the chance of spreading through aerosols 4 we also investigated the aerosols and pollutants behavior with the total number of cases during the covid-19 outbreak the concentration in aerosols aod and other pollutants no 2  was sharply reduced during the first lockdown period 25 march-15 april in india which may have a negative effect and lowered the risk of covid-19 to be airborne because less available aerosols as the base for the virus to stick on it 5 since many earlier studies and our findings are suggesting that covid-19 may be airborne so to slow down its spread governments should impose strict lockdown and motivate the society to follow the social distancing thermal scanning and wearing a face mask when going outside health workers and those are working at the front line must take precautions as it may be airborne also the mild infected and the severely infected patient should be kept in a separate medical facility 6 the structures of social contact critically determine the spread of the infection and in the absence of vaccines the control of these structures through large-scale social distancing measures appears to be the most effective means of mitigation as in the previous study by singh and adhikari 2020 suggested that the three-week lockdown will be insufficient and its found true for india our suggestion is for complete lockdown with minimal relaxation with strict social distancing for 4 more weeks 7 we found that early lockdown in india reduces the possible number of infectionsdeath due to the coronavirus in india most of the

of cases per million populations is least for india in comparison to the usa and europe which shows the government mitigations working well as it was a historic move by the indian government to

maximum and in india during june also humidity will be high in coastal states it will increase slowly over the northern parts of india in late june month then this hypothesis may be tested for the indian region that high temp and high humidity will reduce the number of cases due to the coronavirus that time will tell but before that at least up to 15 may 2020 there must be strict lockdown by the government the second lockdown announced for 15 april-3 may over india and community should strictly follow the social distancing to reduce the number of covid-19 cases relaxing in the lockdown and environmental rules in terms of pollutant emissions from power plants factories and other facilities would be the wrong choice it could increase pollutants like pm25 which may result in more

lockdowns tended to be associated with less mortality p031 and per-capita testing with higher reported mortality p026 though neither association was statistically significant conclusions societal norms and government policies supporting the wearing of masks by the public are independently associated with less mortality from covid-19  the covid-19 global pandemic caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has presented a major public health challenge for reasons that are not completely understood the per-capita mortality from covid-19 varies by several orders of magnitude between countries 1 numerous sources of heterogeneity have been hypothesized higher mortality has been observed in older populations and in men 2 3 patient-level behaviors such as smoking might also have an impact 3 other potentially relevant factors include economic activity and environmental variation such as temperature 4 more urban settings and increased population density would be expected to enhance viral transmission 5 in addition public health responses to the covid-19 pandemic may influence per-capita mortality various strategies have been implemented ranging from robust testing programs to lockdown or stay-at-home orders to mandates regarding social distancing and face mask usage practices with theoretical benefit such as social distancing stay-at-home orders and implementation of mandates regarding use of masks in public spaces must be assessed quickly as implementation has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality mask usage by the public is postulated to decrease infection by blocking the spread of respiratory droplets 1 and was successfully implemented during other coronavirus outbreaks ie sars and mers 6 in the context of the ongoing pandemic we assessed the impact of masks on per-capita covid-19-related mortality controlling for the aforementioned factors we hypothesized that in countries where mask use was either an accepted cultural norm or favored by government policies on a national level the per-capita mortality might be reduced as compared with remaining countries methods data from 183 countries for which

fraction of the population age 60 years or over duration of the outbreak in the country and the period of outbreak subject to cultural norms or government policies favoring mask-wearing by the public these results support the universal wearing of masks by the public to suppress the spread of the coronavirus 1 given the low levels of coronavirus mortality seen in the asian countries which adopted widespread public mask usage early in the outbreak it seems highly unlikely that masks are harmful one major limitation is that evidence concerning the actual levels of mask-wearing by the public are not available for most countries particularly in western countries which only recommended rather than mandated mask-wearing by the public such as the united states the practice has been steadily increasing but change has not occurred overnight our analysis based on norms and policies can be compared with intention-to-treat analysis in a clinical trial much of the randomized controlled data on the effect of mask-wearing on the spread of respiratory viruses relates to influenza one recent meta-analysis of 10 trials in families students or religious pilgrims found that the relative risk for influenza with the use of face masks was 078 a 22 reduction though the findings were not statistically significant 48 combining all the trials there were 29 cases in groups assigned to wear masks compared with 51 cases in control groups 48 the direct applicability of these results to mask-wearing at the population level is uncertain for instance there was some heterogeneity in methods of the component trials with one trial assigning mask wearing to the person with a respiratory illness another to his close contacts and the remainder to both the ill and their contacts 48 mask-wearing was inconsistent the groups living together could not wear a mask when bathing sleeping eating or brushing teeth 49 50 51 in one of the studies reviewed parents wore a mask during the day but not at night when sleeping next to their sick child 51 in a different trial students were asked to wear a mask in their residence hall for at least 6 hours daily rather than all the time 49 the bottom line is that it is nearly impossible for people to constantly maintain mask wear around the people with whom they live in contrast wearing a mask when on public transit or shopping is quite feasible in addition as an infection propagates through multiple generations in the population the benefits multiply exponentially even if one accepts that masks would only reduce transmissions by 22 then after 10 cycles of the infection mask-wearing would reduce the level of infection in the population by 917 as compared with a non-mask wearing population because 078 10  0083 it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever

demonstrated that in 4 patients infected with sars-cov-2 who were asked to cough without and with a cloth mask the viral load on a nearby petri dish was reduced with the cloth mask in all patients and in half was not detectable with the cloth mask 52 nationwide policies to ban large gatherings and to close schools or businesses tended to be associated with lower mortality though not in a statistically significant fashion however a full accounting would consider local policies which often varied within each country moreover businesses schools and individuals made decisions to limit contact independent of any government policies the adoption of numerous public health policies at the same time can make it difficult to tease out the relative importance of each colder average monthly temperature was associated with higher levels of covid-19 mortality in univariate analysis but not when accounting for other independent variables nonetheless environmental factors which could influence either human behavior or the stability and spread of virus particles are worthy of further study per-capita testing both early april 4 16 and later may 9 were positively associated with reported coronavirus-related mortality it seems likely that countries which test at a low level are missing many cases we previously identified just 3 countries iceland the faeroe islands and the uae which had performed over 75000 tests per million population by april 16 and all 3 had mortality below 1 in 46000 at that point 53 by may 9 we could add to this high-testing group the falkland islands and bahrain as all 5 countries had tested over one tenth of their population all 5 countries had a mortality of 29 per million 1 in 34480 people or less the degree to which these results would apply to larger less isolated or less wealthy countries is unknown statistical support for benefit of high levels of testing might be demonstrated if additional and more diverse countries are able to test at this level one limitation of our study is that the ultimate source of mortality data is often from governments which may not have the resources to provide a full accounting of their public health crises or an interest in doing so in summary older age of the population urbanization and longer duration of the outbreak in a country were independently associated with higher country-wide percapita coronavirus mortality lockdowns and the amount of viral testing were not statistically significant predictors of country-wide coronavirus mortality after controlling for other variables the use of

our knowledge this is the first study evaluating the likely association between genetic ancestry and covid-19 manifestation while our current findings improve our overall understanding of the covid-19

deathrecovery ratio that pertains to a ratio of the number of deaths caused by the novel coronavirus to numbers of infected individuals recovered within the same time interval while infected individuals from some countries have recovered relatively quickly with lower morbidities those from some other parts of the world appear to remain affected for longer with slower recovery times and demonstrate relatively higher deathrecovery ratios 2  this is suggestive of a likely population level genetic variation in terms of susceptibility to the coronavirus and covid-19 manifestation a case in point in this context appears to be ace2 that encodes for angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 and has been speculated to be the host receptor for the novel coronavirus 3 4  recently cao et al analysed 1700 variants in ace2 from chinamap and 1000 genomes project databases 5  while they reported the absence of natural resistant mutations for coronavirus s-protein binding across their study populations their study revealed significant variation in allele frequencies af among the populations assessed including between people of east asian and european ancestries they speculated that the differences in afs of ace2 coding variants likely associated with its elevated expression may influence ace2 function and putatively impact sars infectivity among the evaluated populations additionally a majority of the 15 eqtl variants they identified had discernibly higher afs among east asian populations compared to europeans which may suggest differential susceptibility towards coronavirus in these two populations under similar conditions in addition to ace2 covid-19 manifestation may also be modulated by several immune response modulating genes li et al 2020 mentioned that coronavirus infection causes secretion of large quantities of chemokines and cytokines such as il 1 il 6 il 8 il 21 tnf  and mcp 1 in the infected cells additionally the hosts major antiviral machinery comprising of interferons ifns may also the limit of coronavirus 6  overall it can be speculated that variations in host genes encoding for interleukins and interferons may be responsible for differential manifestation of covid-19 further recent studies have shown that variants associated with immune responsiveness display significant population-specific signals of natural selection 7  in particular the authors showed that admixture with neanderthals may have differentially shaped the immune systems in european populations introducing novel regulatory variants which may affect

the potential association between genetic ancestry and covid-19 employing europeans as the case study in addition using a genome wide association study gwas approach we sought to discern the putative

deathrecovery ratio073 while covid-19 related deaths in northern italy has surpassed 12000 less than 1000 deaths have been so far reported in southern italy interestingly these numbers are consistent with whg fractions among italian genomes thus while whg ancestry fractions were found to be  231 and 92 among northern and southern italian genomes respectively in contrast only a handful of covid-19 cases have been so far reported in russia the largest country in the world and we assessed whether this is owing to their genomic make-up all modern-day russians originated from two groups of east slavic tribes northern and southern and have 0 whg ancestry fraction they are genetically similar to modern-day other slavic populations such as belarusians we note that covid-19 deathrecovery ratios

such as mexico and peru with lower death to recovery ratio have higher eskimo ancestry fraction 132 and 203 and lower ma1 fraction 868 and 797 compared to our other study populations further we found  zero eskimo ancestry fraction among columbians and purto ricans where death to recovery ratio is relatively high the high death to recovery ratio in brazil 35 is reminiscent of similarly high ratios in portugal 39 and may be attributed to the predominant portuguese ancestry in the former as noted above significant variation in afs of ace2 gene the presumed receptor of novel coronavirus has been reported among people from east asian and european ancestry 5  the authors of this study speculated that the differences in afs of ace2 coding variants are associated with variable expression of ace2

incoming southeast asians took place 2000-3800 years ago giving rise to the aaa ancestry notably the south asian populations with whom the incoming southeast asians mingled were aasi related with little to no west eurasian ancestry fraction 27  finally it has been showed that the tibeto-burmans atbs derived their ancestry through admixture with low-altitude east asians who migrated from china and likely across northern india or myanmar 28 leading to the high genomic proximity between south asians of atb ancestry and east asians the genomic proximity between east asians and south asians mostly from northeast india with prominent atb ancestry is likely reflected through fewer numbers of covid-19 cases from this region so far one case each in arunachal pradesh and mizoram and two in manipur notably the death to recovery ratio in the largely atb dominated region of ladakh india is zero indicating complete recovery so far of covid-19 infected individuals from this region while the

prevalence of aaa ancestry andor with large fractions of aasi-related ancestry eg chhattisgarh jharkhand and orissa have not registered any covid related deaths till date indicating that south asians with dominant aaa and aasi related ancestry may also likely be less severely affected against the most detrimental effects of covid-19 infection nevertheless the severity of covid-19 manifestation is likely to vary appreciably across the south asian populations approximately 12 people of ani and asi ancestries belong to mitochondrial haplogroup u which as described above is found at high frequency

december 2019 because the clinically diagnosed cases in hubei province were reported for the first time on february 13 2020 a very high peak of new cases in china was observed the reason why so many clinically diagnosed cases appeared was not clear methods all data of new cases in china were acquired from who situation reports linear fitting was used to infer the ability to detect covid-19 infections primer-blast and nucleotide blast were applied to check the specificity of primers expression data of human mrna in different tissues was obtained from human protein atlas findings based on the data and analysis of changes of new laboratory-confirmed cases and new clinically diagnosed cases it was inferred that there were many false-negative results in all clinically diagnosed cases in hubei province there were eight non-specific primers in dozens of primers used in clinical or research detection of covid-19 among them a pair of primer for the orf1ab regions of sars-cov-2 genome which widely applied to detect sars-cov-2 virus in china well matched some human mrnas such as cathepsin c transcripts compared to other transcripts cathepsin c mrna had a high abundance in tonsil

was difficult to understand the extent to which this abnormal phenomenon occurs however the who reports on new laboratory-confirmed cases and new clinically diagnosed cases in china during the covid-19 epidemic were helpful to deduce that extent rapid raise and drop of total new cases in figure 1 indicated that the amazing number of clinically diagnosed cases was just an accumulation of those in hubei province earlier than february 13 2020 successive revision in the diagnosis criterion for the novel coronavirus pneumonia in hubei province had resulted in a sudden surge in the number of total new cases and the removal of clinically diagnosed cases in the province 16 17 there was no reports on whether the clinically diagnosed patients tested or not but it was possible to infer general situation through evaluating the ability to detect covid-19 infections the ability to detect covid-19 infections was steadily enhanced along with the outbreak of the epidemic and then exhibited a great accelerated growth china national biotec group could produce novel coronavirus detection kits for 200000 people each day on february 18 2020 18 in the light of the linear fitting of laboratory-confirmed cases from january 22 to february 5 2020 in the inset of figure 1  the ability to detect covid-19 infections for more than 14400 persons besides laboratory-confirmed patients could be deduced from february 6 to february 13 2020 and that basically met the requirements for 12289 detections for clinically diagnosed patients on february 13 2020 hence it was inferred that a considerable number of clinically diagnosed patients tested and obtained negative results furthmore the number of recovered cases in china moderately increased from 261 on february 5 2020 to 3622 on february 27 2020 which was shown in figure s1  it represented that  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display

rapid increase of recovered cases after february 13 2020 it could be concluded that most of more than 17410 clinically diagnosed patients had finally diagnosed covid-19 infections the slowly decline of number of existing confirmed cases as shown in figure s2 also supported the conclusion therefore it was considered that false-negative results in rt-pcr detection of covid-19 infections usually occurred among clinically diagnosed patients rt-pcr detection was applied to diagnose sars virus in 2003 but little false-negative diagnosis was reported in more than 8000 confirmed cases moremore even if so many rt-pcr detections were repeated in laboratories and hospitals in china general operation problems resulting in false-negative detections were not found consequently the specificity of rt-pcr primers was investigated a pair of specific primers used to detect sars-cov-2 virus should only amplify the virus sequence but not any unintended rna including those of human host and other pathogens in contrast to pathogens human host was usually omitted to eliminate the host interference in rt-pcr detection of covid-19 infections specific amplification of the intended target of sars-cov-2 sequence required that primers matched as little as possible to any human rna transcript besides primers matched znf7 fyco1 and rragb transcripts it was noted that primer1 with sixteen consecutive nucleotides at 3 ends which perfectly matched those of ctsc transcripts except one nucleotide could cause the serious interference during rt-pcr amplification the technical guidance including the primer 1 and 2 was employed to instruct centers for disease control at all levels in china 6 7 9 19 20 although there was no interference with primer 2 for n gene only both positive

the clinical diagnostic criterion for nucleotide detection in china hence it was not difficult to draw a conclusion that non-specificity of the primer designed for sars-cov-2 virus might be an important factor resulting in so many false-negative diagnoses for covid-19 infections in china moreover there were seven non-specific primers besides primer 1 although primer 7b and 8b were inner primers of nested rt-pcr second round rt-pcr operation would be susceptible to contamination therefore it was believed that false-negative diagnoses for covid-19 infections might occur when using the above primers besides the specificity of primers the amount of the unintended target mrna was another key factor in determining whether human host contamination could happen in rt-pcr detection rt-pcr detection samples were collected usually from nasopharynx or oropharynx swap sputum or fluid in trachea or alveoli and stool which corresponded to tonsil lung and intestine the high abundance of ctsc transcripts in tonsil lung and small intestine tissues and good match of ctsc transcripts to primer 1 could lead to the contamination of clinical samples which were used for rt-pcr detection of covid-19 infections and might trigger the false-negative diagnosis furthermore the higher total abundance of son thoc2 and agpat3 transcripts in tonsil lung and small intestine tissues and better matches of the above three transcripts to primer 14 could also result in the same problems although other transcripts had smaller ptpm values expression of the transcripts might become very complex when inflammatory and oxidative stress occurred during viral infections according to the above mentioned analysis and data there could be no doubt that non-specificity of rt-pcr primers obviously

neonatal outcomes a review of 287 pregnancies fatemeh azarkish roksana janghorban  pregnant women are vulnerable group in viral outbreaks especially in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 pandemic the aim of this review was to identify maternal and neonatal outcomes in available articles on pregnancies affected by covid-19 the articles that had assessed outcomes of pregnancy and perinatal of women with covid-19 between oct 2019 and apr 30 2020 without language limitation were considered all kinds of studies such as case report case series retrospective cohort case control were included we searched databases selected relevant studies and extracted data regarding maternal and neonatal outcomes from each article data of 287 pregnant women with covid-19 of 6 countries were assessed from 28 articles between december 8 2019 and april 6 2020 most pregnant women reported in their third trimester 102 355 cases were symptomatic at the time of admission common onset symptoms abnormal laboratory findings and chest computed tomography pattern were fever 515 lymphocytopenia 679 and multiple ground-glass opacities 785 respectively 93 of all deliveries were done through cesarean section no maternal mortality and 3  icu admission were reported vertical transmission was not reported but its possibility was suggested in three neonates one neonatal death one stillbirth and one abortion were reported all newborns were not breastfed this review showed fewer adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with covid-19 in comparison with previous coronavirus outbreak infection in pregnancy limited data are available regarding possibility of virus transmission in utero during vaginal childbirth and breastfeeding effect of covid-19 on first and second trimester and ongoing pregnancy outcomes in infected mothers is still questionable a flow diagram of the literature search is shown in figure 1  from 77 results in pubmed 13 in scopus 7 in wos and 45 in medrxiv 28 relevant studies 15 case series 10 case reports 1 case-control 2 retrospective clinical series were identified characteristics of the selected studies are described in table 1 two full texts of included articles are in chinese 2638 and the others are in english all articles reported sars-cov-2 positive pregnant women from china except six case reports from republic of korea 1 39 sweden 1 41 united states 2 4445 central america 1 42  and switzerland 1 46 a total of 287 pregnant women with covid-19 were identified  outbreak of coronavirus covid-19 as a new respiratory disease has affected over two million individuals throughout the world and the world health organization who has declared the outbreak as a global pandemic on march11 2020 1 2  understanding of the effect of viral infection during pregnancy is considerably important especially in pandemic due to possible effect on the pregnant woman and the fetus 3  studies showed that pregnant mothers were vulnerable group in viral outbreaks of influenza-a h1n1 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov ebola and zika virus and had higher risk of mortality and worse maternal and neonatal outcomes such as abortion still birth preterm delivery and birth defects 4 5 6 7 8  some conditions increase vulnerability of mothers and fetuses to become infected with outbreak viruses especially respiratory viruses the first one is maternal physiologic adaptive changes in cardiopulmonary system during pregnancy which leads to increased heart rate and stroke volume and reduced pulmonary residual capacity these changes could increase the risk of hypoxemia 9  the second issue is maternal immunologic alterations and a shift from th1 to th2 immunity that occurs during pregnancy this shift could decrease the robustness of cell-mediated immunity alter responses to viral respiratory infections during pregnancy and increase severity of these infections 10 11  the third factor is related to characteristics of innate and adaptive immunity in fetus including lower cytolytic function of fetal natural killer nk cells compared to adults lower intensity of antigen-specific antibody response in comparison with adults immature t cell immunity with suppressed th1 responses and upregulated th2 responses hyporesponsive macrophages and scarce soluble inflammatory mediators 12 13 14  all of these characteristics increase fetal susceptibility to infections furthermore a viral infection of placenta could produce inflammatory cytokines activate maternal immune system impair placenta induce abortion or preterm labor in perinatal period and lead to long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae in adulthood 15 16 17  despite some similarities among covid-19 sars and mers the 2019 novel coronavirus seems to be less lethal and more easily spread than the other two coronavirus according to available information 18  this characteristic could raise critical concern as regards widespread transmission in the community and increase infected pregnant women numbers and the possibility of vertical transmission of covid-19 from mother to the fetus and adverse outcome on maternal fetal and neonatal health current knowledge related to effect of covid-19 infection on maternal and perinatal outcomes are based on information that exists in some scattered case reports and case series which were mostly reported from wuhan hubei province china it seems that better clinical management of the infection in pregnancy needs to have more information of covid-19 behavior in a large number of infected pregnant cases in different trimesters from various countries this review was conducted to identify maternal and neonatal outcomes in available articles on pregnancies affected by covid-19 throughout the world in this review the articles that had assessed outcomes of pregnancy and perinatal of women with covid-19 between oct 2019 and apr 30 2020 were considered all kinds of studies such as case report case series retrospective cohort case control were included non-english language publications were

that icu admission rate and cfr in the pregnant group were higher than non-pregnant group and were 60 and 40 respectively 49  limited data exists on the outcome of mers on pregnancy however available information showed that cfr of infected pregnant women was 27 and icu admission was 64 4 50 51 52 53 54  our review of 287 pregnant women with covid-19 showed no maternal mortality and icu admission was reported in 5 of 161 cases 3 studies showed that the decision for cesarean section in sars and mers affected pregnant women was made due to maternal hypoxemia fetal distress and some obstetrical indications such as placenta previa 4 51 55 56  in this review the majority of deliveries were done through cesarean section and 69 of pregnant women delivered by vaginal delivery more than half of mentioned causes of cesarean section were covid-19 infection and 154 of deliveries were done through cesarean section due to fetal distress one important issue was that in most women who delivered by cesarean section due to covid-19 infection cause maternal condition did not deteriorate vertical transmission from mother to child among pregnant women who were infected with sars and mers were not identified 4 57 58 59 60  according to this review there is no evidence to prove intrauterine or transplacental transmission of covid-19 but possibility of mother-to-child vertical transmission was

studies 20 22 23 25 31  all newborns of mothers with covid-19 were not breastfed according to available information it seems that formula feeding could prevent neonates from the possible way of covid-19 infection transmission through close contact with confirmed or suspected mothers lack of report of some variables related to maternal and neonatal outcomes in several studies is one of the limitations of this review the other one is low methodological quality of the studies which were included in this review maternal and neonatal assessment of a large number of cases 287 cases consideration of some maternal and neonatal outcomes including cause of cesarean section early maternal chest ct findings fetal condition neonatal asphyxia newborn feeding in all studies and no limitation on language of published articles are strengths of the current review in comparison with three reviews that exist to date 63-66 this review literature showed fewer adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with covid-19 in comparison with sars and mers infection in pregnancy there is no evidence to prove vertical transmission of covid-19 but possibility of mother-to-child vertical transmission was suggested due to positive test for sars-cov-2 in two neonates and one placental infection with sars-cov-2 possibility of transmission during vaginal delivery is unknown due to small number of cases who delivered by vaginal delivery because of not reporting breastfeeding risk of transmission during breast feeding is unknown if breast milk test of suspected

implement interventions to stimulate preventive behaviour against infection more insight is needed in how people perceive the risks of being infected by this new coronavirus if they use of preventive measures and especially which pre-outbreak factors determine the perceived risks and measures taken 6  however to the best of our knowledge to date peer-reviewed population-based studies assessing the perceived risks of corona infection measures and their determinants are absent aim of the present population-based study conducted is to shed light on this gap of scientific knowledge with respect to perceived risks we made a distinction between risk for infection and risk of becoming ill when infected 9  with respect to potential determinants we first focused on pre-outbreak respiratory heart problems and diabetes because they increase the risk for severe health problems when infected 8  we furthermore assessed pre-outbreak anxiety and depression symptoms and loneliness because they may impact the perceived threat of infection and perceived likelihood to become ill when infected 9 10 11 12  we finally assessed demographics such as age because older people are more at risk to become ill 6  and sex and education level this study is conducted in the netherlands and during the data collection period  the study was conducted using the dutch longitudinal internet studies for the

coronavirus with respect to pre-outbreak physical health problems only respondents with heart problems took preventive measures more often females more often took preventive measures and medium and high educated respondents more often than low educated respondents finally respondents who filled in the survey more recently more often took preventive measures we repeated the regression analyses among those who participated 10-15 days after the start of the corona survey showing almost similar results having heart problems was no longer significantly associated with preventive measures

respiratory and heart problems diabetes anxiety and depression symptoms and loneliness and older respondents more often perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as high in line with the increased perceived risk to be infected the number of respondents who took preventive measures increase too however respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory and heart problems did not more often take preventive measures than others in addition analyses of respondents who participated 10-15 after the the start of the study showed that respondents with respiratory and heart problems and diabetes did not differ in the proportion of people who took preventive measures our findings are somewhat similar to the results of a study reported by the who regional office for europe 6  this serial cross-sectional study conducted in germany in almost the same period as our study week 10 and 11 2020 showed that the prevalence of respondents who perceived the risk to be infected by the coronavirus as high increased from 168 to 214 they furthermore reported like us that older respondents 60 felt less likely be infected importantly in our study the effects of other factors that are associated with the perceived risk of corona infection were controlled for such as pre-outbreak respiratory and heart problems and education level asmundson and taylor 18 reported that according to polls in the

research topic are initiated and conducted however when finalizing this study we were not aware of any peer-reviewed population-based studies on perceived risks the use of preventive measures and their pre-outbreak determinants to compare our findings with strength of the present study are the use of a large traditional probability based sample drawn from the dutch population the prospective study-design data on preoutbreak physician-diagnosed diseases and use of well validated instruments on anxiety and depression symptoms and loneliness we deliberately choose to use the data that was collected in the first two weeks of the survey response was 701 to be able to share our results rapidly given the threatening global developments however although we distinguished three subsequent periods during these two weeks suggesting an increase in preventive measures taken we do not know from this study if and when all respondents have taken preventive measures in addition we do not know from this study to what extent respondents who have taken preventive measures will continue to comply with protection guidelines from governmental health agencies another limitation is that we not were able to include children it is unknown to what extent childrens perceptions of the risks and the measures they taken resembles those of adults and especially parents and other family members we did not systematically examine whether respondents were in quarantine eg were separated and restricted in movement because they had been potentially infected by the coronavirus and their  cc-by-nc-nd

made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity there has been a considerable overlap in the comorbidities which has been widely accepted for instance diabetes 29 and copd 30 frequently co-exist with hypertension or coronary heart diseases therefore patients with co-existing comorbidities are more likely to have poorer baseline well-being importantly we have verified the significantly escalated risk of poor prognosis in patients with two or more comorbidities as compared with those who had no or only a single comorbidity our findings implied that both the category and number of comorbidities should be taken into account when predicting the prognosis in patients with covid-19 our findings suggested that patients with comorbidities had greater disease severity compared with those without a greater number of comorbidities correlated with greater disease severity of covid-19 the public health implication of our study was that proper triage of patients should be implemented in out-patient clinics or on hospital admission by carefully inquiring the medical history because this will help identify patients who would be more likely to develop serious adverse outcomes during the progression of covid-19 a multidisciplinary team with specialists would be needed to manage the comorbid conditions in a timely fashion

population better personal medical protection the main limitation of our study was the self-report of comorbidities on admission underreporting of comorbidities which could have stemmed from the lack of awareness andor the lack of diagnostic testing might contribute to the underestimation of the true strength of association with the clinical prognosis however significant underreporting was unlikely because the spectrum of our report was largely consistent with existing literature 3 4 5 6 7 and all patients were subject to a thorough history taking after hospital admission moreover the duration of follow-up was relatively short and some patients remained in the hospital as of the time of writing more studies that explore the associations in a sufficiently long time frame are warranted as with other observational studies our findings did not provide direct inference about the causation or reverse causation of comorbidities and the poor clinical outcomes comorbidities are

social and economic factors underlying the impact of covid-19 cases and deaths in us counties nivedita mukherji  this paper uncovers the socioeconomic and healthlifestyle factors that can explain the differential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on different parts of the united states using a dynamic panel model with daily reported number of cases for us counties over a 20-day period the paper develops a vulnerability index for each county from an epidemiological model of disease spread county-level economic demographic and health factors are used to explain the differences in the values of this index and thereby the transmission and concentration of the disease across the country these factors are also used in a zero-inflated negative binomial pooled model to examine the number of reported deaths the paper finds that counties with high per capita personal income have high incidence of both reported cases and deaths the unemployment rate is negative for deaths implying that places with low unemployment rates or higher economic activity have higher reported deaths counties with higher income inequality as measured by the gini coefficient experienced more deaths and reported more cases there is a remarkable similarity in the distribution of cases across the country and the distribution of distance-weighted international passengers served by the top international airports counties with high concentrations of non-hispanic blacks native americans and immigrant populations have higher incidence of both cases and deaths the distribution of health risk factors such as obesity diabetes smoking are found to be particularly significant factors in explaining the differences in mortality across counties counties with higher numbers of primary care physicians have lower deaths and so do places with lower hospital stays for preventable causes the stay-at-home orders are found to be associated with places of higher cases and deaths implying that they were perhaps imposed far too late to have contained the virus in the places with high-risk populations it is hoped that research such as these will help policymakers to develop risk factors for each region of the country to better contain the spread of infectious diseases in the future  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review  the novel coronavirus also known as covid-19 has brought the global economy to a screeching halt it is sweeping through the united states and the country has now taken a lead in not only the total number of positive cases but in terms of the number of reported deaths as well new yorks total number of cases exceeds the total number reported for any country including china the virus is believed to have originated in wuhan china in late 2019 as the virus spread through wuhan and the rest of china it raised alarms across the scientific communities and governments around the world with every passing day the virus continued to spread exponentially the impact of the virus in the united states started to grab public attention from late february and many states started imposing stay-at-home orders in mid-march 2020 the dramatic increase in the number of infected patients in a nursing home in seattle washington stunned a nation and made evident the contagiousness of the virus and its lethality while the national attention was focused on seattle the virus was taking a deadly hold in new york city and its surroundings with every passing day one state after another started announcing their first reported cases no us state has been spared however the spread of the virus has been anything but uniform figure 1 shows the geographical distribution of reported cases across us counties in april 2020 this paper attempts to uncover the socioeconomic conditions that are dominant in the areas with the high number of cases and deaths the literature on the transmission of infectious diseases often finds that highest impact areas have low income poor sanitary conditions and poor health care conditions due to their focus on viruses that have significantly impacted developing countries campos et al 2018 for zika redding et al 2019 for ebola are recent examples moore et al 2017 used ebola to develop an infectious disease vulnerability index for countries in africa the literature on the socioeconomic determinants of the spread of infectious diseases in developed countries is not extensive - adda 2016 is an exception using data from france it offers an extensive analysis of the transmission of three viruses -2 influenza gastroenteritis and chickenpox the paper asks the important questions whether virus spread more rapidly during periods of economic growth and if their spread follows a gradient determined by economic factors using data from france adda 2016 finds that the viruses studied indeed propagated faster during times of economic boom due to increased economic activity and contact between people qiu 2020 have conducted a similar analysis for wuhan china both papers find a positive relationship between the spread of the virus and economic activity avery et al 2020 offers a list of resources both in terms of relevant research and data sources for researchers unlike some of the literature cited above that concentrate on the impact of mitigation andor containment strategies along with economic conditions such as gdp employment and weather-related factors such as temperatures and pollution wu 2020 this paper focuses on economic demographic and health conditions in explaining the number of cases and deaths in the us figure 1 clearly indicates that the spread of the virus has been in regions of high economic activity on the two coasts the virus has arrived on the us shores through international travel while the initial spread of the virus is expected to be triggered by international travel and economic activity it is important to understand whether its continued spread and concentration is restricted to such places as the lockdown continues and the medical profession is trying to understand the susceptibility of individuals in contracting the disease this paper attempts to understand the underlying socioeconomic conditions of the geographic regions around the us that make them susceptible to becoming hotspots this is related to the question about the factors that determine the gradient followed by the virus as it spreads through the country introducing heterogeneity that captures region-specific uniqueness in an epidemiological model of disease spread the paper develops a vulnerability index for the counties included in the study these indexes capture the underlying factors that impact the vulnerability of a region to the virus economic demographic and healthlifestyle factors are used to explain the observed differences in the vulnerability index these factors are also used to explain the differences in the number of deaths reported across the countries the results indicate 3  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review that the underlying demographic and healthlifestyle factors have a more significant impact in explaining deaths than disease spread this is not a surprising result since the spread of the virus does not depend on a persons ethnicity or education status once people contract the disease however the health outcome depends on a multitude of factors that go beyond an individuals control the paper uses available county level data to identify economic demographic and healthlifestyle risk factors for different parts of the us the paper finds that people in regions of high economic activity and economic inequality are particularly at elevated risk of both disease spread and mortality there is a remarkable parallel between the spread of the disease and distanceweighted distribution of passengers arriving at international airports the demographic distribution in terms of race shows higher vulnerability both in terms of disease contraction and death for non-hispanic blacks native americans and immigrants counties with higher numbers of personal care physicians per 1000 individuals have lower deaths and so do places with fewer preventable cases of hospital stays some of the high risk factors such as obesity diabetes are found to have a more mixed result this can be partly explained by the fact that many of these risk factors have a high degree of concentration in many of the southern states these states have not reported as many cases or deaths as the regions around new york detroit chicago and the western states of california and washington the paper includes the number of days since the onset of stay-at-home orders issued by governors at the state level across the country this variable is not found to be statistically significant in influencing the vulnerability index in the spread of the virus regions that have longer stay-at-home orders have experienced higher number of deaths these regions would have experienced much higher number of cases and deaths without those orders it is likely that they were imposed too late to have been successful in containing the virus this paper has identified socioeconomic and healthlifestyle factors that have played a critical role in helping the virus to develop a stronghold in certain parts of the country and cause high fatalities it is true that a single gathering of individuals can lead to a spike in the number of cases and large number of deaths in a region the members of the coronavirus task force 4 are monitoring where a sudden spike is occurring as data on cases and deaths are collected it is important to be able to better predict if the population of a certain area is particularly vulnerable to the disease this paper shows that it is possible to develop a vulnerability index both for disease spread and deaths based on the socioeconomic composition of the population and their healthlifestyle choices developing such a profile will be particularly important as the various parts of the country contemplate lifting stay-at-home orders before the invention of a therapeutic or a vaccine recent experience suggests that infectious diseases are a major threat to both the health and economic well being of people around the world in spite of the experience with hini sars and ebola countries such as the united states did not develop a coherent infrastructure or strategy to determine which parts of the country are at particularly higher risk of disease transmission this paper shows that it is possible to utilize the economic demographic and lifestyle profiles of regions to develop a risk factor for each geographical area so that when the next epidemic arises public officials are better prepared to anticipate where the hotspots are likely to arise and take the necessary containment steps the experience with covid-19 shows how rapidly an infectious disease can bring an economy down without advance preparation the next disease will be just as difficult to contain as this the large differences within state boundaries show the importance of developing more local strategies that take into consideration a multitude of factors the coronavirus pandemic has impacted all 50 states in the united states the experience of each state county and city has been anything but homogeneous to understand this differential effect across counties in the us we consider two sets of factors epidemiological models explain how an infectious disease evolves in a region based on population and the size of the pool of infected individuals we will use epidemiological models such as the sir model to determine the fundamental differences in cases based on population size and number of 5  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 8 2020  infections these factors alone cannot explain the entire heterogeneous outcomes across the country we expect differences in types and amounts of economic activities living conditions demographic makeups and lifestyle choices to determine the vulnerabilities of communities in the spread of a highly contagious virus such as the coronavirus we will conduct this analysis in two steps in the first step an epidemiological model of disease spread will be used to generate estimates of a vulnerability index for each county once population and infections are accounted for in the second step we will use county level economic demographic and health data to explain differences in the vulnerability indexes across counties

the fixed effect parameter for county i  is the parameter for the time variable and u it is the error for county i at time t the lagged value of the cases shows that the number reported in any day depends on the numbers reported the previous day estimation of the above regression will generate parameter values  for each county these values will reflect the county-specific fixed effects that influence the vulnerability of each county to the virus from these fixed effects we generate a vulnerability index for each county this approach is similar to the one used by mukherji and silberman 2013 in studying patent citations between metro areas in the us in the second step of the analysis we use county-level economic demographic and health care factors to explain how they influence the vulnerability index for each county the factors that may explain the county vulnerability index are classified into three groups the first group of factors relate to the economic conditions and include factors such as per capita personal income the unemployment rate the level of income inequality poverty access to housing and concentration of different types of industries such as manufacturing mining and others the second group of factors relate to a set of demographic factors including the size of the population and its density the racial profile of the counties the age distribution of the population and the percentage of the population that was born outside the united states the third group of factors considered include health or lifestyle related factors such as the number of primary care physicians per capita the percentage of the population with obesity and diabetes the percentage of the population that smokes and drinks the percentage of the population with inactive lifestyles in addition to the county level economic demographic and health data spatial factors are considered as well the contagious nature of the disease compels one to consider the spillover effects to neighboring counties we introduce inverse-distance weighted values of the number of international passengers served by the top 46 international airports in the contiguous us since the virus is presumed to have originated in china and then spread to other parts of the world including europe before taking a hold in the united states international passenger data is introduced to examine if proximity to international airports is related to the concentration 7  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 8 2020  of confirmed cases while international passengers often arrive at a particular airport and then use domestic airlines to travel to other parts of the country the locations of the international airports are closely tied to areas with concentrations of activities that are globally oriented consequently a large number of the international passengers served by these airports are expected to interact in the regions around these airports using a 300-mile radius around each county where the airports are located an inverse-distance matrix is used to assign the number of international passengers in the areas surrounding the airports the bottom part of figure   1 displays the weighted distribution of international passengers while this data is unrelated to the number of confirmed covid-19 cases the spatial distribution of the passenger data is similar to the spatial distribution of confirmed covid-19 cases the estimation of the impact of these regional factors in explaining differences in vulnerabilities to the disease will be based on equation 2 in the above equation v i represents the vulnerability index of county i e ki represents the set of k economic variables that makes a county susceptible to the spread of the disease due to the enhanced interactions between people and working in close proximity although the economic activity of a county changes with time the general distribution of such activities across the country remains relatively stable within short periods of time d m represents the demographic factors and h n represent the health-care factors discussed above this equation includes a spatially weighted number of international passengers in the region by multiplying an inverse distance-weighted matrix w with the number of international passengers i served by an international airport in the neighborhood of county i this paper uses county-level data for the united states the data on covid-19 cases and deaths is obtained from the covid tracking data provided by the new york times and johns hopkins university figure 1 displays the distribution of cases in the 2512 counties data sources for the various demographic and economic variables such as population distribution by ethnicity population density are listed in table 1  while many of the data listed 8  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 8 2020  for local spillover effects of the virus in the form of increased susceptibility due to higher prevalence of cases an inverse distance weighted matrix was created with positive weights assigned upto a 300 mile radius around a county this radius is just large enough to ensure that each county in the study had at least one other county in the study as a neighbor the previous section explained that the foundation of the analysis of the socioeconomic factors that can contribute to the spread and concentration of the coronavirus in the various parts of the country lies in the epidemiological model of disease transmission the first step is to generate county-level vulnerability measures from an estimation of equation 1 cc-by 40 international

infections in determining the proportion of the population that is susceptible at any time t the incubation period for this virus is estimated to be anywhere between 2 to 14 days people are infections a few days before they develop symptoms and after they develop symptoms we assume a 7 day lag for the results reported in the paper sensitivity analysis was conducted for different lag lengths equation 1 stephen 1981  a difference gmm estimation is found to be the best option for the data the allerano-bond estimation method arellano and bond 1991 that uses lagged values as instruments as implemented by roodman 2006 was used results are reported in table 2  the results show that although autocorrelation of the first order exists there is no second order autocorrelation the sargan and hansen tests of no overidentification of instruments are satisfied and the f statistic shows that the model fits the data well the table shows that the one period lagged number of cases has a significant impact on the number of cases reported on any day the interaction of the infected and susceptible population is also significant and positive one of the key objectives of this regression is to obtain a set of estimates for the county level fixed effects the method of dynamic panel estimation that utilizes first differencing removes the impact of time-invariant variables such as the time-invariant fixed effects these are however recoverable from the residuals it is to be noted that for a dynamic panel model of the form y it  y it1  a i  e it  the residual it  a i  e it    y it

4  the differences in the three sets of results are based on the inclusion of population and population density in the regression these two variables have a correlation of 076 as discussed in the previous section the independent variables are classified into three broad groups -economic demographic and healthlifestyle the results show that in the economic group per capita income has a positive and significant effect showing that places of high income have higher vulnerability the gini coefficient measuring the degree of income inequality and severe housing problems are positive and

indicator of deep poverty are not found to be a significant variables the results also show that places of severe housing shortage have higher vulnerability indexes only when population is not

the age distribution and health indicators are not significant in explaining the differences in the number of cases across the counties it is well established at the individual patient level those are important factors the daily data provided by the new york times and johns hopkins university report the number of deaths as well table 5 the coefficients of the regressors are reported as incidence

physicians have reportedly fewer deaths the remaining results related to health indicators are as follows -places with more preventable hospital stays higher percentage of the population that has diabetes smokes and are physically inactive have higher reported deaths these are not surprising since people with underlying health risks are expected to experience more severe reactions to the infection counties with higher obesity and percentage of the population that engages in excessive drinking have fewer deaths the coefficients of the region codes 2-4 are less than 1 indicating that relative to the excluded region the northeast the other regions had smaller incidence of death the results show that the economic factors are important for explaining the differential impacts experienced by counties across the country both in terms of confirmed cases and deaths reported the demographic and health related factors are more pronounced in the estimation of deaths than reported cases this is not surprising since the virus does not discriminate 14  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the

depends on underlying health and demographic factors this paper has examined the differential experience of infections and deaths across the united states due to the covid-19 pandemic daily reported cases of confirmed cases and deaths were examined over a 20 day period from march 30 through april 19 2020 although data is available for over 2700 counties this paper focused on 771 counties that reported an average of 30 cases over the 20 day period the counties that are not included in the study had far fewer cases and reported deaths the counties that remain in the sample includes a vastly diverse set of counties the excluded counties are largely similar in the small number of cases and reported deaths and added significant costs in terms of computational complexity without adding much in terms of added value the analysis of the number of cases is based on an epidemiological model in which we included a county fixed effect this is a novel way to introduce heterogeneity in such a model as noted by avery et al 2020  the epidemiological models do not include the heterogeneity that economic models require a dynamic panel regression of the number of cases included the potential number of interactions between susceptible and infected individuals as a proportion of the population along with county fixed effects the results of the model were used to construct a vulnerability index for each county economic demographic and healthlifestyle factors were used to explain the differences in the vulnerability index across the counties the results showed that counties with higher economic activity have higher vulnerability the results show that regions around international airports experienced higher numbers of cases than ones that are over 300 miles away this is consistent with the fact that the virus has arrived on the us shores through travelers coming to the us from abroad the results also show that places with higher vulnerability also have a higher proportion of the population that does not use public transportation to go to work counties with more non-hispanic 15  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted

vulnerable the remaining demographic and health variables were largely insignificant due to many counties reporting zero deaths during many of the days used in the sample a zero-inflated negative binomial pooled regression was used to analyze how the economic demographic and health conditions impact the severity of the infection experienced by the counties the results show that the economic factors have a similar impact on deaths that is counties with higher income and cases also experienced higher deaths counties with higher income inequality and housing shortage also experienced more deaths in contrast to the results of the reported cases this regression showed that not only are counties with higher percentages of non-hispanic blacks native americans and immigrants more likely to die relative to counties with non-hispanic whites so are counties with a higher concentration of people with less than a college education counties with more personal care physicians per capita experienced lower deaths and so did counties with a lower percentage of the population with diabetes smokers and preventable hospital stays counties with higher obesity hiv and drinking are associated with lower deaths the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated how quickly a highly contagious respiratory illness can bring the global economy to a standstill there have been several such infections in the last ten years although none of them had the virulence or lethality of this virus most of them spread to a few countries and then disappeared the developed world remained largely unaffected by most of them and the experience of this pandemic has laid bare the lack of infrastructure to respond to such an incident the economics literature is not extensive in the area of pandemics and epidemics in developed countries the contribution of this study is to understand the various socioeconomic conditions that can make a county or region more vulnerable to both disease spread and severity of cases a national strategy to prepare the infrastructure for controlling the spread of infectious diseases should consider these factors and develop vulnerability indexes for each region

and classifying global covid-19 cases by using 1d deep convolution neural networks mark amo-boateng  the novel coronavirus disease and pandemic has taken the world by surprise and simultaneously challenged the health infrastructure of every country governments have resorted to draconian measures to contain the spread of the disease despite its devastating effect on their economies and education tracking the novel coronavirus 2019 disease remains vital as it influences the executive decisions needed to tighten or ease restrictions meant to curb the pandemic one-dimensional 1d convolution neural networks cnn have been used classify and predict several time-series and sequence data here 1d-cnn is applied to the time-series data of confirmed covid-19 cases for all reporting countries and territories the model performance was 905 accurate the model was used to develop an automated ai tracker web app ai country monitor and is hosted on httpsaicountrymonitororg this article also presents a novel concept of pandemic response curves based on cumulative confirmed cases that can be use to classify the stage of a country or reporting territory it is our firm believe that this artificial intelligence covid-19 tracker can be extended to other domains such as the monitoringtracking of sustainable development goals sdgs in addition to monitoring and tracking pandemics  the covid-19 disease was declared as a global pandemic 1 2 3 4 leading to the imposition of restrictions in almost all countries and states worldwide since then confirmed covid-19 cases as well as reported recoveries and deaths have been tracked and monitored on several apps and platforms 1 2 5-7  these tracking dashboards and apps provide data that can be used to estimate the rate of spread and other statistics which influences the top-level decisions by governments which may lead to tightening or easing of these state-wide restrictions and policies 6 8 9 10  the existing covid-19 trackers 2 6 11 12 focus on presenting the covid-19 case data as reported by countries and territories only as dashboards and charts  they and do not perform any predictions or classifications we also note that no studies or existing dashboardstrackers employ the use of artificial intelligence to predict the state of covid-19 for reporting countries and territories the method proposed in this study involves data preprocessing feature extraction and predictions using one dimensional deep convolution neural networks even though other algorithms exist that can be used in performing feature extraction and classification of sequence or time-series data convolution neural networks have been found to be superior 13 14 15 16 in extracting unique features and patterns in sequences 17 18 19  images and video data in fact deep convolution neural networks algorithms are behind some of the state-of-the-art detection and tracking algorithms found in everyday images and videos here 1d-cnn is used to extract unique feature identifiers that help predict the true state of countries and territories with respect to the novel coronavirus disease uncovering hidden and underlying patterns that might otherwise not be readily noticed we propose an artificial intelligence prediction algorithm for the novel coronavirus 2019 stages for countries and reporting territories based on 1-d deep convolution neural networks trained on confirmed covid-19 cases we also propose the concept of pandemic response curves also based on confirmed covid-19 cases that provides further insights into the state of each reporting country or territory our main aim is to provide real-time predictions of the stages of covid-19 that is unbiased or subjective to human prejudices for all countries and reporting territories also covid-19 state for each county and territories in the usa on on 11th 18th 25th and 31st may as classified by the ai used in this paper is given in figure 3  the color code for the diagram is red stage 1 -emerging cases actively rising amber stage 2 -controlling cases passed peak and actively declining green stage 3 -winning cases consistently zero or near zero after stage 2 changes in the us counties and territories as seen each week is shown in figure 4  it is very evident that though some counties did not have any changes over the month of may many counties had a negative change moving from stage 3 winning to stage 1 emerging while others moved in the opposite direction  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder

response curves as shown in figure 5  provides a visual inspection of the similarities among countries in the various stages of the covid-19 pandemic the curve highlights patterns that may have otherwise not been noticeable and helps clarify unbiasedly where each country or reporting territory is at in the covid-19 fight figure 6 provides some of the prc for selected countries in each of the stages also figure 7 shows the country ghana prc compared to other countries prc which recorded their first cases of covid-19 the same day the covid-19 pandemic is still ravaging many countries and territories and has led to strict movement restrictions including border closures and curfews in many countries public gatherings schools restaurants and hotels have also been closed as a results on its unprecedented method of spreading to help contain the virus many apps have been developed that track infections across the globe notable amongst them include the john hopkins csse covid-19 dashboard which has served as a reference database to understand further understand hidden insights to all reported cases an artificial intelligence was developed in this paper artificial intelligence is already being applied covid-19 diagnosis of chest xrays and ct-scans 20 21  in this paper we applied ai to the cumulative confirmed coronavirus cases to uncover hidden insights and tell the status of each country for the month of may this begun by preprocessing the data and manually classifying some of the data from the countries see table 3  the data was meant to help the ai be a generalizer of the patterns in the confirmed coronavirus cases further the ai was developed using convolution neural networks which has been demonstrated to be superior in finding hidden patters in images and videos by apply a 1d-cnn we had hoped for a very efficient pattern finding of the confirmed covid-19 cases and used that to classify the cases into three main groups stage 1 emerging active rising cases stage 2 controlling passed peak and active decline cases stage 3 winning consistently zero or near zero cases after active decline training the ai on the pre-classified data using the last 100

results of this operation for each country is shown in figure 1 and figure 3 for us counties and territories in addition tracking the changes overtime is paramount to helping us understand which countries or states are performing well or otherwise as such changes in the performance of all countries and states were also carried out these results for the month of may can be seen in figure 2 and table 2 for all countries and reporting territories similar results for us counties and territories are shown in figure 4  from the above results it can be clearly seen that very few countries states and us counties are changing their covid-19 status there are even instances where some countries or states went from consistently very low or zero cases to actively rising cases eg djibouti namibia zimbabwe the ai developed in this paper currently relies on patterns within the cumulative confirmed coronvavirus cases for all reporting countries and territories a further investigation into the performance of the ai led to the development of the pandemic response curves prc the prc showed that countries with similar covid-19 status had identical curves this suggests that the generalized prc shapes can be used to classify the status of all countries in an unbiased way the prcs for all countries highlighting the shapes and similarities of curves irrespective of population and other metrics are shown in 5 selected countries with kwown covid-19 status are shown in 6 to further highlight the uniqueness of the prcs ghana a stage 1 emerging country was compared to other countries that recorded their first case on the same day this result is shown in 7 for namibia stage 3 winning -see figure 7a  seychelles stage 2 controlling -see figure 7b  and phillipines also stage 1 emerging -see figure 7c  it is hoped that the prcs be developed further to help automatically classify pandemics  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has

substantial burdens on healthcare system following this human-to-human spread we aim to scrutinise the currently available information and evaluate the burden of healthcare systems during this

different diagnosis rates as well as different public health intervention efficacy our estimates suggest assuming 50 diagnosis rate if no public health interventions were implemented that the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported with estimated 88075 cases as of 31 st january 2020 and projected burdens on isolation wards and icu would be 34786 and 9346 respectively the estimated burdens on healthcare system could be largely reduced if at least 70 efficacy of public health intervention is achieved the health system burdens arising from the actual number of cases infected by the novel coronavirus appear to be considerable if no effective public health interventions were implemented this calls for continuation of implemented anti-transmission

particularly for the isolation wards and icu if no effective public health interventions were implemented our analysis is limited by the availability of data and the lack of understanding of 2019-ncov first sir model can be substantially affected by the input parameters ie the transition probabilities which were estimated based on either the data released by the nhc of the peoples republic of china or other recent investigations only the reported incidence between 000 and 2400 on 28 th jan 2020 was used at this stage as more data become available further investigation should be considered second classic sir model assumes a constant infection rate which is not likely to be true as interventions being implemented therefore in this study we constructed sir models with multiple efficacy rates of public health interventions as proxy for the change of infection rate third our prediction can be influenced by the diagnosis rate therefore we simulated a number of scenarios with different hypothesised diagnosis rates of 10 50 and 90 to estimate the actual number of infected cases for the reason of mild or moderate symptoms reported by part of infected cases and the relatively long incubation period observed it is reasonable to model a context of low diagnosis rate in fact recent investigation also suggests the current diagnosis rate could be low and likely lower than 10 13 our

block the viral transmission between individuals within and across cities are urgently needed fortunately the lockdown of wuhan city has taken place and is believed to have largely minimised the spreads from the epicentre to other areas however the mayor of wuhan later announced approximately five million of residents had left the city ahead of the implementation of lockdown due to scheduled travel during chinese new year and panic about the lockdown 14  which may compromise the antispread effect of such city lockdown measure as to spreads to other cities to date information on transmission modes and severity of this novel coronavirus is still limited 15  further preventive measures to diminish contact between persons and reduce social distance such as school closure public transport shutdown common activities suspension etc 7 8  should be implemented as to avoidance of healthcare system breakdown to achieve higher efficacy of the public health interventions efforts from individuals should not be neglected in light of no available specific vaccines and treatments for such novel coronavirus thus far a range of precautionary behaviours between individuals at homes and in communities are essential and vital to obtain proper control of the spreads in public and likely preventing superspreading events personal prevention strategies for seasonal influenza and other viral infections are still applicable during the present outbreak inclusive of restricting ill residents from common activities excluding symptomatic persons from entering homesfacilities limiting visit especially of wet markets live poultry markets or farms maintaining personal hygiene eg frequently performing hand hygiene washing hands with soap and water and cough etiquette eg covering nose

randomised controlled trial 16  consisting of multiple region-varying medical settings showed both n95 respirators and medical masks can effectively prevent influenza and other viral respiratory infections apart from facemask wear being required in public of the epicentre city in hubei province it has also been mandated by the guangdong provincial government that facemasks should be worn in public with effect from 26 th january four days after the implementation in wuhan the centre for disease control and prevention the united states also emphasised the importance of wearing a facemask at all times when staying with infected individuals in shared spaces as one of precautions for large-scale spreads in community specified in their interim guidance for prevention for 2019-ncov from spreading in home and communities 17  all these are extremely important in raising awareness in the public as to personal preventive steps given the present situation mild or subclinical symptoms observed in many cases and observed long incubation period operational issues associated with wearing disposable facemasks to maximise their preventive effectiveness should be also publicised and educated to the general public including correct ways of wearing facemask hygiene practices across the procedure of mask wearing disposal of used masks volunteering from healthcare professionals appears to play a major role in reduction of fears amongst the public imported healthcare support from other cities are certainly vital to the healthcare system in wuhan during the present outbreak 18

health measures to curb this very outbreak without delay otherwise the current healthcare system would not be able to sustain once the breakdown occurred mortality would be expected to soar due to lack of medical resources home isolation for patients with mild symptoms could be one of the possible managements if the ultimate limit of isolation beds at the city or province level was exceeded we hope that all the essential measures mentioned above can be inclusively implemented so as to achieve at least 70 efficacy as our projection any primary preventive steps are expected to be contributed to the curb on viral transmission and ultimately bring about the emergency situation to a controllable level via a functioning healthcare system to conclude our estimates of the healthcare system

cross-sectional study that was conducted among pregnant women attending antenatal care at alex ekwueme federal university teaching hospital abakaliki from february 1 2020 to march 31 2020 ebonyi state is one of the five states in the south-east geopolitical zone of nigeria 12 abakaliki is a semi-urban area and the capital of ebonyi state nigeria the population comprises mainly of subsistence farmers and petty traders christianity forms their major religion and the inhabitants are predominantly igbo speaking all consenting eligible pregnant women who attended antenatal care during the study period study criteria all women who gave informed consent to participate in the study were included in the study participants who had a verbal communication problem and complete loss of hearing were excluded the sample size was calculated by taking variability of proportion of 18 from the average of 450 pregnant women who attend antenatal clinic per month in the hospital 13 using open epi software package for the determination of sample size and design effect of 15 at error margin of 5 the final minimum sample size was calculated as 227 after considering 10 non-response rate for any unpredictable events the final required sample size was 2497 however 284 women were recruited for the study the study participants were selected by using simple random sampling method and the first participant was selected by using lottery method the dependent outcome variables for this study were the level of knowledge and practice of preventive measures against covid-19 infection the

it is the first study to evaluate the knowledge practice and sociodemographic variables associated with poor knowledge and practice of preventive measures against coronavirus infection among pregnant mothers in a low-resource setting these associated factors of poor practice were determined using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis these statistical methods are appropriate and efficient method for determining associations between dependent and independent variables despite these strengths this study has a limitation it is a single centre study which limits the generalization of the study findings to the study area a multicentre study would have been ideal in conclusion this study showed that most of the participants had adequate knowledge of preventive

possible reason of reduced susceptibility of females to viral infection is that females have a lot of x chromosome and estrogen that are vital components in development of innate and adaptive immunity 47  meanwhile numbers of patients with covid-19 infection had chronic comorbidities mainly hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease which is similar to mers-cov population those results indicate that older adult males with chronic underlying disease might be more susceptibility to covid-19 or mers-cov  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who

1 in terms of laboratory testing reduced lymphocytes and increased crp were found in both covid-19 and mers-cov patients this result indicates that covid-19 might be associated with cellular immune response mainly act on lymphocytes like mers-cov does 48  the cells infected by viruses induce the release of numbers of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation storm in the body moreover increased cytokines might make damage to related organs such as liver 49  our results demonstrated that abnormal value of ast was found in mers-cov population but not in covid-19 population the possible reason is that the follow-up time of covid-19 population was too short and the liver might remain to be in compensatory stage for this result a long follow-up time study is urgently needed on the other hand our results suggested that mers-cov population had a higher rate of icu admission and fatality than covid-19 population indicating that compared with mers-cov covid-19 has less toxic and more easily cured however lower discharge rate was found in covid population than in mers-cov population the possible explanation is that most of covid-19 patients remained to be hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission and data on those patients could not be obtained in time thus careful interpretation is urged for this result up to now no effective strategy has been found for treatment of covid-19 infection 50  currently the measure to covid-19 is to control the source of the infection taking personal protective works to reduce the risk of transmission and early diagnosing isolating and supportive treating for confirmed patients in the present study our systematic results of cure rate of drug for mers-cov infection indicated that ribavirin and interferon oseltamivir antivirals and intravenous immunoglobulin all had been effective for mers-cov infection with the cure rate of those drugs was 742 692 671 and 625 respectively thus we  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

several limitations first many patients infected by covid-19 remained to be hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission leading to the unavailable of some data second the follow-up time of covid-19 population is too short to get related data from long-term observations of this disease third finding of statistical tests and p values between covid-19 and mers-cov populations should be interpreted with caution fourth the number of mers-cov patients treated by drugs is small careful understanding is needed for the cure rate of drug for this disease finally as covid-19 is still developing around the world and remains to have many unknowns the results of this study are staged and need to be carefully understood more large-sample multicentre high-quality research should be performed to update this study our systematic review reveals that main clinical manifestations of both covid-19 and mers-cov populations are fever cough and generalised weakness and myalgia ards is main complication of both two populations covid-19 population has a shorter incubation time and lower rate of icu admission discharge and fatality compared with mres-cov population this study was

their economies to some extent after the coronavirus lockdown although there are many debates about whether states reopened their economies too early no study has examined this effect quantitatively this paper takes advantage of the daily cases deaths and test data at the state level and uses the synthetic control method to address this question i find that reopening the economy caused an additional 2000 deaths in the 6 states alabama colorado georgia mississippi tennessee and texas that reopened before may 1 st by three weeks after reopening it also increased daily confirmed cases by 40 52 and 53 after the first second and third week of reopening respectively moreover contrary to scientists prescription that expanding tests is a necessary condition for reopening these states witnessed a decline in daily tests by 17 47 and 31 after the first second and third week of reopening respectively  if states reopen prematurely and dont have the capability to handle new cases the consequences could be really serious and more outbreaks can occur -anthony fauci may 12 2020 the outbreak of coronavirus in 2020 has become one of the most serious challenges to public health not only in the united states but also throughout the world in response to the rapid spread of the coronavirus 43 states and washington dc issued the stay-athome orders and shut down their economies on one hand the stay-at-home order is believed to increase the fraction of people who stay at home all day guo 2020  reduce coivd-19 cases and save lives fowler et al 2020 friedson et al 2020 lyu and wehby 2020  on the other hand the economic cost of stay-at-home order was large and increased unemployment significantly on april 24 th  alaska was the first to reopen its economy followed by colorado reopened on april 26 th  montana reopened on april 26 th  and mississippi april 27 th  etc there are fierce policy debates about whether some states in the united states reopened their economies too fast stock 2020 asked the following questions what are the consequences of reopening now as opposed to say waiting until deaths decline further among npis that have similar effects on the paths of infections and deaths are some more economically desirable than others how can one most effectively reopen the economy while achieving some public health objective whether flattening the curve or sharply reducing infections and deaths thus far the answers to these questions are limited alvarez et al 2020 constructed a planners dynamic planning problem and found that the optimal policy prescribes a lockdown for around two weeks followed by a gradual loosening of restrictions in the following four months rampini 2020 calibrated an sir model with heterogeneous population and suggested a sequential approach to reopening the economy one consensus that current research has reached is that sufficient testing is a necessary condition to reopen the economy taipale et al 2020 alvarez et al 2020 berger et al 2020  the goal of this study is to quantify the effect of reopening the economy on daily confirmed cases and deaths i use the synthetic control method abadie and gardeazabal 2003 abadie et al 2010 to estimate the effect of this policy in the states that were the first to open the main advantage of this approach is that it requires fewer observations and imposes fewer functional form restrictions to construct a robust estimator compared with the difference-in-difference method using the state-level daily confirmed covid-19 cases covid-related deaths data and test data from march 1 st to may 24 th  i comprehensively analyze the effect of reopening policy george floyds death on may 25 th sparked nationwide protests in subsequent weeks these widespread protests may be linked to the spread of the coronavirus and may bias the analysis of policies to reopen the economy if i include the data after may 25 th  my preferred results suggest that reopening policies causes an additional 2000 deaths in the 6 states that reopened before may 1 st by three weeks after reopening reopening also significantly increased the daily confirmed cases in these 6 states by more than 1000 however the increase in the cases was not due to the increase in tests conducted on the contrary the number of tests conducted in these states significantly decreased all these results suggest that reopening the states too early incurred substantial public health costs the covid-19 outbreak has been accompanied by a cascade of academic research many papers discuss the effect of social distancing on flattening the curve kapoor et al 2020 mangrum and niekamp 2020  however there is little evidence on the impact of reopening the economy my study mainly focuses on the costs of reopening the economy the results of my paper shed light on its potential consequences and lays the foundations to answering questions asked by stock 2020  when and how to reopen the economy section 2 introduces the data and empirical methods i use to study the impact of reopening the state on confirmed cases deaths and tests section 3 discusses the results a conclusion is drawn in section 4 state-level data on coronavirus daily confirmed cases deaths comes from killeen et al 2020s jhu dataset the coronavirus test data come from the new york times dataset and is aggregated by the covidtracking website 2  the cdc in some states conflated viral and antibody tests at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak and reported both then they adjusted this data and reported the viral test results only therefore the number of tests in some states might become negative at the date when they adjusted the test data it is worthwhile to note that the test data are more volatile and of lower quality compared with confirmed cases and deaths data i collect the statelevel confirmed covid-19 cases covid-19 related deaths and number of tests data from march 1st to may 24 th on a daily basis the date the state reopened the economy comes from the new york times dataset and the kaiser family foundation 3  the treatment group includes the states that 2 httpscovidtrackingcomapi 3 httpswwwkfforgcoronavirus-policy-watchlifting-social-distancing-measures-in-america-state-actionsmetrics reopened the economy before may 1 st  the remaining states are assigned to the control group i also restrict our control group to the states that reopened after may 10 th in appendix 2 and the results are still robust table 1 lists the states that reopened before may 10 th   i use the synthetic control method introduced by abadie and gardeazabal 2003 and abadie et al 2011 to estimate the effect of reopening the economy on the daily confirmed cases and daily covid-19 related deaths in the nine states that reopened before may 1 st  the synthetic control method allows more flexible functional forms and imposes fewer restrictions on the observations the estimation procedure can be summarized as follows in the first step i choose the optimal weight w  to minimize where is the value of the m th variable for the 9 treated states 0 is a 1 n vector containing the values of the m th variable for the units in our donor pool which includes n42 states and the district of columbia that reopened or planned to reopen after may 1 st  as noted above i also consider as an alternate control group the states that reopened or planned to reopen after may 10 th  and the results remain robust in the second step the effect of reopening the economy can be estimated as where and are the outcome variables ie daily confirmed cases deaths and the number of tests in step 2 i use the bootstrapping method to conduct hypothesis testing the estimated effect  is denoted by the estimated variance is where b denotes the total bootstrapping times b50 in this study denotes the synthetic control estimator for state i at time b the observables i choose to match across the treatment and control pools include the outcome variables ie daily confirmed cases deaths and number of tests and a set of controls that includes population density and hospital beds per capita i report the results that use only the outcomes variables as the matching criterion the results remain unchanged if i add a set of controls with regard to the time window i largely follow friedson et al 2020  my primary strategy is to generate a synthetic control that closely approximates coronavirus cases and deaths and tests in the treated states in each of seven pre-treatment days when i extend the pre-treatment days to 14 in appendix 3 the results remain quite robust one drawback of the synthetic control method is that the variable of interest ie daily confirmed cases deaths and number of tests in the treated states should be written as a convex combination of the same variables in the donor pool therefore it is hard to find an ideal synthetic state for some states with the highest daily confirmed cases or deaths and for some states with the lowest daily confirmed cases and deaths eg alaska montana and idaho i delete alaska montana and idaho from the treated pool and analyze the effect of reopening the economy in the 6 remaining states alabama colorado georgia mississippi tennessee and texas that reopened before may 1 st  in this section i present the synthetic control results using the daily confirmed cases covid-19 related deaths and number of tests conducted as the variable of interest in appendix 1 i present parallel results that uses the same variable of interest but on a per million population basis it is quite similar to our main results figure 1 compares daily confirmed cases for each of the 6 states that reopened before may 1 st and their synthetic control states i assign weights to synthetic control states based on the daily confirmed cases on each of 7 pre-treatment dates the y-axis is the daily confirmed case in thousands and the x-axis is the date the dashed line in the middle represents the effective date when the state reopened the economy trends in daily confirmed cases for the treated states before they reopened the economy do not show a clear declining pattern the results in figure 1 suggest that the synthetic control states match quite well most of the treated state during the pretreatment periods although texas is not matched very well however after the treated states reopened the economy two lines diverge markedly with the daily confirmed cases in treated states that reopened the economy before may 1 st increasing much faster than the synthetic control states table 2  note that in table 2  week 0 refers to the week before the reopening policy weeks 1 2 and 3 refer to the weeks after the reopening policy respectively the column treated-synthetic refers to the difference in terms of the daily confirmed case between the treated state and the synthetic state the coefficients reported in table 2 could be interpreted as the difference in terms of the number of daily covid-19 confirmed cases between the treated states and the synthetic control states at week i for instance 743 at column 3 row 3 means that on average colorado has 743 more covid-19 confirmed cases on a daily basis compared with the synthetic control states for colorado  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 26 2020  table 2 support the patterns reported in figure 1  i find that there doesnt exist a significant difference in daily confirmed cases between treated and synthetic control states before the date when the treated states reopened the economy however this difference becomes large and significant after the reopening policy and the gap reaches its peak 2 weeks after reopening then remains relatively constant in the 3 rd week using the average daily confirmed cases during the pre-treatment week as the benchmark i find that the daily confirmed cases increase by 40 in the first week after reopening the economy and this number increases to 52 and 53 in the second and the third weeks after the policy respectively the analysis suggests that if the goal of the policy-maker is to reduce the transmission of the coronavirus then it may have not been successful for these 6 states  i then change the variable of interest to daily covid-19 related deaths and conduct a similar analysis as in section 31 figure 2 reports the synthetic control results for daily deaths the y-axis in figure 2 represents daily deaths and the x-axis denotes the date i assign weights to synthetic control states based on the daily deaths on each 7 pre-treatment dates i find that the daily covid-19 related deaths are more volatile and harder to predict than the daily confirmed cases especially for georgia and colorado nonetheless i still find that daily deaths between the treated states and the synthetic states start to diverge after the treated states reopened the economy the results in figure 2 suggest that reopening the state too early greatly increases the deaths  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 26 2020  i check the timing effect of the reopening policy and conduct statistical inference using the bootstrapping method the results are reported in table 3  the notation in table 3 remains exactly the same as in table 2  with week 0 denoting the pre-treatment periods and week 1 2 and 3 denoting the first second and the third week after reopening the economy the coefficients reported in table 3 can be interpreted as the difference in the number of daily covid-19 related deaths between the treated states and the synthetic control states at week i for instance 26 in column 3 row 3 means that on average colorado has 26 more covid-19 related deaths on a daily basis compared with its synthetic controls  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 26 2020  table 3 support the patterns reported in figure 2  the results suggest that the difference in daily deaths between treated and synthetic control states is negligible during the pre-treatment period then daily deaths in treated states increase by around 9 compared with the synthetic control states in the first week after reopening the economy this number increases to 25 and 38 in the second and the third week after reopening the economy respectively i find that there is a one to two week lag in the increase in deaths compared with the increase in daily confirmed cases this result is consistent with wang et al 2020 and wang et al 2020 who argue that the median time from symptom onset to death is around 2 weeks converting the percentage to numbers the above results suggest that reopening the economy early causes an additional of 2000 deaths in these 6 states within 3 weeks after the policy one consensus that scientists have reached is that expanding testing capacity is a necessary condition for reopening the economy testing aggressively could discover new cases at the early stage and permit efficient contact tracing taipale et al 2020 propose testing every individual repeatedly and then isolating the infected individuals peto et al 2020 argued that aggressively testing is the lockdown exit strategy for the uk they estimated that for a local population of 200000 people with 90 compliance this will require 26000 tests per day in this section i check whether states expanded their test capacity after they reopened the economy if the daily tests performed significantly expanded in these states the increase of daily confirmed cases does not necessarily imply that the incidence of the coronavirus per million people increased figure 3 reports the synthetic control results for the number of tests performed 4  with the same notation as in figure 1 and 2 i assign weights to synthetic control states based on the number of daily tests on each of 7 pre-treatment dates note that because of the adjustment of the conflating of the viral and antibody test data in mississippi the number of tests performed on may 23 becomes negative although the test data is more volatile and of lower quality compared with confirmed cases and deaths data it could still provide some suggestive evidence as to how tests were conducted after the reopening of the economy in these states the results in figure 3 suggest that except for georgia the number of tests performed in the treated states after they reopened the economy decreased compared with their control counterparts 4 colorado delaware georgia maine mississippi missouri new hampshire pennsylvania texas vermont and virginia mix the viral test and antibody test data table 4  using the same notation as in table 2 and table 3  the coefficients in table 4 can be interpreted as the difference in terms of the number of tests performed on a daily basis between the treated states and the synthetic control states at week i for instance -16034 at column 3 row 3 means that on average colorado conducted 16034 fewer tests on a daily basis compared with the synthetic control states for colorado  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 26 2020  table 4 support the pattern in figure 3  the difference in the number of tests performed on a daily basis is negligible between the treated and synthetic control states during the pre-treatment period week 0 however except for georgia the number of tests performed in the treated states significantly decreases after the reopening of the economy using the number of tests performed in treated states at week 0 pre-treatment week as a benchmark 5 the number of tests performed in the treated states decreases by around 17 in the first week after they reopened this number becomes 47 and 31 in the second and the third weeks respectively the analysis underscores two points first the increase in the number of daily confirmed cases in the states that reopened before may 1 st doesnt come from the expansion of the tests on the contrary the test number shrinks after reopening the economy second these six states are not well-prepared for reopening lacking tests and reopening the economy too early is accompanied by significant public health costs appendix 1 contains parallel results on a per million people basis i find that reopening the states too early for the six states increased their daily confirmed cases on a per million basis by 155 200 and 207 after the first second and third week of reopening respectively with texas witnessing the highest increase it increased the daily deaths on a per million basis by 15 44 and 76 after the first second and third week of reopening respectively with texas alabama and mississippi witnessing the highest increase it decreased the tests on a per million basis by 978 2611 and 1731 after the first second and third week of reopening respectively by may 29 2020 all 50 states in the united states had reopened their economies to some extent after the coronavirus lockdown there have been many policy debates about when a state should reopen its economy on one hand reopening the economy reduces unemployment on the other hand reopening the economy prematurely may increase the spread of the coronavirus there have been few rigorous quantitative studies of this topic this study uses the synthetic control method to rigorously study the short-term effect of reopening the economy on the daily confirmed covid-19 cases daily deaths and daily tests in 6 states alabama colorado georgia mississippi tennessee and texas that reopened before may 1 st  i find that all these states experienced a sharp increase in both confirmed covid-19 cases and covid-19 related deaths except for georgia the other 5 states saw a decline in the number of tests performed after they reopened the economy the magnitude of the increase in confirmed cases and deaths is substantial it resulted in an additional 2000 deaths in the 6 states compared with their control counterparts it also increased daily confirmed cases by 40 52 and 53 after the first second and third weeks of reopening respectively however the increase 5 the average number of daily tests performed at week 0 is 5684  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 26 2020  of confirmed covid-19 cases and deaths was not due to the expansion of tests on the contrary the number of tests performed on a daily basis decreased by 17 47 and 31 after the first second and third weeks of reopening respectively the findings are robust to the pre-treatment time windows and the choice of observables with which the donor states are weighted my study provides some evidence that 6 states reopened prematurely reopening increased both deaths and transmission of the virus there are however additional questions that future research must address first my work estimates the public health costs associated with reopening the economy future work needs to focus on the economic benefits of reopening second it is critical to study what is the most efficient way to reopen the economy from a public health perspective if expanding tests are the best answer to this question then how many tests are needed to monitor the transmission of covid-19 after reopening the economy third this study focuses on the short-term effects of early reopening of the economy early

table 3  reopening the economy in the six states significantly increased the daily covid-19 related deaths per million population texas also saw the largest increase in covid-19 related deaths per

for georgia the remaining 5 states that reopened before may 1 st did not increase their test capacity this would have enabled identifying cases at an early stage and permitted contact tracing again

because this method is quick low-cost and reaches many participants 6 7 8  during an epidemic a face-to-face interview is not appropriate due to self-quarantine telephone usage is increased thus an online survey is most convenient to ensure all potential respondents have access to survey completion the major limitation of this method is that internet access is differentially apportioned

accounts are more prevalent among the younger educated population as is reflected in our respondent demographics the level of knowledge was higher among older individuals which is consistent with previous studies an online survey about covid-19 conducted in the united kingdom during march 17-18 similarly demonstrated that older adults consider covid-19 to be life-threatening 10 however overall awareness and appreciation of the risks appears to be higher among the uk respondents 77 of whom worried about a coronavirus outbreak compared to 44 of georgian respondents according to our study the

the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic 1  sars-cov-2 was first reported in december 2019 when a pneumonia outbreak occurred in wuhan city hubei province china 2  the infection rapidly spread throughout mainland china and subsequently to all continents in at least 212 countries on march 11 th -2020 the world health organization who declared covid-19 a pandemic 3  so far there are over 62 million confirmed sars-cov-2 cases worldwide that have caused more than 373000 deaths the clinical manifestations of covid-19 vary notably among affected individuals most patients develop mild to moderate flu-like symptoms however some cases progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards that can be fatal 4  the association of many of the initial cases with the huanan seafood wholesale market in hubei a wildlife animal market suggested a zoonotic origin of the virus 5  coronaviruses covs belong to the coronavirinae subfamily of coronaviridae family and nidovirales order alpha and betacoronaviruses infect only mammals including humans whereas gamma and delta coronaviruses infect mainly birds although some of them can also harm mammals 6  in humans covs cause primarily respiratory and enteric infections that can be either mild such as the common cold or more severe manifestations such as bronchitis and pneumonia 7  sars-cov-2 is the seventh characterized coronavirus that infect humans already known coronaviruses cov-hku1 cov-nl63 cov-oc43 and cov-229e induce mostly mild diseases 7 while sars-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus are highly pathogenic and caused large outbreaks of severe respiratory disease during 2002-2003 8  and in 2012 and onwards 9  respectively sars-cov-2 is a large enveloped virus belonging to the genus betacoronavirus the viral genome is a 30 kb single-stranded positive-sense rna encoding approximately 9860 amino acids two open reading frames orfs orf1a and orf1b located at the 5 terminus of the genomic rna encode 16 non-structural proteins nsps involved in virus replication and possibly in the evasion of host immunity in addition the viral genome encodes four structural proteins spike protein s envelope protein e membrane protein m  and nucleocapsid protein n and several accessory proteins 10 11  the envelope spike glycoprotein mediates receptor binding on the host cell and plays an essential role in determining host tropism 12  sars-cov-2 uses the ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor to enter human cells as does sars-cov 13  molecular characterization of the sars-cov2 pandemic begun from the very first isolate to arise in hubei china 2 and has already yielded more than 10000 complete genome sequences worldwide 14  sars-cov2 although not rapidly evolving possibly due to the ability of its nsp14 exonuclease 15 to correct replication errors has already shown divergence from the initial isolate that has differentially spread around the globe various methodologies have divided locally or internationally the virus isolates into two or more cladeslineages 14 16 17 18  tracing virus variability through full genome sequencing apart from its use as an analytical tool to assist the epidemiological analysis of the pandemic may also provide an approach to tracking antigenic diversity that will assist towards the assessment of potential antigenic drift of the virus during outbreaks as well as towards vaccine development  greece is one of the countries in europe least affected by the current

in greece was the main epicentre of the pandemic encompassing the majority of cases and considerable spread of the virus in the community our study focused on the genomic characterization of a number of isolates from a number of healthcare facilities in the metropolitan area of athens that included 14 hospitals and other diagnostic or health care providers the aim of the study was to analyse the entire viral genomes through next generation sequencing and to analyse heterogeneity and dominant variants circulating and spreading throughout the capital during the first month of the outbreak these variants form a representative group of viruses that seeded athens before and during gradual lockdown the analysis focused on links between countries with high viral prevalence and greece and possible lines of infection among positive cases in the country between march 5 and april 4 2020 oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were submitted for molecular diagnosis for sars-cov2 virus to the laboratory of microbiology medical school national and kapodistrian university of athens designated as one of the two reference laboratories for covid-19 in athens greece during the aforementioned

characterization of sars-cov2 variants that initiated coronavirus outbreak in athens greece in 2020 it has been hypothesized that the 2020 coronavirus epidemic in greece was initiated via imported cases from various countries where sars-cov2 already circulated after its international spread from china during january and february 2020 full genome analysis through next generation sequencing was

potential amongst quasispecies black spikes figure 4  several quasispecies frequently rose in different patients signifying areas with high and low evolutionary potential mapping the density of unique positions of quasispecies within the 94 samples supported this notion figure 4  quasispecies observed among athens isolates are concentrated in hot spots located in limited areas of orf1ab eg nsp3 and nsp6 and more predominantly in the downstream orfs encoded by coronavirus subgenomic rnas eg s orf8 and n high evolutionary potential regions are often hotspots for aminoacid substitutions that may have direct effect on protein functionality indeed amino acid substitutions presented similar clustering in the same regions of the genome figure 4  five isolates presented deletions of aminoacids two closely related isolates 146 and 53 belonging to the b21 lineage presented a deletion of two amino acids in orf1a nsp1 this deletion has been reported previously in various isolates eg mt385441 mt344956 as presented in ncbi genbank similarly two closely related isolates 213 and 214 belonging to the b lineage presented an one-amino-acid deletion in orf1a nsp2 this deletion has also been reported previously in various isolates eg mt457399 mt451006 deposited in ncbi genbank an isolate 51 diverging significantly from the b1 lineage presented a premature stop codon within orf7a the stop-codon-variant was the predominant variant in the sample 1179 out of 1183 reads while the wild-type variant was only present as background 1 out of 1183 reads premature termination of the protein was predicted to result in the abrogation of 28 amino acids from the c terminus of orf7a protein intriguingly this moiety represents the intrinsically disordered c terminal region of sars coronavirus

for european and international tourists close epidemiological surveillance of post-quarantine local sars-cov2 outbreaks is required in order to avoid or contain a second pandemic wave and viral reintroduction in the country full genome next generation sequencing of viruses during local or widespread epidemics eg the ebola virus epidemic has particularly assisted as an analytical tool for the determination of conventional and unconventional transmission chains 29 30 31  sars-cov2 pandemic is the first pandemic that has been rapidly monitored through genomic analysis of isolates around the world 14  phylogenetic analysis clustering described major and minor viral lineages with various degrees of prevalence from the very beginning of the pandemic high prevalence of major lineages was assisted by major sars-cov2 outbreaks in europe followed by outbreaks in the americas 14 28  following the dynamic nomenclature system by rambaut et al the outbreak in athens during the first 5 weeks after the first identified case was initiated in a greater extent by lineage b1 viruses and at a lesser extent by lineages a2 a5 b b11 b15 b2 b21 and b3 worldwide dominant distribution of lineage b1 may account for its high prevalence in athens while introduction of numerous other lineages implies multiple routes of virus introduction in the country 32 lineages did not present any clustering regarding the health care provider supporting limited hospital-acquired infections during the first 5 weeks of the epidemic in greece however two cases of suspected nosocomial infections were observed both of which are related to b21 lineage viruses specific branches of the sars-cov2 phylogenetic tree in europe encompass dominant variants from local outbreaks in european countries that were vastly affected by the pandemic such variants with minimal or no divergence are found amongst the athens isolates signifying direct transmission between countries athens isolates cluster in the european phylogenetic tree in multiple branches that represent genetic traits that were first observed in countries that served as transmission hubs for europe and subsequently for the americas 14  such as belgium united kingdom italy and spain intriguingly athens was mostly affected by viruses that share genetic traits with variants originating from the united kingdom possibly correlating with a wave of repatriation of greeks leaving the uk during the outbreak further genomic analysis of athens sars-cov2 isolates revealed a rich variety 121 of dominant 50 in a sample nucleotide polymorphisms and multiple high and low abundance quasispecies quasispecies observed among athens isolates are located in hot spots across the genome although concentrated in the structuralaccessory protein part as

premature stop codon in orf7a resulting in the abrogation of 28 amino acids it is the first time that this variant is reported although others have previously reported an extensive deletion in orf7a 33  such variations may represent the continuous adaptation of the virus to human cells or viral tendency towards natural attenuation 34 35  next generation sequencing of full viral genomes has greatly assisted epidemiology either resolving lines of infection or assessing virus variability in the community rapid genetic characterization of isolates following molecular diagnosis can be a powerful analytical tool of molecular epidemiology during the postlockdown era of the pandemic local outbreaks and sporadic cases should be promptly traced especially in immunologically nave countries like greece while cessation of quarantine measures is required to reduce economic effects of the pandemic resumption of passenger flight connections to athens and greece may present a serious challenge in tracking sporadic cases or outbreaks our work delineated the pool of variants that initiated the outbreak of sars-cov2 in athens and may serve as reference for resolving future lines of

to jun 30th 2020 the first case in india was reported in kerala on january 30th 2020 to break the chain of spreading government announced a nationwide lockdown on march 24th 2020 which is increased two times the ongoing lockdown 30 is over on may 18th 2020 we derived how the lockdown relaxation is going to impact on containment of the outbreak here the exponential growth model has been used to derive the epidemic curve based on the data collected from february 11th 2020 to may 11th 2020 and the machine learning based linear regression model that gives the epidemic curve to predict the cases with the continuous flow of the lockdown we estimate that if the lockdown is continuing with more relaxation then the estimated infected cases reach up to 116 crores by june 30th 2020 and the lockdown would persist with current restriction then the expected predicted infected cases are 569 lacs the exponential growth model and the linear regression model are advantageous to predict the number of affected cases of covid-19 these models can be used for forecasting in long term intervals it shows from our result that lockdown with certain restriction has a vital role in preventing the spreading of this epidemic in this current situation  the novel coronavirus puts the world to go through its distress stage the world health organisation who is declared this situation as a global public health emergency in the last two decades more than 10000 people in additive order are affected by the contagious coronavirus which is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 1  according to the centre for disease control and prevention cdc the recent coronavirus has some correspondence with sars-cov and mers-cov 2  the first case was reported as unidentified pneumonia in the peoples republic of china prc in late december 2019 2  which later detected as coronavirus who was later on march 11 th 2020 framed it as pandemic 1  then as time flows the number of coronavirus victims spread exponentially who named this novel coronavirus as covid-19 on february 11 th 2020 3  the initial symptoms are fever cough and

growth model is used to predict the number of positive cases if the lockdown is not continuing strictly after may 18 th 2020 and the linear regression model is used to predict the number of positive cases with concern to lockdown continue exponential growth is a mathematical function which tells us the number of cases at a specific moment in time according to the researcher the first period of epidemic follows exponential growth this is the reason to use this mathematical model for the coronavirus outbreak 17  in this model the quantity increases over a period the quantity is proportional to the derivative of the quantity with respect to time a quantity undergoing exponential growth is the exponential function of time that means the time variable is the exponent we observed the growth

in the worst case all the possible number of people infected after that the curve has to be flattened so in the epidemic the exponential growth model follows the path of a logistic curve it increases until the inflation point at the inflation point the growth rate becomes 1 and the derivative becomes 0 after the inflation point the growth factor may be less than 0 and the derivative is negative and when the growth factor tends to 0 the line flattens the total number of cases is double the number of cases at an inflection point  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is

taking days as only dependent vectors is also questionable but we investigate the trend in our data to overcome the first challenge we resample the data by taking the interquartile range iqr range 25

shortage of data there might be a problem of overfitting but we achieve train test accuracy and test set accuracy nearly the same in this paper we only predict the number of infected positive cases in the future but dont predict the recovery and death cases the recovery and death of positive cases depend on various factors like underlying diseases in a positive case age of positive cases and also the recovery of an infected person also depends on the average age group infected and the immunity system so we only limited our prediction of the number of infected people however the growth rate

west for the particle filter pf with siru-type epidemic model to monitor and forecast cases of covid-19 in brazil from february up to september we filter the number of cumulative reported cases and estimate model parameters and more importantly unreported infectious cases asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals the parameters under study are related to the attenuation factor of the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious becoming reported as symptomatic infectious initially the problem is analysed through particle swarm optimization pso based simulations to provide initial guesses which are then refined by means of pf simulations subsequently two additional steps are performed to verify the capability of the adjusted model to predict and forecast new cases according to the results the pandemic peak is expected to take place in mid-june 2020 with about 25000 news cases per day as medical and hospital resources are limited this result shows that public health interventions are essential and should not be relaxed prematurely so that the coronavirus pandemic is controlled and conditions are available for the treatment of the most severe cases  the first infection by the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 was detected on december 31 2019 in wuhan china and a pandemic was declared by the world health organization on march 11 2020 1 2  such infection causes the covid-19 whose main symptoms include cough fever difficulty breathing it presented a scary evolution with millions of infected people and thousands of deaths in the world because these facts the affected countries and cities around the world have been reacting in different ways towards locally controlling the disease evolution in brazil the first case of covid-19 was confirmed on february 26 2020 ever since the number has surged to more than 310000 cases of the disease according to the brazilian ministry of health 3  such milestone makes this nation to become the third one with the highest number of infections in the world behind only the united states and russia specifically amazonas ceara pernambuco rio de janeiro and sao paulo have been the worst affected states in brazil whose cases correspond to at least 60 of all cases in the country the coronavirus has so far been responsible for more than 20000 deaths on may 21 2020 an unenviable record was broken with 1188 new deaths reported officially within a single day this acceleration of the pandemic shows that brazil tends to become a new global epicentre of the covid-19 4  figure 1 comprising data up to may 21 2020 shows that the number of confirmed cases of the covid-19 in brazil has significantly exceeded the number of cases in china this extent of the disease reveals a dramatic situation since the population of brazil is approximately 65 times smaller than that of china which implies the urgent need for epidemiological studies to develop the best strategies for public health policies public strategies include general isolation through quarantine and massive testing for focused isolation with varying degrees of success so far as can be analysed from the limited data available 5  in this

nonlinear dynamics of biological and biomedical systems is the objective of several researches that can be based on mathematical modelling or time series analysis 6  literature presents some examples related to the dynamics of infectious diseases mathematical equations are widely used to model the nature and impact of global pandemics in the society in particular coronavirus propagation can be described by a mathematical model that allows the nonlinear dynamics analysis representing different populations related to the phenomenon 7  recently the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered

consequences of public health interventions it was a direct application of previous developments 13 14 on the fundamental problem of parameter identification in mathematical epidemic models accounting for unreported cases in this work the siru-type model is implemented for the direct problem formulation of the covid-19 epidemic evolution in brazil adding a time variable parametrization for the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic individuals according cotta et al 5 it is an especially important parameter in the public health measure associated with massive testing and consequent focused isolation the same analytical identification procedure is maintained for the required initial conditions as obtained from the early stage exponential behaviour however a bayesian inference approach is here adopted for parametric estimation employing the combined parameter and state estimation algorithm proposed by liu and wes and particle swarm optimization pso in

specifically in epidemiological studies a crucial step is the determination of the extension of diseases in this regard the effort is made to infer the values of unknown states and parameters characterizing the system under investigation the results of such studies can support developing public health policy here using the available data of infected individuals in brazil we aim at solving a joint estimation of states and parameters namely  0  f 0 and  for the siru model in order to assess the covid-19 spread and hence to be able to predict locally the future progression of the pandemic the estimation problem also known as non-stationary inverse problems usually requires a system dynamic model which provides the temporal evolution of the states and parameters an observation model which transforms the system variables to give the observed variables and a estimation technique that relates the all available information to the process knowledge to obtain the desired estimate 15  here x x x represents the state vector    is the parameter vector y y y is the vector of the observed variables    and    are respectively the system and observation noise vectors the function f f f indicates the evolution model and the function g g g is a observation model both of them are nonlinear function of state variables and parameters it is assumed that the noise vectors have zero mean and follow a normal distribution the subscript k denotes the instant of time there are many numerical methods that can approach the state and parameter estimation however as the model considered here is nonlinear and there may be high correlation between model parameters local optimization methods such as gradient and direct search algorithms are not suitable since they strongly depend on the initial conditions it is necessary to resort to the use of global methods capable of handling nonlinear systems such as 1 heuristic methods including the particle swarm optimization pso technique which usually presents better performance than other heuristic algorithms 16 17  and 2 sequential monte carlo methods as the particle filter pf algorithms which makes use of random samples for a bayesian statistical inference such methods do not suffer from instability as they do not solve the inverse problem as an optimization problem but as a search or sampling problem 18  in both classes of methods a set of particles is used to find the solution for the estimation problem ie filtering the available data and estimating the parameter values that minimize the objective function f ob j  which represents the model performance for the problem in this work we solve the estimation problem for the siru model considering the measurements as the cumulative number of reported cases crt from brazil using pso and pf algorithms presented below before carrying on the estimation problem useful information can be obtained if the onset of the pandemic is modelled as an exponential growth as

with associated weights is to approximate the posterior density of the states and parameters within the bayesian framework all available information measurements and phenomena involved is used as a source of knowledge to determine the unknown variables the prior distribution provides the necessary information to draw the first set of particles which are updated through the evolution model and transformed by the observation model to give the estimates the likelihood function is then used to compare such estimates with the experimental measurements and incorporates more information via particle weights in order to determine the posterior distribution sequentially all new information is combined with the previous information to create the basis for the statistical procedure such steps describe briefly the sequential importance sampling sis filter 19 15 20 21  the performance of the sis filter may be negatively affected by the degeneracy phenomenon in which few particles contribute to the approximation of the posterior probability distribution 19 20  in this regard the sampling importance resampling sir and auxiliary sampling importance resampling asir filters consider a resampling step to deal with the elimination of particles originally with low weights and the replication of particles with high weights at each instant t k or whenever the number of effective particles falls below a certain threshold 22 23 24 25 26  however such filters are used to obtain estimates of state variables 19 20  in this work we are particularly interested in the joint estimation of parameters and state variables since estimating the parameters that regulate the dynamics of growth in the number of infected individuals is also very important to understand the phenomenon for this purpose we used the algorithm proposed by liu and west 27  this algorithm is a generalization of the asir filter and the inference is made on the joint posterior density x x x k

total of susceptible individuals in brazil firstly we used the data points related to the first month of the cumulative cases in brazil from february 26 2020 up to march 25 2020 30 days to fit the early exponential growth in the sequence we estimated the model parameters via inverse problem analysis applying data from february 26 2020 up to may 21 2020 85 days besides that we also considered that isolation measures were taken from march 17 2020 when domestic isolation remote work and shutting down temporarily businesses and services were recommended the data points recorded from may 8 2020 until may 21 2020 14 days were used to verify the predictive capability of the proposed approach this way we used about 84 of the data set to estimate the siru model parameters learning step and

a negative value for t 0 means that the starting time of the epidemic in brazil took place about six days before the first reported case what may have happened on february 20 2020 although such modelling cannot represent subsequent cases we can use its parameters to find the remaining initial conditions i 0  u 0 and  0  which have to be recalculated from within both pso and pf algorithms to solve the estimation problem through the pso technique we applied a time weighted cost function as the objective function f ob j  t  cr meas  cr model  2 dt where cr meas and cr model are the values of the measured and estimated cumulative cases at time t we used 100 particles and 50 independent calls of the code to tune the algorithm we set the parameters   09 and  p   g  20 16  firstly to monitor the number of reported and unreported cases and infectious cases we used the full data set 85 days for estimation of the siru model parameters f 0   and t  gt  0   the adjustment with pso simulations led to the parameters f 0  039123   00109 and  0  1426  10 9  in figure 4  it is possible to note an excellent agreement of the simulated values with the measured values of the cumulative reported cases figure 4-a  however the number of reported cases is not represented accurately what can also be better observed in the figure  4 -b for the daily cases in addition the low value of the fraction f 0 indicates that about 40 of asymptomatic individuals became reported symptomatic infectious meaning that a vast majority of the asymptomatic population was not diagnosed however the significant under reporting of cases 11  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 29 2020  are caused by low number of tests being carried out delay in the official processing of information and more seriously the lack of test kits such reasons make it difficult to fight covid-19 in brazil the result for the number of asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious cases given by the model states it rt and ut which are not measured variables is also obtained  figure 5  infections may be transmitted from either asymptomatic individuals or unreported symptomatic individuals which sum up more than 350000 at this stage may 21 2020 of the pandemic in the country it is known that most healthy people are likely to experience asymptomatic or mild cases however this fact makes the coronavirus spread control even harder finally in order to verify the predictive capability of this approach we divided the problem into the learning and prediction steps as explained above the best result of the simulations provided f 0  039123   00109 and  0  1426  10 9  in figure 6  from may 8 2020 the prediction for 14 days is compared to the measured or observed values of the reported cases we can see again that the siru model can be adjusted to represent the brazil data set since there is an excellent agreement with the data used in the learning step however the prediction step shows a poor performance when one desires to use the estimated parameters in the learning step this is probably because any pandemics is a dynamic process depending on many factors such as individual behaviour against isolation enforcement application rate of test kits and processing of information since we used a pso algorithm that does not consider time-varying parameters and uncertainties this approach failed to exhibit a different trend which was not present in the training data 12  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in

be adopted in advance in order to avoid further increasing the number of infected individuals so proposing a different scenario to predict properly may be interesting to show that the siru model can represent this pandemic in this sense we consider that the most uncertain parameter of the model would be the attenuation factor  which depends on the quarantine and isolation measures to decrease the infection rate keeping f 0 constant at the estimated value we checked for different changes on  to find a scenario in which the performance of the prediction phase step could be improved according to the result in figure 6  we found that reducing substantially the attenuation factor by 70 would suffice to improve the prediction for the reported cases such result highlights the importance of considering state and parameter uncertainties in this regard we expect that the particle filter allows reaching a better prediction performance what would make forecast analysis more reliable or at least provide better understanding of the dynamic behaviour of the parametersor at least understanding the time variation and range of the parameters anyway the best result of the pso algorithm is used merely here for comparison with the pf simulations and to provide an initial estimate of the model parameters we used the algorithm of liu  west for the particle filter technique in the estimation problem such algorithm is suitable for the joint estimation of state variables and model parameters the number of particles n part was set arbitrarily to 5000 and the results from the pso simulations were considered as initial guesses for the parameters gaussian prior probability densities were assumed for the parameters f 0 and  with standard deviations corresponding to approximately 1 of the means of each parameter for the effect of the model uncertainty we tuned throughout the simulations 0001 for the number of individuals susceptible to infection st and 5 for the remaining states it rt and ut -such percentage is related to the previous value of the respective state besides that the uncertainty level for the observed cumulative cases crt changes over time it started at  cr  30 in relation to the measured value and as of march 17 2020 when isolation was enforced it was decreased in the simulation by a step-change to  cr  3 to present the results we calculated the estimation error rmse   k cr meas k cr model k 2  2 cr k and 95 credibility level for each state variable and parameter was calculated as the 25 and 975 quantiles  the posterior distributions of each state and parameters estimated on may 07 2020 last day of the learning step provided the respective initial condition for the prediction step lastly we also performed an additional step to forecast new covid-19 cases during 120 days from may 22 2020 to september 17 2020 in the prediction and forecast horizons the model parameters are updated via random walk model using the full data set february 26 2020 to may 21 2020 the estimation with the algorithm of liu  west significantly improved the agreement of the simulated values with the measured values figure 7  especially for those measured points near the end of the considered period this was possible due to the dynamic estimation of the parameters figure 8 a and b  which were varied over time from the initial guess the attenuation factor was increased about 30 from the initial guess showing that isolation has been effective at some extent decreasing the transmission rate  cc-by 40 international license it is made available

shows that over 60 of symptomatic infectious cases were not reported in this period the improvement obtained in comparison to the pso result can be seen from the estimation error rmse figure 8d  which was consistently decreased regarding the infectious cases the estimation is alarming since the group of potential transmitters is increasing figure 9  the number of the infectious population that may not have been diagnosed that is asymptomatic and unreported symptomatic individuals is estimated to be more than 450000 cases hence it is worthy to point out that massive rapid tests and restrictive measures are paramount to curb the spread of the virus a 26 the capability of the model to predict was analyzed using the available data of reported cases in brazil from february 26 2020 up to may 7 2020 according to figure 10  the adjustment of the parameters found in the learning step is suitable to predict accurately the pandemic evolution up to may 18 2020 10 days ahead which would have presented in advance the notification of more than 115000 cases from this result we simulated the model considering 120 days from may 21 2020 to forecast new cases the dynamic behaviour of the parameters in both steps can be seen in figure 11  the forecasted values for the daily reported cases and for the infectious cases are shown in figures  12 and 13  in which we highlighted each analysis step estimation prediction and forecast the result suggests that the epidemic peak in brazil are due to be reached around mid-june 2020 15  cc-by 40 international license it is made available

with almost 25000 cases being notified a day specifically it can inferred that the number of asymptomatic individuals may increase up to 400000 cases and more importantly the number of unreported symptomatic cases around 460000 may be twice greater than the number of reported symptomatic in brief this means that number of people requiring medical assistance will increase dramatically in the future according to the forecast the pandemics in brazil is expected to slow down beyond the peak of daily number of cases and the number of cumulative reported cases to be more than 1500000  figure 14  so if such numbers impose a burden on the health system it is important to enhance isolation measures as quarantine and social distancing as brazil is a very large country the spread of the virus is supposed to vary from region to region such way that community containment measures may be established locally at different moments  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is

by this novel virus has been named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who 4 the disease has spread widely throughout china followed by other countries worldwide and it is now considered a pandemic 5-9 as the disease spread in the communities has increased many of the infected persons may not have an obvious history of exposure 10 the rapid rate of spread confirms the highly infectious nature of the novel coronavirus which is transmitted from person to person by means of droplets direct contact and inhaled air 11 given that early detection and isolation of covid-19 cases could potentially decrease the spread rate initial efforts focused on the use of chest ct in the forefront of diagnosis in addition to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr testing 12 most common ct features of covid-19 include multilobar ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation in the periphery of the lungs 13-16 although early studies evaluating the clinical performance of chest ct obtained at initial presentation in the city of wuhan china showed high sensitivity 17 it is still questionable if chest ct should have any role in routine screening for covid-19 in patients with suspected infection therefore the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the performance of chest ct in patients under investigation for covid-19 from two centers in the province of henan china which is located near the center of this pandemic this analysis was retrospective and approved by the relevant institutional review boards the need for written patient

upper lobe was affected in 41 patients 50 the lingula was affected and in 63 patients 77 the left lower lobe was affected meanwhile lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were less common only one patient had a unilateral pleural effusion which was accompanied by low serum protein elevated serum creatinine and a history of chronic pyelonephritis suggesting renal etiology none of those patients in this cohort showed lymphadenopathy the sensitivity specificity ppv and npv with 95 ci were 93 85-97 53 27-77 92 83-96 and 42 18-70 in the entire cohort respectively table 3 similar results were

17-93 respectively in addition there were no significant differences in the distribution of normal and abnormal ct or rt-pcr positivity in the two geographic subgroups respectively p0423 and p0931 table 4 and table 5 respectively in the present study the sensitivity and specificity of chest ct in patients under investigation for covid-19 was 93 and 53 respectively using the results of rt-pcr as the standard of reference with no significant differences between two distinct regions in the chinese province of henan one of which is geographically closer to the center of the disease outbreak in wuhan the sensitivity in this study is similar to a previous study 97 reported by ai et al who focused on the subjects in wuhan 17 noticeably the sensitivity of the first rt-pcr testing was only about 42 in our study increasing to 75 on the second round of testing in fact this observation has been also seen in reports from other medical centers 1819 as a result many experts in china had proposed ct as a screening tool for covid-19 although ct was initially included in the diagnostic criteria for covid-19 in hubei province on the 5th edition of the diagnosis and treatment program of the 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia issued by the national health commission of china it was later removed on the 6th edition 20 our results suggest that chest ct may have a limited screening role for patients under investigation as the npv for covid-19 was only modest in both geographic regions ie 56 - 60 currently the definite diagnosis of covid-19 still relies on rt-pcr or fast genetic sequencing the specificity of ct findings for covid-19 in our study was relatively low even in patients specifically under investigation for the disease in fact ggo consolidation interlobularintralobular septa thickening crazy paving pattern or other features on ct have been reported in several other non-infectious and infectious processes such as sars common viral pneumonias and other interstitial lung diseases 21 in our study 15 patients under investigation for covid-19 who showed findings on ct consistent with the disease were found to have other diagnoses our observation is aligned with other reports for instance ai et al estimated a sensitivity of 28 for the initial ct in a large single-center study in the city of wuhan with 1014 patients 17 slight differences in specificity between the two studies could have occurred due to diverse demographic profile inclusion criteria or diagnostic criteria remarkably 688 rt-pcr-positive patients had a normal ct follow-up cts obtained 2 to 3 days after the initial scan in these patients not systematically studied here became positive in 16 patient while the other 5 patients remained negative during their hospitalization these 5 patients presented with normal lymphocyte count and only minor symptoms in this study we also noted that none of the patients had mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy those ct findings are aligned with the report by chung et al 14 this special ct features accompanied with the decrease number of peripheral blood lymphocytes may contribute to disclose the pathogenesis of covid-19 infection huang et al reported that the virus of covid-19 can consume lymphocytes which may also be an important substrate for the rapid proliferation of the virus in early stages of the disease 3 we contemplate that this cytopathic effect on lymphocytes could be one of the causes for the lack of lymphadenopathy this study is not without limitations first ct readers were aware of the high suspicion level for covid-19 in the population cohorts which could have led to observer bias nevertheless they were still blinded to the rt-pcr status of the patients second the ppv and npv could be affected by local prevalence of covid-19 in our sample of patients under investigation to balance the magnitude of such effects we included patients from distinct geographic regions from our province one closer and another distant from the center of the outbreak last we used rt-pcr in different specimens as the standard of reference in our study although the sensitivity of rt-pcr has been reported vary significantly such effects could have been balanced in our study by obtaining multiple sequential tests during hospital admission we conclude that 1 although initial chest ct showed a high sensitivity for detecting covid-19 the npv observed in both geographic regions 56 and 60 were too low for proposing this exam as a screening tool in patients under investigation 2 the specificity of ct findings was also relatively low reinforcing the need to consider all the clinical information exposure history and alternative diagnoses  age-dependent risks of incidence and mortality of covid-19 in hubei province and other parts of china hongdou li shuang wang fan zhong wuyin bao yipeng li lei liu hongyan wang yungang he   on january 7 2020 a new pathogenic virus causing pneumonia was identified in a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in wuhan hubei province china the pathogen had typical features of the coronavirus family and therefore was classified in the subgenus sarbecovirus orthocoronavirinae subfamily 1 2 this virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and the disease it causes has been named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 it is the third epidemic coronavirus that has emerged in the human population in the twenty-first century following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars outbreak in 2002 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers outbreak in 2012 3 4 coronavirus is one of the main causes of human respiratory disease owing to frequent cross-species infections the emerging virus rapidly became a challenge for global public health due to it spreading through human-to-human transmission the majority of the earliest covid-19 patients were linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market however human-to-human transmission has frequently occurred and the epidemic has been gradually growing 5 as of march 4 2020 80566 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported in china internationally more than 14396 cases had been reported in 77 countries 6 7 the number of infected individuals is far surpassing that of sars and mers sars-cov-2 can cause severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome it has been reported that sars-cov-2 is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities suggesting that age and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcomes 8 9 in china the reported death rate approached 3 of the total number of covid-19 patients during february 2020 at present information regarding the prevalence and case-fatality for the clinical features and epidemiology of covid-19 remains scarce however a relatively accurate evaluation of incidence and mortality is required to help refine the risk assessment and to ensure that the public and patients are managed in an effective way therefore it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the risks for individual groups of different ages and genders in this paper we report our initial analysis of the public data from local authorities our study shows that the incidence risk of covid-19 might be as low as 01 for children while it could be over 09 for 40-year-old adults our results also suggest that the mortality risk might be above 02 for patients older than 80 years notably the mortality risk was significantly different between patients of hubei province and those from other parts of china basic information on covid-19 cases was released on official websites by the national health commission of china and its local branches we collected data from a total of 6673 identified cases published before february 22 based on the completeness of the data we involved 5319 cases in our study all the 5319 covid-19 cases were residents outside hubei province a total of 76 fatal cases were included in our analysis among the 76 fatal cases 45 cases were reported as residents of hubei province and 31 cases were reported as residents of other parts of china epidemiological characteristics such as age gender and location were carefully checked to remove missing values or duplicated records the composition of the age of the general public was obtained from data of 1144648 individuals from the general census of china 2018 10 the census data were collected from the whole country including 31 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government ethical approval for this study and written informed consent from the participants of the study were not required in accordance with local legislation and national guidelines we estimated the incidence risk of covid-19 for different age groups in the general public by a maximum likelihood approach in this approach given the age composition of the general public and the incidence risk of different age groups age composition of covid-19 cases can be obtained as where pincidece  agei is the incidence risk of age group i and pagei is the proportion of age group i in the general public we assumed that the incidence risk for different age groups could be obtained from a logistic function of age pincidenceagei11exp-ir the likelihood of observation for age composition of 5319 covid-19 cases can be maximized by searching for optimized  and  consequently the incidence risk can be achieved in a maximum likelihood approach where the risk is given by a logistic function of age with estimated parameters  and  to assess the mortality risk of covid-19 in the general public we used a maximum likelihood approach that is similar to that mentioned above we obtained the age composition of fatal cases of covid-19 as where pmortality  infection agei is the risk of mortality condition on an individuals age and infection state and pagei  infection mortality is the age composition of fatal cases of covid-19 in this study we assumed that infection happens in all age groups for the general public and therefore have pagei  infection  pagei we further applied the maximum likelihood approach to obtain the mortality risk of covid-19 for different age groups in the general public pmortality  infection agei in the maximum likelihood approach the mortality risk was given by the aforementioned logistic function of age but with mortality-specific  and  to eliminate the concern that the high mortality risk of older people may inflate the mortality rate of the infected population we further imputed the mortality rate of the infected people as the public data of a total of 5319 identified covid-19 cases were included in our analysis there were 2829 532 males and 2490 468 females in the covid-19 cases the male to female ratio turned out roughly equal across all age groups the age of covid-19 patients ranged from 05 to 97 years with a mean of 452 years the age and gender composition of covid-19 patients and the public reference are presented in table 1 compared to the general public the covid-19 cases had a higher average age and there was a higher proportion of people aged 3069 years we collected detailed information on 76 fatal cases and plotted the age composition of the cases and the general public in figure 1 it is evident that death occurs more frequently in older people but is rare for patients under 40 years old the fatal cases were from 34 to 89 years old with an average age of 7147 and a standard deviation of 1249 based on the age composition of 5319 covid-19 cases and the 1144648 individuals of the general public we estimated the incidence risk by a maximum likelihood approach our results show that the disease can occur in all age groups and there is no significant difference between males and females figure 2 the difference in incidence risk for different genders is observed only for the groups between 15 and 50 years old after the age of 15 years males have a slightly higher incidence risk than women but the increase is negligible for people over 50 years old our result does not support a previous report that sars-cov-2 generally affects more males than females in the epidemic 8 the incidence risk is low for children and teenagers but rapidly increases for adults for adults over 40 years of age the risk is higher than 09 when they have full exposure to the virus in our assessment of mortality risk there is a significantly higher mortality risk in older adults figure 3a the estimated fatal probability is 001 for individuals under 40 years but it is more than 051 for people older than 90 years the calculated risk is much higher than previous reports stated our result is consistent with most of the earlier studies supporting the hypothesis that older age is associated with an increased risk of mortality in covid-19 patients our analysis of the total of 76 fatal cases suggests a mortality rate of 238 for general infection however we noticed that the mortality rate of covid-19 in reports is significantly different between identified cases of hubei province and that of other parts of china 11 to compare the mortality risk between hubei and other provinces of china we divided 76 fatal cases into two subsets 45 cases from hubei province and 31 cases from other parts of china the aforementioned statistical analysis for mortality risk was applied to the two subsets with nine different age groups in each to account for variability we further obtained a standard deviation of estimates by applying the same method to 1000 simulated data sets that were generated from the initial estimation our results show that mortality risk is no more than 013  010 for people over 80 years outside hubei province but the risk is as high as 060  015 for the corresponding age group in hubei province figure 3b mortality risk falls under 005 for people younger than 70 years in other parts of china while only people under 50 years have a risk under 005 in hubei province we also calculated the expectation of mortality rates for a general infection inside and outside hubei province as 478 and 095 respectively our results suggest that there is a significantly higher mortality risk for covid-19 in seniors than that given in the previous report 11 this is probably due to the published report not accounting for the increasing death rate of the identified covid-19 cases in the previous study the crude mortality rate was only 23 but the rate was 37 on march 4 2020 3015 deaths among 80566 identified covid-19 cases as of march 4 2020 there were still 5952 covid-19 patients in critical condition in china it has been reported that the survival probability of critically ill patients continuously decreased with the increase of time since admission to the intensive care unit 12 our analysis was based on the composition of the age of the different populations and therefore it is less affected by the disease progression of patients especially the increasing death rate of critically ill patients age has been reported as the independent predictor of an adverse outcome in sars and mers comorbidities and low immune function in older people might be the major cause of a higher mortality of coronaviruses 3 4 11 prompt administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and the strengthening of immune support treatment might reduce the mortality of seniors 8 our data showed that the mortality rate of covid-19 is five times higher in hubei province than that in other parts of china this result is supported by an early publication that stated the estimated case fatality rate of mainland china excluding hubei was 015 far less than that of the hubei province excluding the city of wuhan 141 and wuhan city 525 13 on the one hand this difference may be partially explained by insufficient medical resources due to such a large number of patients in hubei province during the outbreak according to the 2018 annual brief report of the health service development in wuhan city there were 86 hospital beds per 1000 people however hospital bed utilization ratio of 2017 and 2018 reached 9234 and 9422 respectively 14 it was shown that even under normal circumstances there were few spare beds on the other hand detailed information on the majority of fatal cases 40 of 45 in total from hubei province was published before january 25 2019 the mortality rate of early reported cases may be overstated because case detection is highly biased toward the more severe cases however we strongly suggest that international authorities try their best to immediately prevent covid-19 patients from overloading their health care system our hypothesis that a smooth-running health care system can effectively reduce the mortality rate of covid-19 is strongly supported by the low mortality rate in other parts of china in conclusion we investigated the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of covid-19 patients and the general public in china our data show a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for older adults therefore it is prudent to strengthen the tertiary preventive and clinical care of old-aged patients to reduce mortality furthermore our results also support the conclusion that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1 or less our study could be of value to medical authorities to implement effective medical service the lack of complete data for all covid-19 cases potentially increases the occurrence of selection and measurement biases in this study therefore further large-scale epidemiological studies are necessary to elucidate the risk factors of covid-19 for the general public all datasets generated for this study are available upon request ethical review and approval was not required for the study on human

covid-19-positive patients compared to subjective methods a systematic review and meta-analysis mackenzie hannum e vicente ramirez a sarah lipson j riley herriman d aurora toskala k cailu lin paule joseph v danielle reed r  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which causes coronavirus disease 2019  has currently infected over 65 million people worldwide in response to the pandemic numerous studies have tried to identify causes and symptoms of the disease emerging evidence supports recently acquired anosmia complete loss of smell and hyposmia partial loss of smell as symptoms of covid-19 but studies of olfactory dysfunction show a wide range of prevalence from 5 to 98 we undertook a search of pubmedmedline and google scholar with the keywords covid-19 smell andor olfaction we included any study that quantified olfactory loss as a symptom of covid-19 studies were grouped and compared based on the type of method used to measure smell loss-subjective measures such as self-reported smell loss versus objective measures using rated stimuli-to determine if prevalence rate differed by method type for each study 95 confidence intervals cis were calculated from point estimates of olfactory disturbance rates we identified 34 articles quantifying anosmia as a symptom of covid-19 collected from cases identified from january 16 to april 30 2020 the pooled prevalence estimate of smell loss was 77 when assessed through objective measurements 95 ci of 614-892 and 45 with subjective measurements 95 ci of 311-585 objective measures are a more sensitive method to identify smell loss as a result of infection with sars-cov-2 the use of subjective measures while expedient during the early stages of the pandemic underestimates the true prevalence of smell loss  in december 2019 an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease coronavirus disease 2019  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 that originated in wuhan china rapidly spread to almost every country worldwide as of june 5 2020 over 65 million cases have been identified and over 387155 deaths have been attributed to the virus 1 the most common symptoms of infection include fever dry cough and fatigue 1 other accepted symptoms include difficulty breathing sore throat headache nasal congestion diarrhea skin rash and body aches and pains 1 2 however as knowledge about the virus increased with more confirmed cases reports of loss of smell andor taste started to arise other the past few months covid-19 research has investigated olfactory and taste disturbances as potential symptoms of covid-19 3 4 5  many of these disturbances include the immediate onset of a complete loss of smell anosmia andor taste ageusia other studies report hyposmia a reduction in perceived odor intensity therefore the centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization officially included losses of smell and taste as symptoms of covid-19 though less prevalent than some other symptoms 1 while olfactory loss is a common symptom of numerous viral respiratory infections 6  recent reports suggest its prevalence rate might be higher with sars-cov-2 infection 7  however there is a wide reported range of olfactory disturbance prevalence from 5 8 to 98 9  thus there is a need to better quantify smell loss during the covid-19 pandemic 10  differences in the reported values may be attributed to different recruiting and sampling methodologies the range of symptom severity across patients and the amount of information about covid-19 available at the time of data collection eg symptom recognition  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not certified by peer review however different data collection techniques used by researchers and health care professionals might also account for the different prevalence rates reported there are two general types of methods to measure smell loss objective and subjective objective measures of smell encompass psychophysical testing designed to measure and quantify human responses to physical stimuli though sparsely used in covid-19 research to date current psychophysical techniques encompass odor threshold tests to determine the lowest concentration of an odor that can be detected odor discrimination tests to measure the ability to differentiate between odors and odor identification tests assessing the ability to correctly name odor qualities when possible these tests are performed repeatedly over several days to measure changes in a patients smell abilities over time historically these objective tests are often executed in a laboratory setting under surveillance of a researcher or health care professional to ensure proper completion examples of odor threshold tests in a covid-19 population involve the use of butanol or phenylethyl alcohol at different concentrations 11 12 13  the sniffin sticks test an odor discrimination and threshold test is another method to quantify human olfactory performance 14 used now in covid-19 patients 15 16  however due to the global presence of stay-at-home orders many researchers have adapted these objective methods to enable testing at home by patients themselves with common household odorants 5 11  a more common technique employed to quantify smell loss in the covid-19 population uses subjective methods self-report through patient questionnaires or interview or the extraction of symptomatic information from a patients electronic health records 8 17 18  however collecting information from records can be prone to underestimation of smell loss due to an initial lack of awareness that it is a symptom of covid-19 other subjective methods directly ask patients about their own perceived sense of smell through an online questionnaire 7 19   cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

substance including both household items being self-administered in their own home and smelling items in a laboratory setting were classified as objective measures all other methods for example selfreports of overall smell loss were considered subjective measures due to differences in how data were specifically collected across the studies further inclusion restrictions regarding how smell loss was reported were established when smell loss was reported in tandem with taste loss eg loss of taste or smell this value was extracted if smell and taste loss were reported together as well as

posted july 6 2020  subjective methods self-report to quantify the prevalence of smell loss 6 studies used objective methods eg odor threshold tests the reliance on self-report was expedient due to the pandemic conditions and global stay-at-home orders however our analysis revealed a stark difference in prevalence between the two subgroups studies using objective methods reported around 77 prevalence overall whereas those using subjective methods reported around 45 there are inherent pros and cons regarding each type of methodology objective methods quantify smell loss and can limit any confounds because they are often conducted in a controlled environment with standardized procedures objective methods rely on true perception of a stimuli when presented diminishing response and measurement bias in contrast subjective methods naturally encompass more variability due to a lack of standardization in how and what questions were asked additionally subjective methods are often prone to recall bias however they are an easy and cost-efficient way to collect information quickly from the intended population as demonstrated by the numerous studies in our meta-analysis that used this type of method objective methods have higher time and cost requirements than do subjective methods the higher overall reported prevalence of olfactory loss in studies using objective methods 77 compared to those using subjective methods 45 suggests that subjective methodologies miss crucial information and might consistently underestimate true smell loss in covid-19 patients one major difference between the two types of methods is the number of variables assessed in each study often in the studies using subjective methods the researchers were interested in numerous aspects of covid-19 symptoms not just smell loss alone whereas the studies using objective methods focused solely on sensory loss using numerous stimuli to get a sensitive measurement of the patients smell loss our findings align with a prior meta-analysis by tong et al 23 that found that non-standardized methods which were all subjective methods  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available

objective methods which indicated around 87 prevalence standardized methods outlined in the tong et al study consisted of both objective and subjective measures-because a method is subjective does not mean that the method is not standardized or validated validated subjective methods for collecting information on olfactory dysfunction in our pool of studies include a version of the questionnaire of olfactory dysfunction and the sino-nasal outcome test 42 43  overall however objective methods have been found to be more sensitive in detecting anosmia and hyposmia than subjective self-reports in a covid-19 patient population 16  additionally among patients who initially self-reported no smell loss objective analysis showed mild hyposmia in 30 again pointing to underreporting by subjective methods 13  on the other hand in a covid-19 patient population recruited due to suspected olfactory loss 38 of patients with self-reported olfactory dysfunction had normal olfactory performance using the sniffin sticks test an objective method 15  this overreporting could be due to the biased and specific recruitment patients with suspected olfactory loss compared to the general covid-19 patient population recruited for studies in our meta-analysis the higher reported prevalence of olfactory loss when using objective as compared to subjective methods to measure olfactory loss calls for further examination of the consequences of the methodologies employed researchers might be missing a critical symptom of covid-19 through the use of unstandardized subjective methods to measure smell loss as demonstrated by the lower prevalence rate we found in studies classified as using subjective methods however objective methods are costly and time-consuming to conduct in standardized

accessibility and adaptability of these objective approaches make them a resource-efficient strategy to obtain an accurate measure of olfactory loss in covid-19 patients anosmia is frequently reported to be one of the first presenting symptoms of covid-19 23 44 45  in a cohort specifically of patients complaining of smell loss researchers found that 83 of people reported anosmia as their first symptom of covid-19 32  the actual mechanism by which sars-cov-2 may inhibit and disrupt smell perception is currently unknown however many potential theories about the cause of smell loss have been proposed reports suggest that different from other coronaviruses such as those that cause the common cold sars-cov-2 can cause smell loss even in the absence of symptoms such as blockage of the nose postnasal drip or a runny nose which are typical co-occurring manifestations of smell loss from other respiratory viruses 46  the lack of nasal blockage suggests covid-19 might be a neurotropic and neuroinvasive disease 47  furthermore it is now commonly known that sars-cov-2 coronavirus binds to ace2 receptors allowing the virus to enter and infect cells ace2 receptors are expressed in nasal epithelium cells 48  specifically the structures that support olfactory neurons leading to a theory that infection of these supporting cells might cause additional damage to the olfactory epithelium resulting anosmia or hyposmia 49   cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the

covid-19 patients supporting the need to understand the mechanism of infection onset of symptoms and recovery from olfactory loss due to a sars-cov-2 infection limitations and future research due to the nature of data collection amidst an evolving global pandemic there are inherent limitations to the present meta-analysis many of which were driving factors of the observed high heterogeneity across studies disease severity of the recruited study population covid-19-positive patients was not controlled for which could add to selection bias a wide range of measurement methods were employed within both objective and subjective categories which naturally creates measurement bias often recall bias occurs in subjective methodologies as self-recognition may occur only in severe cases and is often forgotten in prolonged more subtle cases 47  furthermore there is lack of awareness regarding chemosensory function in subjects-many researchers combined the loss of taste or smell in their symptomatic findings even though they are two completely different perceptions that would be impacted differently by sars-cov-2 in addition there remains a lack of comprehensive testing of chemesthetic sensations eg burn from capsaicin or cooling from menthol compounds 50  diagnosis may become standard practice by clinicians despite the limitations inherit in subjective measures at a

interrelationship between smell and taste during clinical assessments patients may report changes in taste rather than changes in smell for patients who report changes in smell and taste function during screening questionnaires full testing should be performed using objective standardized chemosensory assessment tools considering that psychophysical testing may not be possible for all patients and the current social distancing regulations regular olfactory and gustatory self-assessment at home may be an initial recommendation although regular self-assessment may give information about chemosensory function during the trajectory of the disease the results should be interpreted with caution in addition longitudinal assessments of chemosensory function may help identify those patients with continued impairment who may need further treatment and non-pharmacological interventions eg olfactory training more research is needed to better establish procedures to estimate prevalence rates of sensory loss our meta-analysis results reveal underestimates when using subjective techniques supporting the value of adapting objective methods to estimate smell loss as information regarding

huanan seafood wholesale market emerged in wuhan china 1  a later confirmed pathogen of this previously unknown pneumonia was described as a novel coronavirus currently named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 previously known as 2019ncov was ascertained by unbiased sequencing analysis of lower respiratory tract samples from early cases on 7 jan 2020 following which the protocol of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr assay for this novel coronavirus had also been developed 2 3 4 5 6 7  in fact the epidemics of the two other novel coronaviruses namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov have posed a huge threat to public health in the past two decades 8 9  sars-cov-2 in this outbreak like the previous two viruses is also categorized within the same genus of the subfamily orthocoronavirinae within the family coronaviridae but shows a strong affinity for human respiratory receptors 10 11  by 11 feb 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 due to the sars-cov-2 has caused more than 40000 laboratory confirmed cases and 1023 deaths among them in china 12  sufficient evidence indicated that the covid-19 clustered within close-contact human groups such as family and hospital settings 13 14 15 16 17  the sars-cov-2 epidemic has transmitted throughout china and to other countries due to massive population movements before the lunar new year 14  and consequently escalated as a public health emergency of international concern declared by world health organization who 18  as of 4 mar 2020 more than 90000 confirmed cases infected with sars-cov-2 have been identified globally 19  information pointing to the epidemiology and clinical features of general confirmed cases has been accumulating the previous studies enrolling 41 99 and 138 confirmed cases admitted to wuhan respectively provided an insight into epidemiological characteristics clinical manifestations treatment measures and clinical outcomes of these patients 1 20 21  in particular a recent study in zhejiang province china indicated that the symptoms of patients outside of wuhan perhaps are relatively mild versus symptoms of initial cases in wuhan 10  meanwhile a new finding from a national wide descriptive report drew a huge amount of attention which declared that the total number of confirmed novel coronavirus-infected medical staff was as high 1716 as of 11 february 2020 with a peak incidence occurring on 28 january 2020 12  hospital-related transmission are one of the causes for infection of health-care workers 21  especially in the early stages of covid-19 epidemic when there was a lack of knowledge about transmission approaches of sars-cov-2 as well as in the period when facing a shortage of protective materials nonetheless the predominant cause of the infection and the failure of protection among health workers remains to be investigated 12  despite the increased attention towards protecting medical staff from infection information regarding the epidemiology and clinical features of medical staff confirmed

at one hospital in wuhan hospital-related transmission is not the main transmission feature of covid-19 in china 25  our findings advocate this viewpoint according to our data a small proportion of 64 novel coronavirus-infected medical staff had a direct contact with specimens of patients 5 as well as patients in fever clinics 8 and isolation wards 5 during patient care in addition none of the 64 medical staff had an exposure to huanan seafood market or wildlife and 4 6 had family members with confirmed covid-19 the exact mode of medical staff infection remains unclear the findings are consistent with previous reports 12 25  the demographic characteristics and clinical manifestations of medical staff with confirmed covid-19 in wuhan were not exactly the same as general confirmed patients included in recent studies 10 12 26  in our study most of the novel coronavirus-infected medical staff analyzed were females and nurses and had a smaller median and range of age the medical staff infected with sars-cov-2 have similar signs and symptoms with general confirmed infection patients 12 26  the infected medical staff tended to manifest on chest ct with bilateral subpleural ground-glass opacities which is consistent with the recent radiological reports on covid-19 pneumonia 27 28 29 30  furthermore abnormal d-dimer levels as well as abnormal functions of kidney heart and liver was relatively rare among medical staff with sars-cov-2 infection in our study only one of 64 medical staff with sars-cov-2 infection was severe case none developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or transferred to intensive care unit more than half of the cases were discharged by 24 feb 2020 previous studies suggested that 138 of the general confirmed patients were severe cases among whom older age male sex chronic diseases are more common 25 31 32 33  contrarily our study revealed that medical staff have relatively milder symptoms  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

days by the time of admission were compared with those with symptoms of more than 10 days we found that medical staff with symptoms for less than 10 days had more prominent laboratory abnormalities on admission and they also experienced relatively worse clinical course and longer hospital stay furthermore the median time between symptoms onset and admission of infected medical staff in this study was 85 days longer than general population as described in recent publications 10 21  we believe that mild cases of infected medical staff without an early hospitalization was mainly because they made admirable concessions to provide the limited-number of isolation wards for infected patients with worse conditions during the peak time of covid-19 epidemic in wuhan predictors of hospital discharge among infected medical staff were identified by cox model smaller bmi absence of fever and normal levels of il-6 on initial stage were favorable factors for recovery and discharge a recent study revealed that fever was identified in only half of the patients on presentation but increased to nearly 90 after hospitalization 26  elevated il-6 levels were observed in 80 of infected medical staff on admission which is associated with inflammatory response 34 35  to explore how absence of fever and il-6 levels on initial stage affect the length of hospital stay and discharge of medical staff with sars-cov-2 infection further studies are needed given that epidemiology and clinical features of medical staff infected with sars-cov-2 is unclear our study provides an insight to prevention and

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 otherwise known as the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 considerable political and medical emphasis has been placed on rapid access to testing both to identify infected individuals so as to direct appropriate therapy appropriate return to work and to implement containment measures to limit the spread of disease however success depends heavily on test accuracy understanding when in the disease course the virus is detectable is important for two purposes firstly to understand when and how to detect sars-cov-2 and secondly to understand how long individuals are likely to remain infective posing a risk to others the success of covid-19 testing depends heavily on the use of accurate tests at the appropriate time testing for active virus infection relies predominantly on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr which detects viral ribonucleic acid rna that is shed in varying amounts from different anatomical sites and at different times during the disease course it is increasingly understood that differences in virus load impact directly on diagnostic accuracy notably giving rise to negative tests in disease-positive individuals 1  positivity is contingent upon sufficient virus being present to trigger a positive test which may depend on test site sampling methods and timing 2  for example it is believed that positive nasopharyngeal rt-pcr declines within a week of symptoms so that a positive test later in the disease course is more likely from sputum bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or stool 3  nomenclature for anatomical site is also unclear with a wide variety of overlapping terms used such as oral throat nasal pharyngeal nasopharyngeal because testing is pivotal to management and containment of covid-19 we performed an individual participant data ipd systematic review of emerging evidence about test accuracy by anatomical sampling site to inform optimal sampling strategies for sars-cov-2 we

but one were judged at high rob for the participant selection domain 16  mainly as they only included participants with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection based on at least one positive pcr test studies also frequently selected a subset of the participant cohort for longitudinal rt-pcr testing and only results for these participants were included in the study ten studies were judged at unclear rob for the index test domain as the schedule of testing was based on clinician choice rather than being pre-specified by the study or clinical guidelines or because the samples used for pcr testing were not pre-specified eleven studies were judged at high rob for the flow and timing domain mainly because continued testing was influenced by easy access to participants such as by continued hospitalisation negative rt-pcr test results were common in people with sars-cov-2 infection confirming that rt-pcr testing misses identification of people with disease our ipd systematic review

version posted july 14 2020  has established that sampling site and time of testing are key determinants of whether sars-cov-2 infected individuals are identified by rt-pcr we found that nasopharyngeal sampling was positive in approximately 89 95 ci 83 to 93 of tests within 4 days of either symptom onset sampling ten days after symptom onset greatly reduced the chance of a positive test result there were limited data on new methods of sample collection like saliva in these longitudinal studies sputum samples have similar or higher levels of detection to nasopharyngeal sampling although this may be influenced by preferential sputum sampling in severely ill participants although based on few participants tested at both sampling sites urt sites have faster viral clearance than lrt in most of these participants 50 of participants were undetectable at urt sites 12 days after symptom onset compared to 28 days for lrt we found that faecal sampling is not suitable for initial detection of disease as up to 30 of participants detected using respiratory sampling are not detected using faecal sampling all included studies were judged at high rob so results of this review should be interpreted with caution box 1 provides an overview of the major methodological limitations and their potential impact on study results a major source of bias is that all but one study 18 restricted inclusion to participants with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection based on at least one positive rt-pcr test meaning that the percentage of positive rt-pcr testing is likely to be overestimated lack of technical details for example of how samples are taken and rt-pcr tests performed limit the applicability of findings to current testing compared to real life studies were likely to use more invasive sampling methods use experienced staff to obtain samples and sample participants in hospital settings where sample handling could be standardised consequently estimates of test performance are likely to be overestimated compared to real-world clinical use and in community population testing including self-test kits  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the

infection based on at least one positive rt-pcr test in all but one study 18 poor reporting of sampling methods and sites impaired our ability to distinguish between and report on variability between them for some sampling methods such as saliva and throat swabs more studies are needed there were also sparse data on sampling methods that are becoming more widespread such as participant self-sampling 41 and short nasal swab sampling anterior naresmid turbinate 42  our index times may be subject to bias as symptom onset is somewhat subjective and hospital admission practices vary by country pandemic stage and hospital role ie healthcare vs isolation the results presented do not correspond to following the same participants across time but the testing at clinically relevant time snapshots reported from individual studies so that participants tested at later time points are likely to have more severe disease this does not limit the interpretation of results in understanding testing of participants in most clinical contexts comparisons of sampling sites should be restricted to participants tested at the relevant sites we have used analysis methods that do not include clustering within studies to keep analyses simple to understand and present and to avoid complications of fitting models where the number of participants in each cluster varies ultimately many potentially eligible studies did not report ipd which led to their exclusion or only reported ipd for a subset of participants in the study we would welcome contact and data sharing with clinicians

test  rt-pcr testing is usually a key component of identifying people with sars-cov-2 infection  participants will not be detected or included in these studies when sars-cov-2 is not present at easily sampled sites and at the time that participants were available for testing rates of positivity will be inflated as only people with virus accessible for sampling for rt-pcr tests will be included in studies participants source of bias most participants are identified or present based on respiratory tract symptoms such as cough or respiratory distress unclear how many and what severity of participants with sars-cov-2 are not included in studies  participants will not be detected or included in these studies when less common symptoms or asymptomatic  participants included will be biased to over-represent people with detectable virus in respiratory tract sampling sites and at times frequently used for testing post symptom onset or at admission to hospital studies will inflate positivity for sampling sites that overlap with sampling sites used in rt-pcr reference testing  for example we identified 30 of participants with rt positivity but with negative results from faecal sampling however if participants had only faecal virus would they have been included in the studies index test rt-pcr applicability  studies included are likely to use more invasive sampling methods than acceptable in widespread population testing for example nasopharyngeal testing is likely in many current studies to be based on long swabs and self test kits percentage of people with detectable virus may be overestimated when testing is applied in real world clinical use and in population testing  studies will use experienced staff to obtain samples handle process and conduct tests  studies

research in context
evidence before this study
we searched pubmed medrxiv biorxiv arxiv ssrn research square virological and wellcome open research for peer-reviewed articles preprints and research reports on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 using the search terms coronavirus 2019-ncov and similar terms and fatality up to march 6 2020 several studies have estimated the case fatality ratio the percentage of individuals with symptomatic or confirmed disease who die from the disease and infection fatality ratio the percentage of all infected individuals who die from the disease including those with mild disease of covid-19 using a range of different statistical and modelling methods studies done solely in hospitalised patients report the highest fatality ratios 828 representing the outcome for the most severely ill patients estimates of the population-level case fatality ratio from all case reports are in the range of 28 estimates of the infection fatality ratio averaged across all age-groups range from 02 to 16 while estimates of the infection fatality ratio in the oldest age group 80 years range from 8 to 36 none of the identified studies had adjusted for differences in the denominator populations to obtain estimates that could be applied across populations no other studies have estimated the proportion of infected individuals who will require hospitalisation
added value of this study
by synthesising data from across a range of surveillance settings we obtained estimates of the age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio that take into account the different denominator populations in the datasets our underlying assumption that attack rates ie the probability of becoming infected do not vary substantially by age is consistent with previous studies for respiratory infections under this assumption differences in age patterns among cases in wuhan versus those elsewhere in china would probably due to under-ascertainment of cases given the different surveillance systems in place our results are consistent with this hypothesis with cases in wuhan seen in older individuals who would have been identified through attendance at hospital whereas cases elsewhere in china being younger overall which would be explained by the policy of testing those with a travel history to wuhan after correcting for these biases we found that estimates of the case fatality ratio from china are consistent with those obtained from early international cases our age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio can be applied to any demography to give an estimate of the infection fatality ratio in older and younger populations these estimates can be combined with estimates of the infection attack rate approximately 80 for an unmitigated epidemic to give rough projections of scale similarly our estimates of the proportion of infections requiring hospitalisation can be combined with the infection attack rate to forecast health-care requirements
implications of all the available evidence
our estimates of the case fatality ratio for covid-19 although lower than some of the crude estimates made to date are substantially higher than for recent influenza pandemics eg h1n1 influenza in 2009 with the rapid geographical spread observed to date covid-19 therefore represents a major global health threat in the coming weeks and months our estimate of the proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation when combined with likely infection attack rates around 5080 show that even the most advanced health-care systems are likely to be overwhelmed these estimates are therefore crucial to enable countries around the world to best prepare as the global pandemic continues to unfold
 assessing the severity of covid-19 is crucial to determine the appropriateness of mitigation strategies and to enable planning for health-care needs as epidemics unfold however crude case fatality ratios obtained by dividing the number of deaths by the number of cases can be misleading9 10 first there can be a period of 23 weeks between a person developing symptoms the case subsequently being detected and reported and observation of the final clinical outcome during a growing epidemic the final clinical outcome of most of the reported cases is typically unknown simply dividing the cumulative reported number of deaths by the cumulative number of reported cases will therefore underestimate the true case fatality ratio early in an epidemic9 10 11 this effect was observed in past epidemics of respiratory pathogens including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars12 and h1n19 influenza and as such is widely recognised thus many of the estimates of the case fatality ratio that have been obtained to date for covid-19 correct for this effect13 14 15 16 additionally however during the exponential growth phase of an epidemic the observed time lags between the onset of symptoms and outcome recovery or death are censored and naive estimates of the observed times from symptom onset to outcome provide biased estimates of the actual distributions ignoring this effect tends to bias the estimated case fatality ratio downwards during the early growth phase of an epidemic second surveillance of a newly emerged pathogen is typically biased towards detecting clinically severe cases especially at the start of an epidemic when diagnostic capacity is low figure 1
 estimates of the case fatality ratio can thus be biased upwards until the extent of clinically milder disease is determined9 data from the epicentre of the outbreak in wuhan have primarily been obtained through hospital surveillance and thus are likely to represent patients with moderate or severe illness with atypical pneumonia or acute respiratory distress being used to define suspected cases eligible for testing7 in these individuals clinical outcomes are likely to be more severe so any estimates of the case fatality ratio will be higher elsewhere in mainland china and the rest of the world countries and administrative regions alert to the risk of infection being imported via travel initially instituted surveillance for covid-19 with a broader set of clinical criteria for defining a suspected case these criteria typically included a combination of symptoms eg cough and fever combined with recent travel history to the affected region wuhan or hubei province2 17 such surveillance is likely to detect clinically mild cases but by initially restricting testing to those with a travel history or link might have missed other symptomatic cases here we attempt to adjust for these biases in data sources to obtain estimates of the case fatality ratio proportion of all cases that will eventually lead to death and infection fatality ratio the proportion of all infections that will eventually lead to death using both individual-level case report data and aggregate case and death counts from mainland china from hong kong and macau and international case reports by adjusting for both underlying demography and potential under-ascertainment at different levels of the severity pyramid figure 1 these estimates should be broadly applicable across a range of settings to inform health planning while more detailed case data accrue we identified information on the characteristics of 48 patients who died from covid-19 in hubei reported by the national health commission and the hubei province health commission website up to feb 8 2020 we recorded the following data elements where available sex age date of symptom onset date of hospitalisation and date of death of the 48 cases neither the date of symptom onset nor the date of report was available for 13 cases we also removed eight cases with onset before jan 1 2020 or death before jan 21 2020 and three deaths after jan 28 2020 which were the dates consistent with reliable reporting of onset and death in this setting respectively considering the onset-to-death times including early onsets creates a bias towards long onset-to-death times reflecting under-ascertainment of deaths early on this left 24 deaths which we used to estimate the onset-to-death distribution we collated data on 2010 cases reported in 37 countries and two special administrative regions of china hong kong and macau from government or ministry of health websites and media reports until feb 25 2020 we recorded the following information where available country or administrative region in which the case was detected whether the infection was acquired in china or abroad date of travel date of symptom onset date of hospitalisation date of confirmation date of recovery and date of death we used data from 165 recovered individuals with reported recovery dates and reported or imputed onset dates to estimate the onset-to-recovery distribution after excluding 26 recoveries without appropriate information on dates of recovery report or locality we used data on 1334 international cases to obtain estimates of the case fatality ratio not including cases without dates of report data on 70 117 pcr-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases by date of onset in wuhan and elsewhere in china from jan 1 to feb 11 2020 were extracted from the whochina joint mission report8 over this period a total of 1023 deaths were reported across china with these data available disaggregated into 10-year age bands between 09 years and 7079 years old and a further age band for those aged 80 years or older7 using collated data on daily reported deaths obtained each day from the national health commission regional websites we estimated that 74 of deaths occurred in wuhan and the remainder outside wuhan additionally the most recent available cumulative estimates march 3 2020 of 80 304 confirmed cases and 2946 deaths within china were extracted from the who covid-19 situation report number 431
 an earlier preprint of a subset of these cases up to jan 26 2020 reported the age distribution of cases categorised by severity for 3665 cases18 under the china case definition a severe case is defined as tachypnoea 30 breaths per min or oxygen saturation 93 or higher at rest or pao2fio2 ratio less than 300 mm hg7 assuming severe cases to require hospitalisation as opposed to all of the patients who were hospitalised in china some of whom will have been hospitalised to reduce onward transmission we used the proportion of severe cases by age in these patients to estimate the proportion of cases and infections requiring hospitalisation data on infection prevalence in repatriated expatriates returning to their home countries were obtained from government or ministry of health websites and media reports to match to the incidence reported in wuhan on jan 30 2020 we used data from six flights that departed between jan 30 and feb 1 2020 inclusive in early february 2020 a cruise liner named the diamond princess was quarantined after a disembarked passenger tested positive for the virus subsequently all 3711 passengers on board were tested over the next month we extracted data on the ages of passengers onboard on feb 5 2020 the dates of positive test reports which were available for 657 out of 712 pcr-confirmed cases and the dates of ten deaths among these cases from the reports of the japan ministry of health labour and welfare19 and international media age-stratified population data for 2018 were obtained from the national bureau of statistics of china20 according to these data the population of wuhan in 2018 was approximately 11 million people all analyses were done with r software version 362 with bayesian marko-chain monte carlo via the package drjacoby version 10021
data and code are available online at github in estimating time intervals between symptom onset and outcome it was necessary to account for the fact that during a growing epidemic a higher proportion of the cases will have been infected recently appendix p 7 therefore we re-parameterised a gamma model to account for exponential growth using a growth rate of 014 per day obtained from the early case onset data appendix p 6 using bayesian methods we fitted gamma distributions to the data on time from onset to death and onset to recovery conditional on having observed the final outcome missing onset dates were imputed on the basis of dates of report where available estimates of the distribution of times from onset-to-death were used to project the expected cumulative number of deaths given the onsets observed in wuhan and outside wuhan assuming a uniform attack rate across age groups using the age-distribution of the population we obtained an estimate of the expected number of infections in each age group under-ascertainment was estimated in and outside of wuhan by comparing the number of observed cases by age to this expected distribution assuming perfect ascertainment in the 5059 age group as this group had the highest number of detected cases relative to population size we also did a sensitivity analysis assuming a differential attack rate by age appendix p 9 for wuhan we added scaling to account for further under-ascertainment compared with outside of wuhan these steps gave us the expected age-distribution of cases for a given onset-to-death distribution we obtained a modelled estimate of the cumulative number of deaths by age under an age-dependent case fatality ratio fitted relative to the case fatality ratio in the oldest age group which represented the highest crude case fatality ratio this estimate was compared with the observed deaths by age using a poisson likelihood these data were then jointly fitted alongside the most recent age-aggregated cumulative deaths and cases in mainland china given that the numbers of observed cases and deaths have dropped substantially following a peak in late january the ratio of current cumulative cases to current number of deaths once corrected for under-ascertainment should provide a good estimate of the final case fatality ratio11
 to estimate the infection fatality ratio we fitted to data on infection prevalence from international wuhan residents who were repatriated to their home countries our age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio model was jointly fitted to the case data and infection prevalence data with use of bayesian methods using our previous estimate of the onset-to-death distribution as a prior full mathematical details are provided in the appendix p 8 assuming a uniform attack rate by age groups we used the demography-adjusted under-ascertainment rates calculated above to obtain an estimate of the proportion of infected individuals who would require hospitalisation to independently validate our infection fatality ratio estimate we analysed data from the outbreak on the diamond princess cruise liner taking the dates of reported positive tests as a proxy for onset date we calculated the expected proportion of deaths observed until march 25 2020 given the onset times and estimated onset-to-death distribution appendix p 13 we used parametric and non-parametric methods11 22 to estimate the case fatality ratio in cases reported outside of mainland china using individual-level data cases in which the outcome was unknown were treated as censored observations for parametric and non-parametric analyses missing onset dates were multiply imputed using information on the onset-to-report distribution and unreported recoveries were imputed using onset-to-outcome distributions and country summary data the parametric models were fitted to the data using bayesian methods appendix p 12 the funder of the study had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report the corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication in the subset of 24 deaths from covid-19 that occurred in mainland china early in the epidemic with correction for bias introduced by the growth of the epidemic we estimated the mean time from onset to death to be 188 days 95 credible interval cri 157497 figure 2
 with a coefficient of variation of 045 95 cri 029054 with the small number of observations in these data and given that they were from early in the epidemic we could not rule out many deaths occurring with longer times from onset to death hence the high upper limit of the credible interval however given that the epidemic in china has since declined our posterior estimate of the mean time from onset to death informed by the analysis of aggregated data from china is more precise mean 178 days 169192 figure 2 using data on the outcomes of 169 cases reported outside of mainland china we estimated a mean onset-to-recovery time of 247 days 95 cri 229281 and coefficient of variation of 035 031039 figure 2 both these onset-to-outcome estimates are consistent with a separate study in china23
 case fatality ratios were estimated from aggregate data on cases and deaths in mainland china table 1
 a large proportion of the cases including all of those early in the epidemic were reported in wuhan where the local health system was quickly overwhelmed as a result the age distribution of cases reported in wuhan differed to that in the rest of china figure 3a
 reported cases in wuhan were more frequent in older age groups perhaps reflecting higher severity and therefore prioritisation for hospitalisation in wuhan while cases outside of wuhan might also show a bias in terms of the relationship between age and travel adjusting for differences in underlying demography and assuming no overall difference in the attack rate by age we estimated high under-ascertainment of cases in younger age groups both inside and outside of wuhan figure 3c d furthermore we estimated a higher level of under-ascertainment overall in wuhan compared with outside of wuhan figure 3c accounting for this under-ascertainment we estimated the highest case fatality ratio 134 112159 in the 80 years and older age group figure 3b table 1 with lower case fatality ratios associated with lower age groups and the lowest in the 09 years age group 000260 000031200382 in cases reported outside of mainland china we estimated an overall modal case fatality ratio of 27 95 cri 1447 using the parametric model table 2
 in those who reported travel to mainland china and would therefore have been detected in the surveillance system we estimated an overall modal case fatality ratio of 11 0441 and in those without any reported travel to china therefore detected either through contact tracing or through hospital surveillance we estimated a case fatality ratio of 36 1972 using the parametric model the estimated case fatality ratio was lower in those aged under 60 years of age 14 0435 compared with those aged 60 years and over 45 18111 similar estimates were obtained using non-parametric methods table 2 in international wuhan residents repatriated on six flights we estimated a prevalence of infection of 087 95 ci 03219 six of 689 adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment we estimate an infection fatality ratio of 066 95 cri 039133 as for the case fatality ratio this is strongly age-dependent with estimates rising steeply from age 50 years upwards table 1 the demography-adjusted and under-ascertainment-adjusted proportion of infected individuals requiring hospitalisation ranges from 11 in the 2029 years age group up to 184 in those 80 years and older table 3
 using these age-stratified infection fatality ratio estimates we estimate the infection fatality ratio in the diamond princess population to be 29 given the delay from onset of symptoms to death we would expect 97 of these deaths to have occurred by march 25 2020 giving an estimate of the current infection fatality ratio of 28 compared with the empirical estimate of 14 95 ci 0726 ten of 712 from an extensive analysis of data from different regions of the world our best estimate at the current time for the case fatality ratio of covid-19 in china is 138 95 cri 123153 although this value remains lower than estimates for other coronaviruses including sars24 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers25 it is substantially higher than estimates from the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic26 27 our estimate of an infection fatality ratio of 066 in china was informed by pcr testing of international wuhan residents returning on repatriation flights this value was consistent with the infection fatality ratio observed in passengers on the diamond princess cruise ship up to march 5 2020 although it is slightly above the upper 95 confidence limit of the age-adjusted infection fatality ratio observed by march 25 of 712 confirmed cases 601 have been discharged ten have died and 11 remain in a critical condition this difference might be due to repatriation flight data slightly underestimating milder infections or due to cruise passengers having better outcomes because of a potentially higher-than-average quality of health care our estimates of the probability of requiring hospitalisation assume that only severe cases require hospitalisation this assumption is clearly different from the pattern of hospitalisation that occurred in china where hospitalisation was also used to ensure case isolation mortality can also be expected to vary with the underlying health of specific populations given that the risks associated with covid-19 will be heavily influenced by the presence of underlying comorbidities our estimate of the case fatality ratio is substantially lower than the crude case fatality ratio obtained from china based on the cases and deaths observed to date which is currently 367 as well as many of the estimates currently in the literature the principle reason for this difference is that the crude estimate does not take into account the severity of cases for example various estimates have been made from patient populations ranging from those with generally milder symptoms for example international travellers detected through screening of travel history13 through to those identified in the hospital setting14 15
 it is clear from the data that have emerged from china that case fatality ratio increases substantially with age our results suggest a very low fatality ratio in those under the age of 20 years as there are very few cases in this age group it remains unclear whether this reflects a low risk of death or a difference in susceptibility although early results indicate young people are not at lower risk of infection than adults28 serological testing in this age group will be crucial in the coming weeks to understand the significance of this age group in driving population transmission the estimated increase in severity with age is clearly reflected in case reports in which the mean age tends to be in the range of 5060 years different surveillance systems will pick up a different age case mix and we find that those with milder symptoms detected through a history of travel are younger on average than those detected through hospital surveillance our correction for this surveillance bias therefore allows us to obtain estimates that can be applied to different case mixes and demographic population structures however it should be noted that this correction is applicable under the assumption of a uniform infection attack rate ie exposure across the population we also assumed perfect case ascertainment outside of wuhan in the age group with the most cases relative to their population size 5059-year-olds however if many cases were missed the case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio estimates might be lower in the absence of random population surveys of infection prevalence our adjustment from case fatality ratio to infection fatality ratio relied on repatriation flight data which was not age specific the reported proportion of infected individuals who were asymptomatic on the diamond princess did not vary considerably by age supporting this approach but future larger representative population prevalence surveys and seroprevalence surveys will inform such estimates further much of the data informing global estimates of the case fatality ratio at present are from the early outbreak in wuhan given that the health system in this city was quickly overwhelmed our estimates suggest that there is substantial under-ascertainment of cases in the younger age groups who we estimate to have milder disease by comparison with elsewhere in mainland china this under-ascertainment is the main factor driving the difference between our estimate of the crude case fatality ratio from china 367 and our best estimate of the overall case fatality ratio 138 the case fatality ratio is likely to be strongly influenced by the availability of health-care facilities however surprisingly although health-care availability in wuhan was stretched our estimates from international cases are of a similar magnitude suggesting relatively little difference in health outcome finally as clinical knowledge of this new disease accrues it is possible that outcomes will

containing the disease spread for 2 months such containment is unlikely to be achievable in most countries thus much of the world will experience very large community epidemics of covid-19 over the

using crispr-cas3 kazuto yoshimi kohei takeshita seiya yamayoshi satomi shibumura yuko yamauchi masaki yamamoto hiroshi yotsuyanagi yoshihiro kawaoka tomoji mashimo  novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 outbreaks have rapidly spread to multiple countries highlighting the urgent necessity for fast sensitive and specific diagnostic tools for virus surveillance here the previously unknown collateral single-stranded dna cleavage we observed with type i crispr-cas3 highlights its potential for development as a cas3-mediated rapid within 40 min low-cost instrument-free detection method for sars-cov-2 this cas3-based assay is comparable with cas12-and real-time reverse-transcriptase pcr-based assays in its speed and sensitivity but offers greater specificity for single-base-pair discrimination while negating the need for highly trained operators these findings support the use of crispr diagnostics for point-of-care testing in patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infections  the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which emerged in wuhan china in late december 2019 has resulted in more than 535 million laboratory-confirmed cases in over 210 countries and more than 340000 deaths as of may 25 2020 1 2  the virus is mainly spread between people during close contact even before the symptoms appear 3  during the covid-19 outbreak on the diamond princess in japan in february 2020 3 700 passengers and crew members were kept aboard the ship for one month mainly because of the capacity shortage of covid-19 diagnostic kits 4  many countries use assays based on real-time r reverse-transcriptase rt polymerase chain reaction pcr rrt-pcr to detect viruses however the results of such assays on clinical samples from people with suspected sars-cov-2 infections are generally not ready until the day after sample collection because the samples need be shipped to reference laboratories for accurate diagnostic testing 5 6  rrt-pcr assays also require expensive equipment and well-trained personnel for their operation making them unsuitable for point-of-care test poct applications but a poct would have benefited the situation on the ship enzymes from crispr-cas systems have recently been adapted to rapidly robustly and sensitively detect viruses these systems rely on cas12a

outside mainland china and covid-19 introduction index between countries outside mainland china haoyang sun borame dickens l mark chen i c alex cook r hannah clapham e  background  the emergence of a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 in wuhan china in early december 2019 has caused widespread transmission within the country with over 1000 deaths reported to date other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 covid- 19 importation from china with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside china we aim to estimate the number of cases imported from wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland china and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside china we used the reported number of cases imported from wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from wuhan to each location outside mainland china this uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model a covid-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the betweencountry connectivity we identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland china that may have under-detected covid-19 importation from wuhan such as thailand and indonesia in addition 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50 including four outside asia the covid-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland china from which cases may be imported to each recipient country as sars-cov-2 continues to spread globally more epicentres may emerge outside china hence it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside china even before local transmission in a source country becomes known the emergence of a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 in wuhan city china at the end of 2019 has caused large numbers of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 and deaths in wuhan 1-3 as of 11 th february 2020 there are increasing reports of large scale transmission and numbers of cases in other places in china 4 5 in addition there are now reports of cases in multiple countries outside of china and limited reports of transmission within countries outside of china 5 from january 23 rd travel from wuhan was halted by the chinese government and in addition many countries have implemented measures such as airport screening testing of patients reporting symptoms who have recent travel from china 5 quarantining arrivals from wuhan andor china or halting travel altogether as with many infectious diseases there is a risk of under reporting of cases as some people who are infected do not seek care some who seek care are not diagnosed and in some settings those who are diagnosed may not reported there are also particular issues in an outbreak of a novel pathogen due to difficulties in mobilizing the response and in development of testing capacities as well as changes over time in the definition of sars-cov-2 infection symptoms there are therefore concerns the reported cases in countries outside of china may be an under-report of what is actually occurring previous work has estimated significant under reporting of covid-19 cases in a number of countries such as indonesia cambodia and thailand 6 a detailed understanding of the geographical distribution of case importation will help to guide resources to places with currently limited capacity to test and provide support to perform control measures and support for clinical care flight data has been used to determine connectivity between countries and therefore risk of onward transmission from china to other countries early in the outbreak bogoch et al listed the countries at most risk of importations given the number of flights from wuhan 7 their ranking ultimately followed closely the countries that first reported imported cases albeit with some countries predicted to report that did not since then others have used flight and other data to highlight countries at most risk of importation of sars-cov-2 from china 8 9 these papers have then used the infectious disease vulnerability index idvi as an assessment of how at risk a country is to local transmission 8 9 in countries where importations are occurring it will be important to quantify the risk of onward transmission occurring and the extent of this transmission kucharski et al 10 considered this generally given the number of importations using a probabilistic model and wu et al estimated a probability of transmission within cities outside china 4 however risk estimates of importations to countries outside china have been focused on the risk of importations from mainland china with the risk being correlated with the connectivity of places in mainland china to other countries 7 8 9 as transmission increasingly occurs in countries outside mainland china it may also become important to consider the risk of importations to and from other countries indeed there have already been cases outside of china only reporting travel history to countries outside of china such as from singapore to the uk 11 and from thailand singapore and japan to south korea 12 in light of this there is some urgency to assessing the relative risks of onward transmission between countries outside of china therefore in this paper we estimate 1 the number of imported cases globally from wuhan using flight data and the currently reported cases then using our estimates of the number of imported cases and current estimates of r0 for sars-cov-2 we estimate 2 the probability of an outbreak in countries outside mainland china and finally given this outbreak risk and the flights between countries outside mainland china we estimate 3 the risk index for importations occurring from and to countries outside mainland china there is of course large uncertainty in these values and we propagate the uncertainty through the estimates  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity which was not peer-reviewed

synthesized and made publicly available by the ncov-2019 data working group 13 for each country or territory outside of mainland china we collated data on the total number of reported covid-19 cases imported from wuhan only not from other places in china based on the epidemiological data updated as of 7 th february-15 days since the wuhan shutdown table s1  for a small number of cases we were unable to identify the cities from which they were imported we included these into our data as having originated from wuhan to avoid producing false positive results when we later on identified countries that may have under-detected sars-cov-2 importation from wuhan we used the monthly number of air ticket bookings during 2017 from the official airline guide 14 to approximate the volumes of air passengers for each origin-destination route for each country or territory outside of mainland china denoted by  we assumed that the total number of covid-19 cases imported from wuhan   followed a poisson distribution with rate parameter proportional to the number of air travelers from wuhan during january 2020     with an unknown coefficient 0 to be estimated from data more detail in supporting information to date the reported total number of imported cases from wuhan   differ substantially between countries even after adjusting for the volumes of air passengers arriving from wuhan we assumed this was due to inter-country variation in case detection and reporting rates we ranked countries based on the ratio between the reported case count and passenger volume    and assumed all the imported covid-19 cases from wuhan have been successfully detected and reported by countries having the top 10 rankings to provide a conservative estimate for 0 and hence the number of cases imported from wuhan to the rest of the countries we consider in the equation below  refers to the set of the aforementioned countries having the highest rankings and the posterior of 0 follows a gamma distribution if we impose a uniform prior the posterior predictive distribution of the estimated number of covid-19 cases imported from wuhan to each country   is thus a gamma-poisson mixture

this preprint   subsequently we computed the 95 uncertainty interval for the total number of covid-19 cases imported from wuhan to each country   the left tail probability p   can also be used to identify countries that may have under-detected covid-19 importation from wuhan next we propagated the uncertainty in the estimated number of imported covid-19 cases from wuhan and estimated the probability that a local outbreak would occur and sustain for at least three generations hereinafter referred to as local outbreak risk for each country or territory outside mainland china we modelled the offspring distribution of each case as a negative binomial distribution with mean equal to the basic reproduction number estimated by riou et al 15  and dispersion parameter assumed to be equal to that of sars-cov 16 using the first-step analysis the local outbreak risk can be mathematically derived where we created two scenarios for each country 1 only the reported cases imported from wuhan were immediately isolated but the rest of the estimated cases were not main analysis and 2 immediate isolation of 95 of the estimated imported cases from wuhan here we assumed that immediately isolated cases were not able to cause any secondary infection throughout their infectious periods and hence the local outbreak risk estimation was conservative for the main analysis we truncated the uncertainty distribution of the imported case count derived earlier using the reported case count to ensure that the estimated total number of cases imported from wuhan was always greater than or equal to the reported case count countries with a local outbreak risk above 05 in our main analysis were named as potential donor countries and subsequently assessed for their relative potential of exporting sars-cov-2 to any recipient country or territory outside mainland china described as follows for each recipient country outside mainland china  we derived a covid-19 introduction index  on a relative scale that ranks potential donor countries in terms of their viral exportation potential this was expressed as the product of the probability of travelling from a potential donor country to a recipient country in february and the local outbreak risk  where the total population size in each potential donor country   was based on the data published by the socioeconomic data and applications centre 17  in addition we also derived the total covid-19 introduction index estimate for each recipient country    by summing over all the potential donor countries   cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

asia figure 1 and table s1  outside asia we estimate united states australia and united kingdom as having the highest imported case count estimates figure 1 and table s1  in addition we also identify countries whose reported number of imported cases from wuhan is less than the 5 th percentile of the posterior predictive distribution of our imported case estimates table 1  suggesting under-detected cases imported from wuhan in these countries or territories in particular we estimate that thailand received 97 95 ci 66-136 imported cases from wuhan-the largest among all the countries analyzed but have only reported 20 cases table 1  for indonesia there have not been any reported covid-19 cases imported from wuhan and yet we estimate at least 19 95 ci 10-30 imported cases if we assume each country has immediately isolated all the reported cases imported from wuhan and therefore truncated transmission but not isolated the extra cases we estimated and that no extra control measures are put in place we estimate that the chance that local transmission would occur and sustain for at least three generations exceeds 50 for a total of 16 countries or territories including four outside asia australia canada united kingdom and united states  table 2  in a second scenario where we assume that 95 of all the imported cases from wuhan were immediately isolated the estimated local outbreak risk reduces substantially with only thailand having a local outbreak risk estimate greater than 50 still the estimated risk of local transmission sustaining for at least three generations is not negligible  20 in many other countries or territories including japan taiwan hong kong south korea united states malaysia and singapore  table 2 for the countries or territories having a local outbreak risk estimate greater than 50 in the main analysis and figure 2  table s2 for results obtained for all countries or territories outside of mainland china for countries where we estimate a large number of unreported cases the local outbreak risk is ranked higher in the first scenario than the second scenario as the extra estimated cases not being detected means a higher risk of onward transmission compared to countries where we estimate higher detection table 2  for each recipient country or territory outside mainland china we assess the relative potential of covid-19 introduction from each donor country that has a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50 for example hong kong singapore and australia are found to have the highest covid-19 introduction index estimates when we consider the united kingdom as the recipient country using the united kingdom united states south korea and south africa as recipient country examples we highlight the top donor countries or

httpsdoiorg1011012020021720024075 doi medrxiv preprint this study quantifies with uncertainty the estimated number of cases imported from wuhan to countries outside mainland china as we use information from the places with the highest ratio of the reported case count to the volume of passengers from wuhan we are only estimating the number of importations if these places with the highest ratio are capturing all imported cases therefore our estimates should be viewed as a lower bound on the number of imported infections given possible mild and asymptomatic infections even given this we estimate that indonesiawhich has reported 0 cases to date-would be expected to have more cases than this in line with estimates from lipsitch et al 6  in addition in places that have identified some cases-such as thailand japan south korea taiwan and hong kong the us and malaysia-we estimate that the imported number of cases from wuhan is even higher than those reported in some of these places testing may be already increasing but if not our results would suggest that these places should be targets for increased screening and testing for sars-cov-2 we next probabilistically determine the risk of local transmission within countries outside mainland china there is of course currently great uncertainty in these estimates however some of the countries we estimate with the highest probability have indeed reported limited local transmission such as thailand the us singapore taiwan japan and the south korea 18  this information was not used to generate our estimates but provides some validation for the model in countries such as singapore intensive contact tracing of cases and testing of all pneumonia cases was implemented 19  increasing the likelihood of finding community transmission the impact of control measures after initial detected cases is not included in our model but may alter the risk of onward transmission and should be considered in further iterations of the model as in other modelling work considering impact interventions under different transmission scenarios 20 21 other countries that we estimate to be at high risk of local transmission but that have not yet detected transmission 18 include indonesia cambodia canada and the philippines for all these places our results suggest there could be a consideration of expanding testing of pneumonia or influenza like illness cases beyond those who have currently travelled to find community transmission as soon as possible after it occurs as has been ongoing in singapore 19 and has been recommended recently in some areas of the us 22  we estimate that in the first wave of inter-country spread not including mainland china the countries at highest risk are still mainly within asia the pacific north america and europe the first importations of cases to and from countries outside mainland china have already occurred including from singapore to the uk 23 and thailand japan and singapore to the south korea 12 singapore was second highest on our uk donor risk result list after hong kong and japan singapore and thailand were numbers 4 5 and 6 on the south koreas list after macao hong kong and taiwan given our results and these observations it would seem prudent for planning to consider the scenario in which the number of countries that may be both recipient and donors of importations will be increasing once transmission is confirmed in a possible donor country our estimates of the risk transmission index are no longer needed and the number of reported cases and the volume of traffic between countries are what will become important see table s3  however it must be considered that transmission may not always be detected quickly in all possible donor countries so estimates of the risk of transmission in donor countries may remain useful for planning though many of the countries at risk of second wave importations are similar to those at risk from wuhan there are some countries that we did not estimate as having the highest numbers of importations from wuhan but become at increased risk as we consider donor countries outside mainland china these include india new zealand spain and mexico as they have greater links to countries outside mainland china than to wuhan china with the first imported case in africa recently reported in egypt 24 which was estimated to have the highest link with mainland china by lai et al 8  we must assess where we are in the timeline of the outbreak with respect to importations to africa and including the risk of importation from not only mainland china could be important here not included in our analysis currently is the risk of importation from places in china outside wuhan there have yet not been enough importations from outside wuhan to use our current method and there is currently much uncertainty on the numbers of cases in china to use this data however as this changes methods using both types of data could be considered here the links between other places in china may follow similar patterns to wuhan and therefore our risk of countries vulnerable for outbreaks and sourcing onward transmission may be similar but there may be places that are differentially connected to wuhan and other places in china and so will become at increased risk as importations from china continue in addition flights from other places in china to different countries will be truncated at different times for different countries depending on if and when countries halted incoming flights from china we also currently dont consider travel across land or sea borders in our analysis there are other limitations to our analysis we assume that r0 in places outside of wuhan is similar to that estimated from early transmission in wuhan however we do not know how variation in climate population structure contact patterns control measures such as contact tracing and quarantine and other factors may impact transmission this is an important area for future research based on what is observed in different places and the extension of the analysis to explicitly model transmission in each recipient country can be undertaken as more becomes known in summary we estimate a number of imported cases from wuhan that were undetected given these importations we estimate a high risk of onward transmission within a number of countries outside mainland china particularly in those places where cases were not detected as these undetected cases could not be isolated and transmission truncated given our results of high risk of onward transmission we highlight the importance of wider testing to pick up community transmission as soon as possible after transmission occurs we also highlight countries that become at increased risk of importation as transmission occurs outside china and provide results for each country to assess the countries that pose their highest risk of importation   rotaviral and coronaviral diarrhea alfonso torres-medina d  v m donald schlafer h charles mebus a   tigators around the world reported on the presence of similar viruses in the feces of diarrheic children and from a variety of domestic laboratory and wild animals 23 4193 the initial agent isolated by mebus was classified as a reovirus-like agent based on its morphologic and biochemical characteristics and on its lack of serologic relationship to reoviruses 87 in 1974 flewett 22 suggested the name rotavirus for these reovirus-like agents coining the name from the latin word rota meaning wheel in view of the characteristic morphology of this virus when examined under negative staining by transmission electron microscopy in 1971 stair mebus and coworkers isolated a coronavirus from cases of neonatal calf diarrhea in nebraska during an experimental trial of a vaccine against calf rotavirus 49 several subsequent publications described the characteristics of this coronavirus and its pathogenicity in infected neonatal gnotobiotic calves 47 49 50 several other viral agents have been found to be implicated in the etiology of neonatal calf diarrhea in recent years they include astroviruses89 caliciviruses89 parvoviruses76 breda virus92 and a virus that causes villous epithelial syncytia 48 a number of other unclassified virions have also been observed by electron microscopy in diarrheic fecal samples 19 21 characteristics of the calf rotavirus rotaviruses are classified as a genus of the reoviridae family of rnacontaining viruses having the unique characteristic of containing doublestranded ds rna 23 41 93 morphologically all rotaviruses are identical having a distinct appearance when examined by electron microscopy under negative staining fig 1  particles are round 65 to 75 nm in diameter and have a hexagonal core from which the capsomers radiate giving them a wheel-like appearance rotaviruses contain a double layer of capsomers complete rotavirus particles have a buoyant density of 136 gm per cm 3 and present a smooth outline when examined by negative-staining electron microscopy incomplete particles however which lack the outer layer of capsomers have a density of 138 gm per cm 3 and a rough outline calf rotavirus is resistant to ph 30 and ether and is relatively stable to heat 29 4193 some calf-rotavirus isolates have the ability to hemagglutinate human erythrocytes 73 calf rotavirus has survived up to 9 months in fecal material stored at room temperature88 or 1 hour at 6c 41 rotaviruses can survive several days in distilled water as well as in wastewater3 9 -characteristics that have important implications in the epidemiology of rotavirus infection rotaviruses contain 11 segments of dsrna of molecular weights ranging between 02 to 23 x 16 daltons 41 93 these segments of rna can be separated electrophoretically into four main groups each segment having its own characteristic mobility this technique of electropherotyping has been used in recent years to study the epidemiology of rotaviruses in large populations and to help in the distinction of rotaviruses from different animal species 33 it has been estimated that rotaviruses have 8 to 10 polypeptides that have a molecular weight ranging from 15 to 130 x 10 3 daltons 41  93 the polypeptides contained in the internal layer of capsomers have the groupantigenic determinants whereas those present in the outer surface of the virion are thought to have the species-specific antigens 8 in the last few years viruses morphogically undistinguishable from rotaviruses have been isolated from several animal species from cases of neonatal diarrheas 72 these rotaviruses are atypical in that they lack the common antigen thus they are serologically different these atypical rotaviruses also known as pararotaviruses or rotavirus-like viruses are pathogenic for susceptible animals 72 the incidence of diarrheas in calves due to atypical rotaviruses has been estimated in less than 1 per cent of all rotaviral diarrheas72 this group of atypical rotaviruses designated as group b rotaviruses may turn out to be a separate genus of the reoviridae family as more information on their characteristics becomes available rotaviruses replicate entirely in the cytoplasm of susceptible cells 234193 for several years the only rotavirus isolate that could be propagated in cell cultures was the original ncdv strain 45 cultivation of additional rotavirus isolates from calves as well as from a variety of animals and humans was made possible by the treatment of the virus with proteolytic enzymes 80 today there are several cultivable isolates of calf rotavirus 5 with recent evidence suggesting that there may be more than one antigenic serotype of calf rotavirus325991 this is similar to the situation found for rotaviruses in other animal species in which there is clear evidence of distinct serotypic variations 33 recent serologic comparison of rotaviruses from a variety of animal species indicates that the ncdv strain and its related uk strain of calf rotavirus are a distinct serotypic group3o other human and animal ro-taviruses share some antigenic relationships which suggests the possibility of cross-species infectivities 30 experimentally some isolates of human rotaviruses can be pathogenic for newborn calves with the production of diarrhea 53 on the other hand although the calf rotavirus has been demonstrated not to be pathogenic for humans nor for a variety of laboratory animals some strains are pathogenic for piglets 27 and can infect young dogs resulting in virus shedding but not diarrhea 70 recent evidence suggests that the ncdv strain of calf rotavirus appears to offer some possibilities as a potential human vaccine strain for the prevention of human rotaviral diarrhea 85 calf rotaviruses have been isolated from numerous countries around the world and their distribution appears to be ubiquitous 23 in temperate countries the incidence of rotaviral diarrhea in calves is higher during the winter months 23 4193 the prevalence of calf rotavirus in the normal bovine population is high serologic surveys indicate that rotavirus infection in cattle could be as high as 90 to 100 per cent69 with morbidity rates for clinical rotaviral diarrhea in the order of 20 to 40 per cent31 and with occasional outbreaks approaching 100 per cent 55 mortality in uncomplicated rotavirus diarrhea in neonatal calves is less than 10 per cent but it increases in cases of secondary infection with enteropathogenic escherichia coli or with other enteric viruses 31 55 most cases of calf rotaviral diarrhea are found in calves under 10 days of age in some instances however rotaviral diarrhea has been diagnosed in calves 3 to 4 months of age as well as in some adult animals 88 90 a recent report on a longitudinal survey of rotavirus infection in a closed dairy herd indicates that rotaviruses were present in 79 per cent of the fecal samples collected during two consecutive calving seasons of these rotavirus-infected animals only 58 per cent developed diarrhea leaving a 42 per cent incidence of subclinical rotavirus infection43 these data are similar to that found in children with rotavirus infections 33 all known coronaviruses are currently classified as members of a common genus in the coronaviridae family of rna viruses although all rotaviruses are associated with enteric infections coronaviruses are important causative agents of several diseases including hepatitis pneumonitis nasopharyngitis peritonitis encephalitis and gastroenteritis in a wide variety of animal species 86 coronaviruses have a common morphologic characteristic particles are quite pleomorphic but mostly round to oval all having typical peplomers projecting from the virion when observed by negativestaining under electron microscopy calf coronavirus particles have a mean diameter of 100 to 120 nm with uniformly spaced petal-shaped projections 10-to 20-nm long fig 2 71 calf coronavirus has a buoyant density of 118 to 121 gm per cm 3 in sucrose 15 71 the calf coronavirus contains essential lipids thus it is inactivated by ether chloroform and deoxycholate but is stable at ph 3071 as are all enteric coronaviruses however all other nonenteric coronaviruses are acid labile 86 the calf coronavirus is unstable at temperatures above 45c and it has the ability to hemagglutinate ha erythrocytes of hamster rat and mouse71 cells in which the calf coronavirus is replicating have the ability to hemadsorb the same erythrocytes 71 the  ha activity of calf coronavirus is destroyed by ether and chloroform but not by deoxycholate or neuroaminidase and is retained in heat-inactivated viral preparations 71 the calf coronavirus replicates entirely in the cytoplasm with budding into cytoplasmic vesicles like most coronavirus and produces syncytial cells in infected cell cultures 49 71 the calf coronavirus contains a single plus-stranded polyadenylated infectious rna of a moelcular weight in the order of 50 to 80 x 16 daltons 26 the calf coronavirus contains five polypeptides of molecular weight in the range of 26 to 140 x 10 3 daltons 34 calf coronavirus can be propagated in a variety of cells 13497183 and its replication is enhanced by trypsin83 all bovine coronaviruses appear to be of the same serotype the calf coronavirus is serologically related to other coronaviruses including mouse hepatitis virus type 3 and human coronavirus strain oc 43 and to the hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine however it is not serologically related to the human coronavirus strain 229e canine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus or feline infectious peritonitis virus 246167 antibodies to calf coronavirus have been found in a variety of animal species including humans 68 some isolates of calf coronaviruses can be experimentally pathogenic for mice producing encephalitis 35 coronaviruses associated with neonatal calf diarrhea have worldwide distribution 10 the prevalence of antibodies to the calf coronavirus is high in the cattle population closer to 100 per cent 65 morbidity of coronavirus enteritis has been estimated at 15 to 25 per cent36 with mortality rates of 5 to 10 per cent in uncomplicated coronavirus infections mortality rates are significantly higher in cases of secondary viral or bacterial infections especially those of enteropathogenic e coli 31 most cases of coronavirus diarrhea are observed in calves 5 to 20 days of age113649 but epizootics of coronaviral diarrhea have been reported in adult cattle 79 there is evidence that strains of calf coronavirus can infect the bovine respiratory tract 63  clinical signs the course of natural rotavirus infections in the field is chararacterized by a sudden onset of diarrhea that spreads very rapidly among neonatal calves present on the farm the incubation period has been estimated to be 12 to 36 hours under experimental conditions the incubation period in field cases may be somewhat longer 24 to 48 hours depending on the dose of the virus challenge typically the signs of rotavirus infection include reluctance to stand and nurse mild depression salivation and watery yellow diarrhea diarrhea may last for 1 to 2 days in uncomplicated cases and much longer 3 to 5 days in cases with secondary bacterial infections under germ-free conditions the rotaviral diarrhea is self-limiting and of short 6 to 10 hours duration with full recovery by 24 hours after infection recovery from natural outbreaks of rotaviral diarrhea depends upon the degree of secondary intestinal infection and dehydration mortality can be high if there is a concomitant infection with enterotoxigenic e coli strains there are no gross lesions in calves with rotaviral diarrhea except for the presence of liquid intestinal contents throughout the intestinal tract epidemiologic studies of acute diarrhea of calves have demonstrated that bovine rotavirus usually affects calves between 1 day and 3 weeks of age a recent field study reported that the average age when rotaviruses were first detected in feces of affected calves was 61 days 43 research has shown however that older animals can be infected yearlings and adult cattle have been shown to be infected 20 88 90 there are many factors that influence the clinical course of calf rotavirus infection in field cases rotavirus infection can have a broad spectrum of clinical effects ranging from severe illness with high mortality to infection with no clinical abnormality at all serotype of virus and the effect of colostral antibody are important factors recent reports from the united kingdom and japan 57 59 have demonstrated that there are distinct serotypes of rotavirus based on neutralization reactions virulence between different bovine rotavirus isolates varies 12 morphologic examination of microscopic changes in intestinal segments infected with different rotavirus isolates in one study showed that there was a difference between the severity of the lesion caused by isolates with different polypeptide electrophoretic patterns another factor important in the course of rotavirus infection is the presence of passively transferred antibody42 calves fed colostrum containing sufficiently high levels of rotavirus antibody are protected from infection yet the effect is thought to be due to local action of colostral and milk antibodies within the gut lumen serum antibody does not protect from infection because the amount of antibody in the dams milk decreases to negligible amounts within a few days calves become susceptible to infection at a very early age partial protection probably occurs and subclinical infections are thought to be common pathogenesis of calf rotavirus infection the calf is most commonly infected by rotavirus through ingestion of fecal contaminated material as indicated before rotaviruses are quite resistant to inactivation therefore it  is not surprising that environmental contamination is recognized as an important factor in the epizootiology of rotavirus infections 62 recent work indicates that once the virus enters the gastrointestinal system it may undergo enzymatic activation it seems that proteolytic enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract of calves probably play an important role in the pathogenesis of rotavirus infections but the mechanisms through which they exert their effects have yet to be elucidated the infectivity of rotaviruses has been greatly enhanced in in-vitro experiments by reaction with certain proteolytic enzymes 2 4 the addition of trypsin to cell-culture systems has been reported to enhance bovine rotavirus production by 1000 times 2 activation of rotavirus in vitro by intestinal trypsin has been postulated to occur in rotavirus infections in children 40 and in domestic animals 80 proteolytic enzymes fed to piglets infected with human rotavirus have been shown to exacerbate diarrhea 75 the primary target cells for rotavirus infection are the epithelial cells lining the small intestine enterocytes epithelial cells covering the villous surface of the upper small intestine are the first to become infected fig  3  this is followed by progression of infection to epithelial cells on the villi in the mid and lower small intestine prior to infection the cells covering the villi form a single layer of tall columnar cells figs 4 and 5  early in the infection large quantities of viral antigen see fig 3  are present in the cytoplasm of these cells coinciding with the onset of diarrhea viral infection alters cellular function and although the integrity of the epithelial cell layer is initially maintained within number of rotaviruses in the feces decreases rapidly after the onset of diarrhea and continues at lower levels over the next 5 to 6 days the pathophysiology of rotavirus diarrhea and the serious alterations in fluid electrolyte and vascular homeostasis that develop secondarily are complex the cells that the virus affects have important functional roles in primary intestinal defense as well as secretion and absorption their relative importance is underscored by the devastating series of events that develop during rotaviral infection in addition to physically covering the surface of the intestine intestinal epithelial cells secrete compounds important in local defense against bacterial invasion two such important products are lysozymes and lactoferrin secretory products are also important in digestive and absorptive functions the microvilli of the tall columnar cells are covered with a surface glycocalyx layer that contains important digestive enzymes when these cells are infected with rotavirus cellular metabolism is altered which results in deranged function in the small intestine of a normal animal cells lining the crypts have a secretory function which is in contrast to the more mature and more differentiated epithelial cells on the villi which perform an absorption function when absorptive enterocytes are infected with rotavirus their absorption decreases markedly whereas cells lining the crypts are spared and continue to secrete fluids this results in an imbalance with net accumulation of fluid in the lumen of the intestine which contributes to the diarrhea even after the infected cells are lost intestinal function is still greatly affected during the period of repair during this stage of the infection there is an accelerated production of immature undifferentiated cells in the crypts although these immature epithelial cells move up over the denuded villi they are not capable of performing normal absorptive and digestive functions the immature cuboidal cells contain low levels of disaccharidases that are insufficient for normal glucose and galactose absorption clinically n-xylose malabsorption can be demonstrated 88 with reductions of 60 to 90 per cent below normal the results of inadequate digestion and absorption include accumulation of lactose and digestible carbohydrates that undergo fermentation by bacteria exacerbating the diarrhea because of increased osmotic pressure although poorly studied intestinal hypermotility may occur causing a decrease in transit time for ingesta and compounding problems of digestion and absorption these changes lead to net alterations in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis that result in dehydration hemoconcentration acidosis with secondary hyperkalemia and in severe cases shock there has been considerable interest and recent research in the area of multiple infections the interaction of rotavirus infection and coinfection with other enteric viruses coronavirus parvovirus and so on protozoa cryptosporidia coccidia and so on and bacteria especially e coli is of practical importance because field studies have shown that more than one of these agents is commonly encountered the importance of multiple infections with enteropathogens has been investigated experimentally by a number of investigators 16 25 51 55 60 66 81 82 84 direct comparisons between these studies is difficult because of differences in the ages of animals used virus and bacterial isolates dosages and feeding regimens in general these studies have shown that simultaneous inoculations of calf rotavirus and enterotoxigenic e coli cause a more severe diarrhea than either agent causes alone but the effect is additive and not synergistic clinical signs the clinical manifestations of natural outbreaks of calf coronavirus diarrhea are very similar to those observed for rotavirus infections however clinical manifestations are more severe in cases of coronavirus diarrhea initially there is a sudden onset of diarrhea in susceptible calves after an incubation period of 36 to 60 hours typical signs include moderate depression reluctance to nurse and the passage offeces containing mucus and milk curds after 2 to 4 days of diarrhea calves can become severly depressed weak and gaunt death follows in severe cases as in rotavirus infections postmortem examination reveals no gross lesions and the intestines have moderate distention with liquid contents under germfree conditions the coronavirus diarrhea is significantly more severe than rotavirus diarrhea and can lead to death even in the absence of secondary enteric infections epidemiologic studies have indicated that calves can be affected with coronavirus diarrhea up to 3 weeks of age they are generally affected at 7 to 10 days of age which is a little older than the mean susceptible age for rotavirus diarrhea pathogenesis of calf coronavirus infection viral infections with the bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus differ in that the coronavirus replicates and causes severe damage in both the small intestine and in the colon in the initial stages of infection coronavirus replicates in the epithelial cells lining the villi in the cranial part of the small intestine and infection progresses caudally the epithelial cells in the crypts are spared diarrhea begins at approximately the time that most of the villous epithelial cells contain coronavirus antigen but before any morphologic changes that are detectable at the light microscopic level occur fig 8  functional alterations of the epithelial cells due to virus infection are thought to be responsible for abnormal absorption and secretion at this stage of the infection coronavirus infection is cytocidal and within a short period of time infected epithelial cells are sloughed into the intestinal lumen forty to ninety hours after diarrhea begins the loss of epithelial cells from the villi is extensive villi appear shortened fig 9  and occasional adjacent villi fuse fig 10  the tall columnar cells are replaced by cuboidal epithelium the tall columnar cells lining the colon also become infected the co- ionic ridges of the large intestine fig 11  become atrophied owing to the destruction of the epithelial cells lining the crypts and the surface of the ridges fig 12  crypts are frequently distended and contain cellular debris there may also be congestion of the capillary bed and mild plasma cell and lymphocytic infiltration of the lamina propria 47 although the calf coronavirus replicates primarily in the mature epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa other cells including undifferentiated epithelial cells goblet cells fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the lamina propria are also infected 77 enteric bovine coronavirus has recently been reported to replicate in organ cultures of the fetal bovine trachea 9 and within the nasal epithelial cells 63 the relative importance of these findings in the epizootiology of bovine coronavirus infection is not yet known as the tissues undergo repair functionally immature cells begin to cover the villi of the small intestine and the mucosa of the colon as was noted in the case of rotavirus infection these young cells have not developed enough to be able to perform the normal absorptive or secretory functions severe water and electrolyte alterations occur as a result of coronaviral enteric infections as has been noted previously alterations in permeability ionic ridges of the large intestine fig 11  become atrophied owing to the destruction of the epithelial cells lining the crypts and the surface of the ridges fig 12  crypts are frequently distended and contain cellular debris there may also be congestion of the capillary bed and mild plasma cell and lymphocytic infiltration of the lamina propria 47 although the calf coronavirus replicates primarily in the mature epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa other cells including undifferentiated epithelial cells goblet cells fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the lamina propria are also infected 77 enteric bovine coronavirus has recently been reported to replicate in organ cultures of the fetal bovine trachea 9 and within the nasal epithelial cells 63 the relative importance of these findings in the epizootiology of bovine coronavirus infection is not yet known as the tissues undergo repair functionally immature cells begin to cover the villi of the small intestine and the mucosa of the colon as was noted in the case of rotavirus infection these young cells have not developed enough to be able to perform the normal absorptive or secretory functions severe water and electrolyte alterations occur as a result of coronaviral enteric infections as has been noted previously alterations in permeability secretion and absorption by the epithelial cells lining the intestine can occur before any morphologic changes are detected and severe destruction of infected epithelial cells and replacement by immature cells are responsible for continued functional deficiency of the intestinal system diarrhea in the calf with rotavirus and coronavirus infection results in extensive losses of water sodium chloride and bicarbonate fecal bicarbonate loss combined with lactic acidosis and decreased renal function produce a general acidosis with secondary tissue buffering this results in movement of potassium ions out of cells because of hydrogen-ion replacement these changes produce an elevation in plasma potassium levels but a loss in total body potassium altered potassium levels combined with hypoglycemia that is associated with severe diarrhea contribute to the clinical lethargy potassium cardiotoxicosis is felt to be an important factor leading to death 37 another important feature in the pathophysiology of viral enteritis is the development of hypovolemic shock following water loss through alterations in intestinal fluid absorption and secretion changes occur in total circulatory fluid volume to maintain sufficient blood pressure for perfusion of vital organs peripheral vasoconstriction occurs decreased blood flow to the extremities causes them to feel cool death can occur because of the hypovolemic shock the reader is referred to other publications for more detailed information about electrolyte and fluid imbalances that occur during neonatal calf diarrhea 3 37 38  because of the clinical similarities in the diarrheas caused by a variety of pathogens and conditions the etiologic diagnosis of neonatal calf diarrheas requires the help and support of a veterinary diagnostic laboratory the accurate diagnosis of cahhood diarrheas is complicated by the sudden onset of illness the potential interaction of several enteric pathogens the presence of the natural intestinal microbial flora and the high prevalence of serum antibodies to most viral enteric pathogens in the cattle population the incubation period for infectious neonatal calf diarrheas is rather short with most infected enterocytes being shed in the diarrheic feces during the first 24 hours of diarrhea which severely limits the time of collection of diagnostic fecal or tissue samples the fact that most cases of neonatal calf diarrhea are the result of mixed infections two or more viral bacterial or protozoal agents acting simultaneously in the intestinal tract along with the normal microbial flora of the gut complicates the identification of etiologic agents and the interpretation of laboratory results for example there are many new viral agents that are only detected by electron microscopy for which very little is known about their pathogenicity in addition limited information is available on the interaction of several viruses or the interaction of viruses and bacteria in the development of diarrhea the high prevalence of serum antibodies in the cattle population against enteric viruses and the fact that serum antibody levels are not cor-related with the degree of protection against intestinal infection preclude the use of serology for diagnosis of enteric infections of calves the timing of collection of samples for laboratory diagnosis is the single most important factor in the successful diagnosis of neonatal calf diarrhea fecal samples or intestinal segments should be collected less than 24 hours after the onset of diarrhea in the majority of the cases the sample of choice is the diarrheic feces the relatively low mortality of uncomplicated cases and the rapid progression of intestinal alterations and intestinal postmortem degeneration greatly limit the use of intestinal samples for histologic diagnosis to cases of selected euthanasia and necropsy for diagnostic purposes feces must be collected from the live calf after manual stimulation or from the rectum or colon of dead calves never from the floor fecal samples 10 to 20 gm should be placed in a wide-mouth container with a tight-closing lid intestinal segments submitted for immunofluorescence should be collected from the mid ileum 2 to 3 inches and it is preferred that they be tied at the two ends to retain their intestinal contents fecal and intestinal samples should be mailed to the laboratory under refrigerated conditions but they should not be frozen unless dry ice is used for freezing and transport of the samples freezing the samples at homefreezer temperatures -15 to -20c and mailing the samples under wetice refrigeration cause disruptions in the morphology of coronaviruses and in the integrity of the mucosa of intestinal samples which cause problems of interpretation in the laboratory in the case of liquid fecal samples submitted for electron microscopy only not for bacteriologic examination the addition of one or two drops of a 10 per cent formalin solution may prevent the autolytic processes associated with the microbial flora present in the sample the submission of serum samples for the detection of antibodies to the enteric viruses is not advisable except for prevalence survey studies to determine the degree of exposure of a given cattle population to these agents with this in mind the majority of the diagnostic tests available for the etiologic diagnosis of viral calf enteritis are those tests done in fecal samples or intestinal segments for the presence of viral antigens electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy has been a method utilized for the discovery of enteric viruses and continues to be a diagnostic procedure of choice for several reasons 21 electron microscopy can detect a number of different virus particles in the same fecal preparation thus providing a broad but nonspecific diagnostic tool for a variety of serologically different viruses most of which cannot be propagated in cell cultures 19 electron microscopy procedures are also rapid and comparatively inexpensive for diagnostic laboratories having access to an electron microscope some of the disadvantages of the electron microscopy procedure are its rather low sensitivity estimated at 1 x 10 6 virions per ml of feces and the need to have personnel trained in the operation of the electron microscope and in the interpretation of the images 21 a rapid electron microscopy procedure for detection of fecal viruses under negative staining that has been used successfully for many years by one of us a t -m is as follows a 15 to 20 per cent suspension of feces is prepared in buffered saline and agitated vigorously in a vortex mixer this suspension is then centrifuged at low speed less than 400 x g for 20 to 30 minutes and the supernatant is saved this is an important step because many enteric viruses are found to be present in large aggregates that could be pelle ted and discarded at higher centrifugal forces 58 the low-speed supernatant is then transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 100000 x g for 60 minutes the supernatant is decanted the resulting pellet is saved and reconstituted in 05 ml of distilled water this concentrated specimen is now ready to be sprayed onto collodion-and carbon- one can enhance electron microscopic detection of enteric viruses by using specific antibodies mixed with the clarified fecal preparation before ultracentrifugation this procedure is known as immunoelectron microscopy this procedure may be useful in viewing small virions but is not practical for routine diagnosis because virions with different antigenic composition will not be clumped by the antibody preparation enzyme and radiolabel lmmunoassays the ability to purify large amounts of rotavirus from diarrheic fecal samples and the presence of a common antigen for rotaviruses from different animal species led to the development of rapid and sensitive methods for the detection of rotavirus antigens in fecal samples both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays elisa and radioimmunoassays ria have been used for rotavirus-antigen detection with excellent results 4 17 initially elisa and ria procedures were mostly used in research but in recent years commercially available elisa tests have opened the opportunity of rotavirus diagnosis to most clinical or diagnostic laboratories the use of ria tests continues to be mostly of research use owing to its instrumentation and restrictions in the use of radioactive materials most of the commercially available elisa tests have been developed for humans but they work equally well for animal rotaviruses that share the common antigen elisa tests are more sensitive than electron microscopy procedures and are rapid and accurate 7 18 their dis-ted pella company tustin california advantage is that they are very specific for rotaviruses and will not detect the newly recognized atypical rotaviruses nor other enteric viruses that may be present in diarrheic fecal samples if there is interest in detecting only rotavirues elisa tests are more than adequate but if a comprehensive etiologic diagnosis of neonatal calf diarrhea is to be established then electron microscopy procedures are recommended because of their broad specificity even though they may be slightly less sensitive the same applies to ria tests in the case of calf coronavirus both elisa and ria tests have been developed65 but they are still limited to use in research environments no such tests are commercially available at the present time immunostaining rotavirus and coronavirus antigens can be detected in intestinal samples from infected calves by immunofluorescent fluorescent antibody staining of frozen sections or of fecal smears fluorescent antibody procedures were very useful in the early work with both calf rotavirus and calf coronavirus in the case of rotavirus smears of fecal samples as well as frozen sections from segments of mid to caudal small intestine are good samples for fluorescent antibody staining for intestinal samples this is a limiting factor unless euthanasia and postmortem examination are performed in the acutely ill calf the reason for this requirement is that the number of rotavirus-infected enterocytes attached to the intestinal villi and present in the intestinal lumen decreases very rapidly after the onset of diarrhea 46 the number of enterocytes containing rotavirus antigen that are present in the feces or in the intestinal mucosa is very low 18 to 24 hours after the onset of diarrhea in the case of calf coronavirus fluorescent antibody staining of mid to caudal frozen sections of small intestine has the same limitations as for cases of rotavirus infections however examination of fecal smears for detection of cells containing coronavirus antigen by fluorescent antibody procedures is a futile enterprise due to the cytolytic action of coronavirus for infected enterocytes 47 fluorescent antibody staining may be applied in a case of coronavirus on frozen segments of colon because of the fact that coronavirus infects the colonic mucosa of calves and coronavirus antigen persists in the crypt cells for 3 to 4 days after the onset of diarrhea 47 still there is a limitation of obtaining colon samples from either dead or euthanatized calves reagents for fluorescent antibody staining of intestinal samples for calf rotavirus and coronavirus are available in most state diagnostic laboratories as a service provided by the national veterinary service laboratory of the vs department of agriculture other laboratories in the v nited states and especially abroad have limitations in procurement of fluorescein-conjugated antibodies for these tests other procedures several other procedures have been used for the detection of rotavirus or coronavirus antigen in fecal samples from diarrheic calves they are based in immunologic reactions with specific antibodies and include techniques such as latex agglutination tests la56 counterimmunoelectro-osmophoresis cie14 and immunodiffusion id procedures 64 recently la tests for rotavirus have become commercially available 56 of all these tests probably the most useful have been the cie procedures especially in laboratories limited in resources cie is fast and relatively sensitive although less so than elisa or electron microscopy procedures their limitation is their specificity and thus their inability to detect rotavirus or coronaviruses of different antigenic composition or other unrelated viruses associated with neonatal calf diarrheas summary a number of different viruses can be primary pathogens in the neonatal calf diarrhea complex by far the most common viruses causing calfhood diarrhea found throughout the world are rotaviruses and coronaviruses primary infection of newborn calves with either one of these viruses can cause severe intestinal alterations and diarrhea rotaviruses can produce high-morbidity outbreaks of diarrhea in calves under 10 days of age mortality is variable mainly owing to secondary bacterial infections and electrolyte imbalances rotavirus infection of the small intestinal mucosa leads to loss of enterocytes of the upper third of the intestinal villi with subsequent villous atrophy and malabsorption there is growing evidence that different rotavirus serotypes of different pathogenicity exist coronavirus infections can produce high-morbidity outbreaks of diarrhea in calves under 20 days of age with variable mortality due to secondary complications coronaviruses affect not only the small intestinal mucosa producing significant villous atrophy but also the colon causing a very severe intestinal damage that can lead to death due to subsequent electrolyte disturbances all coronaviruses associated with neonatal calf diarrhea appear to be of the same serotype the etiologic diagnosis of viral diarrheas of calves requires the support of the laboratory one of the most useful diagnostic methods is the examination of fecal extracts for the presence of virus particles by electron microscopy other antigen-detection procedures like enzyme immunoassays have been found to be useful in the diagnosis of rotaviral diarrheas the sample of choice for these diagnostic tests is a fresh fecal sample collected directly from the calf as close as possible to the onset of diarrhea samples from more than one calf during the outbreak enhance the laboratory ability to establish a proper viral diagnosis  cancer is associated with the severity and mortality of patients with covid-19 a systematic review and meta-analysis ya gao   ming liu shuzhen shi yamin chen yue sun ji chen jinhui tian  word count 249 background cancer patients are considered a highly vulnerable population in the covid-19 epidemic but the relationship between cancer and the severity and mortality of patients with covid-19 remains unclear this study aimed to explore the

more conclusive first the present meta-analysis included 34 studies involving a total of 8080 covid-19 patients compared to no more than 3561 patients in previous meta-analyses thus our study had enlarged sample sizes and added statistical power of nearly 4500 cases second studies included in previous meta-analyses were all from china so the results may not apply to other countries and data selection bias may exist however our meta-analysis included studies from four countries although only three studies from italy france and korea third in addition to conducting subgroup analyses to evaluate the difference of prevalence between different countries we also performed sensitivity analyses and meta-regression analyses and these analyses indicated that the results of our study were

sensitivity analysis by excluding studies with a sample size of less than 100 showed a stronger association therefore the result of our study is more convincing according to the current meta-analysis the pooled prevalence of cancer in patients with covid-19 was 20 combined with previously published results 9 51 52  we can conclude that patients with cancer have an increased risk of covid-19 the development of cancer is usually related to a blunted immune status 53 54  and anti-cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and surgery can also put cancer patients in an immunosuppressive state 8  therefore immunodeficiency may be the main reason for cancer patients susceptible to covid-19 our subgroup analyses found that the prevalence of cancer among covid-19 patients in italy france and korea were higher than that in china although the result was limited by the sample size these results suggest that cancer patients should be provided with special precautions and advised to use stronger personal protection our meta-analysis found that cancer was associated with a 284-fold significantly increased risk of severe illness in patients with covid-19 as well as with a 260-fold increased risk of death although our data are potentially limited by the sources of studies these findings highlight the need for oncology professionals to be vigilant to  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international

symptoms until the isolation of patients plays an important role in controlling the epidemic to control the majority of outbreaks for r0 of 25 more than 70 of contacts had to be traced and for an r0 of 35 more than 90 of contacts had to be traced the delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when r0 was 15 for r0 values of 25 or 35 if there were 40 initial cases contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1 of transmission occurred before symptom onset 16  therefore it is recommended that

tension in societies and the second is to properly interpret the covid-19 case fatality ratio cfr in iran and calculate it tactfully it should be taken into account in interpreting this index since the denominator of the fraction is only positive cases in hospital beds and numerator is the number of died positive among the positive cases of those who are hospitalized andor die this index should also be calculated until the end of the epidemic period and if it is until the end of the epidemic and their outcome deathrecovery is determined this indicator will approach the real number the

sampling of severe cases hospitalization and tip of iceberg spread disease and asymptomatic mild and moderate cases could not be calculated complete reliance on any type of model will lead to systematic and random error unless modeling provides a prediction with precise and clear assumptions and inputs and outputs given the assumptions in iran the prediction of the patients on 3 april farvardin 15 2020 with the three growth models of von bertalanffy gompertz and the least squared error were estimated at 48200 52500 and 58000 respectively the number of deceased covid-19 patients was also estimated to be 3600 individuals using the vons growth model 4200 ones by gompertzs model and 4850 ones according to the lse method if enforcement and public behavior interventions social distance continue with current trends the control and reduction of the covid-19 epidemic in iran will be felat from late april 2020 and new cases are expected to decline from mid-april of the following iranian new year for prediction end of epidemic three models of growth were used based on gompertzs growth model the end of the epidemic is about 13 may 2020 with the about 87000 patients

druckenmiller andrew hultgren luna huang yue emma krasovich peiley lau jaecheol lee esther rolf jeanette tseng tiany wu manaaki  whenua -landcare research  governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus covid-19 pandemic 1 with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections many actions such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes impose large and visible costs on society in contrast the benefits of these policies in the form of infections that did not occur cannot be directly observed and are currently understood through process-based simulations 234 here we compile new data on 936 local regional and national anti-contagion policies recently deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in china south korea iran italy france and the united states us we then apply reduced-form econometric methods commonly used to measure the eect of policies on economic growth to empirically evaluate the eect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections in the absence of any policy actions we estimate that early infections of covid-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 45 per day we find that anti-contagion policies collectively have had significant eects slowing this growth although policy actions in the us appear to be too recent to have a substantial impact since the magnitude of these eects grows over time our results suggest that similar policies may have dierent impacts on dierent populations but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages now deployed are achieving large and beneficial health outcomes we estimate that to date current policies have already prevented or delayed on the order of eighty-million infections these findings may help inform whether or when ongoing policies should be lifted or intensified and they can support decision-making in the over 150 countries where covid-19 has been detected but not yet achieved high infection rates 5 2  the 2019 novel coronavirus 1 pandemic is forcing societies around the world to make consequential policy decisions with limited information after containment of the initial outbreak failed attention turned to implementing large-scale social policies designed to slow contagion of the virus 6 with the ultimate goal of slowing the rate at which life-threatening cases emerge so as to not exceed the capacity of existing medical systems in general these policies aim to decrease opportunities for virus transmission by reducing contact among individuals within or between populations such as by closing schools limiting gatherings and restricting mobility such actions are not expected to halt contagion completely but instead are meant to slow the spread of covid-19 to a manageable rate these large-scale policies are developed using epidemiological simulations 2 4 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 and a small number of natural experiments in past epidemics 18 however the actual impacts of these policies on infection rates in the ongoing pandemic are unknown because the modern world has never experienced a pandemic from this pathogen nor deployed anti-contagion policies of such scale and scope it is crucial that direct measurements of policy impacts be used alongside numerical simulations in current decision-making populations in almost every country are now currently weighing whether or when the health benefits of anti-contagion policies are worth the costs they impose on society for example restrictions imposed on businesses are increasing unemployment 19 travel bans are bankrupting airlines 20 and school closures may have enduring impacts on aected students 21 it is therefore not surprising that some populations hesitate before implementing such dramatic policies particularly when these costs are visible while their health benefits -infections and deaths that would have occurred but instead were avoided or delayed -are unseen our objective is to measure this direct benefit specifically how much these policies slowed the growth rate of infections we treat recently implemented policies as hundreds of dierent natural experiments proceeding in parallel our hope is to learn from the recent experience of six countries where the virus has advanced enough to trigger largescale policy actions in part so that societies and decision-makers in the remaining 180 countries can access this information immediately to exhibit almost perfect exponential growth 7 14 22 the rate of this exponential growth may change daily and is determined by epidemiological factors such as disease infectivity and contact networks as well as policies that induce behavior changes 7 8 22 we cannot experimentally manipulate policies ourselves but because they are being deployed while the epidemic unfolds we can measure their impact empirically we examine how the growth rate of infections each day in a given locality changes in response to the collection of ongoing policies applied to that locality on that day we employ well-established reduced-form econometric techniques 23 24 commonly used to measure the eect of policies 25 26 or other events eg wars 27 or environmental changes 28  on economic growth rates similarly to early covid-19 infections economic output generally increases exponentially with a variable rate that can be aected by policy or other conditions unlike process-based epidemiological models 7-9 12 22 29 30 the reduced-form statistical approach to inference that we apply does not require explicit prior information about fundamental epidemiological parameters or mechanisms many of which remain unknown in the current pandemic rather the collective influence of these factors is empirically recovered from the data without modeling their individual eects explicitly see methods prior work on influenza 31 for example has shown that such statistical approaches can provide important complementary information to process-based models to construct the dependent variable we transform location-specific sub-national time-series of infections into first-dierences of their natural logarithm which is the per day growth rate of infections see methods we use data from first-or second-level administrative units and data on active or cumulative cases depending on availability see appendix section 2 we then employ widely-used panel regression models 23 24 to estimate how the daily growth rate of infections changes over time within a location when dierent combinations of large-scale social policies are enacted see methods our econometric approach accounts for dierences in the baseline growth rate of infections across locations due to dierences in demographics socio-economic status culture or health systems across localities within a country it accounts for systemic patterns in growth rates within countries unrelated to policy such as the eect of the work-week it is robust to systematic under-surveillance and it accounts for changes in procedures to diagnose positive cases see methods and appendix section 2 the reduced-form statistical techniques we use are designed to measure the total magnitude of the eect of changes in policy without attempting to explain the origin of baseline growth rates or the specific epidemiological mechanisms linking policy changes to infection growth rates see methods thus this approach does not provide the important mechanistic insights generated by process-based models however it does eectively quantify the key policyrelevant relationships of interest using recent real-world data when fundamental epidemiological parameters are still uncertain we estimate that in the absence of policy early infection rates of covid-19 grow 45 per day on average implying a doubling time of approximately two days country-specific estimates range from 2523 per day p 005 in china to 6504 per day p 0001 in iran although an estimate only using data from wuhan the only chinese city where a meaningful quantity of pre-policy data is available is 55 per day p 0001 growth rates in south korea italy france and the us are very near the 45 average value figure 2a  these estimated values dier from the observed growth rates because the latter are confounded by the eects of policy in the early stages of most epidemics a large proportion of the population remains susceptible to the virus and if the spread of the virus is left uninhibited by policy or behavioral change exponential growth will continue until the fraction of the susceptible population declines meaningfully 7 29 this decline results from members of the population leaving the transmission cycle due to either recovery or death 29 at the time of writing the minimum susceptible population fraction in any of the administrative units analyzed is 994 of the total population lodi italy 1445 infections in a population of 230000 this suggests that all administrative units in all six countries would likely be in a regime of uninhibited exponential growth if policies were removed today consistent with predictions from epidemiological models 2 18 32 we find that the combined eect of all policies within each country reduces the growth rate of infections by a substantial and except in the us statistically significant amount  figure 2b  for example a locality in italy with a baseline growth rate of 038 national avg that deployed all policy actions used in italy would be expected to lower its daily growth rate by 018 to 020 in general the estimated total eects of policy packages are large enough that they can in principle oset a large fraction of or even eliminate the baseline growth rate of infections-although in several countries many localities are not currently deploying the full set of policies our estimate for the total growth eect of all us policies is quantitatively substantial -025 but not statistically significant us estimates are highly uncertain due to the short period of time for which data are available and because the time elapsed since these actions may be too short to observe a significant impact in china where policies have been enacted for over seven weeks we observe that policy impacts have grown over time during the first three weeks of deployment -011 to -033  in all other countries except china we only estimate an average eect for the entire interval of observation due to the short temporal length of the sample the estimates above describe the superposition of all policies deployed in each country ie they represent for each country the average eect of policies on infection growth rates that we would expect to observe if all policies enacted anywhere in the country were implemented simultaneously in a region of the country we also estimate the eects of individual types of policies or clusters of policies that are grouped based on their similarity in goal eg closing libraries and closing 5

copyright holder for this preprint this version posted march 27 2020  httpsdoiorg 101101 10 2020 museums are grouped or timing eg policies that are generally deployed simultaneously in a certain country in many cases our estimates for these eects are statistically noisier than the estimates for all policies combined presented above because we are estimating multiple eects simultaneously thus we are less confident in individual estimates and in their relative rankings estimated eects dier between countries and policies are neither identical nor perfectly comparable in their implementation across countries or in many cases across dierent localities within the same country nonetheless overall we estimate that almost all policies likely contribute to slowing the growth rate of infections figure 2c  except two policies social distancing in france and italy where point estimates are slightly positive small in magnitude and not statistically dierent from zero we combine the estimates above with our data on the timing of hundreds of policy deployments to estimate the total eect to date of all policies in our sample to do this we use our estimates above to predict the growth rate of infections in each locality on each day given the policies in eect at that location on that date  figure 3  blue markers we then use the same model to predict what counterfactual growth rates would be on that date if all policies were removed  figure 3  red which we refer to as a no policy scenario the dierence between these two predictions is our estimated eect that all anti-contagion policies actually deployed had on the growth rate of infections on that date we estimate that since the beginning of our sample on average all anti-contagion policies combined have slowed the average daily growth rate of infections 0166 per day 0015 p  0001 in china 0276 0066 p  0001 in south korea 0158 0071 p  005 in italy 0292 0037 p  0001 in iran 0132 0053 p  005 in france and 0044 0059 p  045 in the us taken together these results suggest that anti-contagion policies currently deployed in the first five countries are achieving their intended objective of slowing the pandemic broadly confirming epidemiological simulations we estimate that anti-contagion policies have not yet had a substantial nor significant impact suppressing overall infection growth rates in the us at a particular moment in time the total number of covid-19 infections depends on the growth rate of infections on all prior days thus persistent decreases in growth rates have a compounding eect on total infections at least until a shrinking susceptible population slows growth through a dierent mechanism to provide a sense of scale and context for our main results in figures 2 and 3 we integrate the growth rate of infections in each locality from figure 3 to estimate total infections to date both with actual anti-contagion policies and in the no policy counterfactual scenario to account for the declining size of the susceptible population in each administrative unit we couple our econometric estimates for the eects of policies to a simple susceptible-infected-removed sir model of infectious disease dynamics 7 22 see methods this allows us to extend our projections beyond the initial exponential growth phase of infections a threshold which our results suggest would currently be exceeded in several countries in the no policy scenario our results suggest that ongoing anti-contagion policies have already substantially reduced the 6 number of covid-19 infections observed in the world today  figure 4  our central estimates suggest there would be roughly 74-million more cumulative cases in china 5-million more in south korea 12-million more in italy 26-million more in iran 650000 more in france and 20000 more in the us had these countries never enacted any anti-contagion policies since the start of the pandemic the relative magnitudes of these impacts partially reflects the intensity and extent of policy deployment eg how many localities deployed policies and the duration for which they have been applied several of these estimates are subject to large uncertainties see intervals in figure 4  overall our results indicate that large-scale anti-contagion policies are achieving their intended objective of slowing the growth rate of covid-19 infections because infection rates in the countries we study would have initially followed rapid exponential growth had no policies been applied our results suggest that these ongoing policies are currently providing large health benefits for example we estimate that there would be roughly 621 the current number of infections in south korea 36 in italy and 153 in iran if large-scale policies had not been deployed during the early weeks of the pandemic consistent with process-based simulations of 2 4 10 11 12 14 17 29 our empirical analysis of existing policies indicates that seemingly small delays in policy deployment likely produce dramatically dierent health outcomes while the quantity of currently available data poses challenges to our analysis our aim is to use what limited data exist to estimate the first-order impacts of unprecedented policy actions in an ongoing global crisis as more data become available empirical research findings will become more precise and may capture more complex interactions for example this analysis does not account for potentially important interactions between populations in nearby localities 7 33 nor the structure of mobility networks 3 4 10 12 17 34 nonetheless we hope the results we are able to obtain at this early stage of the pandemic can support critical decision-making both in the countries we study and in the other 150 countries where covid-19 infections have been reported based on our results from china where the most post-policy time has elapsed and where a relatively uniform set of policies were imposed during a narrow window of time it appears that roughly three weeks are required for policies to achieve their full eect in other countries these temporal dynamics are more di cult to disentangle with currently available data in part because less post-policy data is available and also because countries continue to deploy new policies making it more challenging to precisely measure the lagged eects of earlier policies future work should investigate these timing changes after more time has passed and new data become available a key advantage of our reduced-form top down statistical approach is that it captures the real-world behavior of aected populations without requiring that we explicitly model all underlying 7  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to

early stages of the current pandemic when many process-related parameters remain unknown however our results cannot and should not be interpreted as a substitute for process-based epidemiological models specifically designed to provide guidance in public health crises rather our results complement existing models for example by helping to calibrate key model parameters we believe both forward-looking simulations and backward-looking empirical evaluations should be used to inform decision-making here we have focused our analysis on large-scale social policies specifically to understand their impact on infection rate growth within a locality however contact tracing international travel restrictions and medical resource management along with many other policy decisions will play key roles in the global response to covid-19 our results do not speak to the e cacy of these other policies our analysis accounts for some known changes in the availability of testing for and changes in testing procedures however it is likely that other unobserved changes in patterns of testing could aect our results for example if growing awareness of covid-19 caused an increasing fraction of infected individuals to be tested over time then unadjusted infection growth rates later in our sample would be biased upwards because an increasing number of policies are active later in these samples as well this bias would cause our current findings to understate the overall eectiveness of anti-contagion policies it is also possible that changing public information during the period of our study has some unknown eect on our results if individuals alter their behavior in response to new information unrelated to anti-contagion policies such as news reports about covid-19 this could alter the growth rate of infections and thus aect our estimates because the quantity of new information is increasing over time if this information reduces infection growth rates it would cause us to overstate the eectiveness of anti-contagion policies we note however that if public information is increasing in response to policy actions then it should be considered a pathway through which policies alter infection growth not a form of bias investigating these potential eects is beyond the scope of this analysis but it is an important topic for future investigations lastly we note that the results presented here are not su cient on their own to determine which anti-contagion policies are ideal for individual populations nor whether the social costs of individual policies are larger or smaller than the social value of their health benefits computing a full value of health benefits also requires understanding how dierent growth rates of infections and total active infections aect mortality rates as well as determining a social value for all of these impacts furthermore this analysis does not quantify the sizable social costs of anti-contagion policies a critical topic for future investigations  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright

including access dates epidemiological and policy data for each of the six countries in our sample were collected from a variety of in-country data sources including government public health websites regional newspaper articles and wikipedia crowd-sourced information the available epidemiological and policy data varied across the six countries and preference was given to collecting data at the most granular administrative unit level the country-specific panel datasets are at the region level in france the state level in the us the province level in south korea italy and iran and the city level in china below we describe our data sources china we acquired epidemiological data from an open source github project 1 that scrapes time series data from ding xiang yuan we extended this dataset back in time to january 10 by manually collecting o cial daily statistics from the central and provincial hubei guangdong and zhejiang chinese government websites we compiled policies by collecting data on the start dates of travel bans and lockdowns at the city-level from the 2020 hubei lockdowns wikipedia page 2  the wuhan coronavirus timeline project on github 3  and various other news reports as we suspect that most chinese cities have been treated by at least one anti-contagion policy due to their reported trends in infections we have dropped cities where we cannot find a policy deployment date to avoid miscategorizing the policy status of cities we manually collected and compiled the epidemiological dataset in south korea based on provincial government reports policy briefings and news articles we compiled policy actions from press releases from the korean centers for disease control and prevention kcdc the ministry of foreign aairs local governments websites and news articles iran we used epidemiological data from the table new covid-19 cases in iran by province 4 in the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in iran wikipedia article which have been compiled from the data provided on the iranian ministry of health website in persian we relied on news media reporting and two timelines of pandemic events in iran 5 6 to collate policy data italy we utilized epidemiological data from the github repository 7 maintained by the italian department of civil protection dipartimento della protezione civile for policies we primarily relied on the english version of the covid-19 dossier chronology of main steps and legal acts taken by the italian government for the containment of the covid-19 epidemiological emergency written by the department of civil protection dipartimento della protezione civile 8  france we used the region-level epidemiological dataset provided by frances government website 9 and supplemented it with scraped number of confirmed cases by region on frances public health website which is updated daily 10 we obtained data on frances policy response to the covid-19 pandemic from the french government website 11 press releases from each regional public health site 12 and wikipedia 13  we used state-level epidemiological data from the github repository 14 associated with the interactive dashboard from johns hopkins university jhu for policy responses we relied on a number of sources including the us center for disease control cdc individual state health departments as well as various press releases from county and city-level government or media outlets policy data policies in administrative units were coded as binary variables where the policy is coded as either 1 after the date that the policy was implemented and before it is removed or 0 otherwise for the aected administrative units there were instances when a policy implementation only aected a portion of the administrative units eg half of the counties within the state in an attempt to accurately represent the locality and impact of policy implementation policy variables were weighted by the percentage of population within the administrative unit that was treated by the policy the most recent estimates available of population data for countries administrative units were used see the population data section in the appendix additionally in order to standardize policy types across countries we mapped country-specific policies to one of our broader policy categories used as variables in our analysis in this exercise we collected 130 policies for   cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright

covid-19 testing regimes for our regression analysis figure 2  we use active cases when they are available for china and south korea and cumulative confirmed cases otherwise we document quality control steps in detail in appendix section 2 notably for china and south korea we acquire more granular data than the the data hosted on the john hopkins university jhu interactive dashboard 15  we confirm that the number of confirmed cases closely match between the two data sources see appendix figure a2  to conduct the econometric analysis we merge the epidemiological and policy data to form a single data set for each country reduced-form approach the reduced-form econometric approach that we apply here is a top down approach that describes the behavior of aggregate outcomes y in data here infection rates this approach can identify plausibly causal eects 23 24 induced by exogenous changes in independent policy variables z eg school closure without explicitly describing all underlying mechanisms that link z to y and without observing intermediary variables x eg behavior that might link z to y nor other determinants of y unrelated to z eg demographics denoted w let f  describe a complex and unobserved process that generates infection rates y process-based epidemiological models aim to capture elements of f  explicitly and then simulate how changes in z x or w aect y this approach is particularly important and useful in forwardlooking simulations where future conditions are likely to be dierent than historical conditions however a challenge faced by this approach is that we may not know the full structure of f  for example if a pathogen is new and many key biological and societal parameters remain uncertain crucially we may not know the eect that large-scale policy z will have on behavior xz or how this behavior change will aect infection rates f  alternatively one can dierentiate equation 1 with respect to the k th policy z k  which describes how changes in the policy aects infections through all n potential pathways mediated by x 1   x n  usefully equation 2 does not depend on w if we can observe y and z directly and estimate y z k with data then intermediate variables x also need not be observed 15 httpsgithubcomcssegisanddatacovid-19  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted

to measure y z k directly exploiting exogenous variation in policies z model active infections grow exponentially during the initial phase of an epidemic when the proportion of immune individuals in a population is near zero assuming a simple susceptible-infected-recovered sir disease model eg ref  22  the growth in infections during the early where i t is the number of infected individuals at time t is the transmission rate new infections per day per infected individual is the removal rate proportion of infected individuals recovering or dying each day and s is the fraction of the population susceptible to the disease the second equality holds in the limit s  1 which describes the current conditions during the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic the solution to this ordinary dierential equation is the exponential where the growth rate g  and t 1 are the initial conditions taking the natural logarithm and rearranging we have anti-contagion policies are designed to alter g through changes to  by reducing contact between susceptible and infected individuals holding the time-step between observations fixed at one day t 2 t 1  1 we thus model g as a time-varying outcome that is a linear function of a time-varying where  0 is the average growth rate absent policy policy t is a binary variable describing whether a policy is deployed at time t and  is the average eect of the policy on growth rate g  t is a mean-zero disturbance term that captures inter-period changes not described by policy t  using this approach infections each day are treated as the initial conditions for integrating equation 4 through to the following day we compute the first dierences logi t  logi t 1  using active infections where they are available otherwise we use cumulative infections noting that they are almost identical during this early period except in china where we use active infections we then match these data to policy variables that we construct using the novel data sets we assemble and apply a reduced-form approach to estimate a version of equation 6 although the actual expression has additional terms detailed below 12  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

101101 10 2020 estimation to estimate a multi-variable version of equation 6 we estimate a separate regression for each country c observations are for sub-national units indexed by i observed for each day t because not all localities began testing for coivd-19 on the same date these samples are unbalanced panels to ensure data quality we restrict our analysis to localities after they have reported at least ten cumulative infections we estimate a multiple regression version of equation 6 using ordinary least squares we include a vector of sub-national unit-fixed eects  0 ie varying intercepts captured as coe cients to dummy variables to account for all time-invariant factors that aect the local growth rate of infections such as dierences in demographics socio-economic status culture or health systems 24 we include a vector of day-of-week-fixed eects to account for weekly patterns in the growth rate of infections that are common across locations within a country we include a separate singleday dummy variable each time there is an abrupt change in the availability of covid-19 testing or a change in the procedure to diagnose positive cases such changes generally manifest as a discontinuous jump in infections and a re-scaling of subsequent infection rates eg see china in figure 1  eects that are flexibly absorbed by a single-day dummy variable because the dependent variable is the first-dierence of the logarithm of infections denote the vector of these testing dummies  lastly we include a vector of p c country-specific policy variables for each location and day these policy variables take on values between zero and one inclusive where zero indicates no policy action and one indicates a policy is fully enacted in cases where a policy variable captures the eects of collections of policies eg museum closures and library closures a binary policy variable is computed for each then they are averaged so the coe cient on these variables are interpreted as the eect if all policies in the collection are fully enacted in some cases for italy and the us policy data is available at a more spatially granular level than infection data eg city policies and state-level infections in the us in these cases we code binary policy variables at the more granular level and use population-weights to aggregate them to the level of the infection data thus policy variables may take on continuous values between zero and one with a value of one indicating that the policy is fully enacted for the entire population for each country our general multiple regression model is thus where observations are indexed by country c sub-national unit i and day t the parameters of interest are the country-by-policy specific coe cients  pc  we verify that our residuals  cit are approximately normally distributed appendix figure a1  and we estimate uncertainty over all parameters by clustering our standard errors at the day level 23 this approach non-parametrically 13

larger estimates for uncertainty than clustering by i when we report the eect of all policies combined eg figure 2b  we are reporting the sum of coe cent estimates for all policies p pc p1  cp  accounting for the covariance of errors in these estimates when computing the uncertainty of this sum note that our estimates of  and  0 in equation 7 are robust to systematic under-reporting of

infections i then the left-hand-side of equation 7 will be and is therefore unaected by the under-reporting thus systematic under-reporting does not aect our estimates for the eects of policy  there are some country-specific adjustments to equation 7 due to idiosyncratic dierences between samples in china we code policy parameters using weekly lags based on the date that the policy is first implemented in locality i as discussed in the main text this is done to understand the temporal dynamics of the response to policy in the one country where policy has been enacted the longest and in the most consistent way weekly lags are used because the incubation period covid-19 is thought to be 5-6 days 4 econometrically this means the eect of a policy implemented one week ago is allowed to dier arbitrarily from the eect of a policy implemented two weeks ago etc these eects are all estimated simultaneously also in china we omit day-of-week eects because there is no evidence to suggest

categorical variable used to identify when an administrative region or country changed their covid-19 testing regime this is zero-indexed with the ordering only indicating chronological progression there is no external meaning to regime 2 vs regime 1 vs regime 0 and there is no consistency enforced for coding across countries for example if china changes their testing regime twice all observations prior to the first regime change would be coded  testingregime 0 all observations in between the two changes would be coded  testingregime 1 and all observations after the second change would be coded  testingregime 2 data imputation in instances where health outcome observations are missing or suffer from data quality issues we have imputed to fill in the missing values imputed health outcome variables are denoted by  healthoutcomeimputed  for the majority of our analyses we do not use imputed data france is the exception where we impute two days of missing data we do this to ensure we have variation in policy variables for use in the analysis we impute by 1 taking the natural log of the non-missing observations pertaining to that health outcome variable 2 linearly

statistics meant there had been no new cases we dropped a small number of cases that had been recorded but not assigned to a specific city many of these cases are imported ones from other cities we also dropped confirmed cases in prison populations we assumed the spread of covid-19 in prisons was not affected by the implementation of city-level lockdowns or travel ban policies for city level health outcomes prior to january 24 2020 we manually collected official daily statistics from the central and provincial hubei guangdong and zhejiang  chinese government websites we did not collect city level health outcomes recorded prior to january 24 2020 in provinces that had fewer than ten confirmed cases at that date we made this decision since our analysis dropped observations with fewer than ten cumulative confirmed cases to prevent noisy data during the early transmission phase from disproportionately biasing the estimated results after merging the two datasets we conducted a few quality checks 1 we checked that cumulative confirmed cases cumulative recoveries and cumulative deaths were increasing over time in instances when cumulative outcomes decreased over time we assumed that the recent numbers were more reliable and treated the earlier number of cumulative cases as missing this was often due to data entry errors or cases where patients that were reported to have been diagnosed with covid-19 but were later found out to actually have tested negative the magnitude of these errors was relatively small we filled in any missing data with the imputation methodology described in the health data overview section 2 we validated our city level dataset by aggregating observations up to the provincial level and comparing the time trends from the aggregated dataset to that of the provincial dataset collated by johns hopkins university we confirmed that the two datasets matched very closely see figure a2 8 panel a as of the time of writing the criteria for being diagnosed with covid-19 had changed twice in china 9 on february 13 2020 china recategorized patients who exhibited symptoms as determined through a chest scan as part of the confirmed cases count even if they had not tested positive in the pcr test this was due to concerns that the pcr test had relatively high false negative rates on february 20 2020 china reversed this decision we included this information in the dataset because it could have potentially changed the levels and short-term growth rates of the number of confirmed cases we have collated a regional level time series health outcome dataset in france from february 15 2020 to present-day we used the number of confirmed covid-19 cases by rgion from frances government website the 10 sources listed for this dataset were the french public health website the ministry of solidarity and 11 health french newspapers that reported government information and regional public health 12 13 websites given that this dataset was not

testing regime we used estimated daily counts of the cumulative number of tests conducted in every state as aggregated by the largely crowdsourced effort named the covid tracking project  covidtrackingcom  we estimated the total number of tests as the sum of confirmed positive and negative cases for some states and some days there have been no negative case counts in which case we utilize just the confirmed positive cases we also ensured that the confirmed number of positive cases agreed with the counts in the jhu dataset we programmatically filtered for possible testing regime changes by filtering for any consecutive days during which the testing rate increased at least 250 from one day to the next and where this jump was an increase of at least 150 total tests over one day after visually inspecting the candidates we removed detected testing regime changes for north carolina and connecticut as these states did not demonstrate spikes in their testing rate but rather a more gradual and steady rate in the increase of testing nb the last download from covidtrackingcom was march 19 1930 pst we have been updating the process and the removal of detected testing regime changes periodically so this may change the policy events datasets and sources used in this paper are described below for each country the relevant country-specific policies identified were then

containment policies such as school 56 closures and restrictions on non-essential work we do not specifically estimate the effect of this holiday extension as most cities were in lockdown during the

qom that brought shiite pilgrims from iran and throughout the middle east where they came to kiss the fatima masumeh shrine it is possible that the disease was brought to qom by a merchant traveling from wuhan china in addition it is believed that the iranian government knew of the covid-19 outbreak 102 prior to its february 21 2020 parliamentary elections but downplayed the risks associated with the disease as not to suppress voter turnout given concerns that a low turnout would reflect poorly on its legitimacy the disease initially centered in qom and neighboring tehran spread rapidly 103

associations between suspected sars-cov-2 infection hand washing smoking status e-cigarette use and nicotine replacement therapy nrt use and 2 whether covid-19 has prompted smoking and vaping quit attempts and more smoking inside the home design cross-sectional household surveys of a representative sample of the population in england participants the sample included 3285 adults aged  18 years participants who reported they definitely or think they had coronavirus were classified as having a suspected sars-cov-2 infection participants were asked how often they wash their hands after returning home before eating before preparing foods or before touching their face they were also asked whether due to covid-19 they had i attempted to quit smoking ii attempted to quit vaping and iii changed the amount they smoke inside the home findings odds of suspected sars-cov-2 infection were significantly greater among current smokers 209 adjusted odds ratio or adj 134 95 confidence interval

use with the exception of hand washing before face touching engagement in hand washing behaviours was high 85 regardless of nicotine use a minority 122 of past- year smokers who made a quit attempt in the past three months were triggered by covid-19 and approximately one-in-ten current e-cigarette users reported attempting to quit vaping because of covid-19 most people reported smoking the same amount inside the home in a representative sample of the adult population in england current smokers and long-term ex-smokers had higher odds of suspected sars-cov-2 infection than never smokers but there were no large differences by nrt or e-cigarette use in general engagement in hand washing was high regardless of nicotine or tobacco use a minority of past-year smokers and current ecigarette users respectively attempted to quit smokingvaping due to covid-19  covid-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the sars-cov-2 virus 1 tobacco smoking was considered an a priori risk factor for sars-cov-2 infection and poor covid-19 disease outcomes current and former smoking is known to increase the risk of respiratory viral and bacterial infection and adverse disease outcomes compared with never smoking 2 3 behavioural factors involved in both smoking and vaping such as regular hand-to-mouth movements may increase viral infection and transmission if performed without accompanying protective behaviours like hand washing 4 however early descriptive epidemiology from the ongoing pandemic produced surprising results limited mixed-quality evidence suggests lower than expected smoking rates among those testing positive for sars-cov-2 infection and those hospitalised with covid-19 5 6 this has led to the hypothesis that nicotine may protect against a hyper-inflammatory response to sars-cov-2 infection 78 thus preventing adverse outcomes such as hospitalisation with covid-19 disease alternatively the lower than expected smoking rates may reflect smokers being less likely to become infected due to an unexpected interaction between nicotine and ace2 receptors or may just be an artefact of various measurement and sampling issues 5 our aim is to use a large representative population survey with reliable assessment of smoking status to estimate rates of self-reported sars-cov-2 infection in relation to smoking status the early literature has focussed on smoking sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 disease however comparisons of rates of symptomatic sars-cov-2 infection between smokers ex-smokers and non-smokers are a poor test of the nicotine hypothesis other components in tobacco smoke could lead to greater symptom severity which could obscure the hypothesised protective effect of nicotine electronic cigarettes e-cigarettes and nicotine replacement therapy nrt have lower toxicity than cigarettes 910 therefore an assessment of the use of these products provides a better test of a potential protective effect of nicotine despite this few studies so far in the pandemic have measured the use of e-cigarettes or nrt 11 in addition most studies have not been able to rely on representative sampling and have failed to distinguish between current smokers recent ex-smokers long-term ex-smokers and never smokers 5 our secondary aim is therefore to estimate rates of sars-cov-2 infection by use of alternative nicotine products in a representative population survey hand washing is an important behaviour in reducing the transmission of infectious diseases through the population especially for those that are primarily spread through respiratory droplets 12 because of the repeated hand-to-mouth movements involved in smoking and vaping current smokers and ecigarette users may be less likely to regularly wash their hands before touching their face additionally personality factors such as lower risk aversion 13 could lead to reduced hand washing among tobacco and nicotine users these behavioural factors could explain differences in rates of sars-cov-2 infection by smoking status e-cigarette use or nrt use therefore in this study we  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

sars-cov-2 infection or hospitalisation public health messaging has focused on general benefits of quitting tobacco smoking 1415 some organisations such as the american lung association 16 have also urged people to stop using e-cigarettes vaping claiming that doing so may reduce their risk of developing severe covid-19 symptoms -despite little evidence to support this the sars-cov-2 pandemic may therefore have prompted smokers and e-cigarette users to attempt to stop in greater numbers social distancing measures introduced in england in march 2020 have limited people to leave their home only for food healthcare exercise and essential work 17 these measures may have increased the amount people smoke inside their home which would be especially damaging because school closures mean children are housebound and at risk of exposure to second-hand smoke the covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated heath inequalities in england with the highest mortality rates found among people working in manual routine and service occupations 18 and in black and ethnic minority groups 19 in addition those living in deprived areas are the most likely to be diagnosed with covid-19 and have worse outcomes when hospitalised 20 because smoking and vaping prevalence is highest among people from disadvantaged groups 21 the impact these behaviours have on sars-cov-2 infection may be more pronounced in these groups in this study we will use a representative population sample of adults in england to estimate 1 associations between suspected sars-cov-2 infection and smoking status e-cigarette use and nrt use 2 associations between hand washing and smoking status e-cigarette use and nrt use 3 the proportion of smokers and e-cigarette users who have attempted to quit product use because they are

hospitalisation or it is an artefact of various measurement or sampling issues in this study we found that compared with never smokers current smokers and long-term ex-smokers had greater odds of suspected sars-cov-2 infection recent ex-smokers also had greater odds of suspected infection but not significantly so these findings suggest that one of the two explanations other than infection are likely to account for the lower than expected smoking rates among those hospitalised for covid-19 however see below for an alternative interpretation  cc-by 40 international license it is made

httpsdoiorg101101202006 2920142661 doi medrxiv preprint in terms of infection the most parsimonious interpretation of the current findings is that current smokers and long-term ex-smokers are at increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection independent of a variety of sociodemographic factors this increased risk could be the result of behaviour or biology a relevant behaviour is that smoking requires repeated hand-to-mouth actions although we found no equivalent association with e-cigarette use which involves similar behaviours in terms of biology smoking has been associated with upregulation of ace2 the receptor for the virus in the lung which would provide a mechanism for increased risk however other studies argue the relationship between smoking and ace2 is more complicated and may vary between epithelial or alveolar cells 28 29 the alternative explanation is that smokers are more likely to report suspected infection but that this does not reflect an increased infection risk instead these differences could result from smokers and longterm ex-smokers having greater susceptibility to other infections with similar symptoms to covid-19 3 consistent with this explanation is that current compared with never smoking is associated with reduced risk of testing positive among people tested in the community 5 30 in order to resolve these competing explanations for our observation that smokers had greater odds of reporting suspected infection future studies need to assess the seroprevalence of sars-cov-2 infection by smoking status in large representative randomly selected samples of the population beyond smoking the current findings are also difficult to reconcile with nicotine being substantially protective of sars-cov-2 infection bayes factors indicated there was sufficient evidence to rule out large differences in suspected sars-cov-2 infection by nrt use and medium differences by ecigarette use however the current study was not able to address the possibility that nicotine may protect against the development of more severe covid-19 disease among people who become infected protective behaviours such as hand washing are important in slowing the transmission of infections like sars-cov-2 here we found that regardless of smoking status or nicotine use the majority of respondents 85 reported that they wash their hands most of the time after coming home before preparing food and before eating fewer people reported washing their hands most of the time before touching their face and recent ex-smokers had significantly lower odds than never smokers of reporting doing so the primary route through which people become infected with sars-cov-2 is through cells in the lungs and mucus membranes of the eyes nose and mouth 31 avoiding face touching without first washing ones hands could therefore be an important and understudied behaviour to reduce transmission 12 public health bodies have advised smokers that quitting may reduce their risk of severe covid-19 outcomes 15 this advice is based on the observation that despite being hospitalised at lower than expected rates current smoking is associated with greater disease severity among those who are hospitalised 5 this advice has been shared through the news and in social media campaigns such as  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder

quitforcovid in the uk 1432 here we found that while covid-19 triggered quit attempts among some smokers in england far more attempts were triggered by other reasons like future health concerns it is possible that conflicting news stories reporting the possibility that smoking is protective against covid-19 3334 may have partially undermined attempts to encourage people to quit smoking some organisations have also advised people to stop vaping arguing that e-cigarette use makes one susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection -despite little evidence to support this 5 16 in our sample one in ten current e-cigarette users attempted to quit vaping due to concerns about covid-19 these attempts to quit vaping might stem from the deteriorating perceptions about the harms associated with e-cigarette use among smokers in england 35 36 there was a concern that social distancing measures might increase the amount people smoke inside their home especially for disadvantaged individuals who may live in housing without easy access to outdoor smoking areas reassuringly we found that the majority of participants reported smoking the same number of cigarettes inside the home and equal numbers reported smoking more or fewer cigarettes there was no significant association between smoking more inside the home and ses or children in the household however given our small sample and the wide confidence intervals we may have lacked sufficient data to detect differences this study benefits from using a representative sample of the population in england including questions about current e-cigarette and nrt use and distinguishing between never current recent ex-smokers and long-term ex-smokers however there were a number of limitations first for some comparisons sample sizes were small which meant there was substantial uncertainly in estimates second suspected sars-cov-2 infection was self-reported and not confirmed with a viral or antibody test given that many other infections share symptoms with covid-19 some participants may have misdiagnosed themselves in addition it is likely that most participants with asymptomatic cases did not report being infected third individuals with the most severe cases of covid-19 were likely censored from our analysis because they may have died or been hospitalised thus if nicotine reduces risk of severe symptoms fewer infected nicotine users would be censored from the analysis than non-users leading to an upward bias in the or between these groups however at its peak only 002 of the uk population were in hospital

wuhan the city in china where the coronavirus emerged in december 2019 here we employ statistical methods to assess the severity of covid-19 pandemic across different regions of italy we manually retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths attributed to covid-19 stratified by region in italy from march 2 2020 to march 28 2020 we estimated both the crude and time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio across five geographic regions of italy northwest northeast center south and island  the northwest that includes lombardy exhibited the highest

reported a cluster of cases of severe pneumonia of unknown etiology to the china national health commission 1  and on january 7 2020 a novel coronavirus was isolated from afflicted patients in wuhan 1  this novel coronavirus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 while the disease it causes was named  since the initial cases of covid-19 the virus has rapidly spread throughout china and subsequently the number of covid-19 cases soared in many parts of the world considering the explosive spread and significant severity associated with the novel coronavirus the who declared this public health emergency a pandemic on march 11 2020 3  as of march 29 a total of 634835 confirmed cases of covid-19 and 29957 deaths have been recorded globally with 202 countriesterritoriesareas reporting variable disease growth rates 4  moreover the us has reported the highest number of cases 163 while italy has exhibited the highest death toll 334 4  the severity impact of any pandemic situation like covid-19 depends on the transmission rate of the disease the capacity of the health care system and the spectrum of clinical severity which is tied to socio-demographic factors age gender and the underlying prevalence of comorbidities in the population 5  a better understanding of the expected influx of severe patients to the health care system during the coronavirus pandemic in different areas of the world is key to anticipate medical resources such as icu units and ventilators which are critically needed to save the lives of severely ill patients 5 6 7  the case fatality ratio cfr is one of the most important epidemiological metrics to quantify the clinical severity of emerging infectious disease such as covid-19 so far several studies have attempted to elucidate the case fatality ratios for different population segments and geographic regions particularly based on epidemiological data from china 8 9 10  however there is still a scarcity of studies carefully documenting the severity of the covid-19 pandemic in populations outside china accumulating epidemiological data indicates that the cfr varies by geographical location intensity of transmission characteristics of patients such as age sex and comorbidity status 9  for example the timedelay adjusted cfr for wuhan was estimated at 122 compared to 42 for hubei province excluding wuhan and 09 in china excluding hubei province 11  rough differences in severity of the pandemic in different countries have been highlighted 10  however there is a need to quantify spatial variability in cfr and investigate how this variability is influenced by population factors and the characteristics of the health care system at the time of writing italy is exhibiting an alarming death toll from the covid-19 pandemic but estimates of the case fatality ratio that carefully account for the delay from onset of symptoms to death are not yet available in this study we provide estimates of the covid-19 cfr for different regions of italy by relying on publicly available daily series of confirmed cases and deaths from march 2 2020 to march 28 2020 italy is located in southern europe and is comprised of some islands and the italian peninsula that extends into the central mediterranean sea italy has 20 administrative regions including 5 autonomous regions 12  for our study we divided the country into 5 geographic regions northwest northeast centre south and island lombardia piemonte liguria and valle daosta were included in northwest emilia romagna friuli-venezia giulia trentino alto adige and veneto were included in northeast lazio marche toscana and umbria were included in centre region while abruzzo puglia basilicata calabria compania and molise were included in the south region the two islands sardegna and sicilia were categorized as islands the first two confirmed cases of covid-19 in italy had a travel history to wuhan china and were reported on 31 st january 2020 the third case was not confirmed until february 7 2020 on february 22 2020 the cumulative total reached 9 cases and subsequent incident cases continued to follow a rapidly increasing daily trend 13  the ministry of health of italy releases daily report on covid-19 cases and deaths 14  from these reports we manually retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of reported laboratory confirmed covid-19 cases and deaths stratified for five italian regions from march 2 2020 to march 28 2020 the crude cfr is defined as the number of cumulative deaths divided by the number of cumulative cases at a specific point in time for the estimation of cfr in real time we employed the delay from hospitalization to death h s  which is assumed to be given by h s  hs -hs-1 for s0 where hs is a cumulative density function of the delay from hospitalization to death and follows a gamma distribution with mean 101 days and sd 54 days obtained from the previously published paper 11  let  ati be the time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio on reported day t i in area a the likelihood function of the estimate  ati is where c at represents the number of new cases with reported day t in area a and d ati is the cumulative number of deaths until reported day t i in area a 15 16  among the cumulative cases with reported day t in area a d ati have died and the remainder have survived the infection the contribution of those who have died with biased death risk is shown in the middle parenthetical term and the contribution of survivors is presented in the right parenthetical term we assume that d ati is the result of the binomial sampling process with probability  ati  we estimated model parameters using a monte carlo markov chain mcmc method in a bayesian framework posterior distributions of the model parameters were estimated by sampling from the three markov chains for each chain we drew 100000 samples from the posterior distribution after a burn-in

social distancing measures are needed to flatten the curve and prevent the health care system from overloading to a breaking point the italian government put in place extraordinary social distancing measures to reduce transmission through strict self-isolation including the restriction of movement in the lombardy region of northwest at the beginning and later expanded at the nationwide level is praiseworthy 28  however there are reports from the lombardy region that indicate an overwhelming surge in patients requiring icu admission and overloaded public health laboratories 29  which underscore the dire need to mitigate transmission to flatten the incidence curve and reduce the pressure on the healthcare system our study is not exempted from limitations the preferential

balasco vincenzo daposalessandro giovanni smaldone luigi vitagliano  in recent months the entire world is facing a dramatic health emergency caused by the diffusion of a hitherto unknown coronavirus sars-cov-2 despite the efforts the understanding of the many facets of the pandemic is still rather limited in the present manuscript we have monitored the evolution of the lethality rate in italy by using the data collected over the last three months our data indicate that there is a striking correlation between the number of infected people of a certain week and the deaths of the following one despite the overall simplicity of the applied approach and its many approximations the analysis of the italian scenario provides some interesting insights into the pandemic indeed we have found that the lethality rate is virtually unchanged over the last two months this implies that the reduction of the deaths is strictly connected to the decrease of cases unfortunately the present study does not support the idea that the virus potency has lowered in the last weeks as our data demonstrate that the likelihood of a fatal outcome after the infection has not decreased in the recent outbreak evolution moreover we show that the lethality rate is still very high in the country 135 since this number is remarkably higher if compared to the actual lethality estimates made worldwide this finding suggests that the number of detected cases may be a gross underestimation of the actual infected people likely due to the presence of a significant number of  in china the last part of 2019 has been characterized by the detection of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome of unknown origin that did not respond to common treatments of respiratory illnesses the causative agent of this rapidly-diffusing disease has been identified in an unknown coronavirus that has been denoted as sars-cov-2 brussow 2020 and references therein chen et al 2020  the unravelling of the virus genome has highlighted that sars-cov-2 shares remarkable similarities with the coronaviruses responsible for sars and mers syndromes but also some clear distinctive features according to the data reported by worldometer a  the spread of the virus throughout the world has caused a pandemic that currently involves more than 200 countries of five continents sars-cov-2 has hitherto infected over seven million people worldwide with the death of more than 400k individuals despite the huge efforts made preventive and broadly effective therapeutic approaches to combat the virus and to cure the related respiratory syndrome are currently not available it is a common opinion that this situation will not change in the coming months to limit the pandemic social distance restrictions and frequently lockdowns of large regions and countries have been imposed at almost planetary scale although this strategy where applied has significantly mitigated the virus diffusion its economic and social costs are becoming progressively unsustainable for many communities therefore there is an urgent but largely unmet need to gain a deep understanding of the many facets of this global and dramatic health emergency a striking complication of such a new and unforeseen scenario is that the enormous collection of related data poorly validated by the scientific community and rapidly diffused by the media has frequently produced disputes and controversies moreover it is virtually impossible for scientists working in this field to keep updated with the huge amount of literature produced this sort of live science with a weakly-filtered osmosis of information from the lab bench to public has often generated confusion that could eventually lead to a general distrust for science in the sars-cov-2

figure 2b that reports the ssr values as function of the shifted days the optimal fitting of the data is achieved by applying a six-day shift to the curve of deaths this value which represents the

horizontal line indicates a slight increase of the wlr in the last three weeks indeed the average values and standard deviations calculated considering weeks from w5 to w10 or from w11 to w13 are 130  06 or 147  12 respectively however it should be noted that the very low number of ratios considered does not warrant a significance to this slight increase additional data should be collected to validate or confute this observation this is the average 1ws wlr from w5 to w13 in the panel b a comparison of the wlr based on the 1ws black scheme with the 0ws green and 2ws magenta ones is reported the data used to generate the graphs are reported in table s4  the observed constancy of the wlr values after the initial decrease is somehow surprising as the percentage of positive tests is continuously decreasing the reduction of the positive tests is also observed if a single test per individual is considered  figure s1 and table s4  finally we also analyzed the trends of the wlr values by assuming alternative schemes for the shift in particular we calculated new ratios by not considering any shift between deaths and cases 0ws or by assuming a two weeks shift 2ws as shown in figure 5b  the trends emerged for 1ws are clearly observed also for 0ws and 2ws indeed a reduction of the wlr values is observed in the initial phase of the infection that is followed by a plateau

decreases the longer is the shift the smaller is the ratio to quantitatively check and validate the robustness of the model of the wlr evolution obtained with the present analysis we predicted its value for w12 and w13 starting from the average wlr detected for the ensemble w5-w11 134  13 using this value we estimated the number of deaths of w12 and w13 by considering the cases of w11 and w12 respectively the predicted number of deaths of w12 is 853 63650134 the actual deaths of this week are 877 the relative error of this prediction is 27 the same approach used for w13 predicts 592 deaths 44230134 with a relative error of 59 considering the actual 630 fatalities of this week the very low error associated with these predictions witnesses the reliability of the illustrated approach it is worth mentioning that in both cases we underestimate the deaths this is not surprising if we consider that the wlr values are slightly increasing in the very last weeks of the infection in the present manuscript we monitored the evolution of the fatality rate in italy by using the data collected over the last three months our data indicate that there is a striking correlation between the cases of one week and the deaths in the following one despite the overall simplicity of our approach and its many approximations as for example the statistical assumption of a fixed time between deaths and cases the analysis of the italian scenario provides some interesting insights into this dramatic health emergency the first finding is that the weekly lethality rate is virtually unchanged at least over the last two months our analysis indicates that the reduction of the deaths is strictly connected to the decrease of cases produced by the restrictions imposed by the national and local authorities unfortunately the present analysis does not support the idea that the virus potency has lowered in the last weeks as emerged from the media f  despite the detected tendency of the virus to mutate van dorp et al 2020  our data indicate that the likelihood of a fatal outcome after the infection has not decreased in the last weeks obviously this analysis does not exclude that the variation of external factors including weather conditions has or will have an impact on the virus infectivity potential contagiousness the average fatality rate we detected in the last weeks indicates that the sars-cov-2 lethality rate is still very high in the country 135 this number is remarkably higher if compared to the actual f from

unfortunate situation this finding suggests that the number of detected cases is still a gross underestimation of the actual infected people due to the presence in the population of a significant number of non-symptomatic or paucisymptomatic individuals a better estimate of the spread of the virus in the country could be obtained by focusing the attention on individuals that in principle are not expected to be positive this will require extensive testing of people that do not display symptoms and did not have contacts with infected people  prevention and control strategies for sars-cov-2 infection shailendra saxena k nishant srivastava shailendra saxena k   the sars-cov 2 or covid-19 is emerged as global pandemic declared by the who with 184976 reported cases across 159 countries until march 18 2020 and accounts for 7529 deaths globally who the severity of covid-19 can be easily understood by the exponentially increasing cases worldwide the virus affects respiratory system like other influenza viruses and appears as a major threat throughout the world after 1918 spanish flu h1n1 outbreak covid-19 is one of the highly infectious diseases with the ability to affect a large population globally and can cause severe impact on socioeconomic stability of the world the emergence of sars-cov traces back to year 2003 from china and again another mutant emerged in 2012 known as mers from saudi arabia all the three highly infectious strains of cov are found to be zoonotic and transmitted from animals to people the sars-cov-2 is also believed to be spread from fish market of wuhan china in november 2019 and was first reported in the last week of december 2019 in 59 people at wuhan hubei china the strain was completely novel and unknown to scientific fraternity at the time of its outbreak the novel coronavirus or covid-19 is highly infectious and spread so fast through people-to-people contact the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic viral strains pose immense threat to the human population and need to addressed strategically with rapid response menachery et al 2018 the sars-cov-2 is a novel coronavirus and is classified into virus family of coronaviridae coronaviruses belong to large coronaviridae family of viruses causing infection leads from common cold to severe illness and respiratory diseases as per the studies conducted by various research groups worldwide the covid-19 genome is in close similarity with bat coronavirus and it belongs to beta coronavirus group of coronaviridae family the brief classification of the sars-cov-2 is depicted in fig 111 tekes and thiel 2016 ashour et al 2020 and some of the major human illnesses causing covs are given in table 111

 the emergence of covid-19 has drawn very much attention of researchers and health professionals because of its high infection potential and novel structure researchers found the stability of sars-cov-2 on various surfaces and compared the same with sars-cov-1 the experimental data under varied circumstances on different surfaces are found to be similar for both the strains van doremalen et al 2020 the experimental observation shows that alterations in the epidemiologic characteristics of both the viruses may arise due to other reasons the high viral concentration in the upper respiratory tract in the patient and the potential of covid-19-infected individual to carry and spread the virus while being in asymptomatic condition are some probable reasons for high infection rate making its control challenging bai et al 2020 zou et al 2020 covid-19 is a single-stranded ss rna virus consisting of 2636 kb positive sense rna genome the complete virus particle is made up of four major structural proteins namely spikes s nucleocapsid n membrane m and envelope e encoded by virus genome forni et al 2017 the size of sars-cov-2-encoded proteins shows similarity to bat sars-cov the important difference is longer length and structure of s protein of sars-cov-2 in comparison to sars-cov and bat sars-cov observed by researchers these s proteins are very crucial for receptor binding membrane fusion internalization of the sars-cov-2 tissue tropism and host array this s protein may be utilized as vital target for vaccine development menachery et al 2016 ji et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 extensive efforts are already taken to control covid-19 spread and for the development of effective vaccines around the world scientists are working round the clock individually and in collaboration to get some effective solution for the severe pandemic occurred by covid-19 the covid-19 outbreak can be reduced and controlled only by maintaining self-hygiene social distancing and strong immunity until any vaccine or effective medication is found the present chapter provides an insight into the prevention and control strategies for covid-19 including vaccine development and control measures covid-19 contains the largest rna genome and has spike proteins which play very important role in hostvirus interaction and infection after entering into host cells the viral genome translates into two large precursors poly-proteins known as pp1a and pp1ab these precursors further processed by orf1a-encoded viral proteinases pl pro papain-like proteinases and 3cl pro 3c-like proteinases into 16 mature non-structural proteins namely nsp1 to nsp16 these nsps perform several important functions in viral rna replication and transcription rna polymerase rna-processing enzymes such as poly u-specific endoribonuclease protease helicase 35 exoribonuclease ribose 2-o methyltransferase adenosine diphosphate-ribose-1-phosphatase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase narayanan et al 2015 additionally these nsps have a major role in viral rna replication and transcription due to the absence of proofreading mechanism during rna recombination process in pre-existed coronaviruses strains it may account to be responsible for the evolution of sars-cov-2 the s gene-encoding spike glycoproteins have the maximum recombination frequency ji et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 out of the three major proteins forming viral envelope s and m are glycol proteins and the e is non-glycosylated protein m and e proteins are essential for virus assembly morphogenesis and budding the m protein comprises short n terminal glycosylated ectodomain with a long c terminal domain and three membrane domains on the other hand s glycoprotein is a type 1 fusion viral protein which includes two heptad repeat regions hr-n and hr-c and forms protein ectodomain-surrounded coiled structure additionally the s protein cleaves into two subunits s1 and s2 and facilitates receptor binding at domain 270510 and membrane fusion respectively tripet et al 2004 yuen et al 2007 fehr and perlman 2015 narayanan et al 2015 kumar et al 2020 wan et al 2005 considering the importance of s protein in attachment with host cell and variation in sequence of s protein from sars-cov-1 s protein may be considered potential candidate for vaccine development systematic assessment identified that 380 amino acid substitutions between sars-cov-1 sars like bat cov and sars-cov-2 may be responsible for functional and pathogenic divergence of sars-cov-2 wu et al 2020 the covid-19 virus is traced till death in non-survivors and the longest virus shedding of 37 days has been observed in survivors zhou et al 2020 it shows the severity of covid-19 and its high infection rate especially in elderly and immunocompromised or weak immunity individuals several pharmaceutical rd units and researchers are working to develop vaccine for sars-cov-2 pandemic researchers are putting all efforts to find a solution for combating this novel coronavirus researchers across the globe are trying to develop sars-cov-2 vaccine by using approaches like whole virus vaccine antibody vaccine dna vaccine recombinant protein subunit vaccine and mrna vaccine dresden 2020 currently there is no approved vaccine available for sars-cov-2 recently mrna 1273 investigational vaccine has been developed by niaid scientists in collaboration with the biotechnology company moderna inc based in cambridge ma the clinical trial began at kaiser permanente washington health research institute kpwhri in seattle and part of national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid national institutes of health is funding the trial on mrna platform approved for human trial after its promising response in animal models nih a team of researchers from the hong kong university of science and technology hong kong reported high genetic similarity between sars-cov outbreak in 2003 and sars-cov-2 this genetic similarity leads researchers to determine experimental data for sars-cov-1 b-cell and t-cell epitopes derived from s and n proteins which map identically to sars-cov-2 in comparison to the non-structural proteins the t-cell response against the structural proteins has been reported to be the most immunogenic in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of recovering sars-cov patients additionally t-cell responses against the s and n proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting li et al 2008 channappanavar et al 2014 ahmed et al 2020 as no mutation was observed in the sars-cov-2 proteins and long-lasting t-cell response against s protein immune targeting of these epitopes may provide protection against covid-19 or sars-cov-2 ahmed et al 2020 similar study was also reported by researchers from cfar king georges medical university lucknow india in which researchers found glycosylated s protein site as potential target for vaccine development due to the genetic similarity with sars-cov and bat cov kumar et al 2020 table 112 comprise of some of the vaccines under development in various pharma and rd laboratories with the stage of vaccine
 the above given set of data is few of ongoing search for potential vaccine vaccine development is one of the typical processes and requires lot of efforts and time there are several vaccines under development for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov and researches are still going on at various stages of clinical trials the available advanced technology for virus genome sequencing and global emergency of pandemic expedite the process to develop vaccine at earliest the potential vaccine may take more than a year to come on the market after getting all approvals as once the researchers develop a vaccine it must get approved from various agencies like fda after which the vaccine is sent to three phases of clinical trial in phase 1 a small group of people are selected to evaluate the safety and immune response for vaccine after successful trial in phase 1 the vaccine is tested for phase 2 clinical trial on approximately few hundred people to analyse the dosage in phase 3 the effectiveness and safety evaluation of the vaccine will be evaluated on a large population once the vaccine passes all the three phases it successfully gets approval from the fda and is released for use to combat against the pathogen since the inception of deadly coronavirus such as sars-cov in 20032004 the human coronaviruses drew very much attention of the researchers worldwide to find a solution the emergence and transfer of zoonotic pathogens in humans become a great threat for human population after a decade of sars outbreak mers is emerged as another severe threat and continued infecting after its discovery in 2012 stockman et al 2006 in 2020 coronavirus emerged in a new form and is standing in front of the whole humanity as a severe threat in the form of pandemic accountable for many lives across the globe the timely containment and slow rate of transmission of sars-cov-1 and mers helped to control its larger impact menachery et al 2018 in context of sars and mers outbreaks many vaccines were developed and tested the majority of coronavirus vaccines studied or under development so far broadly comprise the following typeswhole virus vaccinelive attenuated vaccineantibody-based vaccinesmall subunit-based vaccinevector-based vaccinenucleic acid-based vaccine
 live attenuated vaccines contain weakened or dead virus to induce immune response in individual recipient the live virus vaccine sometimes develops complications in the receiver but it provides a long-term immune response for the specific virus antibody-based vaccines contain monoclonal antibodies which are strain specific and provide limited range of protection as per the studies carried out on coronavirus it mutated many times and in the last 1518 years some species emerged as deadly virus the protein subunit-based vaccines are one of the safest vaccines providing protection to a wide range of virus strains by targeting viral s and n proteins which facilitate attachment and interaction of virus to host cells nucleic acid-based vaccines also known as dna or rna vaccine are also safe for the recipients and provide long-term immunity the mrna-based vaccine for covid-19 already sent for phase 1 clinical trial some of the coronavirus vaccines are listed in table 113
 the research reported by various individual groups shows that cov s subunit protein provides complete protection than sars-cov live attenuated vaccines full-length s protein and dna-based s protein vaccines buchholz et al 2004 the s protein gene of coronavirus is a highly preferable target of antigenicity as exhibited by the reactivity with convalescent sars patient sera it shows precise binding to soluble ace-2 receptor additionally it promotes antibody-dependent viral access in raji b cells of human refractory b cells and provokes defense against a impute infection in an animal model liu et al 2020 the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccine are the most important criteria for the development of vaccine the efficacy of a vaccine is defined as the reduction percentage of disease in vaccinated or recipients group in comparison to unvaccinated groups under optimal condition whereas the effectiveness of a vaccine is defined as the percentage control achieved for particular disease in vaccinated group compared to unvaccinated group at real world in natural environment the efficacy of vaccine is studied when the vaccine is in clinical trial whereas the effectiveness is studied after the release of vaccine commercially or to mass after all approvals the efficacy of different types of coronavirus vaccines is studied for their potential application in the prevention of the disease various types of coronavirus vaccines are under research like inactivated coronavirus live attenuated coronavirus s-protein-based vectored vaccines dna vaccines and combination vaccines vaccines for combating several animal-based covs have been developed and demonstrated to be efficient in averting viral contagion vaccines for human covs especially deadly sars-cov-1 mers-cov and the present pandemic covid-19 are under development in various levels of preclinical subclinical and clinical trials the study of virus-like particle vaccine in mice and whole virus vaccine in non-human primates and ferrets exhibits immune response against cov infection but later on vaccinated animals unveiled immunopathological lung disease tseng et al 2012 another study in canine cov vaccine exhibited that the vaccination with inactivated cov can expressively reduce the viral replication followed with the reduction in occurrence of clinical symptoms and disease due to virulent cov infection fulker et al 1995 in a study carried out on rhesus monkey with sars-cov inactivated vaccine exhibited effective concomitant humoral and mucosal immunity against sars-cov infection the rhesus monkey was inoculated with a varied dose 05 5 50 and 5000 g of vaccine and provided with booster dose after a week afterwards the animals were exposed to ns-1 strain of sars-cov the vaccinated monkeys had not shown any systematic side effects neither any clinical symptoms the vaccine in study shows promising results on monkeys and may be further tested under clinical trials on humans zhou et al 2005 various therapeutic efforts were adopted for the cov vaccine globally however no solution in form of promising treatment or vaccination is identified till date progressive efforts on developed animal models and under clinical trials are ongoing to find an effective vaccine that is underway as discussed in the above sections targeting s glycoproteins of the virus and its subunits responsible for host interaction may be effective target for cov vaccine for humans as per research conducted on various cov genetic structure the s protein genetic make-up is found to be similar in sars-cov bat sars-cov and sars-cov-2 previously conducted studies on sars-cov and mers-cov vaccine development based on s glycoproteins of virus can provide insight into effective and efficient vaccine development against deadly strains of corona

remembered that severe cases are twice more 1 likely diagnosed and reported than other cases reported cases are usually 2 dominated by non-severe cases and the adjusted total number of cases is about a 3 double of observed count our finding is critical in interpreting the reported data 4 and it is advised to regard the mild case data as always under-ascertained 5 in addition to the proposed adjustment it should be noted that the 6 ascertainment rate of severe cases needs to be additionally estimated and such 7 estimation requires direct measurement of the total number of cases or infected 8 individuals by means of seroepidemiological study or other testing methods of all 9 samples nishiura et al 2020  that is the actual total number of cases is greater 10 than what it was adjusted in the present study using seroepidemiological 11 datasets we plan to address relevant issues in the future other limitations 12 include that i we did not explore detailed natural history eg dynamically 13 changing symptoms over the course of infection and underlying comorbidities 14 ii we ignored right-censored data eg the time delay from illness onset to 15 severe manifestations for simplicity the latter led us to underestimate the 16 ascertainment rate iii it is worth noting that the data of age dependent severity 17 employed in our analysis is only based on the observed data in china 18 considering the possibility of underreporting or biased age distribution the 19 nature of this age distribution may lead to underestimation   phenomenological modelling of covid-19 epidemics in sri lanka italy and hebei province of china a attanayake m c h s perera s n s jayasinghe  the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in increasing number of infections and deaths on a daily basis there is no specific treatment or vaccine identified and the focus has been preventive measures based on statistical and mathematical models these have relied on analyzing the behavior of populations and characteristics of the infection and applying modelling techniques the analysis of epidemiological curve fitting on number of daily infections across affected countries could give useful insights on the characteristics of the epidemic a variety of phenomenological models are available to capture dynamics of disease spread and growth data for this study used the number of daily new infections and cumulative number of infections in covid-19 in three selected countries sri lanka italy and hebei province of china from the first day of appearance of cases to 20 th april 2020 in this study gompertz logistic and exponential growth curves were fitted on cumulative number of infections across countries akaikes information criteria aic was used in determining the best fitting curve for each country results revealed that the most appropriate growth curves for sri lanka italy and china-hebei are exponential gompertz and logistic curves respectively the overall growth rate and final epidemic size evaluated from best models for the three countries and short-term forecasts were also generated log incidences over time in each country were regressed before and after the identified peak time of the respective outbreaks of countries hence doubling timehalving time together with daily growth rates and predictions were estimated findings altogether demonstrate that outbreak seems extinct in hebei-china whereas further transmissions are possible in sri lanka in italy current outbreak transmits in a decreasing rate  covid-19 or novel coronavirus is a pandemic where initiated in wuhan china in december 2019 at present the pandemic was recorded total number of 2471136 infections and 169006 deaths in the world 1  daily infections and deaths are increasing at an alarming rate according to the situation report 93 of who total confirmed cases were 84287 and deaths were 4642 in china as at 22 april 2020 these figures for italy and sri lanka were 183957 and 24648 and 310 and 7 respectively on 19 th march 2020 italy was the country where the highest number of deaths were recorded among the other countries in the world since then italy has attracted the attention of the public on its active engagement with the coronavirus in sri lanka the first infection was identified on 11 th march 2020 afterwards as of other countries several control measures such as isolation of cases quarantine of suspects lockdown of the country or permitting island wide curfew limitation of public gatherings annunciation of social distancing increase awareness of the disease through media and encouraging people to stay in their homes were implemented clearly china was at the phase of ending epidemic when italy entered to the phase of a growing epidemic in february 2020 and now is in its middle phase sri lanka had the beginnings of the epidemic in march 2020 and is still in the early phase since these three countries are in the three phases of the epidemic we decided to analyze them further and draw some conclusions to mitigate the epidemic control measures should be coupled with mathematical and statistical modelling to fine tune strategies by anticipating the dynamics of disease spread applications of phenomenological models in describing a growth of natural phenomenon can be found in the literature 2 3 4 5  these models are able to capture empirical patterns of an epidemic and are useful in predicting dynamics of the disease prediction of models will be beneficial for health care professional to allocate necessary resources and implement preventive measures at the appropriate time the analysis of epidemiological curve fitting on number of daily infections provides a useful insight on determination of the variety of statistical features of an outbreak 6 7  to capture the epidemic pattern one can fit a regression model on log incidences over time after the peak of the distribution has identified pre and post peak models of the distribution lead to identify the point of zero incidences in an outbreak further the estimation of doubling time or halving time together with daily growth rates and predictions were supported by the curve fitting in this study gompertz logistic and exponential growth curves fitted on cumulative number of infections over the selected three countries sri lanka italy and hebei province of china and the best fitted growth curve was identified for each country the overall growth rate and final epidemic size evaluated from best models for the three countries and short-term forecasts were also generated further useful characteristics of epidemiological curves were extracted and predictions were generated using pre and post peak models daily accumulated covid-19 cases were downloaded 8 for the three countries

for sri lanka italy and china-hebei are exponential gompertz and logistic curves respectively the epidemiological curves of each country were analyzed to extract useful characteristics of the coronavirus outbreak pre-peak and post-peak log -linear models were fitted on epidemic curve to predict the spread of covid-19 infection in future the results show that the epidemic seems extinct in hebei-china whereas further transmissions are possible in sri lanka in italy current outbreak transmits in a decreasing rate therefore effective controlling measures need to be continued and enhance with careful supervision in order to keep the epidemic under control in sri lanka in italy their controlling mechanisms seems to be on track and should be continued to eradicate the infection the analysis of this study was done assuming that all the cases reported accurately however there may be under reporting of cases and inadequate screening which leads to a disparity between actual values and the predicted values findings of this study will be beneficial for health care professional to allocate necessary resources at the right place at the right time there is a possibility of applying

never perceived as serious public health threats ashour et al 2020 this perception changed in 20022003 after the emergence of the sarscov1 which was the first lethal form of covs to infect humans

2019 a new human coronavirus emerged in wuhan city hubei province china causing severe acute respiratory disease and this disease is referred to as the coronavirus disease2019 covid19 due to the drastic increase in the number of reported covid19 cases worldwide it was declared as a pandemic by the who on 11 march 2020 on the basis of preliminary genetic studies this new virus was tentatively named as 2019new coronavirus 2019ncov later it was renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 after the coronaviridae study group of the ictv determined that the virus belongs

329300 deaths have been reported in 188 countries in the united states alone 1556749 cases have been reported resulting in more than 93606 deaths jhu 2020 the overall fatality rate of sarscov2 is relatively low 68 as compared to that of sarscov1 and merscov 109 and 344 respectively but it is still in flux and very well could be lower than 68 however it is obvious that sarscov2 is much more contagious as evidenced by its spread to 185 countries across the globe within a very short time this has led to an increased concern of possible collapse of the medical care systems as they will not be able to accommodate a large number of cases simultaneously decaprio gartner burgess kothari  sayed 2020 specht 2020 for that reason the governments and public health sectors are racing against time to contain this pandemic before the occurrence of this catastrophic scenario because an effective and safe vaccine or antiviral drug for sarscov2 does not exist infection control is the only available method to limit the spread of the virus lai shih ko tang  hsueh 2020 the infection control and preventive measures depend mainly on our primary understanding of the routes of transmission of this virus a reported familial cluster of pneumonia associated with covid19 in hospital and family settings has confirmed the direct persontoperson transmission route for this virus chan et al 2020 other indirect transmission routes are postulated andor indicated such as faecaloral nosocomial airborne and contact with contaminated surfaces and fomites cai et al 2020 han lin ni  you 2020 the impact of the environmental conditions such as temperature relative and absolute humidity and sunlight on the virus stability and spread is largely unknown this review has collected all available data on the stability of sarscov2 and other coronaviruses from previously published reports we believe that the data provided herein should help establish a solid longterm protocol to interrupt indirect environmental transmission of sarscov2 limit its spread and mitigate its risks the association of sarscov2 sarscov1 and merscov with acute respiratory diseases and their high loads detected in throat sputum and lower respiratory tract of infected persons indicate that viral particles of sarscov2 are shed in aerosols during coughing and sneezing calvet et al 2016 guery et al 2013 nhcprc 2020 pan et al 2020 the rna of sarscov1 has been detected in air samples collected from hospitals in china xiao et al 2004 the detection of rna of an animal cov such as pedv in air at 161 km distance from an infected farm in the united states indicates possible airborne transmission alonso et al 2014 although the detection of sarscov2 or its rna in aerosols has not yet been reported confirmed aerosol transmission of other coronaviruses suggests possible aerosol transmission of sarscov2 ge yang xia fu  zhang 2020 therefore understanding the persistence of sarscov2 is important to develop effective infection control measures of the virus in aerosols the persistence of various covs in aerosols at different environmental conditions has been studied the results of these studies are summarized in table 1 only two studies on aerosolized sarscov2 are available the first study compared the decay rates of sarscov2 and sarscov1 within 3h aerosolization time at room temperature 21c23c and a fixed relative humidity rh of 65 both viruses were detectable after 3 hr of aerosolization the median halflives were 109 and 118 hr for sarscov2 and sarscov1 respectively van doremalen et al 2020 in another study aerosolized sarscov2 retained its infectivity for a period of 16h at room temperature and the authors concluded that the virus can be considered as an airborne pathogen fears et al 2020 human coronavirus hcov229e a causative agent for common cold showed more stability in aerosols halflife  673 hr at similar conditions 20c and 50 rh and was infectious after 72 hr of aerosolization ijaz brunner sattar nair  johnsonlussenburg 1985 another study reported that infectious merscov was detectable after 1h of aerosolization despite a reduction in virus titre over the aerosolization time pyankov bodnev pyankova  agranovski 2018 persistence of sarscov2 on plastic surface has been reported in two recent studies in the first study sarscov2 retained its infectivity for 4 days but was completely decayed after 7 days on plastic surface at room temperature and 65 rh chin et al 2020 the second study demonstrated that sarscov2 retained its infectivity for 3 days on plastic surface at room temperature the same study found no difference between the persistence of sarscov2 and sarscov1 on plastic surface and both viruses completely lost their infectivity after 4 days van doremalen et al 2020 duan et al 2003 reported longer persistence 4 days with complete decay after 5 days of sarscov1 on plastic surface on polystyrene petri dish sarscov1 survived for at least 6 days at room temperature and completely decayed after 9 days rabenau et al 2005 in another study sarscov1 retained its infectivity on plastic surface for 28 days at room temperature and 4050 rh chan et al 2011 although this study reported longer virus survival it has been shown that the survivability of sarscov1 on plastic surface is drastically affected by increases in temperature and rh as described below as compared to sarscov1 and sarscov2 a little shorter survivability on plastic has been shown for merscov and hcov229e at room temperature both retained their infectivity for up to 2 days only and were completely inactivated after 3 days rabenau et al 2005 van doremalen bushmaker  munster 2013 in another study however hcov229e showed longer persistence 5 days on polyvinyl chloride pvc and polytetrafluoroethylene teflon at 21c and 3040 rh warnes little  keevil 2015 one study reported that sarscov2 initial load  36 log tcid50 persisted for 3 days on stainless steel surface and that it became undetectable after 4 days van doremalen et al 2020 in another study a this virus with a higher initial load 55 log tcid50 retained its infectivity for 4 days and was completely inactivated after 7 days on stainless steel at room temperature and rh of 65 chin et al 2020 the available data demonstrated that the survivability of coronaviruses on metal surfaces differs according to the type of metal in general coronaviruses survive for shorter periods on copper copper nickel and brass than on stainless steel and zinc surfaces for instance sarscov1 persisted on copper for 8 hr while it remained infectious for 2 days on stainless steel with complete decay after 3 days van doremalen et al 2020 similarly hcov229e showed lower persistence on brass ranging from 10 min to 2 hr and copper nickel from 20 min to 1 hr than on stainless steel 5 days at room temperature and 3040 rh the reduction in virus persistence was found proportional to an increase in the copper content in brass and nickel table 2 warnes et al 2015 virucidal activity of copper and copper alloy was reported against various viruses and this might explain the short survival of covs on copper surface compared to other metal surfaces michels wilks noyce  keevil 2005 warns  keevil 2013 in addition different survivability of various coronaviruses was observed on the same surface for instance sarscov2 showed lower survival on copper 4 hr than sarscov1 8 hr van doremalen et al 2020 similarly human coronavirus hcovoc43 showed shorter persistence 2 hr on aluminium than hcov229e which retained its infectivity for 6 hr under the same conditions of temperature and rh sizun yu  talbot 2000 some coronaviruses showed similar stability on the same surface such as merscov and sarscov1 both stayed infectious for up to 2 days on stainless steel surface at room temperature van doremalen et al 2013 and 2020 the porcine cov tgev and murine coronavirus mcov or mhv were detectable on stainless steel for 28 d with only 1 log reduction in their titres on day 1 casanova jeon rutala weber  sobsey 2010 the results presented here suggest that using coppermade common touch surfaces in hospitals might be helpful in reducing the persistence of sarscov2 furthermore the same virus might show different survivability on a single surface according to changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and rh as discussed below recently sarscov2 survivability on glass was studied at room temperature and rh of 65 the virus stayed infectious for 2 days and became completely undetectable after 4 days chin et al 2020 sarscov1 retained its infectivity for a longer time 4 days on glass at room temperature and completely decayed after 5 days duan et al 2003 the stability of sarscov1 on mosaic at room temperature was similar to its stability on glass survived for 3 days and decayed after 4 days duan et al 2003 similarly hcov229e survived for 5 days on either glass or ceramic surfaces at room temperature the time required for complete inactivation of this virus on both surfaces was not reported warnes et al 2015 on surgical latex gloves hcov229e survived for 3 hr and decayed after 6 hr while hcovoc43 survived for less than an hour and completely decayed after 1 hr sizun et al 2000 another study found that infectivity of hcov229e was detectable on silicon rubber at room temperature and 3040 rh for 3 days and that the virus became undetectable after 5 days warnes et al 2015 the survivability of sarscov2 on cardboard was studied in comparison with sarscov1 sarscov2 survived for a longer time 1 day than sarscov1 which survived for only 8 hr under the same conditions van doremalen et al 2020 in a comparative study table 2 sarscov2 showed variable persistence on different porous surfaces in general it survived longer period of days on surfaces with higher porosity than those with lower porosity period of hours for instance it survived on inner and outer layers of surgical facemasks for 4 and 7 days respectively and for 1 day with complete decay after 2 days on cloth and banknotes however the virus survived for only 30 min on paper with complete decay after 3 hr chin et al 2020 sarscov1 demonstrated similar survivability behaviour in terms of the porosity of the surface it survived for 5 days on cloth and filter paper 4 days on press paper and wood boards and between 1 day and 2 days on disposable and cotton gowns respectively duan et al 2003 lai cheng  lim 2005 the survivability on lower porosity surfaces such as cardboard was only 8 hr van doremalen et al 2020 lai et al 2005 reported that survival of sarscov1 on cotton and disposable gowns and paper surfaces was proportional to the initial virus load table 2 compared to 6 hr survivability of hcov229e the hcovoc43 demonstrated lower survivability only 1 hr on cotton gauze sponges sizun et al 2000 oral and upper respiratory tract fluids of the covid19 patients are key factors in sarscov2 transmission as the current data indicate that the major routes of transmission are droplet contact and aerosols lu  shi 2020 faecaloral transmission is also postulated since rna of sarscov2 was detected in anal swab samples collected from covid19 patients in china chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a in addition infectious sarscov2 particles were isolated from stool specimens of covid19 patients zhang et al 2020 furthermore nucleic acid of sarscov2 was detected in urine samples from covid19 cases wang li et al 2020 therefore it is very important to know how stable sarscov2 is in oral fluids and excrements of humans to help us project the roles that these items can play in transmitting this virus to date no data are available on the survival of sarscov2 in human excrements however this can be extrapolated from the available data on other covs table 3 it has been found that coronaviruses can survive in stools for 1 hr to 4 days depending on the type and ph of the stool samples for instance sarscov1 survived in stool specimens from baby ph  67 normal adult ph  78 another normal adult ph  8 and adult with diarrhoea ph  9 for 1 hr 3 hr 6 hr and 4 days respectively the same virus was completely decayed in the same samples after 3 hr 6 hr 1 day and 5 days respectively lai et al 2005 similarly wang et al 2005 demonstrated that sarscov1 survived for 4 days and completely decayed after 5 days at room temperature in faecal samples collected from sarscov1 patients the same study found that the virus could survive for 2 days and decayed completely after 3 days at room temperature in domestic sewage wang et al 2005 both human coronavirus hcov229e and feline coronavirus fcov or feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv survived for 2 days and decayed after 3 days in primary and secondary effluents activated sludge at 23c gundy gerba  pepper 2009 the tgev and the mcov mhv survived for longer periods 21 days for both in pasteurized settled sewage at room temperature the tgev decayed after 35 days while mcov was inactivated within 28 days under the same conditions casanova rutala weber and sobsey 2009 two studies reported different persistence patterns of coronaviruses in urine duan et al 2003 detected the infectivity of sarscov1 in urine for up to 5 days however the infectivity of the same virus was detected in urine for up to 17 days at room temperature in another study wang et al 2005 none of the two studies reported the period for complete decay of the virus in human sputum sarscov1 persisted for 5 days while in human blood serum it persisted for 4 days and decayed completely after 5 days duan et al 2003 in light of these results possible faecaloral transmission of sarscov2 is suggested furthermore human coronaviruses such as sarscov1 and merscov have been considered as having potential for foodborne transmission greening  cannon 2016 this is because several studies reported the association of gastroenteritis symptoms and infection by sarscov1 and merscov chan et al 2015 cheng et al 2004 some studies revealed that up to 106 of patients with sarscov1 and 30 of patients with merscov had diarrhoea chan et al 2020 likewise diarrhoea and gastroenteritis symptoms have been reported in some cases of sarscov2 infection chan et al 2020 song et al 2020 this indicates that sarscov2 may also have the potential for foodborne and waterborne transmission this risk is probably greater in developing countries which are known to have poor water treatment systems poor hygienic measures in food processing and food service areas and use untreated or partially treated sewage for irrigating fresh produce aboubakr  goyal 2019 goyal  aboubakr 2016 mans armah steele  taylor 2016 it should be noted however that until now there is no evidence implicating food or waterborne transmission of sarscov2 in developed countries it is unlikely that foodborne transmission is occurring widely through food handlers as the level of virus deposited on foods is quite low and most of it would be inactivated in the stomach acid li zhao  hsern 2021 moore goulter  jaykus 2015 however this route of transmission cannot be completely excluded as assessed in a detailed risk assessment study by the ukfood standards agency oakenfull  wilson 2020 the stability of coronaviruses has been studied in several types of waters table 4 at room temperature sarscov1 suspended in water stayed detectable for 3 days and was undetectable after 5 days duan et al 2003 another study reported only 2 days persistence and 3 days for complete decay of this virus in both chlorinated and dechlorinated tap water at room temperature wang et al 2005 the human coronavirus hcov229e survived a little longer 6 days with complete decay after 10 days in dechlorinated tap water gundy et al 2009 on the other hand animal coronavirus such as tgev and mcov showed much longer survivability in reagentgrade water at room temperature the infectivity of tgev was detectable for 6 weeks which became undetectable after 7 weeks while mcov stayed detectable for 7 weeks the end of the study period with no complete decay reported casanova et al 2009 many studies have reported higher persistence of several covs in water and liquids at lower temperatures as compared to higher temperatures table 4 for instance the infectivity of sarscov1 in dechlorinated tap water was detectable for 14 days at 4c but for only 2 days at 20c wang et al 2005 similarly hcov229e decayed completely after 10 days in dechlorinated water at 23c but was detectable at least for 25 days at 4c in the same type of water gundy et al 2009 another study showed that after 49 days the tgev completely decayed in reagentgrade water at room temperature 25c while stayed infectious in the same type of water when stored at 4c for the same period the mcov mhv showed similar results in the same study casanova et al 2009 after 2 weeks the titres of lake watersuspended tgev and mhv were reduced by 25 log when stored at 25c but only 12 and 1 log of virus titres respectively were reduced at 4c in the same type of water casanova et al 2009 sarscov2 persisted for 14 7 and 1 day in dulbeccos modified eagle medium dmem at 4c 22c and 37c respectively when the temperature was increased to 56c and 70c the persistence time was dramatically reduced to 10 min and 1 min respectively chin et al 2020 sarscov1 stayed detectable in dmem for 2 hr at 4c 20c and 37c however when storage temperature was increased to 56c 67c and 75c the virus decayed completely after 15 hr 1 hr and 30 min respectively duan et al 2003 another study on sarscov1 in dmem found that the virus stayed detectable after 1 hr at 56c and 65c but decayed completely after 45 min at 75c darnell subbarao feinstone  taylor 2004 likewise merscov stability in dmem decreased with an increase in temperature leclercq batejat burguire  manuguerra 2014 sarscov1 was detectable in minimal essential medium mem for 30 min at 4c while at 56c and 60c it became completely undetectable after 30 min rabenau et al 2005 the decrease in virus infectivity due to an increase in temperature was also reported for animal coronaviruses such as mouse coronavirus mcov or mhv and canine coronavirus ccov in mem and for tgev in hepes buffer laude 1981 saknimit inatsuki sugiyama  yagami 1988 several studies have found that the survivability of coronaviruses in aerosols is affected by environmental conditions particularly temperature and relative humidity for instance the survival of hcov229e in aerosols was studied at two temperatures 6c and 20c and three rh levels low 30 medium 50 high 80 ijaz et al 1985 the high and low rh levels represented the two extremes in indoor atmospheric conditions in the temperate regions in the summer and winter seasons respectively while medium rh reflected the inside atmosphere of climatically controlled buildings the two temperatures were selected to represent the range encountered in late winter and early spring 6c to 20c or in indoor environments 20c the results demonstrated that hcov229e survived longer at 6c than 20c at all rh levels table 1 in addition the aerosolized virus survived for a longer time at medium rh 50 with halflives of 1025 hr and 673 hr at 6 and 20c respectively on the other hand high rh 80 at 20c was found to be the least favourable to the survival of aerosolized virus as it showed only 3 hr halflife at these conditions ijaz et al 1985 the stability of merscov in aerosols for 10 min was studied under 20c40 rh and 20c70rh reflecting average indoor and outdoor environment during winter in the middle east region respectively the results showed that the virus was less stable at higher rh than lower rh van doremalen et al 2013 another study on merscov was carried out at two different environmental conditions 25c 79rh and 38c 24rh mimicking the common office and summer season climates in the middle eastern region at the common office condition low temperature and high rh 63 of the virus retained its infectivity however virus survival drastically decreased 47 survival in the hot and dry air common to the summer season pyankov et al 2018 many studies have shown that the persistence of coronaviruses on surfaces and fomites is affected by temperature and relative humidity in general the available data show that coronaviruses survive longer at low temperatures and low rh table 2 for instance under 8090rh and 95 rh sarscov1 lost 075log and 1 log of its titre respectively on plastic surface at 33c after 1 day while at 38c 2 and 35 log reduction in virus titre was seen chan et al 2011 similar results were observed for merscov on plastic and stainless steel surfaces at 30c the virus decayed completely after 2 days and 1day when the samples were stored at 30 and 80 rh respectively however at 40 rh lower temperature 20c increased the persistence of the virus and delayed its complete decay to 3 days van doremalen et al 2013 the tgev and mcov showed lower persistence on stainless steel under high temperature and high rh after 28 days at 4c tgev titre was reduced by 025 and 3 logs under 20 and 80 rh

respectively when stored at 4c on stainless steel surface at 20c  however 2 and 5 log reduction was seen casanova et al 2010 temperature has also been shown to influence the persistence of coronaviruses in sewage the infectivity of sarscov1 was detectable for 14 days in domestic sewage when it was stored at 4c but for only 2 days at 20c wang et al 2005 in pasteurized settled sewage the infectivity of both porcine coronavirus tgev and mouse coronavirus mcov or mhv was detectable for up to 35 days at 4c but for 21 days only at 25c casanova et al 2009 conformational changes in the spike proteins of covs are essential to enable the fusion of the virion with the host cell weismiller sturman buchmeier fleming and holmes 1990 found that this process is induced in mcov mhv at a ph of 80 on the contrary neutral ph mediated the spike proteins fusion of sarscov1 with the host cell xiao chakraborti dimitrov gramatikoff  dimitrov 2003 procock and garwes 1975 also demonstrated that adsorption penetration uncoating and rna replication of tgev in the host cell was determined by ph in general it has been found that covs are more stable at nearneutral ph as compared to the extreme acidic or alkaline ph sarscov1 suspended in mem completely lost its infectivity after 1 hr exposure to extreme acidic ph 1 and 3 and extreme alkaline ph 12 and 14 regardless of the temperature 4c 25c and 37c however the virus retained its infectivity when stored at ph 5 7 and 9 for 1 hr darnell et al 2004 similarly hcov 229e mhv tgev and ccov showed more stability at slightly acidic to neutral ph 675 than at highly acidic or highly alkaline ph 8 at both low and high temperatures however low temperature 4c increases the stability of these viruses at extreme ph values than at higher temperatures 25c and 37c daniel  talbot 1987 lamarre  talbot 1989 pocock et al 1975 pratelli 2008 sturman ricard  holmes 1990 in contrast to other covs sarscov2 showed higher stability when incubated at room temperature in the transport medium for 1 hr at a wide range of ph values ph 310 chin et al 2020 this finding may help explain the high spread rate of sarscov2 as compared to other human coronaviruses such as sarscov1 and merscov the results presented in the previous sections clearly show that the ability of coronaviruses to survive in aerosols on surfaces and fomites and in suspensions and liquids is affected by temperature and relative humidity in general human and animal covs including sarscov2 showed more persistence under low temperature and low rh these results indicate that the spread of sarscov2 might be seasonally associated with winter and that it might be easier to control the virus spread during the summer months because of the high temperature and high humidity during those months this assumption is supported by the fact that annual epidemics of influenza virus and hcov in temperate climates are usually activated by a sudden drop in outdoor temperatures sundell andersson brittainlong lindh  westin 2016 this is attributed to the lower amount of water vapour that a unit of air can hold at low temperature which means that the air is very dry in terms of the absolute humidity ah and this leads to a reduction in the size of aerosol droplets due to evaporation this prolongs the time when the infectious droplets remain airborne thereby increasing the chance of infecting new hosts harper 1961 on the same principle maintaining high humidity along with indoor heating during winter months might reduce the transmission of these viruses this is attributed to the indoor heating during wintertime which causes a sharp decrease in the rh of the indoor environment and subsequently reduces the size of aerosol particles through evaporation yang  marr 2011 recent epidemiological studies consistently report a strong relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of sarscov2 wang jiang et al 2020 studied the relationship between daily means of temperatures and cumulative numbers of confirmed covid19 cases in the world from january 20 to february 4 2020 they found that temperature can alter the transmission of sarscov2 and suggested that countries and regions with a lower temperature should adopt the strictest control measures to prevent future reversal another study examined the effect of temperature and humidity on the global patterns of early outbreak dynamics of covid19 between january and march 2020 they found a strong impact of temperature and the humidity on the growth rate of covid19 cases across the world the growth rate of covid19 cases peaked at a temperature of 5c and a humidity of 061 kpa in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere during the outbreak month while it decreased in regions that had warmer or colder temperatures ficetola  rubolini 2020 a similar study found that the high covid19 community transmission areas across the world are located along the 3050 n corridor at similar weather patterns of 5c 11c average temperatures with low specific 36 gkg and absolute humidity 47 gm3 sajadi et al 2020 likewise average pressure average temperature minimum temperature and average water vapour pressure were found to be significantly correlated with the incidence of covid19 li et al 2020 another epidemiological modelling study projected recurrent wintertime outbreaks of sarscov2 within the next five years kissler tedijanto goldstein grad  lipsitch 2020 a group of 200 ecological niche models were developed to project monthly variation in climate suitability for spread of sarscov2 throughout a typical climatological year the models showed that temperate warm and cold climates are more suitable to spread of the virus whereas arid and tropical climates are less favourable arajo  naimi 2020 contrary to the aforementioned reports another study reported that there is no evidence for temperaturedependence of the covid19 pandemic jamil alam gojobori  duarte 2020 we think that even if the climate conditions of summer season or warm regions may mitigate the growth rate of covid19 cases no geographical region is immune to this risk since the fast growth rate of covid19 cases has also occurred in some warm climates such as brazil and the philippines therefore strict measures for controlling the spread of the disease remain essential in all areas of the world and the absence of containment actions might lead to severe outbreaks in warm regions too hellewell et al 2020 the international commission on illumination cie classified the ultraviolet radiation into three bands uvc 100280 nm uvb 280315 nm and uva 315400 nm visible light is the region between 400 nm and 780 nm the uvc is known as germicidal uv as it is absorbed by rna and dna bases of the virus thereby causing photochemical fusion of two adjacent pyrimidines and forming covalently linked dimers which then become nonpairing bases perdiz et al 2000 the potential of uvb inducing the formation of pyrimidine dimers is 20100fold lower than that of uvc perdiz et al 2000 dna and rna absorb uva weakly and therefore its effect is much lower than uvc and uvb in the formation of pyrimidine dimers however uva may cause other genetic damage such as oxidation of the bases and strand cleavage through the production of reactive oxygen species ravanat douki  cadet 2001 a few studies have investigated the effect of artificial ultraviolet radiation uvr on coronaviruses table 5 sarscov1 was completely inactivated 6 log reduction in mem following 1hr exposure to uvc 260nm irradiance of 90 wcm2 at 83 cm exposure distance duan et al 2003 in a comparative study 6 min exposure to uvc 254nm irradiance of 4016 wcm2 completely inactivated 55 log of sarscov1 however 15 min exposure to uva 365nm irradiance of 2133 wcm2 did not show any virucidal efficacy against this virus darnell et al 2004 a third study demonstrated 53 and 63 log reduction of sarscov1 following exposure to 134 wcm2 of uvc 254 for 15 and 60 min respectively without complete inactivation of the virus kariwa fujii  takashima 2006 another study showed a 48 log reduction in ccov after 3 days of exposure to a very weak irradiance 71 wcm2 of uvc at 4 cm exposure distance pratelli 2008 it is known that optical radiation from the sun is the only natural source of uvr that reaches the earth through the atmosphere however only twothirds of the energy from the sun that impinges on the atmosphere penetrates to the ground level the uvr comprises 5 of the total radiation received at the surface of the earth this component is extremely important in various biological processes solar iarc 1992 based on the virucidal efficacy of artificial uv radiation presented above and because there is no consensus on the suggested correlation between climate temperature and covid19 spread backer 2020 investigated the correlation between irradiance or sunlight and covid19 spread this observational study revealed that sun irradiance reduces the transmission of sarscov2 for example covid19 epidemic exploded during the darkest january in over 10 years in wuhan bcker 2020 on the other hand the available experimental data do not support this suggestion despite the reported virucidal efficacy of uvc its radiation from sun is completely filtered by the atmosphere and it does not reach the earths surface who 2020f in addition 95 of the suns uv radiation reaching the earths surface is uva who 2020f which has no virucidal efficacy table 4 on the other hand the uvb of the sun partially penetrates and reaches the earths surface and its influence on other viruses has been reported elghorr horsburgh  norval 1998 hart reid  hart 1993 karmer bos  teunissen 1995 sagripanti  lytle 2007 therefore studying the efficacy of sunlight and uvb on sarscov2 and the spread of covid19 might provide some explanation on the observed correlation between sun irradiance and covid19 spread the facts that the human coronaviruses hcov229e sarscov1 and sarscov2 can remain infectious in aerosols for 3 to 16 hr and can survive at room temperature and rh of 65 for a few days suggest possible airborne transmission of sarscov2 therefore stringent preventive measures should be taken by people in highrisk regions and in healthcare settings to avoid this possible route of transmission these findings support the cdc and who recommendations of covering faces by respirators or surgical masks or even by cloth covers in public during the covid19 epidemic the persistence of sarscov1 and sarscov2 was significantly low on copper latex and less porous fabrics as compared to other surfaces such as metals stainless steel and zinc glass and more porous fabrics this information might be helpful in designing methods to significantly decrease viral transmission in healthcare buildings and other areas at risk the reported survival of sarscov1 and animal coronaviruses tgev and mcov in water and sewage along with diarrhoea and gastroenteritis symptoms linked to sarscov2 infection indicates the possibility of foodborne and waterborne transmission of sarscov2 this poses additional risk in developing countries because of their use of sewagepolluted waters for irrigation in addition to having poor water treatment systems although there are no confirmed foodborne or waterborne cases of sarscov2 so far it is very important to devise methods that can concentrate small amounts of this virus from large amounts of water wastewater and foods so adequate surveillance and epidemiological studies can be undertaken the longer survival of covs at low temperatures and low relative humidity explains the observed peaks of covid19 cases during the cold and dry climates in temperate regions of the world and explains the predicted seasonality of the virus spread by epidemiological models additionally a sun irradiancedependent spread of sarscov2 has been suggested in an observational study although the efficacy of the artificial uvc against sarscov1 has been reported it does not support the suggested influence of suns irradiance on sarscov2 spread because all natural uvc radiated by the sun is blocked by the atmosphere and does not reach the earth since artificial uva showed no effect on sarscov1 it does not support the suggested sun irradiancedependent sarscov2 spread because the major type of natural solar uv radiation that reaches the earth is uva a few studies have shown virucidal efficacy of uvb on viruses other than covs however experimental studies on the efficacy of artificial uvb on sarscov2 are required to provide an explanation of the observed sun irradiancedepended covid19 spread the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any

restrictions the virus spread rapidly beyond mainland china by april 7 more than 14 million cases had been reported in 182 countries and regions our understanding of the progression and severity of the outbreak has been limited by constraints on testing capabilities in most countries testing has been limited to a small fraction of the population as a result the number of confirmed positive cases may grossly understate the population infection rate given the large numbers of mild and asymptomatic cases that may go untested 1 2 3 4 5  moreover testing has often been targeted to specific subgroups such as individuals who were symptomatic or who were previously exposed to the virus whose infection probability differs from that in the overall population 6 7  1 given this sample selection bias it is impossible to infer overall disease prevalence from the share of positive cases among the tested individuals a further challenge to our understanding of the spread of outbreak has been the wide variation in per capita testing across jurisdictions due to different protocols and testing capabilities for example as of april 7 south korea had conducted three times more tests than the united states on a per capita basis 8 9  large differences in testing rates also exist at the subnational level for example per capita testing in the state of new york was nearly two times higher than in neighboring new jersey 8  because the severity of sample selection bias depends on the extent of testing these disparities create large uncertainty regarding the relative disease prevalence across jurisdictions and may contribute to the wide differences in estimated case fatality rates 10 11  in this study we implemented a procedure that corrects observed infection rates among tested individuals for non-random sampling to calculate population disease prevalence a large body of empirical work in economics has been devoted to the problem of sample selection and researchers have developed estimation procedures to 1 notable exceptions include the universal testing of passengers on the diamond princess cruise ship and an ongoing population-based test project in iceland correct for non-random sampling 12 13 14 15 16 17  our methodology builds on these insights to correct observed infection rates for non-random selection into covid-19 testing our procedure compares how the observed infection rate varied as a larger share of the population was tested and uses this gradient to infer disease prevalence in the overall population because investments in testing capacity may respond endogenously to local disease conditions however model identification requires that we find a source of variation in testing rates covid-19 that is unrelated to the underlying population prevalence to this end we relied on high frequency day-to-day changes in completed tests across us states which were primarily driven by immediate supply-side limitations rather than the more gradual evolution of local disease prevalence we used this procedure to correct for selection bias in observed infection rates to calculate population disease prevalence across us states from march 31 to april 7 to evaluate population disease prevalence we developed a simple selection model for covid-19 testing and used the framework to link observed rates of positive tests to population disease prevalence we considered a stable population denoting a and b as the numbers of sick and healthy individuals respectively let p n denote the probability that a sick person is tested and q n the probability that a healthy person is tested given a total number of tests n thus we have cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a

combining both equations we have we used the fact that the ratio of negative to positive tests is much larger than one to make the following approximation 2 given a change in the number of tests conducted in a particular population n 1 to n 2  equation 2 implies the following change in the share of positive tests our empirical model was derived from equation 3 we used information on testing across states i on day t to estimate the following equation where n it is the number of tests on day t s it is the share of positive tests and pop i is the state population the term u it is an error which we assumed to follow a gaussian distribution with mean zero and unknown variance we restricted the model to a cubic approximation of the function in equation 4 since higher order terms were found to be statistically insignificant this approximation is supported by graphical evidence depicted below we estimated equation 4 by maximum likelihood for model identification we required that day-to-day changes in the number of tests be uncorrelated with the error term u it  in practice this assumption implies that daily changes in underlying population disease prevalence cannot be systematically related to day-to-day changes in testing our identification assumption is supported by at least three pieces of evidence first severe constraints on state testing capacity have caused a significant backlog in cases so that changes in the number of daily tests primarily reflects changes in local capacity rather than changes in demand for testing second because our analysis focuses on high frequency day-to-day changes in outcomes there is limited scope for large evolution in underlying disease prevalence finally in robustness exercises we augmented the basic model to include state fixed effects thereby allowing for state-specific exponential growth in underlying disease prevalence from one day to the next these additional controls did not alter the main empirical findings to

instead the patterns suggest that states that expanded testing capacity more broadly were better able to track population prevalence and population prevalence the similarity between these two series is notable given that our estimates were derived from an entirely different source of variation from the cumulative case counts nevertheless observed case counts do not perfectly predict overall population prevalence for example despite similar rates of reported positive tests michigan had roughly twice as many per capita infections as rhode island these differences can partly be explained by the fact that nearly two percent of the population in rhode island had been tested by april 12 whereas fewer than one percent had been tested in michigan together these findings suggest that differences in state-level policies towards covid-19 testing may mask important differences in underlying disease prevalence the high proportion of asymptomatic and mild cases coupled with limitations

apply sir models to forecast current infection rates this approach requires fewer assumptions regarding the underlying parameter values nevertheless because these models scale up observed deaths to estimate population infections small differences in the assumed case fatality will have substantial effects on the results this poses a challenge for estimation given that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the case fatality rate which may vary widely across regions due to local demographics and environmental conditions 27 28 29 30 31  moreover to the extent that there is significant undercounting in the number of covid-19 related deaths 32 33  these estimates may fail to capture the full extent of population infection in this paper we developed a new methodology to

associations between obesity prevalence and coronavirus disease covid-19 cases and related deaths in the united states ning zhang lorraine cordeiro s zhenhua liu  the coronavirus disease 2019  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 that was most recently discovered quickly evolved into a global pandemic studies suggested that obesity was a major risk factor for its hospitalization and severity of symptoms this study investigated the associations between obesity prevalence with overall covid-19 cases and related deaths across states in the united states general regression and chisquare tests were used to examine those associations the analyses indicated that obesity prevalence  across states were negatively associated with covid-19 cases p  00448 and related deaths p  00181 with a decrease of 158 cases100k population and 13 deaths100k for every 5 increase of the obesity prevalence when the states were divided based on the median of obesity prevalence 309 into a group of states with low obesity prevalence and a group with high obesity prevalence both the cases 671 vs 416 cases100k population and deaths 39 vs 21 deaths100k population were significantly different p  0001 across groups these findings provided important information for the relationship between the dual pandemic threats of obesity and covid-19 these results should not currently be considered as an indication that obesity is a protective factor for covid-19 and would rather be used as a warning of the public advice that obese people is more vulnerable to covid-19 infection which may lead to a false safety message probably given to people with normal body weight  the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a new infectious disease most recently discovered with the first case reported in december 2019 1  it was resulted from the infection of a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and was named as covid-19 by the world health organization who on march 11 2020  it is now classified as a global pandemic 2  as of may 31 2020 there were 6 million cases and 371000 related deaths worldwide with 1788000 cases and over 100000 deaths in the united states 5  the most common symptom of covid-19 is fever often accompanied by other symptoms including but not limited to cough loss of appetite fatigue shortness of breath and sputum production 6 7 8  obesity defined as bmi of 30 kgm 2 or greater has experienced an unprecedented rise in recent decades in the united states 9 10 and also in many other industrialized and urban areas in developing countries throughout the world 11 12  it has reached an epidemic level in us and a further increase from the current 13 of the population to 50 by 2030 is projected 13 14  obesity is associated with increased risks of developing various health problems including type 2 diabetes mellitus t2m cardiovascular diseases and stroke hypertension and various cancers 15 16  most people with obesity show signs of a low-grade chronic inflammation 17  which plays as a critical underlying mechanism responsible for those obesity-associated medical complications 18  studies have shown that covid-19 poses a particular risk to people living with preexisting complications data from a study in china indicated that the fatality of patients with a labconfirmed covid-19 is 23 but the

it is not surprising that many recent studies show that obesity is associated with more severe symptoms and increased intensive care admissions of covid-19 patients 20 21 22 23 24  most recent studies showed that obesity especially morbid obesity with bmi  40 kgm 2  is an independent risk factor of hospitalization severity of symptoms and intensive care admissions of covid-19 25  however this apparent evidence contradicts with the obesity paradox theory -obesity and morbid obesity were associated with a lower mortality rate in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 26 27  the current study examined how obesity prevalence influence the overall infection of sars-cov-2 and covid-19 related deaths at a population level our analysis demonstrated negative associations between obesity prevalence and coronavirus disease covid-19 cases and related deaths in the united states these results provided interesting and important information for policy makers to combat the pandemic of covid-19 we examined the incidence and mortality data in the united states from three different resources the covidtracking project covidtracking httpscovidtrackingcom the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncov and the coronavirus resource center at john hopkins university jnu httpscoronavirusjhuedu we used the data retrieved from these resources

released by the us census bureau population division httpswwwcensusgov we focused on data from 50 states plus the district of columbia without including other us territories statistical analyses were carried out using general linear regression and chi-square tests four different regression models were performed to examine the associations between obesity prevalence and covid-19 cases and related deaths our first model examined the crude associations between obesity prevalence and covid-19 cases and deaths without adjusting for any confounding factors since our most recent study 28  as well as other studies 29 30  indicated that sunlight and low vitamin d levels are possible risk factors for covid-19 our second model adjusted for a geographic factor using latitude as an index with consideration of the significant variations of covid-19 testing rates across the states our third model also included the test rate as confounding factor with further consideration of population density especially new york city as the epicenter of covid-19 in us we further adjusted for population in our fourth model we adjusted for population rather the population density as we realize that even though new york city has a high population density but the population density for the whole state is not high instead new york is among the states with a high population therefore using the population as confounding factor is appropriate all data are presented in the supplementary file table s1  statistical analyses were performed using sas program version 94 sas institute cary nc usa

to the high testing rate as positive rate of testing in the states with low obesity prevalence were even higher p  001 than those states with high obesity prevalence 117 vs 91 fig 3d  the high

factor for the hospitalization severity of symptoms and intensive care admissions of covid-19 20 21 22  and it is particularly the case for young to middle age people under 60 years of age 23 24  these studies have led to the public advices that obese people especially those with bmi  40 kgm 2  are more vulnerable to covid-19 comparing to people with normal bmi  25 kgm 2 20 31  however there are also publications reporting that there are lack of clarity for this guidance of obesity and covid-19 26 32  previous studies showed that obesity was associated with a decrease of mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and it was referred to as the obesity paradox 27 33  the claim that obesity is an independent risk factor for covid-19 is apparently disagreement with the obesity paradox theory 26  the pathophysiological mechanism underlying this theory is that obesity represents a preconditioned chronic pro-inflammatory status which creates a protective environment that limited the detrimental effects from a more aggressive second hit 26 34  the present study reported a negative association between obesity prevalence and covid-19 outbreak our study focused on how obesity prevalence influence the possibility of overall infection and lethality of covid-19 at a population level it is different from the aforementioned studies that mainly focused on the influence of obesity on the hospitalization severity of symptoms  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display

findings represent the first report showing a potential negative relationship between obesity prevalence and covid-19 cases and related deaths these findings though counterintuitive are mechanistically in agreement with the aforementioned obesity paradox theory in addition these results may also reflect the influence of the lifestyle associated with obesity people one of the major contributions for obesity is sedentary lifestyle with limited out-door exercise 35  which is protective for the highly transmissible covid-19 we acknowledge that this study has limitations a there are large variations of the covid-19 cases and related mortalities across the states which reduced the accuracy of the estimate b the number of casesstate is heavily affected by the number of tests which are unequally performed across the states however even with highly varied test rates across states the higher test ratestate 5745 vs 4574100k fig 3c  together with a higher positive ratetests 117 vs 91 fig 3d  for the states with low obesity prevalence collectively suggested the higher prevalence of covid-19 in those states comparing to states with high obesity prevalence also even after adjusting for the test rate the results remains significant model ii c covid-19 is a highly transmissible disease and population density in large cities are a critical risk factor even though in our model iii we adjusted for the population we recognized the influence from the new york city as the epicenter nevertheless the present study discovered interesting negative associations between obesity prevalence and covid-19 cases and related deaths these findings may possibly be explained by the obesity paradox theory and the sedentary lifestyle with limited out-door activity that is potentially protective to covid-19 infection in obese people in conclusion the present study observed interesting negative associations between obesity prevalence with covid-19 cases and related mortalities these

significant public health strategies have been implemented by the authorities to contain the outbreak nationwide nevertheless however the number of cases is still rising dramatically here we aim to describe a comprehensive and epidemiological study of all cases diagnosed in iraq by 24 may 2020 most of the cases were recorded in baghdad followed by basra and najaf about 45 of the patients were female with 31 deaths of the total cases and 55 were male with 68 deaths of the total cases most cases are between the ages of 20-59 years old and 30-39 years are the most affected range 19 approximately 8 of cases are children under 10 years old iraq has shown a cure rate lower than those reported by iran turkey and jordan and higher than saudi arabia and kuwait healthcare workers represented about 5 of the total confirmed cases these findings enable us to understand covid-19 epidemiology and prevalence in iraq that can alert the our community to the risk of this novel

426 deaths one possible explanation for this increase could be that during this period 24 may-10 june people celebrated eid al-fitr after fasting in the holly ramadan which exhibited many gatherings for all family members and friends another possible explanation is that authorities has generally relaxed enforcement of the stringent curfews and movement restrictions which have been in place for the past several weeks partial lockdowns are currently in force in order to limit the spreading of the virus its worth notice that the total cumulative number of covid-19 cases increasing significantly so this is could be a sign that a country will faces a second wave of virus infections furthermore the number of confirmed cases varies across provinces the highest  cc-by-nc-nd 40

large population with many factories and shopping malls that could not follow the instructions of the health authorities to contain the spread of the virus the current study also found 54 of confirmed cases were males and 45 were females male female ratio  121 in addition the fatality rates were higher in male 68 than female 31 these data seem to be consistent with other studies which found that men with covid-19 infection are more likely to have serious consequences and death 29 30  differences between males and females in getting infection with covid-19 remain unclear countries like italy scotland switzerland sweden and belgium have reported a higher percentage of cases among women according to global health 5050 31  while the rates of infection among men appear to be much higher in iran costa rica thailand greece pakistan and mexico in our study data showed all ages are susceptible to infected with covid-19 and the highest range was between 30-39 years old consistent with other studies 32 33 34  this research found that fatality rates were higher in patients with  60 years old covid-19 negative outcomes tend to be related to comorbidity including diabetes obesity cardiovascular and lung diseases these factors may account for high death rates in older patients despite this the majority of provinces apart from baghdad showed promising cure rates as our healthcare workers continue to fight covid-19 they get infected with the virus the authorities start to be concerned that this could make a significant contribution to increasing the number of cases among healthcare workers and could then transmit the virus to their families and loved ones overall 207 healthcare workers were tested positive for covid-19 representing 5 of the total confirmed cases in iraq what stands out in the data is that 78 of these cases were in baghdad najaf and basra cure and fatality rates have shown variation when comparing iraq with neighboring countries iran reported the highest rates of cure and fatality at the same time this inconsistency may be due to the fact that each country has different management protocols case reporting and the number of tests carried out on each day some countries may not report mild cases if they do not need treatment or if they have been treated at home there are some limitations to this study first we were unable to evaluate the clinical characteristics of confirmed cases since these data were not accessible at the moment of analysis second we did not have any information as to whether or not these patients especially elderly patients have comorbidities a further study with more focus on the comorbidities and the severity of covid-19 in elderly is therefore suggested taken together these findings contribute to our understanding of the epidemiology and prevalence of covid-19 in iraq in several ways which may be useful and provide a basis for future studies  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made

province of china occurred in december 2019 1  shortly the cause was identified as a novel coronavirus 2  which resembles severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and now is named sars-cov-2 3 4  as of february 23 2020 78811 laboratory-confirmed cases and 2462 deaths have been reported globally and the vast majority of the cases and deaths has happened in china 5  with a series of measures such as knockdown of 13 cities in hubei province and stringent travel restrictions throughout the nation the disease spread is slowing down however china still reports quite a few new cases and new deaths every day and the epidemic may rebound as people return to workplace after extended spring festival holiday meanwhile the number of infected patients is increasing in other countries especially in south korea japan and italy 5  better early warning and response systems should be established to avoid such disasters traditional surveillance systems including those used by chinese centers for disease control and prevention cdc typically rely on clinical virological and microbiological data submitted by physicians and laboratories due to time and resource constraints a lack of operational knowledge of reporting systems and regulations in these systems substantial lags between an outbreak event and its report are common 6  on average the reporting delay is around two weeks for traditional surveillance systems 6 7  with the popularization of internet and smartphones an increasing number of people use social media such as twitter and facebook to share information an event may have been posted in social media for several days or even months before its report through health institutions and  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a

data from wechat may be amazing to early detect disease outbreak this may have an advantage especially for detecting outbreaks in china considering the population of wechat users previous studies used search query data including baidu index to monitor the activity of emerging infectious diseases 15 16 17  as far as we know this is the first time to use wechat data in this field as the current study indicated using wechat data may perform better than using baidu search query data in early detecting the outbreak of a new disease because people may communicate first in wechat in the times of wechat as a lifestyle of chinese the main limitation of the study lies on its retrospective nature the outbreak is a solitary case using wechat data to early detect outbreaks like this should be valued in the future in addition history data of wechat index 90 days ago is unavailable and how the index is calculated is not open in summary using data of wechat a chinese social media may early detect the sars-cov-2 outbreak in china in 2019 if wechat index for the keyword feidian were monitored the outbreak would be detected 2 weeks earlier future studies can prospectively gather and analyze data from

phase of the pandemic kaori muto isamu yamamoto miwako nagasu mikihito tanaka koji wada toshiyuki ojima   a pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in china and first officially reported on 31 december 2019 the world health organization who announced a name for the new coronavirus disease covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 on 11 february 20201 since then covid-19 has been spreading throughout the world and a rapid increase in deaths has been reported in many countries as of 28 march a total of 571678 cases and 26494 deaths have been confirmed2 one study has estimated that there will be a total of 81114 deaths from covid-19 over the next four months in the us alone3 the number of covid-19 cases and deaths in japan is gradually increasing with 1499 cases including 60 critical cases and 49 deaths reported as of 28 march4 several small clusters of infected groups have been increasing in urban areas including those in hospitals and nursing homes in addition to cases with unlinked infections nevertheless the total number of deaths and severely ill patients has been comparatively small especially relative to the countrys population size as of 28 march the total number of deaths was 9136 in italy 4858 in spain and 1243 in the united states5 furthermore the trend of the increase is not sharp the reasons for this mild trend have been questioned outside japan6 over the past few decades japan has not experienced any serious damage from new infectious diseases such as sars severe acute respiratory syndrome mers middle east respiratory syndrome or the ebola virus although japan experienced the 2009 h1n1 influenza flu pandemic the rate of deaths per 100000 population was 016 as of the end of may 2010 which was the lowest worldwide ironically this history of escapes might delay the establishment of the emergency operation headquarters in japan the urgent expansion of polymerase chain reaction pcr tests which must be the frontline response to the novel coronavirus outbreak has faced time-consuming obstacles in japan a recent revision of the act on special measures for pandemic influenza and new infectious diseases preparedness and response allows the prime minister to declare a state of emergency for the outbreak but under the current legislation no central or local government can enforce lockdowns such as those undertaken in other countries under such limitations the current goal of the japanese government is to avoid an explosive increase in patients that would exceed the limit of intensive or critical care units in hospitals in urban areas to meet this goal the government policy consists of three strategies early detection of clusters and rapid response enhancement of the early diagnosis of patients and intensive care for severely affected patients and strengthening of the universal healthcare system and public behavioral change7 with regard to the first and second strategies the ministry of health labour and welfare mhlw strongly promotes contact tracing social distancing and pneumonia surveillance under the direction of the patient cluster countermeasure group in the mhlw headquarters for novel coronavirus disease control regional public health centers conduct the contact tracing asking infected persons and their close contacts to maintain social distancing for 14 days and allocating available hospital beds or hospital wards in designated local communities to covid-19 patients in clinical settings the large number of computed tomography ct scanners in japan 11149 per million population8 supports physicians in investigating suspicious pneumonia cases in the absence of conducting massive pcr tests in the population this policy approach might lead to a relatively slower increase in the number of cases and deaths regarding the third strategy public behavioral change by the middle of february 2020 the mhlw encouraged the japanese public to practise frequent handwashing and coughing etiquette using a handkerchief or sleeve instead of hands to catch a cough or sneeze furthermore the mhlw had prioritized access to healthcare for elderly people people suffering from fatigue or shortness of breath and people with underlying health conditions the mhlw had also asked the public younger than 65 years old not to visit clinics for at least four days if they experience cold symptoms or a fever of 375c or higher until 8 may 20209 this restriction might be a shock to japanese citizens who are typically allowed free access to clinics and hospitals in analyses of contact tracing it was found that one infected person tended to infect more than one other person at locations with certain characteristics on 24 february the expert meeting on the control of novel coronavirus infection asked the public to refrain from attending places involving close face-to-face contact between people within an arms length of each other in conversations and similar interactions for more than a given length of time in crowds since then but prior to other similar slogans that have appeared around the world the government has been campaigning for avoidance of these situations with the slogan avoid the overlapping 3 cs closed spaces with poor ventilation crowded places with many people nearby close-contact settings such as close-range conversations in addition to regular ventilation and wiping of shared surfaces such as door handles knobs and bed fences and goods with diluted household chlorine bleach avoid the overlapping 3 cs has been the core and unique message against covid-19 in japan this study examines three research questions 1 how do japanese citizens especially those who are relatively active in terms of work and life activities and therefore have increased opportunities to spread infections to others including older people vulnerable to the covid-19 implement the governments three cs precautionary measures 2 how effective are these requests from the government 3 who has changed their daily precautionary behaviour and who has not several previous studies have investigated changes in precautionary behavior against the coronavirus for example an online survey conducted on 29 january of 3083 mainland chinese respondents revealed that adults living in urban areas had stronger awareness of the issue than those in rural areas 727 vs 661 p000110 another online survey conducted between 23 february and 2 march in the us n  2986 and the uk n  2988 showed that adult residents have a good understanding of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms although they also have important misconceptions and discriminatory attitudes toward people of east asian ethnicity due to covid-19s origin in china11 the latest study in italy clarified the three types of attitude to covid-19 among italian citizens people who trust authority and choose isolation fatalists who are keen on social media and uninformed youth 12 the gallup international association also recently conducted a snap poll in 28 countries including 1115 japanese participants asking about precautionary procedures and their findings indicated that 71 percent of japanese participants had adopted more frequent handwashing13 what is still unclear however is the trigger for behavioural change around covid-19 and who is more actively implementing prevention measures in the gallup survey the response period and sample attribution are also unclear furthermore this survey is not necessarily informative for policymaking as it does not reveal who is not implementing prevention measures using a large sample of cross-sectional survey data this study investigates how and at what point japanese citizens changed their precautionary behaviour in this situation in which the government has only requested rather than mandated their cooperation this study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted via an online platform of an online research company macromill inc japan from a pool of approximately 12 million registered individuals residing in japan we recruited a total of 11342 males and females aged from 20 to 64 years we limit our sample to those under 65 years of age in order to focus on the behavioural changes of the working-age population who tend to be relatively active and have more opportunities to spread infections to others in the recruitment process for this study quota sampling was conducted so that the sample distributions among gender male or female age group 20s 30s 40s 50s or 60s and employment status regular employee non-regular employee self-employed or not working were representative of the japanese population based on statistics from the labor force survey ministry of internal affairs and communications our survey was conducted between 26 and 28 march 2020 we originally determined the target number of participants as 11000 and accepted participants until the target number was reached due to the timing of closure the final number of participants exceeded the target please note that we automatically eliminated duplicate answers from a single respondent and that there was a monetary incentive for participation in addition to providing individual characteristics the participants were asked to answer 11 items rating their prevention measures against novel coronavirus infections such as social distancing and coughing etiquette on a scale of 1 to 5 thus after summarizing demographic characteristics based on the total male and female and under-40 and over-40 categories we aggregate and compare the proportion of participants who have been taking those prevention measures the participants were also asked what kind of events caused them to change their behaviours and rated the reliability and frequency of consulting of 10 information sources about the coronavirus on a scale of 1 to 5 thus we calculate and compare the frequency and reliability by information source next to detect factors associated with behavioural change the participants were also asked about their drinking and smoking habits personality traits were measured by the five factor personality questionnaire ten-item personality inventory tipi 14 the five personality traits assessed by tipi are extraversion agreeableness conscientiousness emotional stability and openness to experiences we estimate a logit model where the dependent variable is a dummy indicating 1 if the participant chose not at all or not true to the question do you avoid the three overlapping cs and where independent variables are individual characteristics we analyzed the data using statamp version 160 for mac statacorp college station tx united states our survey falls outside the scope of the japanese governments ethical guidelines for medical and health research involving human subjects and there are no national guidelines in japan for social and behavioural research therefore our study was carried out in accordance with the ethical principles for sociological research of the japan sociological society which do not require ethical reviews all survey participants gave their consent to participate in the anonymous online survey by macromill inc the authors did not obtain any personal information about the participants after being informed about the purposes of the study and their right to quit the survey participants agreed to participate they were provided with the option i dont want to respond for all questions completion of the entire questionnaire was considered to indicate participant consent the characteristics of the sample both as a whole and separated by gender male or female or age under or over 40 years old are summarized in table 1 the total sample size is 11342 with almost equal gender distribution gender and age distribution are proportional to that of the japanese population university or college graduates constituted about 5060 percent of respondents about half of the total sample is composed of regular employees usually indefinite and full-time employees about a quarter of respondents had a household income of 45 million yen in the survey the participants were asked to answer to the question have you taken any measures to prevent novel coronavirus infections or outbreaks table 2 shows a variety of prevention measures taken aggregating a proportion of the participants who answered very true and true for each prevention measure looking at the first four prevention measures which have been continuously requested by the japanese government and the expert meeting on control of novel coronavirus infection it was found that 80 percent have attempted to avoid the overlapping three cs of the total 57 percent have attempted avoid conversations or shouting in close proximity which was a relatively low figure among the three cs looking next at the fifth prevention measure more than 85 percent of all participants reported practising social distancing by avoiding mass gatherings regarding gender and age differences more females than males and more older than younger participants are supportive of social distancing as shown by the differences in the confidence intervals regarding hygiene practices frequent handwashing is conducted by about 86 percent of all about 91 percent of female and about 88 percent of over-40 participants coughing etiquette was implemented by 77 percent of the participants many also answered that they have avoided going out when ill with a cold as for the measures to strengthen individual immunity around 70 percent of the participants reported getting sufficient rest and sleep or eating a nutritious diet again focusing on gender and age differences prevention measures are conducted more often by females and older people however regardless of gender and age about 40 percent of participants have prepared consultation and transportation methods to use in the event they become ill to explore the triggers of the behavioural changes and preparedness observed above the participants were asked what was the most important event influencing these actions the responses are summarized in fig 1 the figure shows that about 23 percent of the participants cited the infection aboard the diamond princess cruise ship15 that occurred around early february 2020 when there were still few domestic cases the diamond princess is a british-registered cruise ship on which an 80-year-old passenger from hong kong tested positive for covid-19 on 1 february 2020 because the ship was in japanese waters it was quarantined in february 2020 for nearly a month with about 3700 passengers and crew on board other participants noted events from the end of february including the alert from the expert meeting 56 percent the statement of emergency by the governor of hokkaido northern island of japan 74 percent and the request by the prime minister to not attend mass gatherings 78 percent the next large trigger was the request by the prime minister for nationwide school closures in japan on 28 february 2020 about 14 percent finally worldwide outbreak around early march 22 percent also attracted participants attention to explore what kinds of information affected their behavioural change and preparedness the survey asked participants to report the frequency at which they consult certain sources about the novel coronavirus infection and to rate the reliability of the information source as they perceive it the results are summarized in table 3 table 3 shows that almost 90 percent receive information from tv news programs and internet news sites and that about 50 percent trust such information mainstream scientists have expressed annoyance at the fear-mongering on tv talk and variety shows and these formats are slightly favoured but considered less credible among the public meanwhile information from the central and local government received by 60 percent including the prime minister and the expert meeting is relatively trusted by the participants 50 percent among official sources the local government is the most trusted newspapers national and local are read by only about 42 percent of the participants and about 48 percent answered that they trust information from newspapers looking at the differences in gender and age females tend to seek more information and trust it more than males except for the information from newspapers participants over 40 years old tend to access and trust the information from tv newspapers and officials more than those under 40 years old do while young people often seek and trust news from the internet and sns apps as we confirmed in table 2 more than 80 percent of the participants have been implementing social distancing measures and most japanese citizens seem to be exhibiting some behavioural change to prevent coronavirus infections however this also means that about 20 percent may not be conducting sufficient prevention measures to detect what kind of individuals are included in the group not conducting prevention measures we conducted a multivariate analysis table 4 shows the estimation results of the multivariate logit model all the variables in the first column in table 4 were included as independent variables like the other tables table 4 shows the results based on the total male and female and under-40 and over-40 categories the number shown in the table is an odds ratio so the estimates that are significantly higher than 1 indicate a higher tendency to not conduct proper social distancing looking at the estimation results in table 4 males people in their 20s and unmarried people exhibit significantly higher odds ratios indicating that these groups tend not to conduct preventive social distancing although work status is not generally associated with this prevention measure females regular employees and non-regular employees tended to exhibit higher odds ratios than self-employed or unemployed people regarding household annual income the lowest group less than 2000k jpy has significantly higher odds ratio for the total female and under-40 categories higher odds ratios for not conducting social distancing are associated with drinking for males and smoking for females furthermore those with higher extraversion scores also tend to exhibit significantly higher odds ratio in many cases while conscientiousness and agreeableness are associated with lower odds ratio in most cases before this survey was conducted the request by the japanese government for self-restraint in avoiding mass gatherings had become an issue for example on 22 march 2020 the k-1 grand prix a martial arts event was held despite the ministers and local governors pleas for restraint and 6500 participants were packed into the saitama super arena on 23 march more than 50000 gathered in sendai to see the olympic flame which had recently arrived from greece16 we asked the participants whether they supported this policy approach as shown in table 5 about 29 percent of participants support the idea that the government should now allow mass gatherings males tend to support allowing mass gatherings more than females on the other hand 65 percent supported government limitations on movement in addition to self-restraint in avoiding mass gatherings in order to shorten the period of the pandemic there are no significant differences among gender and age categories for this question under circumstances in which there is no enforced ban on mass gathering or travelling beyond the home region our findings indicate that a large portion of japanese citizens seem to be implementing proper prevention measures on their own before the end of march 2020 we found that more than three-quarters of the survey participants have taken some preventive actions including social distancing handwashing coughing etiquette and strengthening immunity because the previous empirical studies did not include developed countries like japan 17 there is little scientific evidence that japanese people prefer cleanliness and tend to wash their hands relatively more frequently than other countries in japanese communities water facilities for handwashing with soap and hand sanitizers are normally placed various public places such as train stations and supermarkets moreover handwashing became a regular practice at home and school through post-war education18 in general japanese people have developed the discipline of washing their hands before eating meals and after using the toilet it is also well known that japanese people greet others with a bow instead of a handshake kiss or hug this cultural behavior implies that the frequency of body contact among japanese people may be lower than those in cultures with more tactile forms of greeting during hay fever season japanese citizens regularly wear surgical-style masks for prevent symptoms wearing a mask may be a less popular preventive measure than some of the others in this study due to shortages of these products these already-habitual practices may be aiding behavioural changes among japanese citizens during these unusual times we also found that in the survey more than half of the participants had not prepared access to consultation centres or transportation methods in the event they become ill implying that they had not planned for the possibility of contracting covid-19 we must advise the public to prepare for such an event to talk to family and close friends about unexpected advanced care planning and to imagine not having access to a ventilator or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at the severe stage it was also found that one of the main motivations for behavioural change was the infection aboard the diamond princess cruise ship in early february 2020 at that time only a few cases of domestic infection had been reported in japan but news of the quarantine and positive test results among the passengers was broadcasted daily this may have contributed to japanese citizens changing their mindset and behaviour toward precautionary measures earlier than in europe and the us the sudden request by the prime minister for nationwide school closures in the end of february might also have been an effective measure for changing the mindsets of japanese citizens toward prevention even though this move was scientifically questioned and confusing to the public especially to single parents and double-income households our survey shows that information from the expert meeting and centrallocal governments including the prime minister are relatively trusted by survey participants the expert meeting and centrallocal government have held frequent press conferences to clarify the tentative scientific risks and encourage citizens to conduct prevention measures such crisis communication attempts may have caused behavioural changes in japanese citizens the most trusted resource in this study was information from the local government which was a hopeful result as the countermeasures against the virus are decided and conducted at the local level in the past when japan experienced natural disasters such as earthquakes typhoons and tsunamis the local governments contributed to providing timely and organized information to disadvantaged residents through the government alert system based on those experiences it may be important that for local governments to provide information or predictions about covid-19 through these systems regarding the information from newspapers it is problematic that although about half of the people say they trust newspapers not everyone accesses them people may be inclined instead to use electronic-based media which is easier to access despite the overall trend toward behavioural change however the results also show that about 20 percent of the participants are reluctant to implement proper prevention measures the statistical analysis indicates that those people are typically male younger under 30 years old unmarried and in lower-income households and have a drinking or smoking habit and a higher extraversion score to prevent the spread of infection in japan it is imperative to address these individuals and encourage their behavioral change in various ways that will reach and move them it is notable that approximately 65 percent of the participants support stricter countermeasures such as limitation of movement as we mentioned in the introduction as of yet the government has not issued mandatory stay-at-home orders or offered financial aid to those affected by such measures the current requests from centrallocal governments are not legally binding and individuals and businesses must arrange financial compensation independent of the government we should observe how effective these measures are in japan over the long term to determine whether the current law should be revised to allow for more forceful enforcement in preparation for the next pandemic there are several limitations to this study first the data were self-reported and participants actual behaviours have not been observed second our sample includes people from 20 to 64 years of age but not those 65 and older so the external validity for older peoples behaviour is rather limited third the sample was not collected based on random sampling from the whole population of japan but through quota sampling from individuals who were recruited by or who self-enrolled in the internet panel of the online research company macromill inc participation involved monetary incentives quota sampling ensured a similar distribution to the japanese population among demographic groups gender age and work status but the sample within each group does not necessarily reflect the population for example our sample may induce a healthy respondents bias or similar selection bias since any persons including those who often use the internet those incentivized by monetary gain and those who have a vested interest in the prevention measures taken against covid-19 were able to participate in our survey in fact as has been the case with previous studies 19 our sample was found to have a higher socioeconomic status than the general population in terms of income and education fourth in our survey the income variables are not available for approximately 25 percent of the participants thus the number of observations used in the regression shown in the table are limited which may bring about selection bias however please note that even though income variables are not included in the regression the results are robust in terms of the sign significance and magnitude of the estimates fifth we obtained this dataset at the end of march 2020 when the infection is not explosively widespread in japan this study should be repeated to find more effective solutions at various periods during and after the covid-19 pandemic  public perceptions of covid-19 in australia perceived risk knowledge health-protective behaviours and vaccine intentions kate faasse jill newby  widespread and sustained engagement with health-protective behaviours ie hygiene and distancing is critical to successfully managing the covid-19 pandemic evidence from previous emerging infectious disease outbreaks points to the role of perceived risk worry media coverage and knowledge in shaping engagement with health-protective behaviours as well as vaccination intentions the current study examined these factors in 2174 australian residents an online survey was completed between 2-9 march 2020 at an early stage of the covid-19 outbreak in australia results revealed that two thirds of respondents were at least moderately worried about a widespread covid-19 outbreak in australia which subsequently occurred worry about the outbreak and closely following media coverage were consistent predictors of health-protective behaviours both over the previous month and intended behaviours in the case of a widespread outbreak as well as vaccination intentions health-behaviour engagement over the previous month was lower in some demographic groups including males and younger individuals 18-29 age group these was a substantial mismatch between respondents expected symptoms of infection and emerging evidence that a meaningful proportion of people who contract the novel coronavirus will experience asymptomatic infection ie they will not experience symptoms associated with covid-19 only 03 of those in the current study believed that they personally would not experience any symptoms if they were infected uncertainty and misconceptions about covid-19 were common including one third of respondents who reported being unsure whether people are likely have natural or existing immunity there was also uncertainty around whether specific home remedies eg vitamins saline rinses would offer protection whether the virus could spread via the airborne route and whether the virus was human made and deliberately released such misconceptions are likely to cause concern for members of the public these results point to areas of uncertainty that could be usefully targeted by public education

population samples lau kim tsui  griffiths 2007 rubin amlot page  wessely 2009 tang  wong 2003  in addition health-protective behaviours during a pandemic are associated with more accurate knowledge about the virus petrie et al 2016 and the perception that these behaviours will be effective in reducing the risk of infection as well as heightened anxiety and trust in information provided by authorities bish  michie 2010  during past pandemics worry and anxiety have typically been high with between one fifth and one third of people feeling very or extremely worried about contracting viruses such as sars bults et al 2011 wheaton abramowitz berman fabricant  olatunji 2012  anxiety and risk perceptions may be influenced by media coverage and exposure to misinformation about the emerging health threat of covid-19 even with accurate media reporting -a particular challenge in a changing situation in which scientific information about the virus is emerging and being disseminated

outbreak including lower stress and anxiety  these findings highlight the importance of encouraging the public to engage with such behaviours not only to reduce the risk of infection but also to reduce the psychological impact of the pandemic this study provided important new knowledge about what participants expected in terms of how serious the symptoms of coronavirus would be should they contract covid-19 there is a clear discrepancy between respondents perceived severity of symptoms and current data on rates of asymptomatic infection only 03 of respondents believed that they would experience no symptoms whereas mild 28 and moderate symptoms 47 were expected in contrast emerging evidence from groups with widespread testing for the sars-cov-2 virus eg cruise ships repatriation flights and overseas arrivals indicates that between 2 and 8 out of every 10 infections have been asymptomatic day 2020 mizumoto kagaya zarebski  chowell 2020 nishiura et al 2020  in addition the incubation period for the sars-cov-2 virus is approximately five days lauer et al 2020  although those in the incubation period and with asymptomatic infections  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license

that the absence of symptoms means they are well diefenbach  leventhal 1996  such assumptions in the covid-19 pandemic could have serious consequences both in terms of community transmission and reduced health-protective behaviours both by those with asymptomatic infections and those close to them therefore public health communication campaigns about covid-19 need to address these misconceptions the results also provide important information about where australian residents are seeking their information about covid-19 and how accurate their knowledge is about the virus and its transmission while it was promising to see that 72 sourced information from official and government websites mainstream news media was most popular 85 and social media 68 was also high the high usage of news media as sources of information is concerning given the potential for alarming sensationalist portrayals of the pandemic klemm et al 2016  in addition myths rumours and misinformation can quickly spread online particularly via social media people are more likely to spread false news stories and misinformation and these false stories spread more widely and more quickly than true stories vosoughi roy  aral 2018  this might have been one of the reasons why there were several uncertainties around covid-19 with a significant minority reporting being unsure whether people have natural immunity to it whether specific home remedies garlic vitamins rinsing noses with saline help protect against coronavirus it may also explain some uncertainty around whether packages and letters from china spread the virus and whether the virus was human made and deliberately released almost one third of respondents indicated feeling unsure whether this was true or not in addition uncertainty and rapidly changing information may have contributed to increased worry about the virus han moser  klein 2006  these findings speak to the importance of distributing accurate health information about

third of participants correctly answered all of the questions about the symptoms of covid-19 and less than 20 correctly answered all questions around transmission suggesting more education of the general public about covid-19 is needed overall respondents had good knowledge of the symptoms most commonly associated with infection and understood that transmission appears to be primarily through respiratory droplets over 95 of respondents correctly identified fever and cough as covid-19 symptoms and over 90 correctly identified droplet spread including droplets on hands or surfaces as the primary route of transmission there were a few uncertainties around whether gastrointestinal symptoms were typically associated with covid-19 though evidence indicates these symptoms are relatively are uncommon guan et al 2020  similarly there was uncertainty around airborne waterborne and mosquito transmission waterborne and mosquito transmission are highly unlikely centers for disease control and prevention 2020 world health organization 2020a although airborne transmission may be possible in some specific medical procedures eg disconnecting a patient from a ventilator available evidence does not indicate that airborne community transmission is common world health organization 2020b however uncertainties about routes of transmission particularly uncertainty over whether the virus may be airborne is likely to be concerning for members of the public the way people act during a pandemic is critical in lowering the risk of contracting and spreading the virus given the rapidly evolving situation with covid-19 globally the findings from this study which were assessed during the first week of march 2020 may not be reflective of actual behaviours now that higher restrictions have been put in place and significant widespread messaging around social distancing handwashing and self-isolation has been disseminated however our findings provide important insights into the demographic and

disease outbreak the most powerful predictors were demographic factors including younger age female gender and being of non-caucasian ethnicity as well as risk perceptions greater concern about outbreak and perceived severity of illness and higher media exposure the effect of media exposure is likely to be related to the provision of important health information about the pandemic although media exposure early in the outbreak appears to have facilitated healthprotective behaviours media fatigue -where people become desensitised to ongoing messagingmay reduce this effect as the pandemic continues collinson khan  heffernan 2015  repeated media exposure may also lead to heightened stress and anxiety which can have longer-term health effects as well as contributing to excessive or misplaced health-protective behaviours such as presenting for diagnostic testing when actual risk of exposure is low garfin silver  holman 2020  the results of this study shed light on how many participants planned to get the covid-19 vaccine if and when one becomes available this information will be important for planning public health initiatives if and when a vaccine becomes available a little over half of the sample 53 had a flu vaccine in the past year and prior flu vaccine predicted greater intentions to get a covid-19 vaccine similar variables including concern about outbreaks greater media exposure higher knowledge and perceived scientific understanding predicted planned vaccination intentions these findings are in line with previous research showing that concern about outbreaks and higher knowledge were associated with increased ebola vaccine intentions petrie et al 2016  in contrast with other research perceived likelihood and severity of infection were only marginally associated with intentions to get a vaccine if one becomes available bish  michie 2010 weinstein et al 2007  in part this may be because the literature tends to focus on personal risk yet

concern for others it may also be that because concern and worry was particularly high during data collection early in the outbreak bults et al 2011  this affective response to the risk posed by the novel coronavirus was a particularly strong driver of both health-protective behaviours and vaccine intentions slovic et al 2007  the current study has limitations that should be taken into account participants were recruited online primarily through facebook and therefore may not be representative of the general population although we recruited a range of education levels cultural backgrounds age ranges and gender three quarters were female and caucasian 43 were from nsw and 62 were younger than 50 years of age and results may not generalise to the broader population to maximise convenience sampling we used solely self-report measures which may lead to biased effects while the results of the regression analyses provide interesting starting points to identify the demographic and risk variables that predict actual and anticipated health behaviours as well as vaccine intentions they cannot establish causality and must be interpreted with caution given the large sample the relationships between some of the significant predictors are likely to be small and may not be clinically meaningful the current results provide timely and important information on the australian public responses to the covid-19 pandemic including information sources and engagement knowledge and perceived risk in the early stages of the outbreak in australia and their relationship with current and intended health-protective behaviours and vaccine intentions overall the findings show that perceived risk of outbreak and personal risk of contracting covid-19 were moderate immediately prior to a widespread outbreak but there was a critical mismatch between expected severity of symptoms versus data on how covid-19 is experienced which need to be addressed in government education campaigns although health-protective behaviour was relatively low at the start of the outbreak intended behaviours in the case of an outbreak were reassuringly high these behaviours  cc-by-nc-nd 40

results screening was undertaken 44000 articles with a final selection of 25 studies referring to 18 different experimental projects related to the estimation of the incubation period of covid-19 findings the majority of extant published estimates offer empirical evidence showing that the incubation period for the virus is a mean of 78 days with a median of 501 days which falls into the ranges proposed by the who 0 to 14 days and the ecdc 2 to 12 days nevertheless a number of authors proposed that quarantine time should be a minimum of 14 days and that for estimates of mortality risks a median time delay of 13 days between illness and mortality should be under consideration it is unclear as to whether any correlation exists between the age of patients and the length of time they incubate the virus finally it is generally agreed that robust precautions must be put in place for the prevention andor mitigation of asymptomatic transmission to high-risk patients caused by those incubating the virus  at the start of 2020 a new form of coronavirus was found to be the source of infection responsible for an epidemic of viral pneumonia in wuhan china a region in which the first patients began to show symptoms in december 2019 at the time of writing april 29 2020 over 3 million people globally have caught the virus of whom more than 200000 have died the novel virus causing severe acute respiratory disease is thought to be from the same family as middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus but it is unique in its own right this means that central epidemiological parameters which includes the incubation period are being urgently researched in real-time from case reports while the epidemic is continuing 1  the incubation period of a virus represents the time span from the probable earliest contact with a source of transmission and the earliest recognition of the first symptoms accurately estimating the length of incubation period is essential for effective contemporary public health measures to be taken 2  if health authorities know what the incubation period is then they will know for how long a healthy individual has to be monitored and have their movement restricted quarantine period 3  correctly estimating the incubation period will also help us to comprehend how infectious covid-19 is make estimations of the size of the pandemic and decide on the best course of action 4 5 6 7  with insufficient data available to definitively state what the incubation period for this virus is the world health organisation who is working with a broad range of 0-14 days the european centre for disease prevention and control cdcdc is working with a range of 2-14 days and a number of studies have made the assumption that the incubation period is similar to that of the mers and sars coronaviruses 1  various infectiousviral diseases have a variety of incubation periods nevertheless for some infectious diseases we are relatively certain about the incubation period for every individual the level of pathogens invading the body their ability to reproduce and resist treatment will differ and so for any specific disease the data related to incubation periods should be treated with logarithm normal distribution 8  log-normal distribution represents the continuous probability distribution for a random variable with normal logarithm distribution incubation periods can usually be measured via biological experimentation and physiological observation accurately determining the incubation period will significantly influence controls to prevent transmission of the disease and official policy regarding it nevertheless determining the incubation period for covid-19 is no simple matter due to the fact that there is no consistency in the quality of the available data one reason for this is that generally we can only discover the times when the patient was in contact with persons carrying the virus and then assume that the incubation period runs from the earliest date of exposure to the appearance of clinical symptoms or medical diagnosis this way of calculating the incubation period may well be responsible for overestimation this paper represents a systematic review of the literature in order to answer the essential question of what length the covid-19 incubation period is due to the fact that no method currently exists that can make an accurate estimation of the incubation period the only option is to draw lessons from past experiencepractice a search was run with the covid-19 open research base set provided by georgetowns centre for security and emerging technology this dataset can be found at httpscsetgeorgetowneducovid-19-open-research-datasetcord-19 it comprises more than 55000 academic articles and more than 44000 of them have some reference to covid-19 sars-cov-2 and other forms of coronavirus this dataset is openly available to the global research community to employ using new techniques in natural language processing nlp and other forms of artificial intelligence for the generation of novel insights supporting the continuing battle with the pandemic this dataset is regularly updated when new research appears in peer-reviewed publications and archive services eg biorxiv medrxiv et cetera this search was undertaken on april 25 2020 for reviewing every article in the dataset we employed the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for biomedical text mining biobert model 9  which is a biomedical language representation model created to assist in mining biomedical texts the inspiration for the model comes from the pre-trained language model bert 10 created by devlin jet al biobert resolves the difficulties caused by moving from a trained corpus for general use to biomedical use and assists in the understanding of complex biomedical texts as are found with the work on covid-19 the model was taken from the github httpsgithubcomdmis-labbiobert  filtering of the articles was then undertaken using keywords and questions eg what is the incubation period of covidnormal coronavirussars-cov-2ncov as illustrated in figure 1  a systematic approach was used to screen the full covid-19 open research dataset through employing biobert just 25 articles were found that scored highly on confidence rating an additional search was run employing google scholar to make sure that every relevant article was included every paper previously found was in the top 29 results alongside four other articles each of the 29 papers have been read thoroughly causing nine articles to be excluded from the list for the following reasons one was simply a report of earlier studies into incubation periods one related to techniques for estimating incubation periods two were letters to editors one was a literature review regarding the genometric features of sars-cov-2 one was a perspective paper and the other four were either irrelevant or redundant the ultimate list of 18 articles was split into five categories with four articles focusing on the study of incubation periods seven on characteristics of transmission two on clinical characteristics four case studies and one last paper related to epidemiological characteristics  backer jet al 1 employed travel histories and symptom onsets for 88 confirmed cases discovered beyond the boundaries of wuhan china in the early stage of the coronavirus outbreak these authors made an estimation that the incubation period ranged from 21 to 111 days 25 th to 975 th percentile and that the mean incubation period was 64 days 95 ci 56-77 this research offers empirical evidence and falls into the previously mentioned incubation periods estimated by both the ecdc and the who 11 the researchers employed three parametric forms related to the distribution of the incubation period lognormal distribution gamma distribution and the weibull distribution they employed uniform prior probability distribution for the exposure interval related to the point of infection for all 88 individuals the researchers used posterior distribution samples employing the rstan package within r software version 360 r foundation vienna austria 12  natalie ml et al 2 examined covid-19s epidemiological characteristics and incubation period the researchers harvested information relating to confirmed diagnoses of covid-19 infection beyond the disease epicentre in wuhan china using official reporting from state institutes and reporting on mortalities both within and outwith wuhan the data used by the authors was either directly harvested from government sources or from news websites reporting government statements the data collection process was real-time so it was added to as further details emerged the final data selection represented a selection of reported cases up to january 31 2020 the outcomes of this research concluded that the incubation period falls into a range of 2-14 days 95 ci with the mean being approximately five days as found by employing best-fit lognormal distribution mean time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital either for treatment or isolation was estimated to be between three and four days with no truncation and between five and nine days with right truncation on the basis of the 95 th percentile estimate for the incubation period the researchers recommended that exposed individuals should be quarantined for a minimum of 14 days when making estimates of the risk of fatality in

that sars-cov-2 has an extended incubation period which has led to modifications in official policy for control and screening to prevent the virus spreading any individual who may have been exposed should go into isolation for 14 days this being the outer limit of predictions for incubation times nevertheless by analyzing a large dataset for this research researchers report that no identifiable difference exists between incubation times for sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov which highlights the requirement for more extensive and better-annotated datasets this research covered 49 patients with sars-cov-2 who had definite dates for first exposure end of exposure and beginning of symptoms 153 patients with sars-cov and 70 mers-cov patients this data was amalgamated from seven separate papers the results indicated that mers incubates on average 58 days 95 ci 5-65 sars-cov 47 days 95 ci 43-51 and sars-cov2 49 days 95 ci 44-55 this demonstrates that the longest incubation period is mers-cov with sars-cov2 second longest lauer stephen et al 14 researched the covid-19 incubation period by looking at diagnosed cases that have been publicly reported the aim of the study was to ascertain covid-19s incubation period and to detail its implications for public health the researchers examined diagnosed cases of covid-19 occurring between january 4 2020 and february 24 2020 the research covered 181 subjects diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection outwith hubei province china by examining press releases and news reports from 50 different provinces regions and nations the researchers harvested information regarding patient demographics datestime of possible exposure onset of symptoms onset of fever and admission to hospital the researchers estimate that conservatively 10110000 cases 99 th percentile 482 will experience symptom onset more than 14 days after being quarantined or actively monitored nevertheless the researchers noted that severe cases could be overrepresented in public reporting it is possible that severe and mild covid 19 infections have different incubation periods this research adds to the evidence that covid-19 is similar to sars in having a median incubation period of around five days this recommendation comes from the research looking at proposed quarantineactive monitoring times for subjects with potential exposure to the virus li q et al 15 researched the early data regarding transmission dynamics for the virus in wuhan estimating the mean incubation period at 52 days 95 ci 41-70 with the distributions 95 th percentile being 125 days the researchers fitted a log-normal distribution to data regarding history of exposure and date of onset using only those cases where detailed information was available to estimate the length of incubation their preliminary estimate of distribution of the incubation period offers strong support for the case that exposed subjects should be quarantined or put under medical observation for 14 days nevertheless this studys accuracy may be questioned as the estimate was made using data from just 10 patients meili l et al 16 researched the transmission characteristics of chinas covid-19 outbreak they took individual patient histories from covid-19 subjects in china not from hubei province for estimating the distribution of the time for generation incubation and the time span between onset of symptoms and isolationdiagnosis on average patients were isolated 37 days after the onset of symptoms and diagnosed after 66 days the average patient was found to be infectious 39 days prior to displaying any notable symptoms this militates against effective quarantining or contact tracing with contact tracing isolation and quarantine the baseline reproduction number is estimated at 154 with the majority of infection attributable to super spreaders the authors of this research on this basis suggested that 14 day quarantine periods would fail for 67 of subjects they proposed 22day quarantine becoming standard this research gave an estimation of mean incubation

special hospitals in hunan province from january 22 2020 and february 12 2020 collection and analysis was made of information regarding patient demographics clinical laboratory and radiological findings medication administered and patient outcomes confirmation of patient illness was made with the pcr test the patients had a mean age of 43 ranging from 8 to 84 with 5288 female the researchers found a median incubation period of six range 1-32 days eight patients incubated between 14 and 17 days and eight patients incubated between 18 and 30 days yan bei et al 20 undertook research into cases where it was assumed that the virus had been passed by an asymptomatic carrier this research looked at a family from anyang china of which five members were suffering covid-19 pneumonia who had prior to developing symptoms been in contact with an asymptomatic member of the family who had travelled to see them from wuhan the origin of the pandemic the timeline they uncovered implies that the coronavirus could have been passed on by this asymptomatic carrier the first patient to develop symptoms incubated for 19 days a long period but one which falls within the reported range 0 to 24 days this patient initially produced a negative return for the rt-pcr test rt-pcr is a common test for diagnostic virology and does not often return false positives so her second result from this test was probably not a false positive and so it was assumed that she was infected with the coronavirus that is responsible for covid-19 wei xia et al 21 undertook research into how the coronavirus was transmitted in incubation periods in 2019 the researchers harvested data on the demographics possible exposure and time to symptom onset for confirmed cases published by local chinese authorities they assessed the possibilities of transmission in the course of the incubation period for 50 clusters of infection these included 124 cases outwith wuhanhubei province every secondary case examined and been in contact with a first-generation case prior to experiencing symptoms this research found that the mean incubation period for covid-19 was 49 days 95 ci 44-54 with a range of 08 to 111 days 25 th to 975 th percentile the infectious curve demonstrated that 73 of secondary cases became infected prior to symptoms appearing for first-generation cases this was especially the case in the final three days of incubation these findings demonstrated that covid-19 is transmitted between those who are in close contact in the course of incubation which could indicate a weakness in the quarantine system robust workable countermeasures are required for the prevention or mitigation of the virus being transmitted asymptomatically amongst high-risk populations in the course of the incubation period juanjuan z 22 undertook research into the evolution of covid-19s transmission dynamics and epidemiology outwith hubei province it was hoped that being able to understand the evolution of the transmission dynamics and epidemiology outwith the center of the epidemic would provide useful information that could be used as guidance for intervention policies the researchers harvested data on individuals whose diagnosis was confirmed by laboratory testing in mainland china apart from hubei that was reported by official public sources between january 19 and february 17 2020 the date of the fourth time the case definition was revised january 27 was employed as a means of dividing the epidemic into two phases december 24-january 27 and january 28-february 17 as dates for symptom onset trends were estimated in terms of central time-event periods and subject demographics this research encompassed 8579 cases covering 30 provinces the median age of the subjects was 44 years range 33 to 56 as the epidemic continued more cases emerged in the younger age groups and for the elderly those aged over 64 mean time between symptom onset and hospitalization fell from 44 days  95 ci 00-140 between december 24 and january 27 down to 26 days 00-90 between january 28 and february 17 for the whole period mean incubation period was calculated at 52 days 1 8-124  with the mean serial interval being 51 days 13-116 shaoqing et al 23 undertook research investigating the clinical characteristics and outcomes for patients submitting to surgery in the covid-19 incubation period the researchers undertook analysis of clinical data for 34 subjects submitting to elective surgery during the covid-19 incubation period at four chinese hospitals renmin tongji zhongnan and central in wuhan between january 1 and february 5 2020 the patients had a median age of 55 with 20 of them 588 being female every patient exhibited covid-19 pneumonia symptoms within a short time of surgery with abnormalities showing on chest ct scans symptoms exhibited by these patients encompassed fever 31 912 fatigue 25 735 and a dry cough 18 529 15 of the patients 441 had to be admitted to the intensive care unit icu as the disease progressed and seven of these died 205 every patient examined in this research had being directly exposed to the environment in wuhan before being admitted to hospital no patient had exhibited any symptoms of covid-19 prior to surgery it was notable how swiftly the covid-19 symptoms appeared once surgery had been completed with the infection being confirmed by laboratory within a short period the time gap between hospital admission and surgery median time 25 days is less than the median incubation period of 52 days found in patients with laboratory-confirmed infections in wuhan 15  it is also less than the general incubation time in hospitals in china median time 40 days from research into infected patients from 552 chinese hospitals 19  taken together this evidence is confirmation of the hypothesis that patients within this research were incubating covid-19 prior to submitting to surgery guan et al 24 undertook research into coronavirus clinical characteristics within china they reviewed data for 1099 patients who had a covid-19 diagnosis confirmed by laboratory data came from 552 hospitals across 32 provinces and municipalities of mainland china up to january 29 2020 only data from 291 patients was used to calculate incubation periods these being patients who had a clear idea of the date they had been exposed the patients had a median age of 47 years with 581 male and 419 female 118 of the subjects had been in direct wildlife contact 3130 had visited wuhan and 7180 had been in contact with people from wuhan there was found to be a median incubation period of four days interquartile range between two and seven days jasper fc et al 25 looked at a cluster of pneumonia within a family associated with covid-19 the researchers examined clinical laboratory epidemiological microbiological and radiological outcomes for five patients aged between 36 and 66 years from the same family who all manifested idiopathic pneumonia upon their return to shenzen guangdong province having visited wuhan from december 29 2019 to january 4 2020 all patients exhibited at least one and sometimes more of the symptoms of diarrhoea upperlower respiratory tract problems or fever within 3 to 6 days after being exposed the patients attended hospital between six and ten days from symptoms appearing the findings of this research accord with other accounts of covid-19 transmission in familyhospital environments and share features with reports of travellers with the infection in other areas jin-wei et al 26 undertook research into 102 cases of covid-19 51 male 49 female in xiangyang china all of whom tested positive via rt-pcr the cohort ranged in age from 15 years to 90 years with a mean age of 5038 the majority of subjects were aged between 50 and 70 years of the 71 subjects who had confirmed contact histories 7 lived in wuhan 37 had travelled there 4 had contact with patients who had been diagnosed with the virus and 23 were members of families where infection clusters appeared analysing 44 subjects where it was obvious where contact occurred incubation periods were between 1 and 20 days with the mean being 809 days

14 days with between 3 and 7 days being the most common the research notes that incubation periods may be extended in some patients the research reports on a family cluster of covid-19 a 47-year-old female member of the family on long-term glucocorticoid therapy had no symptoms in a 14 day quarantine period but tested positive for covid-19 antibodies 40 days after leaving wuhan these findings imply that long-term glucocorticoid use could be responsible for long incubation periods atypical infection and additional transmissions of the virus rachael pf et al 28 undertook an investigation into singapores surveillanceresponse measures this research examined three covid-19 clusters associated with a church in singapore a business conference and a visiting chinese tour group in february 2020 the research employed inpatient medical records and interviews to harvest clinical and epidemiological data regarding subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of covid-19 field investigations were undertaken for assessment of the ways these subjects had interacted with others and the potential ways in which they had acquired the virus with overseas cases open-source reports were used at the time of the research february 15 2020 there were 36 infections with epidemiological links to the three singaporean clusters mentioned above 425 subjects who had had close contact with people from these clusters were put in quarantine those affected had generally had prolonged direct close contact with others although it was not possible to exclude indirect transmission eg through shared food or fomites this research found a median incubation period for covid-19 of four days iqr 3-6 serial intervals for transmission pairs were between three and eight days the researchers came to the conclusion that the virus can be transmitted within communities and that local clusters of infection will appear in countries that welcomed high numbers of chinese visitors prior to wuhan being locked down and travel restrictions being imposed the research further concluded that contact tracing and increased surveillance is necessary to prevent the virus spreading widely across communities china pei w et al 29 undertook an investigation into covid-19s epidemiological characteristics as found in the chinese province of henan centered on publicly available data related to 1212 patients the report mentions that these patients are 55 male and 45 female with 81 being aged from 21 to 60 years statistical analysis undertaken with 483 patients on this cohort revealed that the estimated

that the only means of estimating the incubation period for covid-19 at present is logarithm normal distribution novel ways of effecting improvements to the estimations accuracy in terms of estimating incubation periods should be investigated this is an important issue because date of infection andor onset of symptoms are difficult to precisely identify nicholas gret al 31 have made a comparison of two means of making such estimates one method uses doubly interval-censored data and the other employs data reduction techniques making the calculation more tractable the researchers used both methods on historical data relating to the incubation periods for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza a the outcomes demonstrate that these methods reduce the demands for computational power to analyze the reduced data and make good estimates of median incubation times in many different experimental conditions nevertheless the researchers do recommend that doubly interval-censored analysis should be used to estimate the distribution tails the systematic review undertaken by this research has demonstrated that the current published estimations have offered empirical evidence that the virus incubation period is approximately a median of 501 and a mean of 78 days which falls into the 2 to 12 days assumption of the ecdc and the 0 to 14 days of the who 11 researchers like 2 propose a recommended quarantine length of a minimum of 14 days suggesting that fatality risks should be estimated using a median time of 13 days between first symptoms and mortality 14 offered evidence that it is possible for symptoms to appear once patients have left a 14 day period of quarantine or active monitoring the authors suggest that the median incubation time is around five days similar to sars in 16  the authors stated that 14-day quarantines may be insufficient to protect the public in 67 of cases they therefore proposed that quarantine should be a minimum of 22 days in 19 it was found that eight patients developed symptoms after more than 14 days from infection in 20 the authors referred to a patient who incubated the virus for 19 days a substantial period but one which falls into the reported range 0-24 days it has yet to be conclusively demonstrated whether age group as any impact on the time a patient incubates the virus out of 291 patients 24 with an average age of 47 the incubation period was 40 days for five patients 25 with an average age of 495 years it was 45 days for 44 patients 26 with an average age of 60 years it was 499 days and for two patients 27 with an average age of 47 years it was 45 days the authors of 27 suggested that long-term glucocorticoid use could cause a delay in the onset of symptoms so that they would not appear until after a 14 day quarantine period had been completed long-term glucocorticoid use could be responsible for atypical infection longer incubation periods and additional covid-19 transmission 13 states that covid-19 has a mean incubation period lower than mers coronavirus but higher than sars coronavirus 21 offers a final insight that robust and workable countermeasures must be put in place for the prevention andor mitigation of asymptomatic transmission in the course of incubation amongst high-risk populations the authors declare that they have no competing interests not required 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10

and reduce the spread of illness some reports estimate that 39 billion people over half the worlds population have been asked to stay at home by their countrys government or have had some limit on their movement imposed 1 with almost 3 million confirmed cases globally 2 countries around the world are pinning their hopes on testing as part of their exit strategy from more severe measures this includes antigen testing which tests if people currently have covid-19 and antibody testing which tests if people have had covid-19 in the past however the world health organization has warned against using antibody tests in order to issue people with immunity passports due to fears that those who test positive for antibodies may stop adhering to protective measures 3 people who believe they have had covid-19 may be more likely to think they are completely immune stop engaging in protective behaviours such as handwashing and reduce their social distancing measures this may contribute to transmission of the virus for two reasons first test results can be wrong 4 and in the absence of testing people can misdiagnose themselves this can lead people to believe that they have had covid-19 when they have not second for people who have had covid-19 it remains unknown whether they could catch covid-19 and be infectious more than once3 however there is currently no evidence about the behavioural consequences of believing that you have had covid-19 in this study we explored whether believing that you have already had covid-19 alters your behaviour we hypothesised that people who think they have had covid-19 are more likely to believe that they are immune to covid-19 less likely to adhere to social distancing measures less worried about covid-19 and perceive a lower risk of covid-19 to themselves but no difference in perceived risk of covid-19 to others we also investigated awareness of the most common covid-19 symptoms as a marker of likely accuracy of selfdiagnosis

that seen in other surveys from the uk with findings from daily tracker surveys indicating that approximately 10 to 18 think that they have had 9 differences in findings may be explained by the fact that these data only cover dates until 20 th april although we cannot be sure of the true proportion of the population that have had covid-19 it is likely much lower with an estimate by the chief medical officer for england on 24 th april being unlikely to be much above 10 per cent10 it is likely that a substantial element of self-misdiagnosis underlies the high rate that we observed this is supported not only by the high number of participants who felt they had had covid-19 and who were unable to identify cough and fever as among the top three most common symptoms  cc-by 40 international

believed they had had covid-19 the proportion of the population who believe rightly or wrongly that they have had covid-19 will only increase over time understanding how this affects behaviour is therefore important we found that people who thought they had had covid-19 were more likely to think that they had some immunity to the virus and were less likely to adhere to social distancing measures in particular people were less likely to report adhering to measures that are not allowed at all in the uk such as meeting up with friends andor family that you do not live with and shopping for nonessentials they also reported making more outings in the last week than those who did not think they had had covid-19 however this result should be taken with caution as there was no longer an association in our sensitivity analyses given the cross-sectional nature of our data it is impossible to be clear on causality -it may be that not adhering to social distancing rules leads to a greater likelihood of contracting covid-19 however the findings do fit with concerns expressed by the who that believing oneself to have had covid-19 results in reduced adherence to protective behaviours 3 this finding has important implications at an individual level and also widely social norms are known to affect adherence to quarantine11 therefore people may be less likely to adhere to lockdown measures if they perceive other people such as those who think they have had covid-19 not to be adhering to date there are no communications specifically targeting those who think they have had covid-19 this will become increasingly important in minimising transmission as the outbreak continues communications should acknowledge the growing proportion of the population who think that they have had covid-19 and should issue targeted recommendations for this group explaining why it remains important to adhere to social distancing measures maintain good hand hygiene and for healthcare workers use personal protective equipment where necessary in addition to associations with behaviour thinking that you had had covid-19 was associated with decreased worry about covid-19 this appears logical however there was little evidence for an association between perceived risk to oneself and others and believing you have had covid-19 as we did not measure different factors that may contribute to worry eg concern about personal finances  job impact on physical  mental health we are unable to tell which specific worries may be driving this decrease it should be noted that  cc-by

had the virus were small and may not be meaningful in real world situations older participants were less likely to think they had had coronavirus this may be because of a greater proportion of this group who are shielding not leaving the home at all for at least 12 weeks those who have a child were more likely to report having had coronavirus perhaps linked to greater exposure or perceived exposure among this group 12 13 however schools in the uk have been closed since 23 rd march 2020 except for children of key workers 14 reducing contacts between children15 and these results pertaining to having children should be taken with caution as there was no longer any evidence for an association when analysing only those who had not been tested for covid-19 those who were employed full-time part-time or self-employed were also more likely to think that they had had covid-19 as were those working in key sectors this may be due to increased objective exposure and perceived exposure as these groups continue to go out to work while others work from home or stop working there was no longer any evidence for an association between employment and thinking you had had covid-19 when removing those who had been tested therefore this interpretation should be taken with caution this study has several limitations first while quotas were used to ensure a sample that was broadly representative of the general uk population we cannot be certain whether respondents in survey panels are representative of the general population 16 17 we also cannot rule out participation bias given potential participants were not aware of the topic of the survey before starting it the risk of this is low second we did not differentiate between outings that were in line with government guidelines and those that were not in our measure of total out-of-home activity third because we used a cross-sectional study design we are unable to determine the direction of associations fourth due to the large sample size small differences between groups were statistically significant where detected differences were very small there may not be meaningful influence of these differences eg perceived risk to self people are likely to change their behaviour in line with their belief of whether they have had covid-19 even when tested the reported result of an antigen test was not necessarily reflected in peoples belief about whether they had had covid-19 results from this study indicate that people who think they have had covid-19 are less likely to adhere to social  cc-by 40

critical to identify high risk patients and to facilitate planning eg forecasting the need for hospital beds and mechanical ventilators these risk factors will also have implications for workforce

disease cvd and traditional cvd risk factors eg age male sex current smoking hypertension and diabetes are associated with severe covid-19 however other than age results have been inconsistent furthermore few studies accounted for potential confounding by age and sex when they evaluated other potential risk factors for example some studies reported that hypertension is a risk factor of severe covid-19 but their observations may simply reflect the fact that hypertension is more common in older adults 3 nonetheless despite the lack of robust evidence this observation together with the fact sars-cov-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as an entry to human body 4 has raised a concern about continued use of reninangiotensin system increase among some clinicians and researchers 5 6

35 an important question is whether these associations are independent of major confounders particularly age although we could not obtain a definite answer as very few studies ran multivariable models our meta-regression analysis indicated some degree of confounding by age one study by zhou et al showed substantial attenuation of the association between coronary heart disease and severe covid-19 on the other hand liang et al showed independent associations of hypertension and diabetes with severe covid-19 in a relatively large sample size of 1590 patients these is also biologic plausibility hypertension and diabetes are leading risk factors for cvd and kidney diseases and there is evidence that covid-19 damages these organs 34 35 available studies provide scant evidence related to the hypothesized adverse effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on severity of covid-19 infection as noted above there is biological plausibility for potential associations of covid-19 with hypertension and diabetes two comorbidities associated with use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors only one study reported the prevalence of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors use 13 in this study 30 of patients reported prevalent hypertension but only 5 of patients were taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors 13 thus it is reasonable that many expert organizations recommend continuing this category of medications until better evidence becomes available 4 our results can potentially be used to guide decision-making while the lack of discrete age thresholds for severe covid-19 complicates this process data on case fatality rates from three countries web table 2  suggest that age older than 60 or 65 years confers high risk of severe covid-19 relative risk  5 compared to 50 years our results also indicate male sex is an independent risk factor with a pooled relative risk of 17 although it is very likely that the pooled crude relative risk of 3-35 for hypertension diabetes and cvd overestimate their impact beyond age and sex all or some of them may each confer 15-2 times greater risk thus using these factors it is possible to estimate at least crudely the risk of severe covid-19 for example a man aged 60-65 years old with either hypertension diabetes or prior cvd would  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder

testing for covid-19 clinical management of covid-19 and workforce planning our study has some limitations first reflecting the fact that the outbreak started from china most studies were from china however given similar case-fatality rates and clinical manifestations across different countries it seems likely that these results are largely generalizable nonetheless we need to acknowledge regional variations of some risk factors eg 25-fold difference in the prevalence of smoking in men vs women in china 36  and thus future investigations in different regions would be valuable second we did not include non-english publications third most studies reported odds ratios which are known to overestimate risk ratio when the prevalence of exposures is relatively high fourth we cannot deny the possibility that some patients were included in multiple studies especially in the china cdc report 14 and other chinese studies nonetheless the pooled estimates were largely similar in analyses that excluded the china cdc data data not shown finally the literature of covid-19 is growing rapidly and thus there is a lag time from our literature search and publication on the other hand our

neishay ayub joseph cohen jin jing aayushee jain ryan tesh shibani mukerji s f zafar m brandon westover eyal kimchi y  reports have suggested that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 causes neurologic manifestations including encephalopathy and seizures however there has been relatively limited electrophysiology data to contextualize these specific concerns and to understand their associated clinical factors our objective was to identify eeg abnormalities present in patients with sars-cov-2 and to determine whether they reflect new or preexisting brain pathology we studied a consecutive series of hospitalized patients with sars-cov-2 who received an eeg obtained using tailored safety protocols data from eeg reports and clinical records were analyzed to identify eeg abnormalities and possible clinical associations including neurologic symptoms new or preexisting brain pathology and sedation practices we identified 37 patients with sars-cov-2 who underwent eeg of whom 14 had epileptiform findings 38 patients with epileptiform findings were more likely to have preexisting brain pathology 614 43 than patients without epileptiform findings 223 9 p0042 there were no clear differences in rates of acute brain pathology one case of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was captured but was not clearly a direct consequence of sars-cov-2 abnormalities of background rhythms were common and patients recently sedated were more likely to lack a posterior dominant rhythm p0022  medrxiv preprint 3 conclusions epileptiform abnormalities were common in patients with sars-cov-2 referred for eeg but particularly in the context of preexisting brain pathology and sedation these findings suggest that neurologic manifestations during sars-cov-2 infection may not solely relate to the infection itself but rather may also reflect patients broader preexisting neurologic vulnerabilities  as the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic has grown there has been concern about its possible neurologic consequences 1  covid-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 virus whose presentations range from asymptomatic to severe 2  one early series of patients with severe infection described neurologic findings of impaired consciousness 148 and seizure 11 3  while another noted that 27 of patients had seizure risk factors though clinical seizures appeared rare 4  however routine eeg data to support or contextualize these concerns has been limited to smaller series 5 6 7 8  with some series abstaining from eegs altogether due to safety concerns 4  including limited personal protective equipment ppe risks of technician exposure and possible iatrogenic spread through personnel or equipment contamination a paucity of eegs could underestimate the rate of seizures and epileptiform activity in sars-cov-2 given reports of seizures in other coronavirus outbreaks 9 and reports of patients with sars-cov-2 with nonconvulsive or focal status epilepticus 10 11  it is therefore imperative to understand what eegs might reveal in a broader series of patients with sars-cov-2 concerns have also been raised about the neuroinvasive potential of sars-cov-2 12  in some cases the presence of neurologic symptoms has even been used to infer central nervous system cns invasion 13  and there is at least one possible case of meningoencephalitis with a positive cerebrospinal fluid csf reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr 14  autopsy series however have been conflicting regarding rates of neuroinvasion 15  with the largest series suggesting that neuroinvasion is limited 16  it is therefore unclear whether seizures or encephalopathy in sars-cov-2 are due to new cns injury reflect

all patients at our institution with sars-cov-2 who received an eeg to test the hypothesis that there is a moderate rate of epileptiform discharges in patients with sars-cov-2 but that they are most

have noted frontally predominant abnormalities in patients with sars-cov-2 7 8 25 26  but in at least one paper frontal slowing appeared similar to that seen in metabolic encephalopathies and correlated with systemic lab findings 7  although a few encephalitides are associated with suggestive eeg findings such as very low frequency periodic complexes in measles-related subacute sclerosing panencephalitisis 27 or lateralized periodic epileptiform discharges in hsv encephalitis 28  neither finding is necessarily specific our study did not identify an eeg finding more specific to sars-cov-2 than other syndromes several eegs included capture of convulsive or concerning events but none had electrographic correlates this suggests the need for care regarding the diagnosis of seizures solely based on convulsions in patients with sars-cov-2 which can also manifest with myoclonus 29  more detail may be necessary when seizures are diagnosed or reported in covid-19 without description of ancillary data in addition to epileptiform abnormalities the most common eeg findings were background rhythms abnormalities a nonspecific finding that can be associated with poor prognosis 30  some abnormalities for example generalized theta slowing were frequent even in patients who had not recently received sedation and this can be seen in non-encephalitic conditions such as toxicmetabolic encephalopathies 31  however the increased lack of a posterior dominant rhythm in patients recently receiving sedation suggests that some background rhythm abnormalities in sars-cov-2 may not simply reflect direct effects of sars-cov-2 infection but may include contributions from its management such as sedation  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is

medrxiv preprint a consideration that was unexpected at the outset of this study was how frequently patients were deeply sedated beyond typical sedation goals for example to a rass of -3 rather than -1 to 0 while icu sedation can unintentionally become deeper than intended especially when the number of bedside evaluations are limited 32  sedation was also intentionally deep and rarely lifted successfully due to ventilator dyssynchrony the risks and benefits of deep sedation in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards are complex 33  and the sedation strategy that most effectively balances patient-specific risks and benefits in sars-cov-2 remains unknown heavy sedation is likely to affect eeg sensitivity and specificity and has not been considered in all prior sars-cov-2 eeg reports given that several of our eegs were prompted by convulsions in the setting of weaning sedation we recommend anticipating whether and when attempts will be made to decrease sedation during long-term eegs as the covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 continues there will be increasing need to safely perform diagnostic tests that were previously routine 34 35  to date there has been no clear transmission within or from our division however there is limited data to guide safety protocols and limit iatrogenic spread including among healthcare workers 36  protocols are likely to depend on local ppe availability and evolving understandings of covid-19 spread the benefits of masking patients remains uncertain and exhalation airflow is redirected by masks potentially flowing superiorly with unclear consequences for eeg technicians who often stand above patients heads 37  tracking healthcare related cases of sars-cov-2 would be helpful to understand risks of transmission to and from

knowledge this is the largest known series to date of patients receiving standard eegs for any coronavirus all eegs were ordered at the discretion of providers which may introduce clinical biases that may limit generalizability to patients who do not prompt such studies our rate of electrographic seizures and estimated confidence interval however agrees with other smaller series suggesting a  8 rate of seizures even in such selected populations 3 38 39 40  this series included a heterogeneous population including some patients who appeared asymptomatic from a respiratory perspective asymptomatic patients will likely form an increasing portion of sars-cov-2 studies as both viral spread and testing increase additionally while we have shared the specific safety protocols undertaken by our division at this time we anticipate that protocols will evolve as more is learned eeg provides a dynamic window into the dramatic ways in which the minds and brains of our patients are affected by the systemic neurologic and psychosocial consequences of sars-cov-2 epileptiform abnormalities were common in patients with sars-cov-2 referred for eeg and were associated with preexisting brain

higher than those found in us adults 321 hospitalized with seasonal influenza 25 26 our findings may help to inform resource planning and 322 allocation in healthcare facilities during the covid-19 pandemic 323 there are several limitations to our analysis first it is likely that not all covid-19-associated 324 hospitalizations were captured because of the lack of widespread testing capability during the study 325 period and because identification of covid-19 patients was largely reliant on clinician-directed testing 326 second clinical practices and availability of specific interventions may differ across hospitals which 327 might have influenced findings third covid-net is an ongoing surveillance system and only 15 of 328 the 16318 covid-19 hospitalized patients were included representing those who were discharged or 329 died in-hospital during march 1-may 2 2020 and for whom medical records were available and chart 330 abstractions were completed these restrictions may have resulted in selection bias however there 331 was no difference in the age and sex distribution between cases included and excluded from the 332 analysis the geographic distribution of cases included versus excluded from this analysis differed 333 which may have impacted the racial and ethnic distribution of cases included in this analysis as 334 compared to the racial and ethnic distribution of the surveillance catchment population however as we 335 do not yet have complete data on raceethnicity for all identified cases we were not able to assess this 336 further nevertheless covid-net encompasses a large geographic area with multiple hospitals and 337 likely offers a more racially and ethnically diverse patient population compared to other single-center or 338 state-based

jianfan he shunxiang zhang junjie xia   since december 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases infected with novel coronavirus have been reported in wuhan china through genome-wide sequencing and culture identification of patients sample a new type of betacoronavirus has been identified it was named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and became the seventh member of the coronavirus family that can infect humans 1 because the outbreak of this new coronavirus pneumonia coincided with the chinese lunar new year the cross-provincial transfers of people in china have provided excellent opportunities for the virus to spread throughout the country current evidence shows that the new coronavirus has a high infectivity with the basic reproduction number r0  22 95 ci 14 to 39 2 in order to prevent the transmission of 2019-ncov the chinese national health commission 3 has implemented different measures including centralized treatment for confirmed cases home-isolated or centralized medical observation for close contacts suspected cases mild cases and asymptomatic cases as a city with a large number of immigrants millions of migrant workers are returning to shenzhen after the chinese lunar new year which bringing great challenges to the prevention and control of the novel pneumonia people with travel history in hubei province or close contacts with confirmed cases were investigated and isolated at home or at designated hotels as required in shenzhen however the basic characteristics contact history self-protect measures and overall infection rate of people who receiving medical observation at home is not yet well understood in this study we estimated the demographic characteristics travel history contact history self-protection measures infection situation and other key information of people who were quarantine at home to provide information for prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 people who were identified as close contacts with confirmed cases or had travel history in epidemic provinces were at higher risk of infection both of them need to be self-isolated for 14 days according to the shenzhens guideline for covid-19 prevention and control people who had travel history in epidemic provinces are required to be isolated at home and receive medical observations including regular temperature measurement and syndromic surveillance we regarded this group of people as our target population and used the formula nz2p2p1p to calculate sample size we set infection rate of 19-ncov as 5 the relative error  as 10 and  as 005 the sample size was calculated to be 1825 people considering the sample attrition we planned to recruit 2000 people in our study we applied a stratified multistage random sampling process to recruit participants in this study first we randomly selected 2 streets from 10 districts in shenzhen then we randomly sampled 2 communities from the selected streets if the total number of people who receiving medical observation at home in selected community was less than 50 we merged the community with its neighboring community to ensure that the total number of target people in the sampling unit at this stage was more than 50 people finally we used simple random sampling method to choose 50 target people each from the selected community or merged communities we collected data from feb 5 2020 to feb 10 2020 self-reported questionnaires and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were used to collect information of people under home quarantine considering that our participants might have been infected we developed online questionnaire and asked respondents to fill the questionnaire by themselves we collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens and employed the 2019-ncov real-time pcr kit to detect virus all the laboratory tests were conducted by the beijing genomics institution bgi shenzhen proportions and frequencies were used to report the results of categorical variables mean and range were used to express continuous variable statistical analyses were conducted using the stata software version151 a total of 2004 people were involved in our study of which 1637 participants finished the questionnaire with a response rate of 817 table 1
shows the demographic characteristics of the study sample the prevalence of underlying diseases in this sample was 947 and the mean age was 337 range 03802 years old 
table 2
shows the travel history of the sample in this study a total of 1213 subjects 7410 traveled to epidemic areas within 14 days before the home quarantine from them 129 people have traveled to wuhan city 1046 people have traveled to other cities in hubei province and 40 participants have been to other provinces such as sichuan and beijing most of the subjects drove private car for traveling and 1520 of the sample used public transportations excluding people who were long-term resident in the epidemic areas the average length of their stay was 42 days most of the participants arrived at shenzhen between jan 24 2020 to jan 27 2020 fig 1
 less than 1 of the participants reported any contact history with confirmed or suspected cases see table 2 in our study sample more than 85 have taken various self-protection measures such as wearing masks washing hands and reducing outdoor events recommended by the specialist however there were still 96 subjects 588 who seldomly wearing masks table 3
 we conducted nucleic acid testing for a total of 2004 people and three of these in our study tested positive for 2019ncov after recheck by shenzhen centers for disease control and prevention these persons were confirmed as covid-19 cases the incidence of covid-19 in the sample was 15 95 ci 031437 none of the three patients had obvious symptoms during the time of home quarantine table 4
 also they did not report any history of contacts with confirmed cases during their stay in wuhanhubei this is the first population-based study to estimate the characteristics and the incidence of 2019-ncov infection among people who were quarantined at home using data collected from a stratified multistage random sample it presents results from a comprehensive descriptive analysis of the travel history and laboratory results and provides information for policy makers to produce guideline for the management of people who have travel history in epidemic areas three quarters 7407 of our study population had travel history in january and february 2020 of which 9670 have been to hubei province most of the subjects 5901 arrived at shenzhen between jan 24 to jan 27 2020 right after the travel bans on jan 23 2020 considering that 2019-ncov is a highly contagious infectious disease 4 and the number of confirmed cases increased rapidly in hubei province people participated in our study have potentially been exposed to the virus during their travel therefore it is important to provide effective management measures to prevent the outbreak onset in our study population especially to stop transmission during the incubation period 5 we also recruited 424 people who did not have any travel histories but lived together with those persons incidence of confirmed covid-19 cases in our study population is 15 95 ci 031437 which is lower than the incidence 11 95ci 0431 calculated from the evacuation of korea japan germany singapore and france 6 this may be explained in two ways first most of participants in our study returned to shenzhen after the travel bans and the first level emergency response of guangdong province began on jan 23 2020 which resulted in restricted travel and strict temperature screening in and out of hubei province people who had symptoms such fever or cough were detected and isolated before entering shenzhen second less than 1 of the participants reported contact history with confirmed case and more than 85 of the subjects have taken self-protection measures wearing masks washing hands reducing outdoor events cancelling gatherings and following cough etiquette recommended by the government during their stay in epidemic areas since the common person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-ncov are direct transmission and contact transmission 7 the risk of getting infected is low without close contacts three out of 2004 persons have confirmed 2019-ncov infection in our study which highlighted the importance of home quarantine quarantine is defined as restricting movement of people who have potentially been exposed to infectious diseases to prevent the transmission 89 it has been widely used in response to plague e g the black death severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and ebola outbreaks 10 11 12 13 in current covid-19 outbreak the three in one task force composed of community work stations community health centers and community police is responsible for home quarantine and medical observation in shenzhen during the 14 days of quarantine people are required to stay at home and daily necessities are ordered and delivered by community workers the task force members take their body temperature and record their health status twice a day and health workers in the task force need to assess if he or she need further investigation people who have travel history in epidemic areas and their cohabitants have red code on a smart phone application called ishenzhen people who staye at shenzhen have green code community workers and community polices take temperature and check codes for everyone in and out of the community at the entrance and only people with green code could pass after 14 days of home quarantine if people with travel history in epidemic areas do not have any symptoms they will receive a green code and a proof of complete quarantine consistent with previous experience home quarantine for people who have travel history in epidemic areas has been proven effective to prevent community transmission during the incubation period and the period of early onset however one of the three cases was confirmed as 2019-ncov infection 16 days after his arrival case 1 this patient had a transient high body temperature 374 c and another case had dry cough during the home quarantine moreover previous case reports suggested a high risk of severe illness for elderly people and those who had underlying health conditions 14 in our study 446 of the sample aged above 60 years old and 947 had at least one type of underlying disease such as hypertension diabetes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease et al awareness of incipient symptoms of covid-19 during the quarantine is important to speed up early detection and reduce poor clinical outcomes therefore regular training for community health workers and comprehensive instruction for people under home quarantine are required as of march 31 2020 there was no other case reported in the study population or in close contacts with our study population there was also no case reported in people who finished home quarantine in shenzhen this indicates that although there was case tested positive after 14 days of home quarantine in our study the risk of second outbreak due to people who complete home quarantine may be low however further information and study is required to estimate if asymptomatic patients are highly contagious the main limitation of this study is that nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected only once according to previous reports 1516 there were cases who were tested negative several times before they confirmed as 2019-ncov infections and laboratory results may show false negatives however as of feb 29 2020 there was no other case reported in the study population another limitation is that this is a sampling survey not a census incidence calculated in this study may not be representative for all the people under home quarantine in shenzhen we used a stratified multistage random sampling method and recruited participants who traveled from epidemic areas within 14 days before the home quarantine although further study is needed to get a more accurate incidence our findings provides preliminary evidence to improve measures of prevention and control of covid-19 especially for areas and cities that need to reduce early transmission from imported cases this study suggests that home quarantine has been effective in reducing the early transmission of covid-19 but that more needs to be done to improve early detection of covid-19 infection regular training and systematic supervision for community health workers as well as comprehensive and feasible instructions for people under home quarantine should be provided since the 2019-ncov has been transmitted in multiple countries caused severe illness and huge disease burden experiences in china should be considered across the

fulminant group had a substantially higher burden of cardiovascular diseases compared to nonsevere cases and survivors non-fulminant group these patients were also found to be at an increased risk of acute cardiac injury and cardiac rhythm irregularities likely owing to the involvement of myocardium in coronavirus infection which is evidenced by the elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers our results are consistent with other meta-analyses which concluded that patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders have a higher propensity to develop severe and fulminant covid-19 infection 37 38 furthermore in a latest study lala et al found that the presence of cardiovascular diseases in covid-19 patients increases their susceptibility to develop myocardial damage and is associated with a

could either be due to cytokine storm suggested by elevated levels of interleukin-6 lactate dehydrogenase among a few other biomarkers or due to the direct effect on the myocardium by causing a

abnormalities is still not completely elucidated myocarditis has been associated with covid-19 and elevation of inflammatory biomarkers can also suggest direct involvement of electrical conduction

that the virus that causes covid-19 transmits mainly through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through air the virus may be present in feces of some cases but spread through this route is not the main feature of the outbreak however the transmission of the virus and progress of the disease in people of different ages remain an area of emerging research 4  limited testing and other challenges in the attribution of the cause of death means that the number of confirmed deaths may not be accurate now there is an evidence that people who do not show sever symptoms can spread it silently also there is slow rollout of diagnostic tests so we dont have a precise case count or know where the virus might spread 5  infectious disease pandemics in recent years have increased

situational predictors of risky behavior during covid-19 michael haupt robert staci weiss meredith michelle chiu raphael cuomo jason chein m tim mackey  the purpose of this study was to explore the factors underlying variability in compliance with cdc guidelines in response to the novel coronavirus or covid-19 to do this we examined the frequency of once ordinary but newly risky behavior as deemed by cdc guidelines in a sample of 482 mturkers we ran analyses probing the situational and dispositional variables that predicted variance in risky behavior using data-driven and hypothesis-generated approaches we found situational and dispositional variables contributed unique variance to risky behavior controlling for variability accounted for by demographic factors more frequent report of risky activity was associated with higher extraversion need for cognitive closure behavior activation and perceived resource scarcity in contrast more frequent report of risky activity was associated with less empathy and living space access as well as younger age to break down these findings we used a cluster analysis to profile individuals using only situational and dispositional variables belonging to seven clusters combined with testing differences in risk taking by cluster identity we suggest this profile approach might allow consideration of multi-faceted attributes that influence adherence with public health guidance in the context of health emergencies like the covid-19 pandemic  and habits it may be adaptive for individuals to alter their beliefs about the consequences or risk involved in neglecting public health guidance prior studies have tracked public sentiment during crises such as the h1n1 pandemic 18 and linked public sentiment during global health and natural disasters including the 2003 sars outbreak with changes in personal risk perception risk-to-benefit evaluations of behavior and health-related compliance behavior 19  interestingly salient threats to an individuals mortality have been associated with both greater risk aversion 20 21 and greater risk-inclination 22  in the first account consistent with terror management theory under threat self-protective tendencies reign and behavior reflects extreme risk aversion 23  in the second account consistent with mortality salience self-destructive tendencies reign control of behavior is depleted and individuals may evaluate the risk for harm as lower andor less likely to affect them 22  variability in risk taking and attitudes in response to threat are partially accounted for by individual differences in age as well as disposition and personality 24  greater risk taking is also associated with lower inhibition higher sensation-seeking and lesser need for cognitive closure 25 26 27 medical conditions disability diagnosis and physical injury can disrupt routines and alter perceptions of risk reciprocally personality traits related to risk-taking propensity such as inhibition sensation-seeking extraversion and poor self-regulation abilities have all been associated with a higher incidence of risky behaviors that may lead to adverse health outcomes 28 29  for example in adolescents with childhood cancer experience and adults undergoing chemotherapy vigilance against health risks is generalized impacting risk sensitivity and evaluation more broadly 30  risk taking in patients with bedrest or homebound recommendations due to their vulnerable condition or compromised immune systems might provide an interesting parallel to individuals responses to the covid-19 stay at home and self-isolation orders 30  the relevance of these psychological factors to covid-19 risk taking and social distance compliance is uncertain as people likely react differently to the multiple interacting aspects of the public health guidance such as the salient mortality threat and heightened uncertainty the mandate to avoid physical proximity to other people and the imperative to enact precautions which prevent contracting and spreading infection adjusting quarantine guidelines based on a deeper understanding of psychological and situational factors can potentially improve public health outcomes especially in the face of increased resistance to compliance under current guidelines that continues to grow after just a few weeks since quarantine restrictions have been implemented in the us during the middle of april 2020 liberate protests were organized around city halls in states such as minnesota michigan and virginia where protesters demanded an end to lockdown restrictions 31  even though polls show that the majority of americans do not support the liberate protests 32  there may still be widespread variability in compliance with public health guidelines one week after the protests tens of thousands of people packed beaches in southern california violating social distancing guidelines 33  concomitantly smartphone movement data revealed a significant decline in social distance adherence on april 14th after three weeks of data consistent with compliance 34  hence though most citizens do not actively protest or resent stay at home guidelines 32  situational dispositional and demographic factors may explain why individuals struggle to comply with stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements from a public health standpoint quarantine fatigue inequities in the ability to comply with public health guidance and liberate protests represent breaks in the firewall of covid-19 public health response and contagion control serving as a potential threat to crucial gains made in flattening the covid-19 epidemiological curve while the impact of the covid-19 pandemic is widespread it appears that people are experiencing different contextual challenges which could influence compliance with social distancing measures in this study we examined the association of variability in psychological dispositions personality need for cognitive closure empathy and sensation-seeking and situational factors age employment living space access and perceived resource scarcity in relation to a newly developed measure of covid-19 risk taking as an index of compliance with social distance measures and stay-at-home guidelines along with demographic features in order to further unpack the individual differences associated with covid-19 risk taking a k-means clustering algorithm was deployed to identify distinct trait and situational profiles using trait and situational variables as inputs we found variability among clusters in the risky behavior which might indicate non-compliance with the stay-at-home measures in addition we found cluster differences in data-driven group classifications of risk propensity  we further assessed variability by cluster in risky behavior and risk perception now that engaging in once-mundane activity has the potential to inflict harm to oneself or others these multivariate approaches afford high-level generalizations that facilitate how researchers and public health officials conceptualize types of individuals within the us population with the goal of providing tailored realistic effective public health messaging to mitigate the spread of covid-19 our survey was developed and piloted in a small sample of undergraduates for distribution via qualtrics it used a range of existing psychological measures and batteries as well as our own and others newly-developed items which were created to interrogate aspects specific to covid-19 participants were consented and compensated at a rate of 7hour for completing the 30-minute survey referred from the amazon mechanical turk mturk database of contractors a total of 514 participants were recruited from amazon mechanical turk mturk with the aim to have a sample size approaching n500 aiming for a power of 80 for even smaller effect sizes after filtering participants who did not pass data quality checks 35  recruitment occurred between april 30 th and may 2 nd following the first full month of quarantine within the united states final sample size was

reflected the ethnic breakdown of the american public according to 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 census data with a significant underrepresentation of individuals identifying as ethnically hispanic 36  age

see table a2 in appendix for more demographic information about the full sample ethics approval for this study was received and granted by temple university irb mturk participants were compensated based on standard survey-taking rates on the platform covid risk taking inventory cri a ten-item questionnaire was developed adapted from the structure and format based on the benthin risk perception scale 37  to assess a set of activities eg attending a gathering of more than 5 people that under the conditions of the covid-19 pandemic are considered risky items were developed to target the discrepancies in activities identified as risky per cdc guidelines in april as opposed to those released originally on march 23 each activity item was followed by four questions that asked about the frequency of engagement since the estimated date when respondents first began modifying their behavior due to covid a risk-benefit comparison and risk propensity toward the self or others the cronbachs alpha for the full scale was above 090 for all the ten items across each of the four sub-questions risk behavior frequency cost-benefit evaluation risk to self and risk to other this measure served as our primary outcome variable factor analysis was used to identify which behaviors were high-risk low-risk and essential travel-related items were not included in further analysis for a full detailed index of the items and questions used see supplementary information in assessing situational factors that may influence self-reported behavior participants were asked to respond to questions relevant to living space access how many rooms within your current residence do you feel comfortable relaxing or spending time in that are not your bedroom this can also include outdoor spaces that are on your property and perceived scarcity of resources it has been difficult for me to get needed resources food toilet paper due to the coronavirus the latter of which was rated on a 7-point likert scale ranging from 1 strongly disagree to 7 strongly agree empathy empathy was assessed by having participants respond to the 7-item perspective taking subscale taken directly from the interpersonal reactivity index 41  with each item rated on a 5-point likert scale ranging from 1 does not describe me well to 5 describes me well need for cognitive closure scale all participants also completed a 14-item version of the need for cognitive closure nfcc scale 42  the adapted questionnaire aimed to measure cognitive closure through 5 subscales order eg i prefer to have a clear and structured mode of life predictability eg i dislike situations that are unpredictable ambiguity eg i feel uncomfortable when i dont understand the reason why an event occurred in my life decisiveness eg when i have made a decision i feel relieved and closed-mindedness eg i feel irritated when one person disagrees with what everyone else in a group believes the scales were rated on a 6-point likert scale ranging from 1 strongly disagree to 6 strongly agree behavioral inhibitionbehavioral activation scales the behavioral inhibitionbehavioral activation scales 43 index the two motivational systems of behavioral inhibition and behavioral activation 44 45  the bis scale includes a subscale measuring sensitivity to aversive motivation eg criticism or scolding hurts me quite a bit the bas scale measures sensitivity to the mechanism underlying appetitive motivation by using three subscales namely drive eg when good things happen to me it affects me strongly fun-seeking eg i often act on the spur of the moment and reward responsiveness eg when i get something i want i feel excited and energized analyses were conducted in r and spss statistical software first we identified which of the activities marked as risky according to the cdc were considered to be risky behavior by the participants and then created a mean index using only the subset of items rated as above average on riskier than the benefit by our sample in order to investigate the variables that contribute most to risktaking behavior we implemented a shapley value regression which assesses the relative importance of all the independent variables within a model by first computing all possible combinations of the independent variables and then determining how much each variable contributes to the total r 2 of the model see budescu 1993 for a more detailed description 46  for our analysis a shapley regression predicting variability in risky behavior was run on all dispositional and situational variables next we ran a series of multiple regressions which aimed to examine whether the dispositional and situational variables that contributed significantly to variance in risky behavior while also controlling for variance accounted for by demographic factors we then parsed out whether this relationship held true for all relevant types of activities which were classified as essential low-risk high-risk and travel using a factor analysis on the 10-item covid risk-taking inventory cri to facilitate the interpretation of these regressions and understand why some individuals differed in their covid risk taking we used cluster analyses to identify personality traits and contextual factors relevant to compliance with cdc guidelines  cc-by-nc-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is

groups for the analysis were created using k-means clustering using variables related to psychological and situational circumstances the final input variables used in the model in this paper are introversion scores measured by the bfi sensation seeking scores measured by bisbas perspectivetaking empathy scores from the iri scale age living space access whether or not the participant lives in a residence with more than 2 common spaces and perceived scarcity how much participants agree with the statement it has been difficult for me to get needed resources food toilet paper due to the coronavirus 1 strong disagree to 7 strongly agree since variables with larger values contribute more to the distance measure in k-means clustering than variables with smaller values 47 we converted the psychometric scales into binary variables using the sample median score pertaining to each trait such that participants with scores below the median are classified as low level and participants with scores above the median are classified as high level by converting the variables into binaries we prevented scales with larger ranges from overcontributing to the model additionally living space access number of common spaces was re-coded into a binary variable from the original 5-point scale wherein responses were split into two groups those who responded between 0 and 3 and those who responded 3 or above we also recoded age into a 4-point scale based on quartile scores of the original continuous numeric variable the final cluster model is the result of an iterative process which tested different combinations of input variables and group number in total 20 models were created and tested during analysis a model was considered viable if it met the following criteria each group within the cluster model must show differentiation from one another every input variable must have unique relationships with each group in the model ie no two input variables should have identical correlations with each group the contribution of each input variable within the model must be statistically significant and the distribution of the total sample must not be overly concentrated in one group table a6a depicts multiple comparison results between cluster means of each input variable to test for differentiation between clusters in order to observe distinctions among groups with overlapping characteristics eg comparing two groups in the same age cohort but differ in psychological or situational circumstances we allowed for some input variables to not have statistically significant differences between a limited number of groups greater risky behavior was indexed based on the average of items rated as having higher risk than benefit risks are much greater than benefits or risks are somewhat greater than benefits greater individual risk propensity was calculated as an individuals regression between each item except those labeled travel and their rating of its riskiness relative to necessity or benefit considering that under typical circumstances these behaviors would be considered highly normative self-other gap in risk assessment was calculated as the difference between an individuals rating of the potential harm to themselves and their rating of harm to others we conducted an exploratory factor analysis to verify the structure of our measure covid risk taking inventory cri the factor analysis used diagonally weighted least squares 48  since reports of risk-taking behavior were ordinal frequency of behavior and an oblique rotation was applied to the factors due to the high correlation among some items 49  a scree plot indicated that three or four factor models were equally well fit for capturing optimal variance the four-factor model was deemed the most appropriate the three-factor model loaded using public transit and carshare service items with other high-risk low-frequency behaviors such as meeting with a stranger in person for essential business while the four-factor model included these items as a separate factor since we did not have participants report base rates for transit or use of car andor carshare service the travel factor was difficult to interpret thus we excluded it from further analysis the rank loadings are reported along with sample variable descriptive statistics in table 1   cc-by-nc-nd 40

activities included attending a gathering with more than five guests not in your household as well as interacting with a stranger for essential purposes another variable was used to estimate overall engagement in risky behavior which averaged all items from both low-risk and high-risk factors and was deemed normally distributed using the wilck-shapiro test of normality and visual inspection as

outbreak communication guidance and ultimately impact the effectiveness of covid-19-related interventions to gain insight into the personal attributes and contexts that contribute to cdc guideline adherence we probed the significance of these apparent differences in risk taking and general activity by dispositionalsituational clusters in addition to an effect for overall activity and risky activity we found significant differences by cluster in low-risk and high-risk activities which are subscales of the cri identified using sample-specific ratings of the risk-to-benefit or necessity there were no significant differences in essential activity by cluster analysis which further corroborates the selectivity of cluster input variables we suggest that extending beyond simple demographics contextual and psychological tendencies allows for the discrimination of risky behavior from ordinary or necessary activity for our sample 42 of participants were identified based on their situational-dispositional cluster as risk-inclined compliant and in fact engaged in more frequent risk taking especially for high-risk activities like attending gatherings and meeting with a stranger while we do not claim that this proportion is reflective of the actual proportion of us citizens engaging in high-risk activities due to sample restraints it appears that while the new normative behavior is to comply with public health guidance there is a sizeable proportion of individuals who may not be able or willing to adhere to certain recommendations finally an exploratory analysis indicated that self-other risk evaluation might have a non-linear association with cluster risk engagement which was ranked by risk tendency across all items participants consistently viewed the perceived risk to other as greater to themselves except for the use of public transit we found a quadratic effect such that individuals identified as normative compliant the majority of

observed in risky behavior in the present study is a distal or proximal mechanism related to theories of mortalitymotivated changes in risk behavior the results from this study show that psychological and situational factors impact risk-taking behavior which could result in non-compliance with social distancing guidelines our cluster model shows that groups exhibited a wide array of behaviors and attitudes towards the covid-19 pandemic indicating that underlying psychological and situational factors could drive some variability in behavioral compliance with public health guidance our analysis of risk-taking behavior also identified two riskinclined groups clusters 3 and 4 that exhibited a higher propensity for engaging in currently high-risk activities members of both these groups were more likely to be conservative-leaning and reported high perceived scarcity of goods suggesting a potential political agenda for their risk engagement and attitudes however these were distinct populations who differed significantly in age sensation-seeking and region density upon further investigation we found that these risk-inclined clusters were more likely to report circumstances relevant to their exposure employment perceived scarcity and limited living space along with their higher engagement in high-risk activities it is possible that engagement in highrisk activities was partially driven by the circumstances that these individuals have encountered and may not be solely due to demographic factors and psychological dispositions this interpretation is also supported when examining risk-averse groups such as clusters 2 and 7 who avoided high-risk activities but were also less likely to be affected by these situational factors in general since situational circumstances may make individuals more vulnerable to contracting covid-19 and in many cases are outside the direct control of these individuals these factors may be intractable issues that significantly impair the

example if clusters 3 and 4 are the most likely to be essential workers and have to work on a job-site then it is not surprising that they also engage in more high-risk activities compared to clusters 2 and 7 who are less likely to work around people clusters 2 and 7 are also the least likely to report that the covid-19 pandemic has impacted them financially while clusters 3 and 4 are the most likely which suggests that the groups who engage more frequently in non-compliant behavior are also the ones who are most vulnerable to the pandemic based on these results we recommend that circumstantial differences be considered when communicating social distancing guidelines and also when developing policy approaches to ensure equitable and targeted outbreak control and response put simply current quarantine stay at home and social distancing measures may not adequately take into account the complex cooccurrence of dispositional and situational factors that drive both compliance and non-compliance among the public the combination of these characteristics may be independent of demographic factors often identified as barriers or enablers for health behavior and should be taken into account in public outreach our dispositional-situational clusters also provide initial insights into the combination of characteristics that may influence receptivity to health messages that can

prevention programs could lead to even higher drug usage 53  it is possible that recommending guidelines that urge people to stay home could induce feelings of confinement rebellion or mortality salience leading to greater risk-taking behavior further multivariate people-centered approaches to analyses which consider both dispositional and situational variability are advised for examining the efficacy of public health interventions messaging can be tailored for types of audience to further assess the utility of language used for persuading the public and in laws enforcing public health guidelines there is a need for these types of assessments to be scaled for a larger number of respondents to include a more generalized cohort representative of the us population in light of the recent reconceptualization of risk as a matter of routine our findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how individual differences in attitudes and circumstances influence risk perception moreover these outcomes show that the wider deployment of profile-centric approaches to assess public health compliance and messaging efficacy may be useful in critical efforts to flatten the covid-19

argued by the economists that many of the parameters controlling the move among compartments are not structural however it depends on individual decisions and policies for example according to eichenbaum et al 20 and farboodi jarosch and shimer 21  the number of new infections is a function of the endogenous labor supply and consumption choices of individuals which is determined by the rate of contact and by the standard decision theory models where the rate of contact is amenable similarly the death rates and recovery rates are not just clinical parameters moreover it can be used as functions of policy decisions for example by expanding emergency hospital capacity may increase the recovery rate and decrease death rates also in this case the fatality ratio is a complex function because it depends on many clinical factors therefore the selection-into-disease mechanisms are themselves partly the product of endogenous choices 22  moreover concerning with the identification problems of compartmental models economists atkeson 23 and korolev 24 have found that these models lack many set of parameters that is able to fit the observed data efficiently before the long-run degradable consequences some of the researchers linton 25 and kucinskas 26 used time-series models utilizing the econometric tradition other than using compartmental models however many of the economists are pushing the study of compartmental models in a multitude of dimensions acemoglu et al 27 and alvarez et al 28 identified that the optimal lockdown policy for a planner who wants to control the fatalities of a pandemic while minimizing the output cost of the lockdown berger et al 29 examine the role of testing and case-dependent quarantines bethune and korinek 30 estimate the infection externalities associated with covid-19 bodenstein et al 31 examine a compartmental model with a multi-sector dynamic general equilibrium model other researchers like garriga manuelli and

social distancing flavio toxvaerd 36 also developed a simple economic model emphasizing on endogenous social distancing furthermore many of the economists commented that coronavirus infection transmission cannot be a biologically induced constant rather it can be varied with human behavior and the change in human behavior can be predicted in response to changing social policies another

imposing social distancing among people moreover we tried to focus on the reproduction rate  which is not a constant but varies with time based on the demographic and policy heterogeneity according to the conventional sir model for the n number of constant population each of whom may be in one of five states with respect to time implies that while a susceptible person can be affected by the disease when comes in contact with an infectious person the sir model is used to predict the vulnerability of any type pandemic which may not be applicable to coronavirus cases since this model assumes the reproduction rate as a constant the virus seems to be diminished when all affected people will be recovered which is practically not possible the affected people by corona virus are highly contagious to other people who come in contact to them thus the spreading of coronavirus infection is increasing day by day therefore a mathematical model of the spreading of it can help predicting its vulnerability and while to take some efficient measures to lowering the contact rate the modified behavioral sir model is presented by 38   cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under

steady over time then the situation is considered under control after letting people go back to the normal life with no restriction the situation may get back with more severe affects then the coronavirus pandemic might be uncontrolled with high deaths in the first wave while by taken possible measures and consciousness of people to avoid contact can reduce the infection rate and death rate furthermore after lowering the death rate people ease up and a second wave of infection rate appears so forth therefore the reproduction rate r cannot be constant as it varies with the behavioral change of people and policy taken to control the pandemic the covid-19 is a current global issue which spread in almost every country of the world and caused restriction to the free movement of people resulting a massive economical loss worldwide transmission rate r  is the number of newly infected individuals derived from a single case is the factor that can calibrated the reproduction rate of coronavirus utilizing the sir model in the traditional sir model taking ro as a constant cannot predict the actual scenario of coronavirus spreading the value of r can be different for different places and time period moreover ro can be changed with the behavioral changes of people because of the adopted policies by respective authorities therefore in this research r is not considered a constant rather it is used as a time varying function by taken the possible measures to reduce the social contact r can be minimized with the time causing less death and forecasting to reopen the economy  a method to identify the missing covid-19 cases in the us and results for mid-april 2020 theodore breton r theodore breton richard  i use the covid-19 death rate in south korea and a method relating the ratio of death rates in a us state to its share of cumulative positive tests to estimate the total cases of covid-19 in the us and to estimate the extent of infection and the unidentified share of the infected population in each of the lower-48 states and in new york city in mid-april 2020 i identify a logarithmic relationship between the cumulative death rate in a state and its cumulative positive share of tests using this relationship i find that 43-54 million people 14-17 of the us population were infected with rates of infection that ranged from 01 in more rural states to 8-10 in new york state and 11-13 in new york city only 16-20 of these infected individuals were identified later through testing  1 extremely limited testing for covid-19 until recently and the uncertain share of asymptomatic cases has led to considerable speculation about the extent of infection in the us population in this paper i use state level data on positive covid-19 test rates and associated deaths combined with an estimate of the death rate from the virus in south korea to estimate the number of coronavirus cases in each state in new york city and in the us in total the methodology presented in this paper is similar to the methodology in breton 2020  but the data used in this paper to estimate the share of infection covers a longer period and the interpretation of the models results has been revised based on new information i have developed a methodology to estimate the unidentified cases of covid-19 in the us that utilizes death rates in south korea and in the lower-48 states of the us and the share of cumulative positive tests in the lower-48 states the methodology is based on a series of assumptions 1 unlike all other countries south koreas documented experience with the coronavirus is accurate and complete 2 south korea and the us are sufficiently similar in their medical treatment capacity to have similar actual death rates deathsinfected individuals for covid-19 for similar age distributions of patients 3 the reported share of positive tests in a us state or region is an indicator of the share of infected individuals tested with a higher positive share inversely related to the share of total cases identified by tests 4 the expected death rate in a state associated with its share of positive tests divided by the death rate in south korea provides a valid ratio of the total casesidentified cases in the state i do not use the death rate in each state directly to estimate unidentified cases in the us because state death rates vary based on the particular populations infected in the state eg the elderly in nursing homes instead i use the death rates in all of the states to estimate a relationship between the expected death rate and the share of cumulative positive tests in a state i do this because the share of positive tests in a state is likely to relate more closely to the share of covid-19 cases that have been identified than the states particular death rate the critical element in implementing my method is to account properly for the lags between contagion the onset of symptoms the reporting of test results and deaths the typical lag between contagion and death is 23-27 days boyd 2020  due to delays in us testing in april 2020 this means that positive tests for covid-19 identified infection that occurred 8-12 days earlier and relate to deaths that occurred 11-19 days later i use the estimated average lag between the reporting of covid-19 positive tests and death to identify the related deaths and calculate the death rates in south korea and in the lower-48 states that correspond to the reported cases in early april i use an assumed lag of 19 days from the onset of symptoms to death to calculate the death rates this lag is consistent with the estimate of 18-21 days in the uk boyd 2020 and verity et als 2020 estimate of 178 days in china i use reports on testing delays to estimate the lag between test results and deaths i then plot the death rate in each state vs the share of positive tests on april 7 th and use a logarithmic trendline to determine the relationship between these two variables in the state data i calculate the ratio between the estimated death rate in the us and in south korea to determine the relationship between the actual total cases and the reported cases in each state or in a subregion of a state i use this relationship to estimate the identified and unidentified shares of the total cases in the states on april 25th which in total provides a national estimate of the infected population in the us in mid-april i validate the methodology by examining whether the estimate of the unidentified share of cases in a state is consistent with its reported testing strategy and the availability of testing in march and early april since the states did not test asymptomatic individuals i also examine whether the estimated shares of unidentified cases are consistent with an estimate of the asymptomatic share of all cases in a screening study carried out in iceland in this study 100 of 13080 06 participants tested positive and were quarantined for 14 days during which 43 reported that they were asymptomatic gudbjartsson et al 2020  the study excluded individuals with severe symptoms that would be hospitalized a who-china joint mission determined that about 20 of all symptomatic cases in china required hospitalization verity 2020  assuming this ratio is applicable in iceland i reduced the estimated asymptomatic share to 38 and use this share to further test whether my estimates of the range of unidentified shares of covid-19 cases in the us are plausible the death rate used in this study is the share of positive cases of covid-19 that end in death i use data from south korea to estimate the actual death rate in the us the government of south korea implemented a contact tracing strategy to identify all of the individuals infected with covid-19 in the country including those with no symptoms and then tracked these individuals to determine the associated deaths table 1 presents the data for the cumulative cases of the virus and the associated deaths in south korea during april since the number of new cases declined to almost zero during the month there must not have been many asymptomatic individuals who were not tested identified and quarantined this means that south korea is unique among countries in including all of its asymptomatic cases in the national estimate of total covid-19 cases the government of the republic of korea 2020 reports that in early april the delay between testing and reporting results was 2-3 days i assume 19 days between the onset of symptoms and death and three days between the onset of symptoms and test confirmation which leaves 16 days as the average lag between confirmed test results and death  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under a

1  there were 10156 cumulative confirmed cases of the virus in south korea on april 4 th  and there were 236 cumulative deaths from the virus sixteen days later on april 20 th  this yields a 23 death rate for all cases this rate could be low if some deaths related to the cases are yet to occur or are not included in the statistics but this is unlikely the data in the table show that in the two days prior to april 20 th there were only 21 new cases and two new deaths these numbers are so small that slight increases would have no noticeable effect on the ratio of cumulative deathscumulative cases in mid-april in addition deaths are unlikely to be underestimated because south korea tested all suspected cases and attributed all deaths of persons who tested positive for the coronavirus to the virus even if they had other underlying health conditions afp-jiji 2020 the average death rate for covid-19 in a country is very sensitive to the age distribution of infected individuals in a country because death rates are much higher for older patients the south korean death rate is only applicable for the us if the age distributions of covid-19 patients are similar in both countries the age distribution of all cases is known in south korea but it is not known in the us because such a small fraction of the covid-19 cases have been tested the distributions of the known cases in the us in mid-april includes 40 in the over-60 category compared to 25 in south korea breton 2020  the higher reported incidence in the us is due at least in part to the failure to test individuals who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms a category where younger individuals are more prevalent taking this characteristic into account the age distributions of infected individuals do not seem very different in the two countries so i conclude the south korean death rate of 23 is applicable for the actual death rate in the us when all cases of covid-19 are included several groups track the numbers of us tests confirmed cases and deaths from covid-19 by state and publish their results several times a day these data can be used to  cc-by 40 international license it is made available under

prioritize testing connor 2020   priority one hospitalized patients and symptomatic healthcare workers  priority two high-risk patients with coronavirus symptoms  priority three symptomatic individuals in the community if resources allow none of these priorities included asymptomatic individuals the likelihood that tests would be positive was highest for individuals in priority one and lower in priorities two and three as a result as the number of tests increases testing is extended to groups less likely to test positive and the positive share of cumulative tests declines states or cities overwhelmed with coronavirus cases tested only a small fraction of the individuals they thought were infected and obtained a very high share of positive tests figure 1 shows the share of cumulative positive tests by state for the lower-48 states and south korea on april 7 th  using us data published in politico jin 2020  these data show that about half the states had shares of positive tests under 10 with the lowest share at 3 all of the states had a higher share of cumulative positive tests than south korea 2 five states had shares of cumulative positive tests over 20 and three states had shares over 30 these three states new jersey new york and michigan reported tremendous limitations on their capacity to test individuals with covid-19 symptoms maag 2020 reports that in late march 2020 very sick new jersey residents spent many nights in their cars waiting in line at testing stations after being turned away in emergency rooms in late march new york city restricted testing to hospitalized patients to prevent the many infected individuals with less serious symptoms from leaving home cuzey 2020  michigan restricted testing to those with the most serious symptoms

that they could not test everyone who needed a test becker 2020 and mooney 2020  even in mid-april after testing capacity in the us improved relative to the number of suspected covid-19 cases tests in most locations were still rationed to the higher priority applications connor 2020  death rates deathsinfected population for covid-19 calculated from the confirmed cases for most states are much

likely explanation for the higher death rates in the us is that a large share of infected individuals are not included in the data if this is the case then we should also expect to see a strong positive correlation between the death rates and the share of cumulative positive tests across states a higher share of individuals testing positive is almost certain to indicate that the covid-19

estimate the total number of actual covid-19 cases in each state or in a subregion of a state the sum of all the actual cases in the states can be used to estimate the infected share of the us population equation 2 is based on the assumption that the reported deaths due to covid-19 in the us are as complete as the reported deaths in south korea as discussed earlier south korea tracked and tested all individuals likely to have covod-19 and attributed any deaths of patients who tested positive for covid-19 to the virus this is not the case in the us because some deaths from the virus involved patients who died at home or in nursing homes without ever being tested for the virus these deaths were attributed to pneumonia to some underlying condition or to some fatal physiological response to the virus such as a stroke coroners are now reviewing deaths that occurred over the last few months and increasing the deaths attributed to covid-19 but these deaths are not included in the new york times 2020 data this means that the death rate in equation 1 and the ratio of total casesidentified cases in equation 2 are underestimated wu mccann katz and peltier 2020 have compared the surge in mortality in new york city from march 11 2020 to april 25 2020 relative to the average for the same period in 2017-2019 to the number of covid-19 deaths in the new york times data the sudden increase in deaths in 2020 is 25 higher 420016673 than the reported covid-19 deaths which could be unreported covid-19 deaths they show similar trends in numerous european countries given this information the estimates from equations 1 and 2 should be considered a lower bound on us covid-19 death rates and on the ratio of totalreported cases of covid-19 a more reasonable estimate of these two variables appears to be a range from the values estimated by the equations to values that are 25 higher the validity of this estimated range for total covid-19 cases in each state can be evaluated by examining the plausibility of the estimated unidentified shares of cases in the states with the lowest and highest shares of positive tests in april given the reported availability of tests in those states in late march and early april applying equation 2 and a value 25 higher in montana the state with the lowest share of positive tests 37 on april 25th indicates that the state identified 31-38 of its covid-19 cases since 38 of all cases are estimated to be asymptomatic if the state did not identify any of these cases then it identified 50-61 of the symptomatic cases since most cases are mild or moderate with symptoms not obviously due to covid-19 this estimate seems reasonable even given the relatively high level of testing in the state applying equation 2 and a value 25 higher in new jersey the state with the highest share of positive tests 496 on april 25th indicates that the state identified only 14-17 of its covid-19 cases since 38 of the cases are estimated to be

unidentified overall only 16-20 of all cases have been confirmed through testing leaving 80-84 unidentified the minimum unidentified share ranges from 60 to 83 across states the total number of cases in the us was 43-54 million yielding an infected share of the population of 14-17 the rate of infection varies dramatically across states from about 01 in montana and west virginia to a range of 76 to

south korea managed to control the spread of the virus through a contact tracing process but they only had 10600 total cases the results indicate that no state has managed to identify even half of the covid-19 cases so it is difficult to control the spread but it is also clear that not all states have been severely affected by the virus with rates of infection in mid-april ranging from as little as 01 in rural states to a high of 76-95 in new york state the wide differences in rates of infection indicate that different strategies are appropriate to manage the virus in different states contact

viral pneumonia called coronavirus disease 2019 which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection 44 at the time of this writing the disease has been reported to affect 634835 people in more than 45 200 countries territories or areas and cause 29891 deaths 1 understanding the clinical and 46 epidemiological characteristics of the disease is important for informing public health decision 47 making which would enable improvement of surveillance and effective planning of treatment in in china and in other parts of the world 3-12 however most of these reports were limited by a 52 small sample size and the characteristics reported appeared to be inconsistent for example in 53 a report involving 99 patients chen et al 3 noted a much higher proportion of men than 54 women and suggested that men were generally more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection on 55 the other hand shi et al 4 found that the male-to-female ratio among the 81 patients included 56 was close to 11 indicating that both genders were equally susceptible to 57 the world health organization who has declared covid-19 a global pandemic and the 58 contagion shows no sign of slowing down 13 thus it is a timely prompt to obtain a more 59 precise understanding of the disease by combining all available data in the literature in this 60 study a systematic review and pooled analysis

disease is important for effective surveillance and 132 public health response measures to be implemented in a timely manner currently although we 133 have some basic understanding of the clinical and epidemiological features of covid-19 134 patients our knowledge is insufficient this is because inconsistencies still exist in the findings 135 of many published reports and the sample sizes in most of these reports were too small for a 136 reliable summary to be made in this work a systematic review and pooled analysis was 137 performed to combine data from 69 previous reports in order to yield a more accurate summary 138 of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 patients 139 in many instances susceptibility to viral infections may be related to factors such as 141 gender and smoking habits 72-74 for the former it is believed that x chromosome 142 inactivation in females may cause cellular mosaicism which ensures the presence of at least 143 one functional copy of x-linked immune genes thus conferring women an increased resistance 144 against viral infections 75 in addition estrogen the major female sex hormone is known to 145 promote adaptive immune response 76 while testosterone the primary sex hormone in men 146 could contribute to the suppression of the innate immune response rendering men more 147 susceptible to viral infections 77 78 on the other hand cigarette smoking may reduce the 148 level of circulating immunoglobulins immune cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as 149 disrupt the response of antibodies to antigens 72 for these reasons some studies have 150 suggested that men and smokers are more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infections 3 79 in the 151 present work we noted that the ratios of male to female and smokers to non-smokers were 152 close to 11 although the relative risk or odds ratio of the association between these variables 153 and sars-cov-2 infection could not be computed due to the lack of a comparison

were generally non-157 specific thus the disease cannot be reliably distinguished from other infectious diseases based 158 on the symptoms alone the most commonly observed symptoms were similar to those of the 159 previous coronavirus disease outbreaks mers and sars ie fever cough and myalgia or 160 fatigue nevertheless compared to mers and sars the proportion of afebrile patients was 161 much higher in covid-19 1679 cf 2 in mers and 0-1 in sars 80 this indicates that 162 a significant number of covid-19 patients would be missed if surveillance and monitoring 163 systems focus largely on temperature screening as commonly practiced in airports 81 82 164 the present work also showed that dyspnea was observed in only 1697 of the patients this 165 contradicts with advisories and guidelines published by many health authorities which suggest 166 that dyspnea is a commonly observed symptom in  besides it was observed 167 that 080 of the patients were asymptomatic currently whether asymptomatic patients can 168 transmit the virus to other individuals is not fully known but it is highly possible 35 thus 169 although the number of asymptomatic patients was low identifying and isolating such patients 170 to prevent uncontrolled disease spread would prove very challenging it is therefore important 171 for diagnostic tests to be performed on asymptomatic medium-and high-risk individuals to 172 facilitate early detection and prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission in addition to nucleic acid 173 testing using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction some studies have 174 suggested the potential usability of chest ct for covid-19 diagnosis 90 91 however in the 175 present work we found that 586 of the patients did not have abnormalities on ct scans thus 176 although ct findings have substantial accuracy in identifying the disease 90 91 the results need 177 to be interpreted with caution 178 179 sars-cov-2 is known to infect a cell by

mahir demir michael wise morgan suzanne lenhart  as the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 rages throughout the world accurate modeling of the dynamics thereof is essential however since the availability and quality of data varies dramatically from region to region accurate modeling directly from a global perspective is difficult if not altogether impossible nevertheless via local data collected by certain regions it is possible to develop accurate local prediction tools which may be coupled to develop global models in this study we analyze the dynamics of local outbreaks of covid-19 via a coupled system of ordinary differential equations odes utilizing the large amount of data available from the ebbing outbreak in hubei china as a testbed we estimate the basic reproductive number r0 of covid-19 and predict the total cases total deaths and other features of the hubei outbreak with a high level of accuracy through numerical experiments we observe the effects of quarantine social distancing and covid-19 testing on the dynamics of the outbreak using knowledge gleaned from the hubei outbreak we apply our model to analyze the dynamics of outbreak in turkey we provide forecasts for the peak of the outbreak and the total number of casesdeaths in turkey for varying levels of social distancing quarantine and covid-19 testing  in late 2019 the city of wuhan in the province of hubei china experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019  the disease caused by the novel coronavirus sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 this outbreak quickly spread to all states of china and across the globe being declared a pandemic by the world health organization who on 11 march 2020 the authorities imposed a strict lock-down on the city of wuhan and other cities of the hubei province on 23 january 2020 world health organization 2020b  in the face of over sixty-seven thousand cases and over three thousand deaths the authorities continued strict enforcement of these measures chinese physicians 2020 coronavirus covid-19 global cases by johns hopkins csse 2020 finally on 23 march 2020 hubei reached a significant milestone as the provinces health commission reported no new cases for seven consecutive days world health organization 2020b the new york times 2020  shortly thereafter after over two months of severe restrictions on the movements of the hubei population the 2020 hubei lockdowns were relaxed as the hubei outbreak began to wane inspiring hope that the global pandemic might be able to be controlled previous studies of covid-19 provided the evidence of human-to-human transmission and revealed its similarity and differences from sars chan et al 2020 huang et al 2020 xu et al 2020  however data-driven simulation-based studies are needed to understand the dynamics of the ongoing outbreak indeed it is of the utmost importance to use these tools to investigate the effectiveness of public health strategies such as the number of covid-19 tests carried out to detect the infected the level of quarantinesocial distancing and its efficiency in the transmission of studies investigate dynamics of this pandemic from a global perspective see

both quality and availability of data from region to region make direct global modeling of the dynamics of this pandemic exceedingly difficult as a result in this study we develop a model for dynamics of the pandemic from a local perspective the many hotspots of covid-19 combined with the many travel restrictions in place throughout the world further suggest that local models might provide more practical insights into the dynamics than their global counterparts indeed it stands to reason that accurate models for local regions can be coupled to develop reasonable models for larger regions as of 23 march 2020 around one-quarter of the global covid-19 cases and consequent deaths occurred in hubei the large proportion of data available from hubei combined with the regions recent achievements toward managing their local outbreak suggest that the data from this region presents an excellent picture of the lifetime of an outbreak of covid-19 indeed as countries worldwide close their borders cities and regions and impose their own shelterin-place quarantine or lockdown orders in the face of the pandemic the large amount of data available from hubei provides an excellent testbed for modeling the dynamics of a local outbreak of covid-19 in this study we start by developing a seiqr type deterministic model which uses a system of ordinary differential equations to analyze the dynamics of the outbreak in particular highlighting the effect of testing and the effects of quarantine and social distancing in hubei we present estimates of the basic reproductive number r 0 of covid-19 in hubei and perform a sensitivity analysis to deduce which parameters play significant roles in the transmission and control of the outbreak in hubei in addition we also provide 15-day forecasts of the fatality rate of the outbreak the number of cases and the number of deaths depending on the data chinese physicians 2020 coronavirus covid-19 global cases by johns hopkins csse 2020

outbreak and the total number of casesdeaths in turkey utilizing the extant covid-19 data from turkey ministry of health turkey 2020 a deterministic compartmental model has been developed by using ordinary differential equations odes to understand the dynamics of covid-19 in hubei china chubb  jacobsen 2010 keeling  rohani 2008 kot 2001  in the model the total population n t at time t is divided into the following six compartments susceptible st susceptible 3 in quarantine isolated class s q t exposed et infected asymptomatic or having mild symptoms it reported infected cases hospitalized if get severe symptoms or quarantined if get mild symptoms i q t and recovered rt note that all individuals who upon testing test positive are immediately isolated the transition flows among compartments are given in figure 1  the rate of reported cases i q denotes the number of individuals who transition from the infected class i to the reported class i q per day it is also directly related to the daily number of covid-19 tests carried out during the outbreak figure 1  flow diagram illustrating the disease transitions among the compartments susceptible individuals make the transition to the s q t compartment with a rate of note that the main indicator of quarantine is the number of reported cases i q  when the number of reported cases increases in a state or country then the quarantine is imposed or naturally taken as an option thus when the number of reported cases increases then percentage or amount of people quarantined will increase if the number of reported cases falls to zero the transition rate from s to s q is zero and from s q to s is q s  the individuals in s and s q compartments transition to compartment e exposed with a force of infection given by and disease transmission rate  note that since the individuals in s q transition to e compartment less frequently a reduction factor r is taken into count in the model after an incubation period of 1

matrix ngm as the spectral radius of the ngm is the basic reproduction number r 0 defined as the average number of secondary cases arising from an average primary infected case in an entirely susceptible population the dfe is locally stable if r 0  1 van den driessche  watmough 2002 diekmann et al 2010  the spectral radius of the ngm given in 2 since we do not consider the individuals in s q compartment as a part of the dfe we do not see any effect of quarantine on r 0  however s q indirectly changes the other parameter values such as  i q  therefore r 0 value changes with s q indirectly note that   are positively correlated with r 0 and i q   i   i  d are negatively correlated with r 0 for the system 1 note that we might control the disease with increasing quarantine rate of infected individual i q  thus if then the dfe is locally stable and the disease dies out when sufficiently close to dfe biologically if the infected individuals can be detected in a sufficiently short time another word the number of test to detect the number of cases increase then the disease can be controlled in this part we estimate the parameters in the system 1 so we fit our model with the daily reported cumulative number of cases and deaths which are provided by world health organization 2020b and chinese physicians 2020 we use the ordinary least squares ols method and minimize the sum of the squares of differences between the daily reported data and those predicted by our model the goodness of the fit is measured by computing the associated relative error of the fit using the formula where c i and l are exact and estimated cumulativeinfected cases and d i andd l are exact and estimated cumulative deaths to estimate the number of covid-19 deaths we sum the number of deaths coming from the infected class i and the reported infected class i q  note that the natural deaths in the infected class i and the reported infected class i q are also included in the total number of deaths we used an ode45 solver with fmincon from the optimization toolbox of matlab by using the initial conditions s0  59 000 000 s q 0  0 i q 0  258 and r0  0 we estimate all the parameters of the

depicted in figure 2  these figures show a reasonably good fit with the total relative error 006 6 most of the error comes from the fit of cumulative cases especially around february 12 2020 in february china began to report clinically diagnosed cases in addition to laboratory-confirmed cases and on february 12 2020 13332 clinically rather than laboratory cases reported even though they were diagnosed in the preceding days and weeks due to the very small number of cases reported after march 23 2020 we chose to fit the model using only data from before this date table 1  in this section we discuss 15-day forecasting of the outbreak the effect of quarantine and the effect of testing in hubei we also conduct a sensitivity analysis to see which parameters play important role in the dynamics of the outbreak when we look at the change in the quarantine class nearly the entire province of hubei was quarantined by february 15 2020 see figure 3  february 15 corresponds the day 25 in the figure the percentage of the population transitioning from the susceptible class to the quarantine class attains its maximum level between january 27 2020 and february 10 2020 and by february 15 almost all of the population were in quarantine this result makes sense since the state government imposed a quarantine in the state on january 23 2020 initially recommending quarantine and finally forcing the people into quarantine to guarantee social distancing this action seems to have worked to great effect reducing the contact rate by about 989 see table 1 for the parameter r the reduction

the right plot depicts the estimated number of reported infected cases i q  as it can be seen the number of individuals in each of these classes tends to zero which implies that the outbreak is almost over and so new cases may not be recorded in hubei as it can be seen from the change in infected class the outbreak reaches its peak about february 9 2020 the infected class i also shows how many

during the outbreak to identify the infected people thus increasing the number of tests will increase the rate of case reporting i q  this will reduce the number of cases see figure 6  and consequently the number of deaths due to the outbreak when we increase the rate of reported infected cases i q by about 10 the number of cases and number of deaths are estimated to be 36040 and 1639 respectively decreasing the rate about 10 the number of cases and number of deaths are estimated to be 14084 and 6724 respectively in the part we fit the model 1 with available covid-19 data from turkey ministry of health turkey 2020 we fit the model 1 with turkish data from march 10 2020 to april 10 2020 and get about 59 relative error in the fit by using the equation 3 we estimate the four parameters i q  s q   and r which are not only the most significant parameters in the dynamics of outbreak but also are specific to each country since they are related to the number of covid-19 tests administered i q  the number of individuals in quarantine s q  the contact rate of individuals  and the efficiency of quarantine r in each country therefore by using the initial conditions s0  83 000 000 s q 0  0 i q 0  1 and r0  0 we estimate these four parameters together with the initial number of exposed and infected individuals we do not estimate the rest of the parameters employing the parameters in table 1  therefore our results in this section will depend on observed dynamics of the outbreak in hubei as well as the available turkish data ministry of health turkey 2020 note that the quarantine rate and the rate of reported cases which we stress is related to number of covid-19 tests can be increased and the increase still may have significant effect toward the reduction of the number of cases see figure 6  sensitivity analysis but increasing the reduction rate r does not make very significant changes by way of the number of cases in turkey since it is very close to its maximum level see figure 6  sensitivity analysis part thus we will vary only the quarantine rate s q and the rate of reported cases i q in forecasting the peak of the outbreak and the number of

terms of numbers of covid-19 tests conducted per day turkey is now doing a better job than hubei china at a comparable time in hubeis outbreak the efficiency of quarantine also seems to be very good in turkey given the approximately 85 reduction in the contact rate of covid-19 obtained by our parameter estimation on the other hand the quarantine rate is about 0088 which is small when compared with the quarantine rate in hubei the rate was 0096 in hubei in hubei the population transitioned to quarantine class very quickly almost in two weeks but in turkey the movement to quarantine has been very slow in comparison see figure 8  suggesting why the contact rate is higher in turkey when we compare to the contact rate in hubei see table 1 and 3 for these rates it is still possible to increase the quarantine rate the rate per day of transition to quarantine class and the number of covid-19 tests given each day in turkey to make a reduction in the number of cases and deaths see figures 9 and  10  in figures 9 and 10  the red curves are obtained using base parameters from table 1 and 3 and the other curves obtained by varying the quarantine rate s q and the rate of reported cases i q  when we use the base parameter values which are obtained from our fitting turkey then will have about 203700 cases and 8269 deaths if turkey can increase the number of individuals in quarantine and the number of daily covid-19 tests then depending on the magnitude of the increases the number of cases and deaths can decrease significantly see figures 9 and 10  when we look at trajectories of cumulative cases and deaths in figures 9 and 10  in the worst-case scenario the black curves of the study turkey will have about 281500 cases and 11430 deaths these projections decrease to 148100 cases and 6005 deaths if turkey can increase the number of individuals in quarantine and the number of covid-19 tests  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a

reported cases i q our analysis suggests that quarantine greatly reduced the number of cases and deaths seen in hubeis covid-19 outbreak in addition while quarantine does not appear in the representation of r 0  it still indirectly reduces r 0  we also saw that the dynamics of the outbreak is very sensitive to the quarantine rate s q and contact rate  as indicated by our sensitivity analysis the basic reproductive number is estimated as 549 and the study shows that any change in  or i q directly affects the basic reproductive number the quarantine decidedly reduces the number of cases and deaths increasing or decreasing the speed of movement from the susceptible class to the quarantine class by about 10 would double or half the number of cases and deaths due to the outbreak this speed of movement is controlled by the rate s q  of course the efficiency of the quarantine is also very important in our model the efficiency of the quarantine measured by the reduction rate r the reduction rate shows how much reduction is effected in the contact of covid-19 thanks to the quarantine based on our sensitivity analysis this parameter is very important see figure 6  our model shows that the quarantine in hubei was almost perfect since it caused about 989 percent reduction in the contact rate of covid-19 another important parameter that plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the outbreak is the rate of reported infected cases i q which is directly related to the number of tests given to detect infected individuals similar to the quarantine rate s q  the rate of reported infected cases i q could double half when we have 10 reduction or increase in the rate as of 30 march 2020 there were no reported cases in hubei in the past week and the total number of cases and total number of deaths were 67801 and 3187 respectively based on our 15-days forecasting the number of cases in hubei was projected to be about 67994 and the number of deaths was projected to be about 3254 thus we estimate the fatality rate of the outbreak to be about 48 in hubei our model gives about 6 relative error and we are confident that using the model will be helpful for forecasting local outbreaks of the pandemic in other regions from existing covid-19 data from turkey and the dynamics of our model understood from the hubei analysis the outbreak in turkey is expected to reach its peak between april 20 and april 26 depending on the number of individuals amount of people in quarantine and the number of covid-19 tests carried out each day in turkey the daily number of tests given in turkey is large when we compare to the rates of reported cases in hubei as we showed in the sensitivity analysis increasing the number of covid-19 tests and the number of individuals in quarantine will significantly reduce the number of cases and deaths based on our forecasting the number of cases will be about 203700 with the range 148100 and 281500 and the number of deaths will be about 8269 with the range 6005 and 11430 depending on quarantine rate s q and the rate of reported cases i q in turkey thus in any cases that are given in figure 9 and 10 the fatality rate of covid-19 will be about 41 in turkey  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity is the which was not

televisionmovies and participating in other online skill development programmes  the novel coronavirus disease covid - 19 pandemic which was first detected in december 2019 has continued to ravage the entire world the outbreak started in wuhan china1 has since spread to almost all the countries of the world 2  six months since the first case was reported the number of confirmed cases has risen to over nine million -9633157 2  mortality from the disease is high and was estimated at 490481 by june 27 2020 2  although the number of cases was slow to rise in africa they have been increasing exponentially 3 in the last two months threatening the already weak health structure 4 on march 11 2020 the world health organisation who declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic disease due to its spread all over the globe and how it has affected lifestyle and social interactions 5  even though it started in china it has rapidly spread throughout the world affecting almost all countries of the world except isolated islands with few populations it has been termed as a public health emergency of international concern by the who 6  the first case of coronavirus in nigeria was confirmed on february 27 2020 7  following which the nigeria centre for disease control ncdc issued several guidelines for curtailing with the spread in line with the internationally-approved standard 8  these measures notwithstanding the number of cases continued to rise and was estimated at 24 077 by june 27 2020 9  already by march 2020 the spread of the virus had led the federal and state governments and their various parastatals to shut down activities in the country by march 23 both land border and air space had been closed the weekly meeting of federal executive council suspended among other measures 10  on monday march 23 2020 the nigerian university commission nuc ordered the lockdown of all universities and affiliated schools 11 the lockdown has led to a halt in academic activities and students going home or discontinuing their industrial training -an unplanned break in addition to that there was a lockdown of activities in three major states in the country from march 30 2020  and a partial lockdown in most other states involving the cessation of all social and religious gatherings 12  the result was that residents of lagos and ogun states and the federal capital territory in particular where there was total lockdown as well as those of other states where there was partial lockdown had to spend most of their time at home many employers have since made it possible for their employees to work from home while many private and secondary schools are taking measures to engage their students unfortunately the reverse is the case among public tertiary institution students who form the main bulk of nigerian youths even before academic activities were halted due to the coronavirus pandemic university staff across the country had already embarked on industrial action from march 9 2020 13  hence there was no plan in place to engage public tertiary institution students during the covid-19 lockdown besides the inability to have industrial traininginternship in companies due to the lockdown a feeling of being stalled in academic progress could lead to the development of anxiety or other psychological disorders since the period of youth is perceived as a period of opportunities 14  it is also not clear what role their family functioning may be playing in their psychological state given the increase in the incidence of mental disorders particularly anxiety and depression among young people 15  examining the psychological state and coping mechanisms of undergraduate students in nigeria has become crucial this assertion is in line with a significant function of nurses in caring for the biopsychosocial state of individuals whether sick or well further the who had reported in 2019 that mental health problems account for 16 of the global health burden among people aged 10-19 years 16  it further asserted that if left undiagnosed and untreated it could lead to a myriad of physical and mental health issues hence preventing such individuals from living fulfilling lives as adults 16  some authors have reported an increased prevalence of anxiety and depression among universitycollege students in china and greece during the lockdown 17 18 19 20

three months the response rate for the survey was high as the sample size of 386 was reached within a week most of the participants were female 60 although the male female student ratio in the school is usually around 5347 27  the higher percentage of females who participated in the study could be associated with the higher interest of women in psychology-related issues the dominance of women in psychology is supported by clay 28 who stated that there are more females in the field of psychologyboth in education and the workforce similarly cope et al 29 found a significantly higher number of females enrolled for postgraduate programmes in psychology than male as high as 75 female compared to 25 male a trend which had been occurring for about ten 10 years students with one or more chronic illness s had a significantly higher level of anxiety and depression compared with those who did not have such a disease this is supported by wang et al 30  who reported a higher level of psychological distress among people with a medical history of chronic illness in a population-based study involving 1210 people in china contrary to the findings of some authors 18 19 31  in which female participants had a significantly higher level of depression than their male counterparts during the covid-19 pandemic there was no significant association between gender and anxiety or depression among the participants in this study the difference may be associated with the variation in the demography whereas the present study was carried out among university students aged 16 to 30 years these previous authors  18 19 31 carried out their survey among all age groups the present findings are in keeping with that of some other authors 17 32 33  which were all carried out among university students it is possible that other factors such as age combine to make females more prone to psychological distress however another study 34 among university students in china showed a significantly higher prevalence of depression among female students although measures of socioeconomic status including the number of cars owned by the family private income and living in a personal house were not associated with anxiety and depression students who could not afford three square mealsday had a significantly higher level of anxiety and depression often though being able to provide

doi medrxiv preprint background cao et al 17 had also reported that poor socioeconomic status was associated with anxiety among the university students who participated in their study with those of poor economic conditions experiencing more considerable anxiety at the beginning of the lockdown the federal government and some state government had promised palliative measures to citizens of the country to ease the economic burden of the lockdown however due to limited resources the palliative measures could only be provided to the poorest of the poor this socioeconomic group is mostly resident in the rural parts of the country and constitute 4966 of the population 35  therefore those in the urban areas which is where most university students live were not provided with palliatives hence the inability to have three square meals on the prevalence of anxiety whereas cao et al 17 reported that about 25 of chinese university students had mild to severe forms of anxiety during the covid -19 in this study a higher percentage of nigerian university students 415 experienced mild to severe forms of anxiety the higher rate could be associated with different periods of data collection while cao et al 17 collected data in february 2020 before the pandemic reached its peak in most parts of the world data collection for this study occurred in may 2020 a period during which the cases were increasing exponentially in nigeria some authors 36  had reported a lower rate of anxiety 148 before the covd-19 pandemic among undergraduate students in five universities in south-western nigeria again this is not surprising since several studies that took place in italy united states china and spain 18 19 20 32 37  have averred that the lockdownself-quarantine associated with the covid-19 was putting a lot of psychological strain on college students further mild to severe depression was present in 319 of university students who participated in this study of which one-third were adolescents aged 16-19 years there was no significant association between the age categories and depression therefore this prevalence could be applied to the adolescent age group who participated in this study although there is no national data on the prevalence of depression among nigerian youths there are reports of studies carried out in the same geopolitical zone where the present study was conducted for instance the prevalence found in this study is higher than that earlier reported for nigerian adolescents 38  in which 212 of rural adolescents in south-western nigeria were found to have varying degrees of depression it is not surprising that more participants in this study experienced depression since the covid-19 lockdown was something that put emotional strain on many people likewise a similar prevalence  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity

substances were elicited from the participants at the time data that was collected on depression this information might have brought on some negative feelings leading to a higher score on depression moreover students who lived alone did not experience a significantly higher level of anxiety compared with those living with family or friends mazza et al support this finding 18  since most participants were young adult it could be that those living alone were able to fend for themselves and therefore did not suffer from a significantly higher level of anxiety furthermore results of post-hoc anova showed that students in non-health related faculties had a considerably higher level of anxiety than those in health-related fields this interfaculty difference is congruent with what was reported in another study among college students in china and spain 34 37  another contributory factor to depression among undergraduate students was family functioning participants with poor family functioning experienced mild to severe depression while those with good family functioning were not depressed as mentioned earlier staying alone or with family or friends did not significantly influence the experience of depression yet staying with family or friends as almost all the participants did while experiencing poor functioning was a significant factor causing depression cao et al 17 had reported a negative correlation between social support and anxiety such that as social support increases anxiety reduces further li et al 40 reported that good family function was associated with a decreased level of psychological distress among health professional students this was also the position of jianjun et al in a study among undergraduate students in china 41 besides the top three coping methods used by the undergraduate students included social media -whatsapp status challenges instagram among others -watching television or movies and  cc-by-nc 40 international license

jordan as reported by al-tamemmi et al 33  also students in states where there was a total lockdown experienced a significantly higher level of depression this difference is logical since states with lockdown had a higher number of cases and the students must have experienced increased susceptibility to the coronavirus infection coupled with lack of social gatherings or religious interaction this is in consonant with what was reported by some authors in studies involving higher institution students in china 42 43  another interesting finding is the students responses regarding their willingness to speak to a health professional if they were experiencing anxiety or depression on the whole factors that were significant from the univariate analysis and included in the linear regression showed that that not being able to afford three meals in a day poor family functioning having a chronic illness and having a total lockdown in the state of residence accounted for 14 of depression seen among participants in the study in conclusion the lockdown associated with covid-19 has placed a lot of psychological stress on university students as more than a third of those who participated in this study had varying degrees of anxiety and depression it is recommended that measures such as financial palliative or provision of food to needy families counselling of dysfunctional families and appropriate education and support of students with chronic illnesses be put in place to alleviate the psychological distress of these students there is also a need for recommencement of academic activities through online engagement to positively channel the energy of the university students cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the

aimed to estimate the total number of covid-19 related infections deaths and hospitalizations in iran under different physical distancing and isolation scenarios we developed a susceptible-exposed-infected-removed seir model parameterized to the covid-19 pandemic in iran we used the model to quantify the magnitude of the outbreak in iran and assess the effectiveness of isolation and physical distancing under five different scenarios a 0 isolation through e 40 isolation of all infected cases we used monte-carlo simulation to calculate the 95 uncertainty intervals ui under scenario a we estimated 5196000 ui 1753000 -10220000 infections to happen till mid-june with 966000 ui 467800 -1702000 hospitalizations and 111000 ui 53400 -200000 deaths successful implantation of scenario e would reduce the number of infections by 90 ie 550000 and change the epidemic peak from 66000 on june 9 th to 9400 on march 1 st  scenario e also reduces the hospitalizations by 92 ie 74500 and deaths by 93 ie 7800 interpretation with no approved vaccination or therapy we found physical distancing and isolation that includes public awareness and case-findingisolation of 40 of infected people can reduce the burden of covid-19 in iran by 90 by mid-june we received no funding for this work  evidence before this study iran has been heavily impacted by the covid-19 outbreak and the virus has now spread to all of its provinces iran has been implementing different levels of partial physical distancing and isolation policies in the past few months we searched pubmed and preprint archives for articles published up to april 15 2020 that included information about control measures against covid-19 in iran using the following terms coronavirus or 2019-ncov or covid-19 and iran and intervention or prevention or physical distancing or social distancing we found no studies that had quantified the impact of policies in iran given the scarcity of evidence on the magnitude of the outbreak and the burden of covid-19 in iran we used multiple sources of data to estimate the number of covid-19 infections hospitalizations and deaths under different physical distancing and isolation scenarios until mid-june we showed that implementing no control measures could lead to over five million infections in iran 19 of whom would be hospitalized and 2 would die however under our most optimistic scenario these estimates could be reduced by 90 with no effective vaccination or treatment advocating and enforcing physical distancing and isolation along with public education on prevention measures could significantly reduce the burden of covid-19 in iran nonetheless even under the most optimistic scenario the burden of covid-19 would be substantial and well beyond the current capacity of the healthcare system in iran the covid-19 was declared a pandemic on march 11 2020 and the disease is now expected to spread worldwide the risk is relatively low for the general population although people aged 65 years and over those with suppressed immune systems and people with underlying medical conditions eg cardiovascular or respiratory diseases are at increased risk of adverse outcomes the case fatality rate of the infection is estimated to be around 2 95 ci 2-3 and as of april 15 2020 a total number of 2049888 confirmed cases 510486 recovered cases and 133572 death have been reported worldwide 1 iran is one of the hardest hit countries by covid-19 and has been struggling with controlling the disease for over two months the first confirmed cases of covid-19-related deaths were reported on january 21 in the city of qom 200 km away from irans capital city of tehran as of april 15 2020 a total number of 76389 confirmed cases 49933 recovered cases and 4777 death have been reported and covid-19 has spread to all of its provinces 2 figures that are highest among the eastern mediterranean region countries 3 the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed seir model provides a mathematical framework to explain the spread of infectious diseases and has previously been used for estimating the epidemiological parameters of several infectious diseases such as measles ebola and influenza 4 5 6 seir could also help evaluate the impact of implementing various interventions eg isolation and physical distancing policies aimed at controlling the growth of the pandemic and flattening the epidemic curve physical distancing also called social distancing control measures are policies that aim to minimize close contacts within communities and include individual-level eg quarantine isolation and community-level closure of educational and recreational settings nonessential businesses and cancellation of publicmasscrowded gatherings approaches 7 8 in iran the physical distancing and isolation interventions were scaled up in late february and early march by nationwide closure of schoolsuniversities cancellation of sports events and fridaycongregational prayers as well as the closure of all non-essential services tourism sites and shopping malls figure 1  iran also closed its holy shrines in mashhad and qom in mid-march moreover while there were no mandatory shelter-in-place or lockdown orders people were encouraged to stay at home people were also asked to avoid travelling during the new year holidays ie nowruz from march 19 to 26 however no restrictions for domestic via flight train or bus or international travels ie no border closure were imposed 9 despite implementing various physical distancing control measures our understanding of their impact on the magnitude of covid-19-related new infections hospitalization and death remains limited in this study we aim to provide an estimate of these epidemiological parameters and approximate the peak date of the epidemic in iran under different physical distancing and isolation scenarios these estimates are of particular importance for covid-19-related health policy planning and financing purposes in iran we formed a compartmental model to estimate the total number of covid-19 patients hospitalizations and deaths in

was considered in calculating the transmission probability beta coefficient of the disease indicating the potential for some level of change in transmissibility of the virus from one season to another10 therefore we assumed that covid-19 might behave the same as influenza such that the transmission of the virus may tend to reduce by approaching to warm seasons ie spring and summer we then considered the end of december in winter with the most transmission probability and the end of june in summer with the least transmission probability the minimum and maximum values of the seasonal changes were considered to be 002 and 0045 respectively a time-varying state was considered for the effective contact rate c parameter we first incorporated value of 14 in the tehran model and 13 in

stepwise lifting of the physical distancing measures would reduce the magnitude 92 by mid-2020 24 by end-2020 the epidemic and delay its peak by two months and therefore avoid overwhelming the healthcare systems 15 in iran a recent executive order from the government lifted the restrictions on nationwide business shutdown and allowed most people to return to work only 25 months after the

industrial business technical service and distributional sections as well as removing the shelter-in-place order and resuming domestic and international travels these decisions are mainly derived from the iranian governments economic challenges that have been elevated by the comprehensive sanctions imposed by the usa 2122 while these concerns are understandable and longer shutdown of an already overstretched economy is a tough decision and would be very taxing on the government and the public our findings as well as lessons learned from china 152324 suggest that this approach is not

authorities there had been 988 covid-19 deaths in iran with more than 16000 confirmed infections345 this respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus is one of the leading causes for serious illnesses in people all over the world according to the global statistics of fatalities caused by coronavirus and its spread in iran it is vital and essential to forecast its outbreak by a model as the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a worldwide pandemic it is rapidly expanding in iran real-time analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions previously real-time analyses have shed light on the transmissibility severity and natural history of an emerging pathogen in the first few weeks of an outbreak such as with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars the 2009 influenza pandemic and ebola analyses of detailed line lists of patients are particularly useful to infer key epidemiological parameters such as the incubation and infectious periods and delays between infection and detection isolation and reporting of cases however official individual patient data rarely become publicly available when the information is most needed this is an analysis of the covid-19 out-break in iran in this population-level observational study i used iranian ministry of health reports downloaded from github an online data-sharing platform this dataset is updated on a daily basis with a 24 hour delay the dataset include time-stamped counts of the daily cases and deaths within each province in iran in this study we will build a

small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable variation in value such as annual fluctuation in temperature relative to the season trend is a tendency in the data to increase or decrease over time the predictive model will be tested against four regression model evaluations for robustness they are as follow  mae -mean absolute error this gives less weight to the outliers  mape -similar to mse but normalized by true observation the downside is when true observation is zero this metric could be problematic  mse -mean squared error it is like a combination measurement of bias ad variance of the prediction for eample bias squared add variance  rmse -root mse this takes the root of mse to bring the unit back to actual value it is the standard deviation of residuals prediction errors residuals are a measure of of how far from the regression line data points both mae  rmse can range from 0 to infinity they are negatively-oriented scores lower values are better the akaike information criterion aic test will be applied to the predictive model this purpose of this test is to see how well the model fits the dataset without over-fitting it the aic score rewards models that achieve a high goodness-of-fit score ad penalizes them if they become over complex a low aic score indicates a better fit  cc-by-nd 40 international license it is made available under a is

across the 5 sampled provinces although it has a low mape when compared to the other three statistical metrics like rmse mae mase it yields the highest margin of error in the group the quality of the predictive model for tehran is acceptable because the dataset is more robust compared to one integrated with seasonality the mean absolute scaled error mase is less than 1 for the projected 90 days

manifest mild symptoms the prevalence and the contribution of asymptomatic or mild infection to disease transmission is an emerging area of research 21-23 deaths from covid-19 predominate in the elderly and are commonly associated with a hyper-inflammatory state 24 it is not clear why this harmful immune response is rare in children understanding the presentations of covid-19 disease in children and how they differ from the presentations of more common childhood viral illnesses should lead to a better understanding of the observed profound variation in morbidity and mortality between adults and children 25 the main limitation of this study is that pediatric data are yet to be reported for most countries data would not have been recently been updated on all websites and data on hospitalizations were missing from most websites data from the publications will already be out of date the number of reported cases is very much determined by testing algorithms which may favor testing of elderly adults over children the age ranges that were analyzed were not uniform with the upper limit for the pediatric age range varying from 14 to 19 years the data in the current study

nanoparticles as a life-saving strategy for treating covid-19 patients rasha itani mansour tobaiqy achraf al faraj   coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that belong to the coronaviridae family they were named for the crown-like spikes on their surface and were reported to cause diseases in humans and few animal species with wide spectrum of severity to date four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses have been identified named alpha beta gamma and delta 1 considered one of the largest among known rna viruses the genome size of coronaviruses which are enveloped with a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry ranges from approximately 27 to 34 kilobases with a diameter of around 125 nm 2 the first known severe illness in humans caused by a coronavirus emerged in 2003 in china and resulted in the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic 3 a second outbreak of severe infection occurred in 2012 in saudi arabia and led to the middle east respiratory syndrome mers 4 a novel strain of coronavirus causing severe illness was recently reported in december 2019 in wuhan china and was subsequently named sars-cov-2 figure 1 on 30 january 2020 the world health organization who emergency committee announced a global health emergency based on significant number of confirmed cases and on 11 february 2020 gave the disease an official name covid-19 which stands for corona virus infectious disease - 2019 the virus has raised world concern because of its high transmission rate as well as high mobility and mortality 5 the number of confirmed cases is increasing daily and can be tracked in almost real time on the website of the who website 6 person-to-person transmission of sars-cov-2 is expected to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced during coughing sneezing and talking and largely resembles the spread of influenza 8 however transmission can occur when an infected person with or without symptoms are in close contact with a healthy one or when one touches an infected surface and then touches his or her eyes nose or mouth 9 the period between infection and symptom onset might range from 2 to 14 days 10 it is mainly believed that sars-cov-2 droplets do not typically travel for more than 2 meters and do not remain in the air however van doremalen n et al reported under experimental conditions that sars-cov-2 aerosols can remain viable for up to 3 hours in aerosols 4 hours on copper 24 hours on cardboard and 2 to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel 11 studies have shown that patients with underlying diseases such as hypertension lung disease and cardiovascular disease may have higher mortality risk than other patients 12 13 another study suggested that other risk factors related to developing acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and progressing to death include age neutrophilia organ failure and coagulation dysfunction 14 however these studies are still limited due to the lack of sufficient information about this novel covid-19 disease and the limited number of patients included in these studies this article will first review the proposed conventional treatments that are currently under extensive research and clinical trials then the advantages of theranostic nanoparticles with a special focus on the optimal formulations for intranasal administration of the various therapeutic agents will be discussed finally a special focus will be devoted to the development of nanoparticles-based treatment modalities that are projected to considerably improve covid-19 therapy currently there are no validated vaccines or specific antiviral treatments for covid-19 most treatments currently used including cardiovascular hemodynamic or respiratory are supportive that is they support patients suffering from the virus unfortunately these treatments are given to relieve complications and side effects but do not efficiently kill the virus therefore extensive research and clinical trials evaluating potential therapy are still imminently necessary to develop a successful treatment for covid-19 one must understand well the mechanism of action of the virus resembling sars and mers coronaviruses this novel sars-cov-2 uses a lock and key mechanism in which the angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 acts as a key to enter specialized cells holding its lock 13 these target sites can be found in the lungs heart arteries kidneys and intestines cells once inside the virus will use the host cells organelles to replicate and infect other cells based on that a treatment that prevents the viruss entry into the cell may be of benefit what is common about all target cells for sars-cov-2 is the ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 a key regulator of endocytosis richardson p et al proposed using a machine learning software benevolentai that drugs associated with aak1 may suppress viral access into the target cells 15 however high doses of these inhibitors such as oncology drugs sunitinib and erlotinib will be required but could unfortunately lead to serious side effects 16 furthermore the simulations also showed that not all aak1 inhibitors could cause severe side effects for example baricitinib a janus kinase jak inhibitor can bind to another endocytosis regulator cyclin g-associated kinase and inhibit aak1 thus preventing the virus entry into the cell in addition to being used in cases of rheumatoid arthritis it can be investigated as a potential treatment to fight against covid-19 17 other potential inhibitors to fight covid-19 include the complementary use of human immunodeficiency virus hiv protease inhibitors such as lopinavir and ritonavirin that have been shown to suppress the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease of sars and mers 18 several phase iii and phase iv clinical trials have been initiated to assess the efficacy of these antiviral drugs for instance phase iv open prospectiveretrospective randomized controlled cohort study was designed to assess the efficacy of lopinavirritonavirin antiviral drugs in the treatment of covid-19 viral pneumonia nct04255017 a clinical study is projected to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of baricitinib vs lopinavirritonavir along with 2 other medications in hospitalized persons with moderate to severe covid-19 disease nct04321993 other suggested alternative treatments under extensive investigation include virally targeted agents mainly remdesivir a nucleoside analogue that targets the rna-dependent polymerase and suppresses viral rna synthesis in a broad spectrum of rna viruses including human coronaviruses remdesivir is an approved hiv reverse transcriptase inhibitor that has shown broad-spectrum activities against rna coronaviruses in cell cultures and animal models 19 20 holshue m et al reported the successful recovery of a sars-cov-2 infected patient receiving intravenous administration of remdesivir with no adverse events 21 to further assess its safety and efficacy several phase 3 clinical trials were initiated in patients with covid-19 nct04292899 nct04292730 and nct04252664 a very promising treatment option that started to be applied in several countries involved the use of chloroquine or hydroxy-chloroquine antiviral and wide spread drugs previously used against malaria and autoimmune diseases 22 a protocol comprising the use of hydroxy-chloroquine reinforced by azithromycin revealed encouraging outcomes for efficient treatment of covid-19 however potential effectiveness was mainly observed in the early impairment of contagiousness and treatment should be administered under close monitoring of physicians due to concerns about the risk of arrhythmic death a chloroquine-based drug was reported to inhibit the fusion of sars coronavirus with the cells by acidifying the lysosomes and thus inhibiting catherpsins that require a low ph for optimal cleavage of sars-cov-2 spike protein 23 it is assumed that chloroquine can either alter the molecular crosstalk of sars-cov-2 with its target cells through suppression of kinases ie mapk or interfere with proteolytic processing of the m protein and affect virion assembly and budding furthermore chloroquine can indirectly act by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines andor by activating anti-sars-cov-2 cd8 t-cells 24 cortegiani a et al have recently reviewed the efficacy and safety of chloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 25 however despite these proposed treatment options currently under extensive research and clinical trials the death toll of patients infected with this novel coronavirus is still increasing therefore efforts should in parallel focus on alternative approaches in order to achieve an effective treatment while minimizing side effects although mucosal vaccination mostly intranasal is the preferred route of vaccination against infectious diseases treatment modalities currently under investigation use the systemic route this is mainly because intranasal treatment needs to overcome many hurdles such as low intrinsic permeability for some drugs limited volume of administration rapid mucociliary clearance and enzymatic degradation before they reach the targeting site due to the unique characteristics of the mucosal environment therefore the delivery of most proposed therapies to specific sites of the body by means of nanoparticles np ensures that these agents achieve a concentration several times higher than those obtained via conventional methods in the targeted sites of infection while limiting any side effects on normal cells nanoparticles made from lipids are particularly attractive for biomedical applications owing to their enhanced biocompatibility imparted by the lipid material among the various lipid-based formulations adapted for intranasal delivery are liposomes which are spherical capsules having an outer phospholipid bilayer and an inner hydrophilic core designed to hold aqueous therapeutic agents 31 liposomes offer numerous advantages including efficient encapsulation of the conjugated agents and simple modification to further enhance their mucosal and cellular uptake and improve their biocompatibility 32 like any other type of nanoparticles surface charge plays an important role in affecting the pharmacokinetic properties of liposomes in fact studies carried on cationic liposomes following intranasal administration showed higher absorption and enhanced bioavailability compared to their negatively charged counterparts this is due to the negative charge of the mucosal membranes leading to electrostatic attraction of these positively charged nanoparticles as well as reducing their clearance by the mucosal cilia 33 furthermore liposomes were reported to have great potential for mucosal vaccinations as their retention in the nasal cavity induces a high immune activity leading to the production of higher levels of immunoglobulins 34 polymer-based nanoparticles were reported as an attractive delivery system mainly due to the possibility of tailoring their properties and functions to a specific application they can be synthesized by the addition of several monomers into various configurations including linear branched and 3d networks ie highly branched 35 and thus their size shape and surface charge can be easily optimized to allow a controlled release of their cargo under external conditions 36 out of the many formulations of polymer nanoparticles those made of chitosan attracted particular interest for intranasal administration due to their nontoxic nature biocompatibility biodegradability into non-toxic products in vivo capability to open up tight junctions between epithelial cells 37 and ability to be easily modified into desired shapes and sizes 38 upon conjugation with therapeutic compounds chitosan can enhance persistence of polymeric np in mucosal environment and penetration to mucosal tissue dendrimer are radially symmetric molecules with well defined homogeneous and monodisperse structure similar to polymer dendrimer np can be synthetized in highly branched 3d networks with greater ability of attaching many functional groups on their surface and encapsulating non-water soluble hydrophobic therapeutic agents in their core 39 this allows the potential use of these nanoparticles in various therapies against tumors bacterial and viral infections 40 with the strong interactions that they make with viruses dendrimers showed enhanced antiviral activities preventing the infection of the host consequently they became an important tool in the treatment of viral infections such as hiv and influenza virus infections 41 nandy b et al reported the development of poly-l-lysine pll-based dendrimeric nanoparticles with anionic naphthalene disulphonate surface that can block the entry of hiv viruses by binding to the viral envelope protein gp120 and preventing the formation of the cd4-gp120 complex 42 chahal j et al developed dendrimer np encapsulating an antigen-expressing replicon mrna this nanoformulation offered vital cd8 t-cell and antibody responses that can efficiently protect against lethal exposures to several deadly pathogens including ebola h1n1 influenza and toxoplasma gondii pathogens 43 engineered inorganic nanoparticles are attracting special interests due to their ability to not only act as conventional delivery systems to efficiently deliver loaded cargo to target sites but also to allow stimuli-responsive characteristics and intrinsic capability of some types ie magnetic or gold nanoparticles to be monitored following in vivo administration to human body using noninvasive medical imaging 44 while inorganic np are extensively investigated in preclinical and clinical studies for the detection diagnosis and treatment of many diseases some concerns are still arising about their safe clinical applications 45 to overcome this researchers are working on functionalizing inorganic np with various types of biocompatible materials thus offering the potential benefits of both organic and inorganic nanoparticles gold nanoparticles have shown special interest in vaccine development as they can easily trigger the immune system via internalization by antigen presenting cells the synthesis methodologies significant progress and future prospects of the use of gold np for new mucosal vaccines were reviewed 46 gold nanoparticles can be easily adapted and customized for intranasal delivery and can have the advantage of being readily diffused into lymph nodes thus activating cd8 t-killer cell-mediated immune response 47 furthermore gold nanoparticles owing to their high atomic number can also function as excellent highly stable and biocompatible contrast agent for x-ray based medical imaging especially in computed tomography ct 48 virus-like np vlnp are sphere-shaped nanoparticles composed of several molecules with sizes ranging between 20 and 200 nm these nanoparticles result from the self-assembly of proteins derived from viral capsids they were introduced as attractive nanomaterials as they do not contain genetic material but have the ability for accurately mimicking the real virus or antigen in terms of structure and antigenic determinants this makes these nanomaterials highly attractive to antigen presenting cells that can be readily identified and consequently can trigger an immune response 49 studies performed following intranasal delivery of vlnp derived from the influenza virus lead to enhancing the immunity against this virus by triggering significant types of immune responses cellular and humoral hence they act as a vaccine that can prevent further infections ie influenza virus by producing a significantly high amount of antibodies and t-cells 50 another advantage of vlnp is their high potential to be used as a vector in gene therapy where they can be used as a smart system to accurately deliver a transgene to the site of the mutation or repair genes in aim of changing gene expression or encoding a protein 51 moreover vlnps promising treatment rely on the fact that they can easily prevent enzymatic degradation compared to the naked administration of viroids viral dna segments and they have extremely small size allowing their penetration into the cellular nucleus 52 interestingly these innovative vlnp can be also adapted to be detected using various noninvasive medical imaging modalities ie mri and pet and thus offering a theranostic platform for next-generation diagnosis and treatment of viral infections 53 self-assembling protein nanoparticles sapn are novel type of np obtained from the oligomerization of monomeric proteins with a dimeter ranging from 20 to 100 nm self-assembly is defined as the autonomous organization of molecules into a more stable structure by using non-covalent bonding mechanisms to achieve equilibrium 54 it has paved the way for developing robust and functional np for various applications these nanoparticles can be engineered using many biomaterials with peptides being the most favorable due to the fact that these protein-based np can be easily developed and modified for numerous applications 55 they were assessed in drug delivery given their distinguishing ability to cross the cellular membrane and specifically and safely deliver drugs genes and nucleic acids directly to the cells nucleus 56 kanekiyo m et al reported the synthesis of sapn that elicit broader and more effective immunity ie tenfold higher haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres than traditional influenza vaccines following intranasal inoculation and thus provide a promising platform for developing broader vaccine protection against emerging viruses and other pathogens 57 as previously mentioned drugs associated with aak1 may suppress virus access into the cells however high doses of these suppressors such as oncology drugs sunitinib and erlotinib will be required but could unfortunately lead to serious side effects therefore the use of np as smart nanocarriers that can selectively enhance the delivery of such drugs to target cells will certainly reduce the required doses and arising side effects while providing a more efficient treatment drug delivery system dds conjugated with either sunitinib 58 59 or erlotinib 60 were extensively assessed for treatment of cancerous diseases as an example xu h et al investigated a dds-based on erlotinib-conjugated liposomes for treatment of lung cancer results showed that this nanoformulation can considerably enhance the drug targeting improve the drug biodistribution following in vivo administration in the body ie 3 months stability and significantly increase the relative bioavailability of the drug ie fast and sustained release within the first 4 hours 61 once such oncology drugs that are associated with aak1 are validated to effectively suppress viral access into the target cells in covid-19 np formulations conjugated with these drugs and optimized for either intranasal or intravenous delivery are expected to provide positive outcomes for covid-19 treatment since coronaviruses are positive ssrna viruses that use orf1a and orf1b replicases rna interference rnai could be an efficient approach to control the virus by silencing the viral mrna at particular stages in human cells 62 rnai technology inhibits the expression of the homologous sequence in a target rna by incorporating small non-coding rnas into cells to a multi-protein rna-induced silencing complex risc after identifying the sequence to be inhibited small interfering rnas sirna will be separated from risc and link to that specific section 63 complementary strands of appropriate mrna will then get degraded using special enzymes therefore sirnas can play a crucial role in regulating virus infections and replication 64 sirna were reported as a very successful candidate to fight against viruses as they can be identified designed and synthesized to attack every possible viral mutation 65 several studies reported the efficacy of sirna in inhibiting viral replications such as in hepatitis c virus hcv 63 however one of the essential factors that lead to the success of this potential treatment is their specific and selective delivery to target sites the administration of naked or unprotected sirna will be potentially exposed to degradation by enzymes and lead to several side effects including toxicity instability and filtration by kidneys and reticuloendothelial system res 66 therefore optimizing specific nanocarriers to deliver this fragile molecule to its target is essential sohrab s et al recently reviewed the design and delivery of therapeutic sirnas for treating mers-coronavirus 65 the delivery of sirnas was enhanced by using novel nanocarriers such as lipid inorganic or polymeric nanoparticles the effective delivery of sirna via lipid nanoparticles revealed promising results against several viral diseases 67 various formulations of lipid nanoparticles lnp such as liposomes solid semisolid or liquid state or nano-emulsions were evaluated lnp protect sirna from nucleases improve their biodistribution ensure selective delivery to the desired sites and enhance the bioavailability of therapeutic compounds with low solubility 68 inorganic nanoparticles such as gold magnetic iron oxide and silica nanoparticles in addition to quantum dots qds and carbon nanotubes cnts were evaluated as potential carriers for sirna 69 gold np emerged as attractive nanocarriers and were investigated as sirna carrier and target-specific gene silencing against viral and cancerous diseases owing to their unmatched biocompatibility flexible configurations and surface modifications and effective delivery mechanism 70 polymeric nanoparticles either natural ie chitosan or synthetic ie polyethyleneimine pei have been also assessed as drug or gene carriers and can be potentially used to specifically deliver sirna in covid-19 cases chitosan-based np have proven efficient in inducing protective immunity against various infectious diseases 37 and have been investigated in the formulation of various vaccines including hbv vaccines 71 newcastle disease vaccines 72 and dna vaccines 73 as previously discussed knowing sars-cov-2 infection mechanism will help developing a successful treatment luckily mers-cov and sars-cov-2 share the same membrane protein the key which is the spike protein s protein therefore both viruses infect host cells using the s protein mediated fusion between their membranes 74 the s protein which is the base for mers infections contains 2 subunits s1 and s2 that control the host cells binding to the virus through dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 receptor 75 therefore inhibiting this fusion will offer a promising approach to similarly treat sars-cov-2 huang x et al proposed the use of pregnancy induced hypertension pih as powerful heptad repeat 1 hr1 peptide inhibitor that suppresses hr1hr2-mediated membrane fusion between mers coronavirus and host cells as the key pathway of mers-induced host infections they showed that this peptide inhibitor when delivered via gold nanorods revealed 10 times enhanced inhibitory activity when compared to free pih 76 moreover this nanocomplex showed high stability and biocompatibility with promising prospective application for mers treatment and similar coronaviruses with the continuous evolution of new and mutated strands of viruses the development of effective and safe antiviral treatments to that specific strain becomes more challenging due to the variation in their genetic compositions and the need for specific antiviral agents theranostic nanoparticles can also play a major role in not only killing the virus inside the body but also preventing the virus entry into the cells owing to their high specific surface area and the ability to adhere to multiple antigens andor compounds on their surface nanomaterials such as gold np and carbon quantum dots cqds were reported as promising tools for interacting with viruses and preventing their entry into cells 77 a study carried on boronic acid conjugated carbon dots np demonstrated efficiency and success in inhibiting hiv entry by suppressing syncytium formation 78 in another interesting study oczechin a et al showed that boronic acid ligands conjugated with cqds interfered with the function of coronavirus s protein and considerably stopped its entry into the host cells 79 it was reported that the addition of these np to the cell culture medium before and during infection with coronavirus considerably reduced the infection rate of the cells remarkably after one viral life cycle ie 55 hours for coronavirus a great inhibition activity was also detected at the viral replication step these nanomaterials with an average diameter of 10 nm and excellent water solubility showed as promising candidates for winning the battle against coronavirus because they easily enter the cell through endocytosis and interact with the viruss protein thereby preventing viral genome replication with the significant advances in vaccine development great interest and huge efforts have focused on developing vaccines that mimic the virus using virus-like nanoparticles vlnp np were reported to enhance transport in the lymphatic system compared to smaller subunit antigens 80 moreover np have the ability to display several antigens on their surface facilitating the stimulation of the immune system compared to antigen presenting cells apcs that can only present one type of antigen on their surface 81 this has shed the light on the importance of np not only as carriers of therapeutic material but also as efficient stimulants of the bodys immune system thus having a double synergetic function np are known for their high surface energy that leads to strong adhesion of biomolecules 82 this ability can be exploited in order to imitate viral features and characteristics efficiently and thus stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies and immune cells to fight viral infections 83 in a study combining 100 nm gold np with the s protein of infectious bronchitis virus ibv chen h et al reported increased stability when using the developed vlnp as well as significant retention of these s proteins about 900 s proteins per particle compared to viral antigens 84 moreover this study emphasized the delivery enhancing abilities of gold np compared to free circulating compounds especially in the lymphatic system where the strong adhesion between np and the s protein increased the delivery 6 times most importantly it was concluded that these vlnp resulted in the synthesis of higher igg levels due to the enhanced delivery by the gold np that lead to increased uptake by cells and intensified complement activation 84 in another study coleman c et al reported protection induced by vaccination with a recombinant mers-cov s np vaccine and matrix-m1 adjuvant combination that were able to efficiently and completely block mers-cov replication in the lungs of mice 85 the mers-cov s np vaccine produced high titer anti-s neutralizing antibody and protected against mers-cov infection in vivo in mice these studies proved the promising advantage of np conjugated with s protein as a potential and successful vaccine to not only stimulate the immune system but also to protect humans from mers-cov and thus can be applied to sars-cov-2 as both coronaviruses have the same key ie spike protein the highly contagious novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 that has infected so far more than 2 million people in 210 countries triggered an unprecedented economic crisis as a consequence of forced lockdown to limit the transmission and put the life of many infected people at high risk around the world covid-19 patients are mainly managed with supportive care that includes cardiovascular hemodynamic or respiratory procedures while there is currently no specific treatment for covid-19 several drugs approved for other indications are being investigated in clinical trials these treatments are based on the administration of agents that either block the virus entry inside the host cells stopping virus replication and infection of other cells or potentially inhibit protease activity ie lopinavir ritonavirin antiviral drugs other potential treatments under clinical investigations use either nucleoside analogues that target the rna-dependent polymerase suppressing viral rna synthesis ie remdesivir or directly act on the virion assembly and budding and alter the molecular crosstalk of sars-cov-2 while indirectly reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines andor activating anti-sars-cov-2 cd8 t-cells ie hydroxy-chloroquine however despite some promising results the death toll of infected patients is still increasing although the administration of proposed conventional treatment is mainly performed via intravenous route as intranasal administration faces several challenges associated with mucosal environment the use of nanoparticle-based delivery system ensures effective treatment while minimizing side effects of therapeutic agents the theranostic nanoparticles ensure that therapeutic moieties such as drugs vaccines sirna and peptide achieve a concentration that is many times higher than expected in the targeted sites while protecting the therapeutic agents from enzyme degradation several types of theranostic nanoparticles that can be divided in 3 broad categories organic ie lipid polymer dendrimer inorganic ie gold and virus-like or self-assembling protein nanoparticles were investigated for intranasal administration the shape size and surface charge of the designed nanocarriers are considered as crucial factors that should be taken into consideration when optimized for intranasal delivery and thus play a crucial role in the success of the treatment delivered via intranasal route biocompatible theranostic nanoparticles can thus be a very promising approach to fight against this novel sars- cov-2 as previously investigated against various viral infections including sars or mers coronaviruses using several approaches theranostic nanoparticles can enhance the delivery of therapeutic drugs ensure selective and specific delivery of sirna efficiently delivery peptide inhibitors prevent coronavirus entry into cells and stimulate cells immune system investigating the various promising therapeutic agents currently under development against sars-cov-2 delivered via biocompatible theranostic nanoparticles via intranasal route is expected to be far more efficient than any other treatment for covid-19

research brief isabel frost katie tseng stephanie hauck geetanjali kapoor aditi sriram arindam nandi ramanan laxminarayan  objective the novel coronavirus covid-19 has rapidly emerged to become a global pandemic and is known to cause a high risk to patients over the age of 70 and those with co-morbidities such as hypertension and diabetes though children are at comparatively lower risk compared to adults the indian population has a large young demographic that is likely to be at higher risk due to exposure to pollution malnutrition and poor access to medical care we aimed to quantify the  medrxiv preprint conclusion these estimates show covid-19 has the potential to pose a substantial threat to indias large population of children particularly those suffering from malnutrition and exposure to indoor air pollution who may have limited access to health services  the novel coronavirus covid-19 has spread from wuhan china to become a worldwide pandemic studies from wuhan indicate that the highest risk categories are adults over the age of 80 and those with comorbidities such as uncontrolled hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease chronic lung disease and cancer 1  although the documented short-term risk posed by covid-19 to children is lower than in adults it is possible that they may present a sizeable burden in a country such as india that is home to 130 million children under the age of five many of whom are undernourished suffer from non-covid19 respiratory illnesses and have risk factors for respiratory illness including household air pollution and exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke 2 3 4  already every year in india 169760 deaths of children under 5 from pneumonia could be averted through prompt access to an appropriate antibiotic 5  this situation of low access to essential healthcare stands to be further exacerbated by higher demands on the health system due to covid-19 seasonal peaks in acute respiratory infections are likely to place further demands on the indian health system for example in pune respiratory syncytial virus cases peak during the rainy season in july 6  children living in india are

malnourished infant demonstrated that when comorbidities are present normally benign coronavirus infections can lead to severe disease and death within 24 hours irrespective of the presence of comorbidities there may also be mechanistic reasons for differences in susceptibility to covid-19 between adults and children evidence suggests the angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 may be the cell receptor used by covid-19 to bind and some have suggested the maturity and function of this protein may be less developed in children 13  current evidence suggests that children are at lower risk from severe disease however given indias large young population the need for hospital beds and critical care is likely to be high the asymptomatic and symptomatic rates used in the calculations were

large population of children many of whom do not have access to essential health services or are vulnerable to respiratory pathogens due to pollution-induced lung damage and malnutrition in addition the simple estimates presented here are unable to take into account the further impact of the reduction in services offered by an overburdened health system on children suffering from health issues other than covid-19 many children stand to be affected by the coming pandemic and it is essential that india prepares for this eventuality or the lives of the next generation will be put at risk

 importantly we observed that some of the compounds currently undergoing clinical trials such as ribavirin favipiravir oseltamivir or baloxavir showed no apparent antiviral effect against the sars-cov-2 virus in vitro at concentrations under 100 m table 1 remdesivir is a 1-cyano-substituted adenosine analogue that has been shown to inhibit human coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 brown et al 2019 sheahan et al 2017 de wit et al 2020 it is currently evaluated in phase 4 clinical trials for sars-cov-2 a recent study fitted viral load in linear scale eg the percentage of inhibition under increasing concentrations of remdesivir reported ec50 against sars-cov-2 virus at 077 m wang et al 2020 we fitted viral load in logarithm scale log10tcid50ml and log10 viral rna copiesml under increasing concentration of remdesivir and determined ec50 at 2315 m and 2690 m respectively fig 1
a and table 1 two mutations f476l and v553l in the rna-dependent rna polymerase nsp12 of a murine hepatitis virus have been previously reported to confer resistance to remdesivir agostini et al 2018 due to insertions and deletions in nsp12 these two conserved residues are mapped at f480 and v557 in the sars-cov-2 isolate gisaid epiisl412028 used for the experiments which should remain sensitive for remdesivir other adenosine analogues galidesivir tenofovor or fludarabine phosphate or nucleoside analogues favipiravir ribavirin r-1479 did not inhibit viral replication under 100 m table 1

plasma concentration of emetine may reach 0075 gml 0156 m regenthal et al 1999 which is below the ec50 against sars-cov-2 virus in vitro the toxic plasma concentration is 05 gml 104 m regenthal et al 1999 to reduce the effective concentration of individual compound below the maximal therapeutic plasma concentration we explored the combinational effect of remdesivir and emetine in vitro drug interaction was evaluated using the checkerboard assay with serially 2-fold diluted remdesivir 050 m and emetine 00781 m in combination remdesivir at 625 m in combination with emetine at 0195 m may achieve 649 inhibition of viral yield which can be further tested in vivo fig 2
a the loewe additive model and the bliss independent model malyutina et al 2019 were used to analyse the interaction of the two compounds using synergyfinder ianevski et al 2017 remdesivir and emetine in combination yielded a loewe synergy score of 0306 fig 2b and a bliss synergy score of 20234 fig 2c we confirm the antiviral activity of four compounds that have been reported to inhibit other coronavirus or sars-cov-2 replication in vitro our results suggest that combinational therapy may help to reduce the effective concentration against sars-cov-2 under the maximal therapeutic plasma concentration there is an urgent research need to identify optimal dose combination of effective compounds against the sars-cov-2 virus for better clinical benefit  understanding epidemic data and

commonly pneumonia and bronchitis for the more aggressive strains to date there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs capable of preventing or treating hcov infections fehr  to date several outbreaks of coronavirus-related diseases have been reported severe acute respiratory syndrome-or sars was the first coronavirus-related outbreak starting in guangdong china in november 2002 and spread to a total of 29 territories including hong kong taiwan canada singapore vietnam and the united states within 9 months it infected a total of 8098 people and killed 774 worldwide smith 2006 9  the second coronavirus-related outbreak happened in the middle east in april 2012 officially named middle east respiratory syndrome or mers this virus was first identified in a patient from saudi arabia and later mers affected several other countries including saudi arabia south korea united arab emirate jordan qatar and oman overall resulting with infections in 24 countries with over 1000 cases and over 400 deaths organization 10  the outbreak of mers happened again in south korea supposedly from a traveler from middle east it happened during may and july 2015 and infected a total of 186 individuals with a death toll of 36 organization 2015 11  after 3 years in august 2018 the next mers outbreak happened in countries on the arabian peninsula and resulted in almost 147 infected people and the death of 47 the mers outbreak had been reported in saudi arabia united kingdom and south korea in dec 2019 a pneumonia outbreak was reported in wuhan china and on dec 31 it was attributed to a new strain of hcov first named as 2019-ncov by world health organization who and later renamed to sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses almost 2 weeks later on jan 11 2020 chinese state media reported the first fatality from the new discovered virus that led to infection of dozens more as of jan 20 multiple countries reported their first cases including japan south korea and thailand the first confirmed case in the united states came the very next day in washington state continuing its spread coronavirus presence was confirmed throughout the month of february in the philippines feb 2 france feb 14 iran feb 21 and as reports started in italy on feb 23 many more europeans countries followed suit reporting their first confirmed cases as of this writing the coronavirus has affected 115 countries out of more than 118000 confirmed cases around 4000 people have lost their lives with china italy iran and south korea experiencing the worst cases of outbreaks and showing no sign of alleviation the 2019-2020 outbreak of covid-19 is now officially recognized as a pandemic by who an outbreak or epidemic often refers to a sudden increase in the occurrence of an infectious disease in a particular time and place pandemics are near-global epidemic outbreaks where multiple countries across the world are involved green et al 2002 12  the mentioned rapid trend of spread prompts a lot of concerns and questions such as how fast is the virus spreading which policies or efforts could control the disease better and what is the main difference of covid-19 outbreak with pervious epidemics fortunately the daily case detection changes are available and can be tracked almost in real time on the website provided by authors httpiuwaircorona the aim of this study is to provide the transmission trend from china to other countries and to report the daily confirmed cases case fatalities and surveillance in every countries from the first day of outbreak until march 4th also to evaluate the effect of each government policies in controlling the outbreak of covid-19 covid-19 has currently spread to 85 countries and most national authorities have failed to keep its rapid spread contained 13  who world health organization reports that it began in wuhan city located in hubei province of china first reported on 21 january 14  covid-19 categorizes in three distinctions concerning its infected hosts severity of disease 1516  to date the statistics of its reported cases shows more than 80 percent of infected had a mild case of disease while around 14 percent of infected experienced a severe one suffering from breathlessness and pneumonia and about 5 percent are categorized as critical disease patients their symptoms include septic shock respiratory failure and the failure of more than one organ reports on march 10 2020 show that china has the most confirmed fatal and also recovered cases the order of confirmed cases after chinas is followed respectively by south korea italy and iran which could be found in the table1 confirmed death cases caused by covid-19 are also observed in 14 different countries lead in numbers by china italy iran china  80573  3042  53888  south korea  6593  42  135  iran  4747  124  913  italy  4636  197  523  germany  670  0  17  france  653  9  12  japan  420  6  46  spain  400  5  2  us 278  14

posted march 18 2020  secondly the fitted linear regression line had a small enough error to preserve the values given and the linear regression results could be interpreted with relative ease in addition by fitting regression lines with higher order causes overfitting resulting from the amount of data there is no evidence yet about the relation of other conditions to the outbreak and its case fatality rate cfr so by using linear regression line policies and behaviors could be compared in the prediction cases by using linear regression we could compare future trends of countries in earlier stages with the ones in later stages by considering above mentioned statements we will find the best linear relation between arrays of data in some cases the linear relation could be observed but it may exhibit linear relation with some date shift of others ie death cases should have linear relation with earlier values of confirmed cases given the fact that it should take time from confirmation to death cfr could be calculated by the following formula in which d eath and c on f irmed functions will calculate the value of death cases and confirmed cases at that date t being the date we want to inspect the cfr dt is the mean duration of confirmed to death figure 2a shows the global confirmed deaths and recovered cases trend for covid-19 form jan 22 to march 10 2020 death cases are excessively lower than confirmed ones so we normalized by dividing the value of confirmed deaths and recovered cases to their maximum respectively it in fig 2c to investigate all three trends of cases for the confirmed cases there is a huge increase since feb 11 the increase tones down from feb 11 to the next day furthermore on feb 13 another sharp increase 320  cc-by-nc 40 international license it

could be observed in fig 2b which shows new cases for each day and normalized in fig 2d  the most reliable speculation for this jump is that in that day china the country with the most confirmed cases for the first time reported the clinically diagnosed cases in addition to laboratory-confirmed cases 17  in which 13332 clinically diagnosed cases are added to 1148 laboratory-confirmed ones since then china has kept the same reporting method for the confirmed cases on 23rd and 24th of feb again the decrease of new cases subsided and new cases increased as before as shown in fig 2a the reduction trend is continued approximately and the cause of the increase was other countries growing numbers so for more accurate analysis each country will be investigated separately wuhan city located in hubei province is reported to be the origin of covid-19 on january 23 2020 a lockdown in wuhan and other cities in hubei was implemented to control the outbreak of the covid-19 a total of 12 other cities in hubei consisting of huangshi jingzhou yichang xiaogan jingmen suizhou xianning qianjiang xiantao shiyan tianmen and enshi restricted any form of transportation by the end of january 24 these decisions were made to prevent the expansion of covid-19 any further as measured in 18  the incubation period for wuhan travelers estimated from 21 to 111 days the mean incubation period was estimated to be 64 days and also generally the mean incubation period was estimated at 52 days which distributed in intervals of 41 to 70 with 95 confidence 19  by adding these two values 116 days after jan 24 4th and 5th of feb the effects should be clearly manifesting figure 3b depicted the new daily confirmed cases of china outside of hubei the peak of the plot is located on feb 13 and the daily new cases reduces afterward this reduction shows that the lockdown plays a serious role in the further reduction of cases in chinaexcluding hubei province even though there is no reason to argue the lockdowns positive impact on hubei itself the decrease in new confirmed cases feb 13 increases rationale was described in the previous section shows that emergency circumstances and movement limitations yields positive results to the reduction of confirmed cases from 10th of feb since february 13 2020 the chinese government has issued shutdown of all non-essential companies including manufacturing plants in hubei province 5 days later on feb 18 a drop of new cases could be observed fig 3b  finally the confirmed new cases in china were negligible from 1st of march  cc-by-nc 40

confirmed cases trend with the cfr the normalized plot will be investigated by observing normalized hubei province plot of confirmed deaths and recovered cases in fig 3k  it could be seen that the cfr trend behaves the same as the confirmation with a shift in date visually it could be seen that the value of shift in date varies and increases during this time in earlier cases the period of confirmation cases leading to death was shorter it seems one reason for this variation is that confirmed cases consist only of just laboratory cases and by adding clinically diagnosed cases which existed before but didnt count beforehand the time of confirmation to death increases in other words the number of confirmed cases gets closer to the real value and the cases are announced sooner than they did before other possible reasons include the advancements in developing treatments further delaying fatal cases and the increase in public awareness as more people with possible signs of infection come forward to be diagnosed to estimate the expected value of confirming a case up to the death stage assuming a linear relation between the death and confirmed rates we draw a linear regression line for confirmed and death cases value each time increasing the duration and finding the mean absolute error mae of the regression line normally by increasing the duration following the reduction in investigated points the mae is reduced however if there is an obvious relation between these two parameters at the point which they had a correlating relation mae will begin to increase fig 4a  wang et al estimated the time from the the appearance of first symptoms to dyspnea was 50 days to hospital admission 70 days and to ards 80 days 20  another study found that the median days from the first symptom to death as 14 range 6-41 days 21  as seen in fig 4c this value is about eleven in china excluding hubei province fig 4e depicted the value 5 for hubei and fig 4a depicted the value is 6 days for china assuming the hospital admission is the same day as confirmation or a day before confirmation the mean total of 14 days from the first symptom could be approved in 21  by finding the mean day from confirmation to death it is possible to find out the cfr in china hubei and chinaexcluding hubei province algorithm 1 reports best shifting date value and best linear regression line  recovered cases are defined active cases-patients recovered after a certain amount of time with its trend seen in fig 3k fig  3j and fig 3l  by comparing recovered cases with confirmed ones a relation is observed after date shifts unlike death cases recovered cases shift are longer initially and reduces over time the assumed reasoning is that by the passing of time more medical treatments develop healthcare providers gain more experience in handling patients care and as more people are informed increasing numbers of them check in hospitals at the early stages of their disease resulting in an even more efficient treatment however this reduction doesnt break the linear relation between confirmed cases and recovered ones enough to be significant to find the mean date shift between confirmed cases and recovered ones we apply a linear regression line to different dates by shifting them back until a first local minimum mae is foundalgorithm 1 hubei provinces recovered mean duration value found is 12 days fig 4f  first confirmed cases of covid-19 was observed jan 20th in south korea but the outbreak started around feb 18th 29 days later its death and recovered cases trend shown in fig 5a after normalizing in addition the new cases real-valued and normal form are also found in fig 5b  new confirmed death and recovered cases are also depicted in fig 5c and normalized in fig  5d  in fig 5e first 16 day of four countrys outbreak compared new confirmed and death cases also depicted in fig 5g and 5h being one of the first countries reporting the outbreak of covid-19 the first report was on jan 20 however no outbreak was observed by feb 18th after which there was a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases comparison between the growth trend in numbers from south korea from this date with chinas in the early stages is depicted in fig 5e as shown the growth rate patterns are approximately the same between the two showing a very similar behavior in the increasing numbers of confirmed cases covid-19 spreads from human to human 22  therefore in addition to isolation of people social avoidance and quarantine policies faster detection of infected cases should reduce further growth each infected individual by having contact with others directly or by proxy in other words by activity could infect a number of people so to reduce the odds of transmission of virus faster detection of infected individuals could play a key role alongside lockdown strategies   cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a

doi medrxiv preprint cases have been screened and tested for hcov infection 23  more than 10000 tests had been taken on march 8th and just in two days this number has reached to 210144 indicating more than 20000 tests had been taken in 2 days at this date south korea reached to 4099 taken-tests per million people the magnitude of this number clearly shows the policy of south korea an attempt to reduce the duration of detection through a faster detection strategy 24  furthermore the fact that the cfr in the old south korean affected adults 25 patients above 70 years is still lower than that of italian hcov affected patients average 47 years old better signifies the role of early detection in controlling the epidemic to determine the cfr of confirmed cases specially in countries in which the covid-19 is spreading the knowledge of confirmation to death duration is essential to demonstrate a wrong approach if dividing the death cases by confirmed ones on a specific date yield the wrong answers for the death cases might have been confirmed some day prior by assuming that cfr has a linear or near linear relation with confirmed rate duration of confirmation to death could be evaluated by fitting multiple linear regression lines minimum value for mae appears for 3 days shift meaning death cases were confirmed 3 days before to discern the cfr of south korea total death cases should be divided by total confirmed date of 3 days prior slope of the regression line also shows the rate as alluded to before there are many types of covid-19 with respect to acuteness of the disease the cfr varies depending on the level of infected people already confirmed if a country manages to diagnose and confirm the affection of a patient in an earlier stage and begins curating the infected individuals or tallying those with mild covid-19 the cfr would be comparatively lower such percussion alludes to the apparent lower cfrs in south korea 77 out of 10000 versus other countries with comparably large outbreaks due to the small duration of outbreak in south korea and larger duration of recovery date it is difficult to accurately estimate the duration in this country considering the low cfr and a huge reduction of new cases in south korea the only remaining concern is the low rate of recovered cases figure 5e displays the confirmed cases of south korea with the ones in early stages of outbreak in china with a comparably similar incremental trends the relation was assumed to be linear relation between the two to demonstrate this linear relation with a shift in date shift we will follow the same as before by fitting a regression line it could be estimated which date shift yield the lowest error which is 0 date shift owing to the fact that china has experienced the covid-19 after these fitting trends it is possible to predict south koreas next trend assuming south koreas policies are as good as chinas since other conditions like race and climate are comparatively the same  as mentioned before china on feb 13 22 days after the outbreak added clinical diagnosis cases to laboratory-confirmed cases so it seems appropriate to be considered in predictions after normalization following the evaluation of the number of days shift south koreas confirmation rate behaves the same as china resulting in the answer of 0 italy reported its first confirmed cases of covid-19 infection on jan 31 later announcing an outbreak around feb 21st 21 days later we have displayed after normalizing overall analysis in addition to death and recovered cases trend in fig 6b depicted the covid-19s trend in the country by normalizing the plot death and recovered cases trend could be seen in fig6b  the plot for new cases also figured in fig 6c in real-valued and normal form comparison between the growth trend in numbers from italy from this date with chinas in the early stages is depicted in fig 6d as shown the growth rate patterns are approximately the same between the two for first 14 days showing identical behavior in the increasing numbers of confirmed cases after day 14th italy exhibits incremental increase in confirmed cases juxtaposed to chinas march 10 17th day of italys outbreak being italys initial quarantine date means it is too early to observe this policys effects lombardy the center of outbreak in italy was locked down on february 22 and this lockdown strategy seems to have had a positive effect on other municipalities depicted in fig 6i and by comparing other municipalities confirmed cases with chinas the mainland trend shown in fig6h  results seem identical to analyze the stage of the disease in the italian hcov infected patients ie to find out how rapid the infected people have been screened and diagnosed the results of the covid-19 tests of italy and south korea can be compared south korea has been considered as a reference as its hcov-related cfr is low enough indicating that both countries are at the same level of hcov infection till march 10th 2020 a total of 60761 hcov tests had been taken form italians-through their screening 920  cc-by-nc 40 international license it is made available under a is the authorfunder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted march 18 2020 statistically it is observed that the cfr of covid-19 has had a direct relation with age with the average age of death for these 3 countries respectively 28 38 and 47 years old 28  and it also potentially contributes to the increase in cfrs using the home quarantine strategy in italy should fit the trend of china with the decrease of new cases at latest predicted to start on march 15 comprehensively inspecting signs of the infection in people and faster starting treatment could also help lower cfr and make italys covid-19 cfr more realistic iran covid-19 was first reported in iran starting with 2 dead cases on 19th of feb in qom a city near tehran irans capital followed immediately by a huge outbreak displayed in fig 7a detailing its number of confirmed deaths and recovered cases and normalized in fig 7b  officially iran hasnt mandated any city wide lockdowns but recently some provinces are refusing non-local travelers regarding the experiences in china lockdown strategy will isolate cities to avoid transmitting the growth rate to other cities however such policies entail some negative consequences and therefore they were not implemented in early stages of the outbreak in iran in contrast to italy and south korea where there was a gap between outbreak and huge outbreak 21 and 27 days on the 10th day of outbreak in iran total reported confirmed infected individual cases reached 388 to find confirmed to death cases mean duration as before we calculate the minimum mae assuming there is a linear relation between these two linear regression algorithms shows the date shift should be zero which means on average death cases confirmed at the same day by comparing the death trend with confirmed cases in fig 7b and fig 7d  it is obvious that the 1020  cc-by-nc 40 international license it

the shortage of covid-19 testing kits orand the lack of clinical diagnosis approach caused such unreliable data countries at this stage mostly had about 2 days of confirmation to death period so following this assumption the covid-19s cfr in iran is around 44 by observing the 24th of febs report there were 49 active cases the cases which are not recovered or dead but confirmed as a covid-19 infected reported at least 14 cases are new and the value for active cases in the next day was 79 at least 30 new cases two days later the reported recovered cases was 49 supposing no one was treated in less than two days this results in 100 recovery of 14 new cases in two days and also no active cases after two days marking a great experience which was reported by irans officials otherwise some cases were treated in one day this makes irans phenomena intriguing for investigating the details and contributing factors for such cases in order to find a relation between individuals physical conditions and their treatment period however errors in report could also explain this information using regression line to find the mean recovered duration shows that the recovery duration for iran should be around 1 day also seen in fig 7c  the rate of recovery in iran is quite significant at 38 keep in mind iran is in early stage of covid-19s growth figures 7e 7f 7g and 7h show irans trends of confirmed newly confirmed death and new death cases respectively the trends display no linear relation therefore in order to find the linear relation we fit irans with chinas first 10 days of confirmed newly confirmed death and new death cases respectively depicted in fig 7i 7j 7k and 7l  the 10th day after the outbreak was the day in which new cases of china started to decrease in contrast irans incremental trend continued to rise until the 20th day of the outbreak even though a temporal reduction in new cases could be observed starting on 6th of march persisting until 9th of march evidently it is the impact of a nation wide implemented policy reducing working hours 6 days prior 54 days is the mean incubation period 18  after 4 days with the arrival of weekends and the following 2 additional holidays reports indicate many people took trips during these dates which is widely assumed as a reason for confirmed cases rise although many companies implemented forms of remote work for their employees which is estimated to have a positive impact on preventing the growth outbreak yet many governmental office working hours returned to their pre-outbreak times naturally assumed to negatively impact the prevention of diseases spread  there is yet no observable comparison between the effectiveness of either decisions however the aggregation of effects could be seen from march 15 an important upcoming event in iran is nowruz which is the iranian new year when traditionally gatherings are very common which could have very serious consequences on the outbreak of covid-19 in iran prompting immediate and decisive preventive policies from the government the first confirmed cases of covid-19 in japan returned from wuhan on 6th of jan however the outbreak in japan sped up on feb 15 fig 8a shows the trend of outbreak after 15th feb in japan while fig 8b is normalized to compare confirmed deaths and recovered cases the trend shows that the spread of covid-19 in japan behaves at a lower rate than chinas first dates see fig 8c  the number of deaths in japan is also lower than 10 individuals on march 10 the regression line could be fitted with a high degree of confidence however it is estimated that it is about 2 the cfr is very good by adding the information of mean age in japan which is 48 by finding out the hospital per bed value of japan which is 134 reported at 2012 who the relation of death cases compared with hospital per bed is more clear although japan managed the early stage exponential rate of covid-19 see fig 8c  a reduction in new cases is not observed see fig 8d  so it is speculative at best to say that japan is in its final stages of the outbreak massive levels of covid-19 outbreak were reported around feb 25 for spain as seen by its trend of confirmed death and recovered cases for demonstrated in fig 9a and its death and recovered cases in fig 9b  by comparing the early stages of spain with iran italy and south korea in fig 9c the trend since march 10 shows spain has larger growth rate than other ones mentioned here mean age of spain is 45 years old and hospital beds per person in the country is 2965 for every 10000 at 2013 compared to italy the mean age of spain is slightly smaller while hospital beds per person are relatively higher consequently it is expected that the cfr should therefore be slightly lower after calculating the confirmed to death cases duration which is 3 days the cfr of spain results in 7 for spain as expected france underwent two increments in its rate of confirmed covid-19 cases the first one was on feb 25 therefore chosen as the starting point of the outbreak second was from 3rd to 5th of march as shown in fig 10a  by normalizing data displayed in fig  10b and calculating the confirmed to death duration which is 3 cfr for france at march 10 results in 35 considering the mean age as a parameter which in france is lower than spain 42 and 45 respectively in addition to beds per person which is 6477 at 2013 27 higher than spain  cfrs are expected to be lower than spain by comparing the growth of confirmed cases with china iran italy and south korea depicted in fig 10c  its evident that although covid-19 in france didnt exhibit a fast rate similar to iran in the first 14 days of the outbreak it is predicted however that the cfr will increase as much as italys

trend as all others except iran which is not a bad news for germans but better ones comes when we want to calculate cfr total number of deaths in germany since 10th march is 2 which is obvious that the regression approach could not help to find confirmed to death duration so like other countries in this stage we take it as 3 days by dividing the deaths of 10th march to confirmed of 7th march the 25 out of 10000 025 is the cfr which is too low at this stage the usas confirmed death and recovered covid-19 cases trend is depicted in fig 12a  as well as its normal form in fig 12b  on march 10 both the confirmed and death cases of the usa increased about 29 and 25 times respectively the recovered cases also increased 21 times but due to its low number of recovered 15 on march 10 we considered it trivial the huge increase in death and confirmed cases lead the regression line algorithm to define confirmed to death duration in 0 days however it wouldnt be possible unless most dead cases are confirmed after death accepting the 3 days for the usa like other countries in this stage the cfr should be about 14 which is too high for a country with 38 years old mean age and 29 hospital beds per person the high cfr could be alluded to the detection of the infected individuals during the last stages of the illness or reporting on serious cases with higher cfrs exclusively compared to china iran italy and south korea both confirmed and death cases of the usa shows higher orders of incrementation it is advisable to follow the usa in the coming days for more accurate information gathering considering the latest increment could be caused by wrong data in the previous dates the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid-19 epi-centered in hubei province of the peoples republic of china has spread to many other countries the case detection rate is changing daily and can be tracked in almost real time on the mentioned website reports on march 10 2020 show that reports show that china has the most confirmed fatal and also recovered cases and in the terms of confirmed cases south korea iran and italy are following the chin respectively confirmed death cases lead in numbers by china and followed respectively by italy iran and south korea the daily statistics showed that lockdown are effective in reduction of incidence of confirmed cases with covid-19 after about 11 days in china south korea is one of the first countries reporting the cases after china and the growth pattern of confirmed cases is the same as chinas in early stages however they implement some policies such as in addition to isolation of people social avoidance and quarantine policies and faster detection of infected cases which were effective in decrease in new confirmed case and also case fatality italy and china have the approximately same growth rate patterns for first 14 days although it is too early to observe quarantines policys effects in italy lockdown strategy of lombardy the center of outbreak in italy seems to have had a positive effect on other municipalities unlike to chinas growth pattern irans incremental trend continued to rise

coronaviruses-infected patients are shown in table 2 differences on clinical expressions were obtained among the studied populations p  005 fever was less found among both renal and patients under stem cell transplantation program when compared with the other groups cyanosis was only reported in 1 child with heart disease and wheezing was reported only among hospitalized patients and children both from community and with heart diseases dyspnea another lower respiratory tract infection symptom besides wheezing was documented among patients under stem cell transplantation program children with heart diseases children from community and hospitalized patients healthcare workers presented more sore throat and myalgia than the other studied populations viral respiratory diseases are the leading cause of medical attendance worldwide exerting a great economic impact on the health-care system human coronavirus is considered one of the most common respiratory viruses associated with respiratory tract infections mainly among children epidemiological and clinical data of hcovs infectious in the brazilian population are scarce and restricted to one or two group of patients bellei et al 2008 reported 42 of human coronaviruses in brazilian adults cabea and bellei 2012 described a fatal case of hcov-nl63 associated with pneumonia in a brazilian adult and albuquerque et al 2009 reported 19 among brazilian children this is the first brazilian report of hcovs from distinct brazilian population over a period of nine years detection of coronaviruses by culture isolation or serological methods is difficult a pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay is a usefull molecular tool to test for all coronaviruses in a clinical sample in addition quick screening for several pathogens in one assay allows the identification of previously unknown coronaviruses however the pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay used could have led to some limitations in our study first hcovs subtypes were not identified and the prevalence of our study could be overestimated andor underestimated once the assay included non specific primers that target all human and animal coronaviruses therefore the use of degenerate primers set in a conventional rt-pcr may enhance detection of coronavirus genome variations but may also miss samples with less genome copies to have a better understanding about it and mainly to rule out the possibility of a bias we sequenced a portion of the coronaviruses positive cases detected in the present study using pancoronavirus primers set the positive cases detected among hospitalized patients from 2009 to 2010 were sequenced and all samples were confirmed as human coronaviruses cabea et al 2012 coronaviruses can display a typical biennial seasonality different than occur with other respiratory viruses mcintosh et al 1970 monto et al 1974 vabret et al 2003 in this regard we identified peaks of detection frequency of hcovs during 20022004 and 20082009 with high detection frequencies in winter months but few or no detections in the summer the prevalence of 115 found in our study corroborated with other research that identified coronaviruses as responsible for 1030 of common colds and 039 associated with pneumonia tyrrell and bynoe 1965 bradburne and somerset 1972 larson et al 1980 dare et al 2007 we demonstrate the presence of hcovs infection in all studied populations with a significant prevalence among some at-risk group patients such as patients under stem cell transplantation program and children with heart diseases this higher frequency of hcovs may be related to the functional condition of these patients on the other hand a lower prevalence was observed among children from community when compared with our different studied populations since the majority of these children presented influenza-like illness instead of common cold symptoms the clinical pattern can explain this lower frequency among this group of patients underlying conditions other than cardiactransplantation were observed among 20 of coronaviruses-infected patients this data along with the higher prevalence of coronaviruses-infected cases found in specific at-risk group patients pointed to the relevance of coronaviruses causing respiratory tract illness in patients with comorbidities in conclusion our results provided a novel insight into the epidemiology and clinical knowledge of coronaviruses in different groups of the brazilian population supporting the notation that hcov may have an important role among patients with underlying conditions and transplanted ones  global academic response to covid-19 cross-sectional study jack helliwell a william bolton s joshua burke r jim tiernan p david jayne g stephen chapman j  objective

covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly since it began in the city of wuhan in late 2019 1  the outbreak has been declared as a pandemic by the world health organisation who reflecting its spread to more than 200 countries worldwide 2  as of april 2020 there has been more than 100000 deaths and the number of those affected continues to rise 3  in response to this unprecedented situation healthcare systems around the world have taken urgent action to scale up medical staffing equipment and infrastructure in the united kingdom uk this is demonstrated by the construction of new field hospitals the return of thousands of retired healthcare workers and the re-purposing of many acute and urgent hospital services 4  the role that science and data play in the face of the covid-19 pandemic must also be recognised robust and rapidly-available evidence is essential for improving the detection and treatment of the virus as well as for reducing its transmission it is the responsibility of all members of the academic community to facilitate this transfer of knowledge so that patients around the world receive the best evidence-based care available there is limited information about how the academic community has responded to and how this can be further guided during times of global crisis there is a need for investigators to respond urgently to new clinical needs across all sectors of healthcare and to work in unfamiliar environments journal editors must facilitate rapid and robust peer review whilst making difficult editorial decisions based on little previous academic background publishers must mobilise quickly to enable timely publication of manuscripts so that research outputs can be realised and implemented into practice an early understanding of this response is important so that the academic community can identify early challenges and respond appropriately as the covid-19 pandemic

case series in an attempt to describe the disease these were highly published often in major general medical or highly ranked specialty journals the volume of interventional studies exploring treatments was low but this is expected to change as ongoing trials reach completion the editorial and production times for covid-19 studies were strikingly shorter compared to mers controls and almost all manuscripts were openly accessible at the point of publication in contrast only one-in-four covid-19 manuscripts were published with original data available to support the results during times of medical crisis and global disease rapid dissemination of information is essential to inform frontline treatments and prevention this review provides an early insight into the challenges of the covid-19 academic response even from the early stages it is evident that data sharing practices are lacking and are a target for improvement as the pandemic progresses a key strength of this review is the ability to identify this promptly and inform the study design data management and consent procedures of future research a weakness of the review is the incomplete representation of the research pathway whilst investigators editors and publishers are essential for generating and disseminating research other groups such as funding bodies research ethics committees regulatory agencies and patientstakeholder groups also play important roles measuring the response of these groups however is challenging since it relies on data which are not openly available or straight forward to measure another weakness is the focus on peer-reviewed publications it is likely that a wider body of unpublished data exist following editorial rejection or through investigators making results available on non-peer reviewed platforms these are important data but it is proposed that further work to confirm their rigor and stability ie changes made during parallel submission and peer-review

studies emerge during the covid-19 pandemic data sharing will be critical for allowing scrutiny of results reducing unnecessary duplication and enabling rigorous pooled analyses this study raises important considerations for the dissemination of data during the covid-19 pandemic firstly the urgency for information and the need for rigorous peer review must be balanced particularly in studies that are controversial preliminary or practice-changing preprint publication is an alternative to fast-track editorial processes provided that audiences can accept the lack of prior editorial review 13  secondly open-access publication is essential so that the global medical community can learn freely from each other in this study almost all articles were available with open-access for both covid-19 and mers research it is likely that this represents and extended effort by publishers to share knowledge since only 45 of the scholarly literature in 2015 was published with open-access 14  finally in an age of electronic dissemination it is clear that journals are not the only platform for reporting research data international bodies such as the who publish regular covid-19 situation reports and social media has emerged as a rapid source of knowledge transfer 3 15  there remains a need to balance pragmatic and timely dissemination of results not just limited to academic journals

an outbreak of viral pneumonia in wuhan china little is known about its epidemiological characteristics using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside wuhan we estimate the mean incubation period to be 64 56 -77 95 ci days ranging from 21 to 111 days 25 th to 975 th percentile these values help to inform case definitions for 2019-ncov and appropriate durations for quarantine  early january 2020 a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov has been identified as the infectious agent that causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in wuhan china where the first cases had their symptom onset in december 2019 1  this newly discovered virus causes a severe acute respiratory disease the rapid spread in wuhan and throughout china poses a great strain on health care system and disrupts the local societies the multiple cases showing up outside china cause international concern the virus is related to the sars coronavirus and mers coronavirus but is distinct from each of those viruses 2  such that the epidemiological key parameters have to be identified for this new virus from incoming case reports as the epidemic continues chief among these key parameters is the incubation period distribution the range of the values for the incubation period is essential to epidemiological case definitions and is required to determine the appropriate duration of quarantine moreover knowledge of the incubation period helps to assess the effectiveness of entry screening and contact tracing the distribution of the incubation period is also used in estimating the size of the epidemic 3 -5 and the transmission potential 6 7  in absence of data on the 2019-ncov incubation period the who has worked with a broad range of 0 to 14 days the cdc has taken a range of 2 to 14 days and several studies have assumed incubation periods of sars or mers coronaviruses here we present the distribution of incubation periods estimated for travellers from

strictly positive flat prior probability distributions for the parameter values of the three distributions supplementary material s2 which ensured our estimates are conservative because of the high

than presented here for 2019-ncov these findings imply that findings of previous studies that have assumed incubation period distribution similar to mers or sars will not have to be adapted because of

travellers between wuhan and guangdong 19  it fits within the range from 0 to 14 days that has been assumed by the who in our analysis we assumed a uniform prior probability of being infected during

travellers in this study represent a selective sample of the reported cases we found travellers to be more often male and younger than the cases reported the numbers are too small to detect systematic differences in incubation time with age or sex because we only have information on confirmed cases there is likely a bias towards more severe cases in areas with a functioning health care system as the epidemic continues it remains important to collect more information on incubation periods of 2019-ncov cases of older ages of persons with underlying morbidity of women and of persons with mild symptoms there are various choices one can make about the parametric form of the incubation period distribution the results with the three often-used forms we report here suggest that there is little impact on the mean and dispersion of the incubation periods of these three the lognormal distribution assigns higher probabilities to longer incubation periods although we found that this distribution provided a poorer description of the data than the weibull and the gamma distributions it is prudent not to dismiss the possibility of incubation periods up to 14 days at this stage of the epidemic our study helps in choosing an appropriate duration for quarantine keeping infected persons in quarantine up to 14 days will ensure that they do not develop symptoms after release we are immensely

xu xianwen wang benjamin cowling j lauren meyers ancel  on january 23 2020 china quarantined wuhan to contain an emerging coronavirus  we estimated the probability of transportation of covid-19 from wuhan to 369 cities in china before the quarantine the expected risk is 50 in 130 95 ci 89-190 cities and 99 in the 4 largest metropolitan areas of china  in december 2019 a novel coronavirus covid-19 emerged in wuhan china 1 on january 30 2020 the world health organization who declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern 2 by january 31 2020 192 fatalities and 3215 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported in wuhan 8576 additional cases were spread across 300 cities in mainland china and 127 exported cases were reported in 23 countriesstates spanning asia europe oceania and north america the rapid global expansion rising fatalities unknown animal reservoir and evidence of person-to-person transmission potential 3 8 initially resembled the 2003 sars epidemic and raised concerns about global spread on january 22 2020 china announced a travel quarantine of wuhan and by january 30 expanded the radius to include 16 cities encompassing a population of 45 million at the time of the quarantine china was already 2 weeks into the 40-day spring festival during which several billion people travel throughout china to celebrate the lunar new year 4  considering the timing of exported covid-19 cases reported outside of china we estimate that only 895 95 cri 222 -2872 of cases infected in wuhan by january 12 might have been confirmed by january 22 2020 by limiting our estimate to infections occurring 10 days before the quarantine we account for an estimated 5-6-day incubation period and 4-5 days between symptom onset and case detection 3 5 6 8 appendix the low detection rate coupled with an average lag of 10 days between infection and detection 6 suggest that newly infected persons who traveled out of wuhan just before the quarantine might have remained infectious and undetected in dozens of cities in china for days to weeks moreover these silent importations already might have seeded sustained outbreaks that were not immediately apparent we estimated the probability of transportation of infectious covid-19 cases from wuhan to cities throughout china before january 23 by using a simple model of exponential growth coupled with a stochastic model of human mobility among 369 cities in china appendix given that an estimated 98 of all trips between wuhan and other chinese cities during this period were taken by train or car our analysis of air rail and road travel data yields more granular risk estimates than possible with air passenger data alone 7  by fitting our epidemiologic model to data on the first 19 cases reported outside of china we estimate an epidemic doubling time of 731 days 95 cri 626 -966 days and a cumulative total of 12400 95 cri 3112-58465 infections in wuhan by january 22 2020 appendix  both estimates are consistent with a recent epidemiologic analysis of the first 425 cases confirmed in wuhan 8  by assuming these rates of early epidemic growth we estimate that 130 cities in china have 50 chance of having a covid-19 case imported from wuhan in the 3 weeks preceding the quarantine figure  by january 26th 107 of these high-risk cities had reported cases and 23 had not including 5 cities with importation probabilities 99 and populations 2 million bazhong fushun laibin ziyang and chuxiong under our lower bound estimate of 626 days for the doubling time 190369 cities lie above the 50 threshold for importation our risk assessment identified several cities throughout china likely to be harboring yet undetected cases of covid-19 a week after the quarantine suggesting that early 2020 ground and rail travel seeded cases far beyond the wuhan region under quarantine our conclusions are based on several key assumptions to design our mobility model we used data from tencent httpsheatqqcom a major social media company that hosts applications including wechat 113 billion active users in 2019 and qq 808 million active users in 2019 9  consequently our model might be demographically biased by the tencent user base further considerable uncertainty regarding the lag between infection and case detection remains our assumption of a 10-day lag is based on early estimates for the incubation period of covid-19 8 and prior estimates of the lag between symptom onset and detection for sars 10  we expect that estimates for the doubling time and incidence of covid-19 will improve as reconstructed linelists and more granular epidemiologic data become available appendix however our key qualitative insights likely are robust to these uncertainties including extensive pre-quarantine covid-19 exportations throughout china and far greater case counts in wuhan than reported before the quarantine imposed on january 23 2020 a daily travel volume to and from

detection as reconstructed linelists  14 -17  and more granular epidemiologic data are becoming available under these assumptions we calculated the number of infectious cases at time t  by the
