due to a remarkable effort coordinated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars team at who an understanding of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics and etiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome was achieved less than 2 months from the announcement of the outbreak in china as a result of this groundbreaking international collaboration we now know that the sars epidemic is due to a human coronavirus hcov infection now named sars-coronavirus sars-cov several sars-coronavirus genomes have been mapped and the functions of at least some of the proteins have been determined 1 2 these genomes are now available on genbank making it possible for laboratories around the world to begin the process of building a safe and effective sars vaccinealthough there is much to learn about sars many lessons can already be drawn from our experience with hiv the first lesson to keep in mind concerns strain variability sars like hiv is a rna virus whose replication is error-prone studies of 14 separate sars strains that emerged from a single point source suggest a pattern of evolution in response to immune pressure that is much like the evolution of hiv some forms of coronavirusmurine hepatitis virus in particularare known to mutate to escape from host immune response will clades and strains of sars emerge as they have for hiv if so will sars vaccine researchers be able to develop a vaccine that adequately addresses this problem hiv vaccine developers were slow to address hiv variability scientists involved in the sars vaccine effort must address this issue more promptlymore important the hiv vaccine development effort initially focused on replicating the approach that had been used to develop hepatitis b vaccine development which was to clone and express the surface protein of the virus this simplistic approach to a complex virus was recently proven to be a failure 3 will scientists once again pursue quick and easy solutions in the hopes of stimulating a protective antibody response despite existing evidence that coronavirus vaccines for animals based on the s or spike surface protein have largely been ineffectivein order to best define an effective sars vaccine approach it is important to consider the correlates of protection from coronaviruses in animal models and any evidence for immunity that may be emerging from clinical experience little is known as yet about the human immune response to sars-cov but much can be learned from examining the immunology of other coronaviruses and the history of coronavirus vaccines we must also examine the hostpathogen interaction and ask whether specific antigens proteins derived from the pathogen or host responses such as antibodies and t cell response provide any insight into the type of vaccine that should be developedsars like hiv has the potential to set off a global pandemic in this article we argue that there is much to be learned from the pastboth in terms of building a cooperative approach in order to expedite the development of an effective vaccine and in terms of the scientific knowledge that has emerged as a result of this collaborative process 4 there is no better time to begin working on a new sars vaccine than now it is imperative to capture this moment when the virus is relatively new before clades and strains of this highly virulent airborne virus emergecoronavirus is a common and worldwide pathogen that infects a variety of mammals and birds this virus has been classified into three groups sars-cov has now been assigned to a fourth group because it is unlike other existing coronaviruses 5 coronavirus experts participating in a meeting on sars recently held at the nih
1 reached the following consensus that the sars-cov is most like group 2 which includes bovine and murine coronaviruses 6coronaviruses are positive-strand single-strand rna viruses that belong to the order nidovirales which also includes the families arteriviridae coronaviridae and roniviridae the coronaviridae family contains the genuses coronavirus and torovirus the genus coronavirus is broken down into three groups sars-cov has been assigned to a fourth group see fig 1
7human coronavirus infections hcov are seasonal they generally manifest as wintertime respiratory infections and enteric infections mostly in infants 12 months adult infections are less common than infections among children hcov can also rarely cause neurological syndromes reinfection appears to be common even though antigenic variation is limited in the s or spike protein given that the full extent of hcov variation has yet to be determined it is possible that variations in other non-structural proteins may allow escape from immunity a phenomenon that has been observed with other coronaviruses such as murine hepatitis virus 8 9in contrast with hcov re-infection with sars-cov appears to be relatively rare and in at least one case according to investigators reporting from hong kong at the recent nih conference on sars the reoccurrence was associated with a milder form of the illness while reinfection in the case of common-cold coronavirus hcov-229e implies either that immunity is incomplete or that antigenic variation impedes the development of immunity the low rate of reinfection based on available data that has been observed with sars and the high rate of recovery from acute illness in the absence of effective medical therapy approximately 80 of young adults do recover suggest that protection from disease is achievable this raises hope for the development of a vaccinehowever escape mutations in response to immune pressure have been observed as with hiv 8 9 and selected point mutations are known to causes major shifts in the pathogenicity of coronaviruses as well as in tissue specificity 10 the fact that the virus is famously difficult to replicate without error and that it is able to tolerate large reductions as well as point mutations in its genome suggest that variation in the sequence of sars can be expected as the epidemic continues to move through human populations much as has been observed with hiv accordingly the evolution of strain variability and the identification of conserved or cross-strain epitopes will need to be monitored during the development of a sars-cov vaccine just as the emergence of new strains is monitored for influenzathe genome for the coronavirus believed to be responsible for the global outbreak of sars has been sequenced 11 amplification of short regions of the polymerase gene the most strongly conserved part of the coronavirus genome by rt-pcr and nucleotide sequencing has revealed that the sars virus is a novel coronavirus that has not previously been present in human populations this conclusion is confirmed by serological investigations 12 sars-coronavirus appears to be a novel coronavirus that falls midway between the cat and human species although many coronavirus experts believe that it is closer to group 2 coronavirus bovine cov and mhvthe sars-cov genome is 29727 nucleotides in length and the genome organization is similar to that of other coronaviruses eleven open reading frames corresponding to known coronavirus proteins include the polymerase protein polymerase 1a 1b spike protein s small membrane protein e membrane protein m and nucleocapsid protein n have been identified fig 2
7 these 11 open reading frames are believed to encode as many as 23 separate proteins with both known and unknown functions most of the non-structural proteins seem to be encoded in the first half of the genome whereas most of the structural proteins such as spike membrane envelope and nucleocapsid are located in the second half of the genomemutations in the genome have already been described 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 according to a recent report comparing 14 sars genomes linked by a common point source despite the limited amount of time that elapsed between primary transmission at hotel m and the development of secondary cases in singapore less than 2 months a total of 94 amino acid sequence mutations in the rna polymerase the spike glycoprotein the membrane nucleocapsid and several uncharacterized putative proteins were identified 5 fig 2
one particular amino acid change in position 22222 of the genome an isoleucine residue changed to a threonine a non-conservative amino acid change in the s1 region of the spike protein has been observed this modification which occurred during the carriage of sars-cov from hong kong hotel m to singapore by one patient may have allowed the virus to escape immune response mutations have previously been observed in the mhv spike protein in response to pressure from cell-mediated immune response 13mutation of a large genome 30000 bases in response to immune pressure is an ominous sign for the future of vaccine development against sars-cov and indicates that we may see a degree of variation in the sars genome that matches or exceeds hivthe most common reported clinical presentation of sars based on hospitalized patients is fever 94 more than half of persons affected 5172 report general influenza-like symptoms chills malaise gastrointestinal symptoms loss of appetite and myalgia 14 the mean incubation period of sars is estimated to be between 4 and 6 days the case fatality rate has been as high as 15 for patients younger than 60 years and can be higher than 50 for patients aged 60 years or older nearly 40 of patients developed respiratory failure that requires assisted ventilation 15 most cases occur within 7 days of infection in guandong 70 cases occurred within 7 days after a single point-exposure 16unfortunately given that the clinical manifestations of sars do not allow ready distinction from other common respiratory viral infections the diagnosis of sars may become more difficult as epidemiological links with travel to selected areas diminish over time rapid and accurate diagnostic tools will be critical in the management of this epidemic once these tools are available we may discover as we did with hiv that there are indeed many more persons who are infected yet do not manifest the illnessin other words hospitalized patients may represent just the tip of the icebergdiagnostic tests for sars are currently limited to antibody assays dependent on the development of ab thus detection of infection is only possible 1012 days following infection and pcr assays sensitive but technically difficult in some settings and likely to be false-negative in the early days of the infectiontransmission occurs by droplet transmission and may also occur by the fecal oral route although food is not as yet a suspected means of transmission in the current outbreak sars-cov can be detected at the time of clinical presentation persisting throughout acute illness and decreasing during convalescence according to reports from investigators speaking at the nih conference on sars respiratory secretions are still pcr positive but no virus has been cultured more than 40 days after presentation as are stool samplesin animal coronavirus infection the s protein spike a prominent transmembrane protein two domains s1 and s2 determines the species and tissue specificity of each coronavirus 17 modifications of s are associated with changes in the type of cell targeted by the virus epithelial cells such as those that line the respiratory tract appear to represent the main target for sars although hepatic renal cardiac and ophthalmic tissues may be infected by other coronaviruses coronaviruses have also been reported to infect macrophages in the course of hcov respiratory infections growth of the virus in infected cells appears to be localized to the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract sars-cov in contrast appears to affect cells lining the lower respiratory tracteven though growth in human cell lines is not a common feature of coronaviruses sars virus can be grown in vero cells a fibroblast cell line sars-cov infection results in a cytopathic effect and budding of coronavirus-like particles from the endoplasmic reticulum within infected cells 12 sars-cov does not infect mice nor according to cdc investigators speaking at the nih conference does it infect scid the host target cell range and target cell receptor for sars-cov remain to be discovered at this time finally due to the limited host cell range of the virus no adequate animal model for sars-cov has been foundthe current sars outbreak is believed to have originated in china in late 2002 who issued a global alert about the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome on 12 march 2003 while only five deaths were reported at that time there was immediate and grave concern about the rapid spread of the disease within 2 weeks 11 countries had also reported cases for a total of 569 cases or 264 not including chinese cases in response to these developments cdc issued interim guidance concerning infection control precautions in the health-care and community setting and raised concerns about international travel despite these precautions the numbers of persons and countries affected continued to climb as of 26 may 2003 the who reported a cumulative total of 8202 probable cases with 725 deaths from 28 countries httpwwwwhointcsren fig 3
 health-care workers are increasingly affected by sars the most recent re-emergence of sars in canada is clearly linked to nosocomial transmission 18while local epidemics can be contained with sound barrier precautions there is good reason to believe that sars will become endemic and that outbreaks will recur during the fall and winter transmission seasons one reason to believe that sars will become endemic is that transmission of the virus continues unabated in regions outside of larger cities in china as of 30 may 2003 nine regions in china qualified as having category b second generation or c epidemiologically unlinked transmission
2 pattern c transmission is mainly occurring in regions outside larger cities such as inner mongolia as of this writing no cases of sars had been described in africa india or south america but the impact of the arrival of sars which spreads by both airborne and fecal-oral routes in regions of the world where crowded cities poor sanitation and fragile health-care infrastructures are a fact of life is likely to be revealed over the next few months as with hiv uncontrolled transmission can be expected to occur in regions of the world where access to health-care is poor and understanding of the basic precepts of infectious disease transmissibility is extremely limitedtransmission in pattern c cases may be due to asymptomatic shedders of the sars virus canadian and chinese physicians reported to assembled scientists at the nih conference on sars that a least 14 of contacts in canada and a number of cases in hong kong showed evidence of infection seroconversion but did not report symptoms thus the number of total infections if asymptomatic shedders are included may be much higher than previously reported furthermore serologic evidence of infection has been observed in a range of small animals suggesting that animal reservoirs may exist which would mean that complete eradication of the virus by quarantine may be difficult to achieveno information is available on the immune correlates of protection to sars we are thus forced to extrapolate from available clinical information and from information gleaned from the study of coronavirus infections in animalsseveral aspects of the clinical presentation of sars deserve mention first of all 7080 of individuals recover from infection and there appears to be a relationship between recovery and decline in viral load 7 this suggestion that immunity can be acquired offers great promises for the development of an effective vaccine second anecdotal reports of individuals who have seroconverted but never reported an illness indicate that immunity to infection can occur rapidly after exposure in some individuals and moreover that illness may be preventable third elderly individuals have been observed to have the highest mortality rate greater than 50 higher mortality rates in older individuals may be due to their limited ability to generate new b and t cell responses and contain new infections in summary immunity to sars is achievable and illness may be preventedlastly the clinical presentation of sars is subacute unlike most infectious diseases except for chronic viral diseases like hiv and hepatitis c sars is characterized by a long 510 day prodromal phase a gradual climb in the viral load peaking around day 10 and a decline in viral load by day 15 as symptoms improvefor those individuals who recover from the illness studies contrasting patients who do recover with those who do not have not yet been performedimmune responses may contain and possibly also exacerbate sars while t cell responses would be expected to be present as soon as day 24 of infection antibody seroconversion has been shown to occur at around day 10 when symptoms can exacerbate antibody-mediated exacerbation has been observed in two separate coronaviral diseases in animals feline infectious peritonitis and bovine coronavirus-associated shipping fever see below currently the only accepted clinical intervention in sars has been aggressive suppression of local immune responses using high dose and inhaled steroids ribivarin which has also been used is known to modulate immune responses and may have no direct effect on the sars virus itselfboth cell-mediated and humoral immune responses have been associated with exacerbations of disease in some coronavirus infectionsthese adverse effects must be carefully considered when designing a vaccine for example in the case of murine hepatitis virus mhv a group 2 coronavirus disease t cell response is protective but t cells of both types cd4 and cd8 have been implicated in the demyelination of the brain and spinal cord following infection with neurotropic mhv 19 20 antibody response may also be detrimental in the setting of infectious bronchitis virus ibv in chickensalthough incomplete there is some evidence that birds that have low level humoral immunity as measured by antibody titers in tears do worse than those with higher levels of humoral immune response 21 there is also a link between humoral responses to bovine viral diarrhea virus and the development of shipping fever attributed to a bovine respiratory coronavirus in cattle feedlots 22correlates of protection from coronavirus disease have been studied in animal models coronavirus experts have emphasized that there is a wide range of coronavirus diseases and that the clinical manifestations of the disease and the correlates of protection can vary widely between pathogens and between animal modelsboth humoral and cellular immune responses contribute to protection against coronavirus disease in animal models in some settings antibodies and t cells contribute to exacerbation of the pathology although the mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood and the role of cd8 versus humoral responses is hotly debated in coronavirus infections such as mhv and bocv bovine coronavirus also group 2 t cells are critical to protection against illness both cd4 and cd8 t cells t helper and cytotoxic t cells or ctl respectively are involved 23 24 t cell immunity is also required for protection against porcine endemic diarrhea virus pedv 25 and both humoral and cell-mediated immunity are involved in the immune response to turkey coronavirus infection tcov 26 infectious bronchitis virus is a devastating disease for chicken producers and has been the focus of many vaccine studies both cd8 and cd4 t cells appear to be involved in the protective immune response to ibv 24 25 26 27it is also important to note that cross-virus t cell immunity does exist as has been described between japanese encephalitis virus jev and west nile virus wnv in animal models 28 for example pigs who have had been exposed to porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv are protected against virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus vte in a protective immune response that is attributed to t cells protection correlates with t cell proliferation 29there is evidence in mhv that t cells are required to eradicate infection while antibody is involved in reducing viral load during acute infection 30 these differences may be related to the ability of some coronaviruses to form syncitia note that syncitia-like giant cells were observed in lung tissue specimens derived from sars patients 31 if cell-to-cell transmission via syncitia formation also occurs in sars eradication of the sars-cov may also not be achieved by humoral response alone therefore t cell immunity may be required to clear infection 23a number of laboratories have mapped t cell epitopes in coronavirus infections for example cd4 t cell epitopes have been identified in the m and nucleocapsid proteins of mhv 32 33 in the nucleocapsid of an avian coronavirus 34 and in tgev of swine 35 persistent infection in the case of mhv seems to be due to ctl escape mutations in the viral genomes that abrogate the ability of the cellular immune system to stimulate ctl response mutation occurs even in the mhv spike protein in response pressure from cell-mediated immune response 13 escape from ctl response may allow mhv to persist in the cns 8 9 36 the mhv-specific ctl response is polyclonal but ctl escape occurs nonetheless 37 38this type of mutation in response to immune pressure that has been observed for some coronaviruses is highly reminiscent of ctl escape that has been observed in the course of hiv infection since sars-cov like hiv is an rna virus that has an error-prone replication mechanism there is reason to be concerned that variants of sars-cov that escape cellular immune response may also evolve mutations in the sars-cov genome in the s protein which may have occurred in response to immune pressure have been described 7live attenuated coronavirus vaccines can be made by deletion in group specific genes which are specific for each of the groupsdeleting these genes does not alter replication but does attenuate the virus 39 live attenuated ibv vaccine has been combined with inactivated ibv with good success in broiler chickens 29 live attenuated vaccines have also been made using a more traditional method which consists in passaging the virus obtained from one species of animal pigs in cells derived from another species cattle 40in general the fact that live attenuated vaccines are significantly more effective than whole killed vaccines in animal disease suggests that the development of cell-mediated immunity is critical to protection against coronaviruses however there is great concern that the vaccine strain could recombine with wild type circulating strains 41 and it is unlikely that the fda will approve the use of live attenuated sars-cov vaccines in humans without extensive evidence that recombination and reversion to virulence do not occurwhole killed vaccines are very common in the animal food industry as they are generally safe and cheap to produce autologous vaccines which are vaccines that are developed for a virus circulating in a specific herd of cattle or group of chickens are often used and limited licenses are issued to allow the use of these vaccines in a specific geographic region this approach has been used with coronaviruses as both bocv and ibv are significant pathogens for cattle and chickens a whole killed bovine coronavirus vaccine has been developed for cattle that appeared to be safe and effective 42 an inactivated canine coronavirus vaccine is available to protect against canine coronavirus in young dogs however as it is not clear that this killed vaccine can protect against different strains of canine coronavirus the vaccine is underutilized in the veterinary industry 43 in a comparison of vaccines to prevent ibv live attenuated vaccine appeared to be much more effective than whole killed vaccine 44recombinant subunit vaccines use of molecular biology techniques to produce large quantities of recombinant viral proteins are likewise expected to be limited in their ability to protect against viruses that have evolved in the human population under immune pressure causing significant variation in the viral genome while recombinant technology will certainly permit the rapid development of a sars spike protein-based vaccineefforts are already underway to produce such proteins safelythe need for t cell immunity as has been shown with mhv and bocv two related viruses and the description of s1 region variability so early in the epidemic point to the fact that this approach will need to be supplemented by a cell-mediated immunity-directed vaccine which is relevant to the whole of the sars genomea recombinant fowlpox containing the s1 gene of ibv has been produced and was shown to be relatively protective against ibv 45 a fowlpox virus expressing c terminal nucleocapsid protein of ibv has also been developed this construct protects against challenge by homologous strain and some cross-strain protection has also been observed this cross-strain protection may have been due to effective presentation of conserved ctl epitopes by the viral vector 46 a dna vaccine containing the nucleoprotein gene of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus ptgv has been used to vaccinate against gastroenteritisboth humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are induced 47note that who officials have raised concern that coronavirus variation will make it difficult to develop a single vaccine based on the spike protein as with flu it may become necessary to update the vaccine which would require similar global surveillancethe vectored approach dna or viral vector is currently highly favored by coronavirus experts the dna prime and adenovirus or mva boost approach that is currently being explored for hiv vaccine development might be an avenue worth exploring for the sars pathogen a multi-valent multi gene mixed humoral and cell-mediated approach is strongly supported by coronavirus experts since all of the animal models point to the involvement of more than one arm of the immune systemepitopes are easily delivered in the context of dna or viral vectors an epitope-driven approach to coronavirus vaccine development has already been attempted with some success 48 one advantage of the epitope based approach is that any region of the sars-cov genome that may be similar to self and therefore associated with a potential for autoimmune effectscan be eliminated the epitope-based approach would avoid any possibility of reversion to virulence and may be better able to avoid the type of vaccine-induced enhancement of disease that appears to be associated with some vaccines against bocv fipv and mhv a cell-mediated immunity-directed vaccine that is highly unlikely to recombine this statement is most true with epitope-based vaccines and least true with live attenuated vaccines could also be useful for the treatment of sars this method has been used for some hiv vaccines and could provide an ethically appropriate avenue for the testing of a safe epitope-based sars vaccine in humansvariation leads to escape as subunit or whole killed vaccines can only prime against one strain of virus their efficacy against variant viruses may be lower if sars evolves as hiv has the development of viral variability may preclude the use of a single strain of sars-cov in a vaccine one means of solving the problem of variability is to search for conserved epitopes that are conserved across strains of sars-cov epitopes that are highly mutable will not protect against sars-cov as the virus evolves which may make the selection of epitopes that are highly conserved as with the some hiv vaccines under development 4 very relevant herethere is much to be learned from the hiv vaccine effort and from previous studies of coronavirus vaccines in animals that is applicable to sars there are worrisome similarities between sars-cov and hiv both are rna viruses and able to mutate under selection pressure in the host and coronaviruses are especially prone to mutation and recombination sars-cov sequencing has already uncovered some evidence of mutation in response to immune pressure selecting multiple highly conserved achilles heel epitopes from the sars immunome as has been done for at least one hiv vaccine prototype 4 will permit the development of a vaccine that will remain relevant as sars-cov evolvesboth humoral and cell-mediated immune responses may be required to protect against sars-cov there is however some evidence from animal studies that humoral response to some coronaviruses can contribute to host pathology and the role of antibody in the exacerbation of disease in sars has yet to be defined until the role of antibody is clarified vaccines directed at eliciting humoral immunity need to be evaluated for their potential to exacerbate disease cross-reactive t cell responses have also been implicated in host pathology in the mhv model therefore developing a t cell-directed vaccine that is composed of t cell epitopes that are in no way cross-reactive with the host may be the safest approach consideration might also be given to combining a t cell-directed vaccine with a whole recombinant vectored spike protein vaccine should both vaccines prove safe and efficaciousthe immune responses of recovering and convalescent sars patients provide the most important measure of immunity to sars vaccine design the immune responses of these patients should be used to direct the development of the vaccinein conclusion the development of a sars vaccine should be pursued with the utmost urgency as sars is highly lethal and is likely to become endemic in underdeveloped regions of the world a pathway to vaccine development that will take advantage of the collective expertise of the vaccine development community making available vaccine components such as vectors and delivery vehicles that have been previously evaluated in human clinical trials will expedite the development of a vaccine research reagents should also be collected and shared these would include sars peptides adjuvants dna vaccine vectors and clinical grade viral vectors we have much to learn from the hiv vaccine effort which has been marred by grandstanding and poor cooperation rapidly developing a collaborative approach to developing a sars vaccine that will be both effective and safe is the best way to address

disease 19 covid-19 has spread to 210 countries which is rare among acute infectious diseases in recent years and caused a great threat to global public health 1 this disease was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and it is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades 23 since the first human coronavirus detected in the 1960s sars-cov-2 is the seventh coronavirus that is known to infect humans fig 1

astragalus polysaccharide aps is the most important bioactive component isolated from a chinese traditional herbal medicine of astragalus membranaceus which is composed of glucose mannose d-glucose and d-galactose fig 3 44 45 46 radix isatidis ri is also a kind of traditional chinese herbal medicine with significant antiviral effect and polysaccharide is its main active component 4748 the polysaccharide from ri is mainly composed of mannose glucose galactose and arabinose 49 mushrooms are used as food for long time in china and also are drugs in the orient centuries 50 lentinus edodes is one of the most widely edible mushrooms and is popularly consumed as health foods in asian countries 5051 among the bioactive components of mushrooms the lentinus edodes polysaccharide lentinan lnt is the most extensively investigated with many immune processes which is generally described as biological response modifiers 5253 it consists of a -1  3-glucan backbone with -1  6-glucosyl side-branching units terminated by mannosyl or galactosyl residues fig 3 5051 recently lnt has been widely used as an alternative medicine and dietary supplement in the world 50cell surface gags serve as co-receptors by increasing the local concentration of pathogens so that they can more efficiently interact with their entry receptors most coronavirus receptors of carbohydrate are mainly negatively charged such as sulfated gags or glycans containing sialic acid 5455 s protein concentrated outside the virus contains the receptor binding domains rbds at the n-terminal such as mhv-cov n-rbd and sars c-rbd with their receptor fig 2bd 75657 the coronavirus nl63 cov-nl63 and sars-cov use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a primary receptor for infection of target cells fig 2 565859 phylogenetically sars-cov-2 is almost identical to sars-cov sharing 796 genomic sequence identity 60 and use the same cell entry receptor ace2 as sars-cov 860 during infection cov first binds host cell via interaction between its s1-rbd and the cell membrane receptor triggering conformational changes in the s2 subunit that result in virus fusion and entry into the target cell viral rna gradually forms mature virions through replication transcription and synthesis and then is released from host cell fig 4
 860 61 62 however the expression of ace2 is not sufficient for infection and hspgs play important roles in the entry of some pathogens such as sars-cov 63 64 65 a soluble hs was used to assess whether the attachment of hcov-nl63 was mediated by hs proteoglycans flow cytometric analysis showed that the adhesion of virus to llc-mk2 cells was completely inhibited in the presence of soluble hs indicating the role of this molecule in adhesion to susceptible cells and possible also in cell entry 54 both cov-nl63 and sars-cov initially bind to the hs on the cell surface and virus entry depends on the hs interaction indicating that hs can inhibit virus attachment and entry 2254natural products of hs and the allied polysaccharide heparin are involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including s-associated coronavirus strain hsr1 66 hs is known to bind cov surface proteins and to be used by coronavirus for its attachment to target cells 54 currently there are no commercially available medicinal products designed to treat andor prevent infections associated with the novel sars-cov-2 coronavirus outbreak the surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism were used to measure the interaction between the sars-cov-2 spike s1 protein rbd sars-cov-2 s1 rbd and heparin additionally basic amino acids are known to dictate the binding between proteins and heparin primary sequence analysis of the expressed protein domain and analysis of the modeled sars-cov-2 s1 rbd structure show that there are several potential heparin binding sites and more importantly theses patches of basic amino acids are exposed on the protein surface this study has implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and for next-generation tailor-made gag-based antivirals 66marine polysaccharides such as carrageenan pgs chitosan and their derivatives show good inhibitory activity against various viruses which provides a reference for their research on coronavirus iota-carrageenan containing lozenges show highly active against human rhinovirus hrv influenza virus a h1n1 and hcov oc43 throughout the entire dissolution process and are a promising therapy against viral infections of throat 67 the cationically modified chitosan n-2-hydroxypropyl-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride htcc shows significant inhibition against the human coronavirus hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 and its hydrophobically modified derivative hm-htcc is a potent inhibitor of the coronavirus hcov-nl63 indicating that htcc polymers based on chitosan are effective inhibitors of all low-pathogenic human coronaviruses 68 acute viral upper respiratory tract infection also known as common cold is mainly caused by respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus coronavirus influenza virus 69 70 71 clinical trials applying iota-carrageenan nasal spray have shown to reduce the duration of a virus-confirmed common cold carrageenan nasal spray shows significant antiviral efficacy in three virus subgroups hrv human coronavirus and influenza a virus iav and the highest effectiveness was observed in human corona virus-infected patients the reduced duration of disease was 3 days p  001 and the number of relapses was three times less p  001 in carrageenan treated corona-virus -infected patients compared to control patients 70after the outbreak of sars in 2003 many survivors developed residual pulmonary fibrosis with increased severity in older patients pulmonary fibrosis is caused by a hyperactive host response to lung injury mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor egfr signaling in animal models fig 5
 inhibition of egfr signaling can prevent an excessive fibrotic response to sars-cov and other respiratory viral infections 72 moreover sulfated polysaccharides such as fucoidan and sulfated rhamnan can interfere or inhibit the expression and activation of egfr pathway which may help to suppress coronavirus 7374 the understanding of how polysaccharides play a role in egfr and other pro-fibrotic pathways after viral infection will provide new ideas for covid-19 treatmenttraditional chinese herbal medicine is widely used in the prevention and treatment of viral infectious diseases in china 75 some chinese herbs contain potential anti-sars-cov-2 active compounds especially hedysarum multijugum maxim coptidis rhizoma and forsythiae fructus which have been catalogued for treating viral respiratory infections 76 this provides a basis for the application of traditional chinese medicine polysaccharides in coronavirus the avian coronavirus causes infectious bronchitis ib which is one of the most serious diseases affecting the avian industry worldwide aps can significantly reduce the replication of ibv in infected chicken embryo kidney cek cells in a dose-dependent manner the titer of ibv-specific antibodies lymphocyte proliferation and the expression levels of interleukin il-1 il-2 il-8 and tnf-a in aps treatment groups were higher than those in the control group these data suggest that aps enhances the immune response to ibv vaccination in chickens and is a potential therapeutic agent for inhibiting ibv 7778 during the outbreak of sars coronaviruses in china ri as a chinese medicinal herb was prepared as an antiviral drug 79 polysaccharides isolated from ri have been shown to stimulate the expression of cytokines such as il-2 and interferon inf- thereby regulating and enhancing non-specific immunological function humoral immunity and cellular immunity in mice to play antiviral effects 48 active compounds derived from cultured lentinula edodes mycelia ahcc is an -glucan-based standardized mushroom extract that has been extensively investigated as an immunostimulant both in animals and in humans affected by influenza virus herpes virus avian influenza virus aiv human papillomavirus hpv hepatitis b virus hbv and human immunodeficiency virus hiv by promoting a regulated and protective immune response 80 due to its action in promoting a protective response to a wide range of viral infections which can support its use in the prevention of diseases provoked by a human pathogenic coronavirus including covid-19 80polysaccharides especially sulfated polysaccharides can interact with the surface of virus by negative charge thereby inhibiting the infectious ability of the virus or killing the virus directly pathogens use gags at almost every major entry portal to promote their attachment and invasion of host cells to move from one cell to another and to protect themselves from immune attack 22 for example fucosylated chondroitin sulfate was effective in blocking laboratory strain hiv-1iiib entry and replication 426 gml and 073 gml respectively and inhibiting infection by clinic isolate hiv-1km018 and hiv-1tc-2 2375 gml and 3186 gml respectively as well as suppressing hiv-1 drug-resistant virus further studies indicated that fucosylated chondroitin sulfate can potently bind the recombinant hiv-1 gp120 protein to inhibit several strains of hiv-1 82 a cationically modified chitosan derivative htcc has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of hcov-nl63 replication the analysis of the interaction between htcc polymer and the recombinant ectodomain of the s protein from cov showed binding resulting in the formation of protein-polymer complexes one may assume that such binding will result in the efficient inactivation of the virus 83 carrageenan acts primarily by preventing the binding or the entry of virions into cells 8485 iota-carrageenan a high molecular weight sulfated polysaccharide is an approved antiviral drug that interacts with the viral surface 67 the binding and inactivation of virus particles by iota-carrageenan are fast and highly effective during the residence time of the iota-carrageenan containing lozenge in the mouth the viral titer is reduced by 85 and 91 for iav and hcov-oc43 respectively 67 furthermore animal experiments have shown that iota-carrageenan can reduce the spreading of influenza virus in surface epithelia of infected animals and thereby provided sufficient benefits for animals to promote survival 86the first step for virus to invade a cell is to bind to the cell surface by electrostatic interaction or a receptor such as heparan sulfated proteoglycan on the cell surface polysaccharides especially sulfated polysaccharides have strong polyanionic properties and can block the positive charge on the cell surface to prevent virus adsorption or invasion 12 the invasion process of virus is often associated with the endocytosis of virus the fusion of virus with cell membrane and the translocation of virus 12 heparin or heparin-like materials with broad-spectrum antiviral properties 87 88 89 have been developed to mimic the cell surface carbohydrates responsible for initial viral attachment such as hs and carrageenan 3490 the sulfated polysaccharide derived from marine microalga showed strong inhibition against iav infection via the viral adsorption and internalization steps 91 the antiviral effect of sulfated polysaccharides from seaweeds was mainly exerted during dengue virus denv-2 adsorption and internalization 92 iota-carrageenan and its n-sulfonated derivatives of poly allylamine hydrochloride showed strong antiviral activities against human metapneumovirus hmpv a kind of respiratory infections rna virus by blocking virus release from the cellular membrane and inhibiting virus adsorption 93 iota-carrageenan also effectively prevents the replication of hrv in primary human nasal epithelial cells in culture the data suggest that iota-carrageenan acts primarily by preventing the binding or the entry of virions into the cells 85 fucoidan can bind to the neuraminidase na of iav and inhibit the activity of na to block the release of iav additionally fucoidan can also interfere with the activation of egfr pkc nf-b and akt and inhibit both iav endocytosis and egfr internalization in iav-infected cells 73 the antiviral mechanism of the fucoidans may be through blocking herpes simplex virus hsv-2 virion adsorption to host cells 94 our team found that 36-o-sulfated chitosan 36s possessed broad anti-hpv activities by directly targeting viral capsid protein and host pi3kaktmtor pathway to inhibit cell autophagy fig 6
 95 interestingly using hcov-nl63 as a model system it can be determined that htcc polymer blocks the interaction between s protein and cell receptor consequently blocking its entry into cells and preventing virus infection 6896 the nanomicrospheres of n-2-hydroxypropyl -3-trimethyl chitosan htcc-nsms were used for adsorption of the coronavirus hcov-nl63 from aqueous virus suspensions this nanomicrospheres can be applied for the removal of coronaviruses and purification of water from pathogenic coronaviruses 97polysaccharides especially sulfated polysaccharides can directly interfere with viral replication related enzymes and relevant targets in host cells iota-carrageenan can effectively inhibit porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv replication at mrna and protein levels in both marc-145 cells and porcine alveolar macrophages 98 carrageenan oligosaccharide and its sulphated derivative have good inhibitory effects on iav replication both in vitro and in vivo while not seem to be dependent on the interferon system 99 sulfated polysaccharide from gracilaria lemaneiformis shows anti-influenza virus activities in vitro by inhibiting viral adsorption and replication on host cells 100 polysaccharides isolated from grifola frondosa showed resistance against enterovirus 71 a positive-stranded rna virus by blocking viral replication and inhibiting viral vp1 protein expression and genomic rna synthesis 101 the virus replication was inhibited by a sulfated polysaccharide from angelica sinensis which is a commonly used traditional chinese herbal medicine at the dose of 10 and 30 mgkg 26 and 30 inhibition respectively 102 aps has a long-lasting inhibitory effect on hbv replication in vivo which can be used as a supplementary modality to treat hepatitis b infection 103 furthermore aps can inhibit the replication of avian ibv in vitro in a dose-dependent manner 78after the virus invades the host it will trigger the hosts immune response such as regulating the host nk and macrophages cells inducing the production of immune cytokines and indirectly exert antiviral effects by activating innate immunity chitosan can enhance antigen-specific immune responses by increasing the induction of regulatory t cells lung resident t cells and neutralizing antibodies while reversing th2-skewed immune responses induced by inactivated respiratory syncytial virus rsv vaccine without affecting lung histopathology in mice 13 the sulphated-carrageenan from red alga showed a strong effect on tobacco mosaic virus tmv infection by affecting virus accumulationinfectivity and enhancing locally plant immunity 104 aps can significantly enhance the immunological function of chicken erythrocytes after infected with infectious bursa disease virus ibdv 105 additionally aps can reduce the replication of h9n2 aiv and promote early humoral immune responses in young chickens 17 lnt can significantly down-regulate the expression level of tnf- il-2 and il-11 and up-modulate the expression levels of ifn-1 and ifn- after challenging with infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus ihnv which is an rna virus the results indicate that the inhibitory effects of lnt on ihnv infection are possibly attributed to its regulation of the innate immune responses and specific immunity 51in addition our team found that pgs a sulfated derivative of alginate can effectively inhibit the expression and secretion of hbsag and hbeag in hepg2215cells the anti-hbv mechanism of pgs may be associated with appropriate activation of nf-b and rafmekerk signaling pathways to enhance the interferon system and interfere with hbv transcription fig 7
 this study suggested that pgs merits further investigation as a novel anti-hbv agent aimed at modulating the host innate immune system in the future 42 these studies bring new ideas to the development of current anti-novel coronavirus drugsvaccination is the most successful and effective medical intervention to prevent infectious diseases which can reduce mortality prolong life expectancy and improve quality of life 106 the development of a vaccine for coronavirus is a critical step in prevention but it may not be effective for future strains and we must be ready for the next epidemic 3 polysaccharide adjuvant can enhance the immune effect of a vaccine thus promoting body-specific immunity and non-specific immunity cellular immunity humoral immunity and mucosal immunity 107 chitosan is effective in stimulating humoral and cell-mediated immune responses with a proven safety record in animals and humans which has been used as adjuvant for improving vaccine efficacy especially in rna virus vaccines 13108109 chitosan can only modestly protect animals against rsv infection when given post-infection while it can significantly reduce rsv infection in mice when combined with inactivated rsv vaccine before infection this study suggested that chitosan can be applied as a potential treatmentadjuvant for rsv infection 13 chitosan-adjuvanted vaccines can enhance antibody titers against a- and b-type human influenza viruses 4 to 6 times compared with the vaccines without chitosan inactivated aiv ah5n2 admixed with chitosan when administered to mice challenged afterwards with the same virus showed higher immunogenicity and protective efficacy compared with the antigen without chitosan 110 chitosan adjuvanted vaccine stored at 4 c can preserve its adjuvant properties for at least 8 months chitosan can stimulate proliferative and cytotoxic activity of splenic mononuclear leukocytes in mice 111 thus chitosan is a promising adjuvant candidate for inactivated influenza vaccines which provides a reference for the development of anti-novel coronavirus vaccinesalthough sars-cov vaccines can protect against lethal infection the addition of delta inulin-based polysaccharide adjuvant on day 3 post-challenge can significantly increase serum neutralizing-antibody titers and reduce lung virus titers it also shows that immunity achieved with delta inulin adjuvants is long-lived thereby overcoming the natural tendency for rapidly waning coronavirus immunity this suggests that delta inulin polysaccharide adjuvants have the potential to develop more effective coronavirus vaccines 20 in addition some chinese herbal medicinal polysaccharides have been used as safe and effective adjuvants 77107112113 aps as an adjuvant combined with influenza vaccine can improve the immune response and systemic humoral response to h5n1 virus infection 46114 aps can potentially be used as an immunomodulator for a foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv which is an rna virus vaccine and provide better protection against fmdv 115 aps is also a potent adjuvant for hepatitis b dna vaccine and can enhance the immune responses of hbv dna vaccine via promoting dendritic cells maturation and inhibit the regulatory t cells frequency 116 polysaccharide extract from ri exerts potent anti-iav activity against human seasonal influenza viruses h1n1 and h3n2 and aiv h6n2 and h9n2 in vitro 49 the polysaccharides also significantly reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 and strongly inhibited the protein expression of tlr-3 induced by pr8 the polysaccharide extract from ri therefore has the potential to be used as an adjunct to antiviral therapy for the treatment of iav infection 49additionally peptide-based vaccines have become as a potentially important strategy for the development of therapeutic vaccination 117118 they do not require in vitro culture making them biologically safe and their selectivity can accurately activate the immune responses 119120 for example a hydrocarbon-stapled short -helical peptide can effectively inhibit mers-cov infection and its s protein-mediated cell-cell fusion 121 the epitopes selected from the s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 can be used to design and prepare immunogenic multi-epitopic peptide vaccine against novel coronavirus disease caused by sars-cov-2 122123 the t cell multi epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for covid-19 using the envelope protein of sars-cov-2 as an immunogenic target 124 carrageenan and its structurally related compounds may serve as innovative adjuvants for enhancing peptide-based vaccine potency through immune enhancement 118 the glycopeptides prepared by the combination of selected polysaccharides with peptides and the peptide vaccines with polysaccharide adjuvants will have important application prospects for inhibiting coronavirusesnanobiotechnology provides a variety of solutions for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases such as viruses nanoparticles can be designed as an efficient delivery system to increase the activity of low toxicity vaccines against the host 125 the application of nanoparticles in vaccine formulations can not only improve the immunogenicity and stability of antigen but also achieve targeted delivery and sustained release 126 nanomaterials may have intrinsic immunomodulatory functions acting as adjuvants or immune potentiators 127 the chitosanalginate nanoparticle encapsulated bee venom bv with slow-releasing properties and mucosal adhesiveness has been developed which can effectively induce non-specific immune stimulation particularly those related to th1 responses and viral clearance activities against prrsv infection 128 the effectiveness of a novel nanoparticle vaccine is supported by stimulating effective neutralizing antibody and antigen-specific t cell responses in mice immunized with a mers-cov nanoparticle vaccine candidate using a mers-cov-permissive transgenic mouse model it is shown that the mice immunized with this nanoparticle-based mers-cov vaccine can protect against a lethal challenge of mers-cov without triggering undesirable eosinophilic immunopathology the biocompatible hollow nanoparticle may accelerate the development of effective and safe vaccines against emerging coronavirus pathogens 129 bovine coronavirus bcv n protein-loaded chitosan nanoparticles cnp can significantly increase both iga and igg levels after the second immunization comparable to the control group the igm content in serum increased after the second immunization in the bcv n protein-loaded cnp group these findings indicate that cnp can be used as a novel adjuvant in veterinary vaccine field 130in addition the gold nanoparticles aunps-based nanomaterials also have good application prospects in anti-novel coronavirus an electrochemical immunosensor based on an array of aunps-modified carbon electrodes was used for the determination of mers-cov fig 8
 131 highly sulfonated gold nanoparticles and heparin coated aunps with no cytotoxicity displayed broad-spectrum virucidal properties against hsv hpv rsv dengue and lentivirus in vitro 132 s protein plays a key role in the pathogenesis of coronavirus and it is considered a primary target for vaccine preparation 8133 virus like particles svlps were prepared by protein corona formation with ibv s protein as a model antigen and incubated with 100 nm aunps in a solution containing an optimized concentration of viral proteins 133 as compared to inoculation with free proteins vaccination with the svlps showed enhanced lymphatic antigen delivery stronger antibody titers increased splenic t-cell response and reduced infection-associated symptoms in an avian model of coronavirus infection 133 the study demonstrates a simple and reliable method in bridging viral antigens with synthetic nanoparticles for improved vaccine application 133additionally polysaccharides or their derivatives such as carrageenan oligosaccharide and fucoidan derived from marine algae with biodegradability abundance and non-toxicity can be used as biocompatible reductants for green synthesis aunps 134135 based on our previous works we hypothesize that the s or n protein from coronavirus can be designed to be loaded onto polysaccharides capped aunps by protein corona formation for coronavirus nanoparticles vaccine application fig 9
polysaccharides have a long history to be used as important active ingredients in traditional chinese medicine due to their extensive activity and reliable safety polysaccharides have broad spectrum of antiviral activities and unique antiviral mechanisms they can exert antiviral effects by interfering with the life cycle of virus or can indirectly exert antiviral activities by enhancing the bodys immunity which makes them have a great application prospect in anti-coronavirus gags marine polysaccharides such as carrageenan and chitosan traditional chinese medicine polysaccharides such as aps and lnt and their derivatives have shown potent anti-coronavirus activity and multiple anti-coronavirus mechanisms we speculate that polysaccharides will exert anti-sars-cov-2 effects by the possible mechanisms as shown in fig 10
 more importantly polysaccharide-based vaccine adjuvants nanomaterials and drug delivery systems will play important roles in anti-coronavirus field based on the immunomodulation and antiviral activity of polysaccharides combined with nanotechnology we put forward the strategy of loading s or n protein of coronavirus onto polysaccharide capped aunps vaccine for covid-19 treatment fig 9 this review may provide a novel idea for the development of anti-covid-19 drugs and vaccinessudden outbreak of a novel and alarming contagious primary atypical viral pneumonia was first observed in wuhan china in december 2019 and spread globally resulting in a pandemic situation screening of this virus led to the identification of zoonotic coronavirus similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus researchers coined this disease as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1 this disease mainly affects respiratory organs causing pneumonia and multi-organ failure though it starts with common cold symptoms with shortness of breath 2 according to the data chart as of 23rd march 2020 the rate of deaths per number of diagnosed cases found to be 44 although according to age group and other health problems it ranges from 0215 the world health organization who declared the 20192020 outbreak of the virus as a public health emergency of international concern pheic on 30th january 2020 and a pandemic on 11th march 2020 based upon current researches this virus is spreading from one human to another through respiratory droplets ie cough and sneezecoronavirus comes under the subfamily orthocoronavirinae in the family coronaviridae 3 it is a common cold virus and considered to be the weakest in this family coronavirus is an enveloped positive-sense ribonucleic acid rna virus characterised by the club-like spikes projecting from the surface genetic sequencing of covid-19 is a little bit difficult as the virus show cytopathic effect according to research covid-19 is closely related to the batcov ratg13 sequence although ratg13 does not show the exact variant of the novel virus they also suggested that this novel coronavirus is not motley in nature and that almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage is found within beta coronavirus 4covid-19 is mostly affecting the lungs because it accesses host cell through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 abundant in type ii alveolar cells of lungs this virus seems to have a particular structure that contains a special surface glycoprotein called spike peplomer to connect to ace2 and to enter the host cell diagnosis of this virus is possible by using a standard method reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr from a nasopharyngeal swab but still now there is no definite vaccine treatment or cure it has been observed that the effect of the virus is mostly on the individual with low immunity individual affected with diseases like diabetes individual with cardiovascular disease cvd and individual using any immune-suppressed drug or having past history of major surgeries or severe medical conditions till now there has not been any specific treatment found for this virus hence there is a critical need to discover alternative techniques to cope with the current scenario this review conducted an online search for prevention of coronavirus infection with the help of nutritional interventions it is invalid to say that consumption of healthy foods or following the traditional methods will cure the effects of covid-19 but the inclusion of some nutrition interventions can surely act as immune-boosters which can help us to avoid this type of fatal diseases and their consequences as we know prevention is always better than curevitamin a comes in the category of fat-soluble vitamins it is the first vitamin which was recognised as fat-soluble -carotene is known as a plant-derived precursor of vitamin a this vitamin plays a very crucial role in the bodys immune system as many of the bodys defences against infection depend on its adequate intake due to this the vitamin is known as anti-infective various facets of innate immunity along with barrier function are controlled by vitamin a and its metabolites vitamin a is present in the body in three active forms retinal retinol and retinoic acid retinoic acid acts as a ligand and activates nuclear retinoic acid receptor rar while unknown metabolites may activate the retinoid x receptor rxr hence retinoic acid all-trans and 9-cis plays vital roles in the regulation of the differentiation maturation and function of the innate immune system and cells innate immune cells consist of neutrophils and macrophages retinoic acid encourages an instantaneous response to pathogen incursion with the help of phagocytosis and activation of natural killer nk t cells which link immune-regulatory functions by cytotoxic activity 5 retinoic acid can also reform the differentiation of dendritic cell precursors which are specialised protectors of the immune system managing innate and adaptive immune responses 6 many researchers reported that incorporation of vitamin a in the diet helps in protecting the body against various life-threatening diseases and infections like human immunodeficiency virus hiv malaria coronary heart diseases and various lung-related disorders 7 8 therefore low vitamin a status can be directly correlated with the hindered function of immune cells hence vitamin a deficiency is linked with altered barrier function impaired immune responses and increased sensitivity to a variety of infections according to a study mice having low vitamin a status were more prone to the entry of pathogens due to the breakdown of the gut barrier and altered mucus secretion furthermore a kind of coronavirus infection called infectious bronchitis virus ibv has a more pronounced effect in chickens who were fed a diet which was slightly lacking in vitamin a as compared with the chickens who were fed a diet sufficient in vitamin a 9 thus in consideration of the recent time where no successful treatment is there for covid-19 vitamin a may be one of the possible choices moreover a recent study reported that individuals having vitamin a deficiency display histopathological alterations causing an increased risk of lung dysfunction and respiratory disease 10 this is especially appropriate considering the effects that covid-19 have on respiration and lung function dietary sources of vitamin a are given in table 1it is a water-soluble vitamin it is also known as ascorbic acid or no-scurvy acid it plays a very crucial role in collagen formation in connective tissues vitamin c is also known as a classical antioxidant directly suppressing free radicals in the aqueous layer while oxidising itself to dehydroascorbic acid additionally an increased dietary ascorbic acid intake has been directly proportional to lesser concentrations of c-reactive proteins which are responsible for inflammation in the body 11 however vitamin c also plays the role of a cofactor for a variety of biosynthetic and gene regulatory enzymes proposing immune-modulating effects various in vitro and pre-clinical trials have shown the barrier-enhancing properties of vitamin c moreover vitamin c can also adjust gene expression in dermal fibroblasts improving their multiplication and migration which play predominant roles for tissue remodelling and are significant in wound healing 12 13 vitamin c is also known to stimulate neutrophil apoptosis to protect the hosts tissue from vigorous damage and further supports in macrophage removal furthermore ascorbic acid plays a vital role in the proliferation and maturation of t cells which are lymphocyte immune cells that protect the body from various pathogens and cancer cells many researchers reported that taking adequate amount of vitamin c in diet boosts immunity and helps the individual to becomes less prone to diseases and infections for example atherton et al 14 had reported that the resistance and immunity of chick embryo and tracheal organs against coronavirus have increased by the ingestion of vitamin c vitamin c is also known as a weak anti-histamine agent as it prevents and relieves the individual from various flu-like symptoms for instance sneezing nasal congestion rhinorrhoea and sinus congestion 15 vitamin c has shown its positive effects on respiratory-related disorders also with the help of three controlled clinical human trials it was revealed that groups fed and supplemented with vitamin c showed a lower prevalence of pneumonia which resulted from the fact that vitamin c might control and reduce the vulnerability to lower respiratory tract infections in some occasions 16 furthermore in a double-blinded controlled trial with old-aged candidates 200 mgday of ascorbic acid for about 4 weeks enhanced respiratory conditions 17 in another analysis of eight randomised control trials rcts in 3135 children vitamin c administration with 052 gday did not inhibit upper respiratory tract infection but decreased the time span of infection by 16 days 18 many recent cases revealed that the novel covid-19 leads to lower respiratory tract infections and therefore taking vitamin c could be an effective player in the treatment and prevention against this virus table 2 in support of this according to a report by china and the usa vitamin c supplementation has shown improvement in the conditions of patients suffering from covid-19 19 it has also been reported that vitamin c has an inhibitory effect against various other viruses including influenza hiv rabies virus avian rna tumour viruses herpesviruses and paramyxoviruses parvovirus and human lymphotropic virus type 1 htlv-1 20 dietary sources of vitamin c are given in table 1it is one of the most crucial vitamins it is not only a vitamin but also a hormone which can be produced in our body by the exposure of sunlight this vitamin plays a very important role in maintaining bone integrity it is a fat-soluble vitamin that acts as a crucial player in regulating both innate and adaptive immune responses the major source is obtained from ultraviolet-induced conversion of its precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to cholecalciferol vitamin d3 21 according to various studies calcitriol an active form of vitamin d is activated by ultraviolet radiations leading to a rise in the production of antiviral peptidase increasing the oxidative rupture capacity of microphage and stopping the excessive expression of proinflammatory cytokines which are a type of signalling molecule that promotes inflammation 22 23 based on a study it has been demonstrated that vitamin d is also known to improve the innate immunity by upregulating the expression and excretion of dominant antimicrobial peptides in immune cells which further improves mucosal defence against various viral infections 24 in support of this vitamin d has shown a beneficial effect in various other viral infections such as adding vitamin d to conventional ribavirin therapy for treating patients with chronic hepatitis c virus hcv considerably improved the viral response 25 another study reported on a decreased risk of influenza and covid-19 infection typically due to connected inflammatory status and antimicrobial peptides and by regulating adaptive immunity this is substantiated by a meta-analysis of rcts with daily administration of vitamin d seeming to be the most efficacious plan of action 26 interestingly vitamin d administration has also shown to encourage binding of the sars-cov-2 cell entry receptor ace2 to agtr1 angiotensin ii receptor type 1 thus decreasing the total number of virus particles that could attach to ace2 and enter the cell 27 epidemiological studies have associated vitamin d deficiency to increased sensitivity to acute viral respiratory infections many recent reviews assessing various possible mechanisms recommended that vitamin d plays a significant role of the innate immune responses to viral respiratory infections including parainfluenza 1 and 2 respiratory syncytial virus rsv and influenza a and b 21 according to reports by tangpricha et al 28 it was revealed that a greater number of cases with low levels of vitamin d were present when winter season was over or about to get over moreover people who work from home or housebound and those who do night shifts at work may be more prone to vitamin d deficiency vitamin d-related deficiency disorders are majorly common among the elderly as they have limited exposure to sunlight 29 the first case of novel coronavirus was recognised in winter 2019 and the most affected were those belonging to middle-aged or old-aged population therefore one of the causes of this can be insufficient vitamin d therefore at this time it is particularly important to increase dietary sources of vitamin d table 1 as people are subjected to stay and work from home alleviating strategies additionally it was also investigated that the bovine coronavirus infection has resulted from decreased levels of vitamin d in calves 30 furthermore a trial is presently initiated wwwclinicaltrialsgov nct04334005 with the target of evaluating the potential of vitamin d as an immune-regulating agent subjects will be observed to see if there is any improvement in health status in asymptomatic or non-severe symptoms patients infected with covid-19 along with verifying if vitamin d could control patient deteriorationvitamin e comes under the category of fat-soluble vitamin vitamin e includes both tocopherols and tocotrienols vitamin e acts as an antioxidant in reducing oxidative stress by binding to free radicals 31 this antioxidant activity of vitamin e plays an important role in the human body by helping to slow down cells from any damage vitamin e is also known to employ its immune-enhancing effects by scavenging oxygen species to decrease oxidative stress and it may produce anti-inflammatory effects 32 33 vitamin e also has the potential to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas from oxidation and to modulate the production of reactive oxygen species ros and reactive nitrogen species rns in the cell membranes similarly vitamin e exists in high concentrations in immune cells which further protects these cells from any oxidative injury because of their high metabolic activity and pufa contents 34 35 it has also been known that vitamin e regulates the growth and functions of dendritic cells which are essential for interlacing innate and adaptive immune systems to manage immune response in the body 36 37 vitamin e has been displayed its positive effect in improving t cell immune synapse development and begin t cell activation signals 38 according to a study vitamin e supplementation when given to mice suffering from influenza infection it reduced lung-related pathology and death by the enhancement of t helper 1-type cytokine response which is known to induce proinflammatory responses against intracellular parasites 39 vitamin e supplementation has when given to humans restored interleukin-2 il-2 production which improves t cell proliferation and immune system overall functioning 40 increase in the myocardial injury of coxsackievirus b3 a kind of rna viruses infection had been reported in mice which are suffering from vitamin e deficiency 41 based on an experimental study it has also been reported that vitamin e deficiency leads to increased severity of any disease or virus 42 additionally decreased levels of vitamins e and d resulted in bovine coronavirus infection in calves 30 in particular ageing is related to dysregulation of the immune system making people susceptible to more oxidative stress and inflammation this further results in increased occurrences of infections in the elderly thus increasing dietary sources of vitamin e table 1 in the diet of an elderly may be advantageous for their immune function may provide resistance to infection and may decrease morbidity because of infections as the elderly population is more prone to infection it will be beneficial to investigate vitamin e for potential health benefits against covid-19 certainly a combination of vitamins e and c has been suggested as the beneficial antioxidant therapy for gastric cardia complications of the novel coronavirus 43omega-3 and omega-6 pufas play a crucial role as an arbitrator of inflammation and flexible immune responses 44 long-chain pufas principally support anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory processes and effects pufas are known as a precursor of resolvins and prostaglandins respectively 44 begin et al 45 had examined plasma lipid levels in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids and had discovered a particular and explicit absence of the long-chain pufas of omega-3 in their diet which are found in high quantity in fish oils moreover a compound named protectin d1 derived from omega-3 pufa acts as a mediator and is known to distinctively reduce the various virus replications and hence prevent the infection from spreading the mechanism by which protectin d1 works is via rna export machinery it has also been reported that various pufas have anti-hepatitis c virus properties 46 hence inculcation of omega-3 and omega-6 pufas in diet could serve as a major therapeutic tool for this novel virus covid-19 eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha possess anti-inflammatory properties resulting in the lower level of these inflammatory eicosanoids produced from arachidonic acid that inhibits nf nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells signalling leading to lesser production of inflammatory cytokines 4749 in a study animal models with lung injury showed that administration of fish oil lessens pulmonary accumulation of neutrophils with reduced lung permeability pulmonary oedema and cardiopulmonary dysfunction 50 coronavirus mainly causes respiratory damage that affects the lung extensively in this condition several inflammatory responses tumour necrosis factor- il-1 il-6 occur in the host immune system to protect from coronavirus this condition is manifested as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in the trial of patients with ards with a higher dose of epa and dha antioxidants and -linolenic acid showed satisfactory effects on respiratory damage 50 cyclooxygenase enzyme cox-12 inhibitors were used in some viral infections viz influenza a in some previous studies it had shown that sars-cov-1 can bind with cox-2 promotor with heightened expression however the role of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids in the case of covid-19 symptoms is still cloudy to draw any conclusion but selective inhibition of human microsomal prostaglandin e synthase 1 mpges-1 was believed to be a beneficial and viable therapeutic target for sars-cov-2 although it is known that omega fatty acids are a potent candidate for the therapeutic interaction with cox enzymes 51 its role in sars-cov-2 infection needs more in-depth studies to use as human trialsiron is one of the most important minerals for every age group iron deficiency is directly linked with impairment of immunity which further results in many viruses and infection 52 people suffering from iron deficiency are more prone and at risk in developing acute respiratory tract infections 53 which are a major symptom of covid-19 reduced level of iron results in thymus atrophy and affects the activity of nave t lymphocytes like zinc impaired respiratory burst natural killer cell activity or decreased t lymphocyte proliferation can be an indication towards iron deficiency according to a data t lymphocyte proliferation decreased up to 50 to 60 due to low iron level several pre-cilinical trials also suggest that various infections like plasmodia mycobacterial infections may be dependent on the iron intake of the host increased risk of malaria and infections like pneumonia has been found in tropical areas in children irrespective of any age group due to a higher level of iron injurious effects of iron intervention upon infection have several justifications that suggest that a higher level of iron can impair immune cell activity 50 it affects the inflammation and also provides the iron-requiring microorganisms a suitable environment to grow in that case co-administration of n3 fatty acids showed the lessened effect of iron iron deficiency and beyond a particular threshold level dosage both can harm the immune system thus it is much crucial to maintain an accurate iron level for better immunity therefore iron is an important nutrient in mitigating the risk factors associated with this novel coronavirus major food sources of iron are presented in table 1zinc comes under the category of trace minerals it is required in a very small quantity by the body it helps in the development and protection of immune cells zinc deficiency leads to a decrease in both active and passive immunity and increased proneness to infectious viruses and diseases 54 reports have shown that children suffering from zinc deficiency have shown reduced measles that caused morbidity and mortality when fed with zinc supplements 55 replication of various rna-induced viruses can be effectively damaged by rising the dose of intracellular zinc plus ionophores agent of zinc called pyrithione 56 additionally a collaboration of zinc with pyrithione hinders the process of sars-cov replication 56 recently many studies provided intuitive data regarding the role of zinc in antiviral immunity and infection rna viruses like coronavirus need rna polymerase to replicate according to a study zinc can inhibit rna polymerase and play a central role in host defence against coronavirus 57 there is also evidence of zinc ionophore pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate that inhibited the in vitro replication of influenza virus and it is believed that it might be a potent inhibitor of replication of sars-cov in vitro 56 zinc binding metallothionein also seemed to act as a significant antiviral agent 58 59 the lower level of zinc in the body affects the bone marrow it lessens the immune precursor cells and decreased productivity of the nave b lymphocytes leading to thymic atrophy that also affects t lymphocytes innate immunity along with phagocytosis and other immune cell activities viz il-2 and ifn- interferon production is compromised due to deficient level of zinc it also maintains the discharge of neutrophil extracellular traps to arrest invading microbes 60 based upon the experimental data it has been demonstrated that zinc supplement 30 mgday increased the proliferation of t lymphocytes in elderly care home residents in the usa 61 although the effect of supplementation for respiratory diseases is not clear yet it lowers the probability of getting respiratory infections such as common cold 62 though recommended dietary allowance rda of zinc according to the national institutes of health dietary reference intake nih dri is 811 mgday in the case of adults upper intake level threshold 40 mgday to control the proliferation of rna viruses viz coronavirus 3050 mgday might be helpful 63 therefore zinc may be an effective game changer in reducing and preventing coronavirus-related symptoms such as diarrhoea and respiratory-related disordersl-arginine when reacted with the enzyme called nitrous oxide synthase produces a compound known as nitrous oxide this compound has beneficial effects on lung physiology and cardiovascular functions 64 therefore supplementing arginine in diet could be beneficial in combating covid-19 amino acids viz arginine are the precursor of polyamines that play a significant role in the regulation of dna deoxyribonucleic acid replication and cell division for optimal antibody production its activity is believed to be reliable on the level of proteins present in the system it has been recorded that the supplementation of arginine showed a significantly increased response of t cell function as well as its number compared with control subjects 65combination of carnitine and acylcarnitine has the chief role in -oxidation this combination is also important in modulating the mechanisms of the immune system and the nervous system the biologically active form of carnitine is l-carnitine l-carnitine plays an essential role in the production of energy and fatty acid metabolism this can further improve and control the immune-modulatory functions in diabetic patients neuropathic pain and other liver and kidney-related diseases 66 67 thus carnitine could be a good option to prevent the harm caused by covid-19probiotics are world-famous in improving the gut health and thus improves digestion of nutrients in the body probiotics are microorganisms which when ingested into the host body confer a number of health benefits generally by improving and restoring the gut flora probiotics are broadly known to influence the immune system and maintain immune function balance they are known to bring about these effects by virtue of their cell structures such as dna peptidoglycan and flagellin they may act directly or indirectly by modulating the gut microbiota these probiotic microbes have the ability to inhibit pathogenic bacteria by releasing various metabolites in addition to this these organisms compete for the sites of adhesion and thus inhibits the pathogens from binding to the host epithelium 68 probiotic bacteria can also interact with the hosts gut-related immune tissues it is through these communications that probiotics affect immune function even at sites far away from the gut 69 70 a large number of experiments have analysed the effect of several probiotic microbes either single or in combination on immune response and function and inflammatory and infection conditions in humans 71 recent studies also reported that probiotic supplementation improved the vaccination responses in individuals 72 73 various systematic reviews and meta-analyses verified that probiotics improve antibody response to influenza vaccination in adult subjects 74 75 many of the studies reported that probiotics supplementation results in decreased prevalence and intensity of respiratory tract infections 7679 the gut microbiota also known as live microbes in the digestive tracts of humans appear to be protective against respiratory infections as its absence in mice leads to viral respiratory infection and impaired immune response 80 81 hence taking an appropriate dosage of probiotics during this pandemic could be helpful for combating the current situation and also for the future

a the virus genome mainly encodes four structural proteins spike s nucleocapsid n membrane m envelope e proteins s protein forms the spikes on the surface of coronaviruses and mediates adsorption and fusion of the virus and host cells n protein forms a helical capsid which locates inside the viral membrane to protect viral rna m and e proteins are important components of the viral envelope and together mediate the assembly process of the virus14 among the four structural proteins s protein is the leading mediator of virus entry and is the main factor that determines the virulence and host range of the virussars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 have strong human-to-human characteristics which is attributed to the interaction between s protein and host cell surface receptors sars-cov and sars-cov-2 use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptor15

16 whereas mers-cov uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 also known as cd26 as a receptor17 the distribution of receptors in humans and their affinity with s proteins determine the extent of tissue tropism and the intensity of transmission of coronavirus the epidemiology and biological characteristics of sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are summarized in table 1

15 16 17s protein is a large type i transmembrane glycoprotein whose trimers constitute the spike structure on the surface of the virus the s protein fig 1b can be divided into two functional subunits an n-terminal s1 domain contains signal peptide and receptor binding domain rbd and a c-terminal s2 domain contains fusion peptide and two heptapeptide repeats hr1 and hr2 to facilitate viral fusion rbd mediates the binding of virus and cell receptor which then triggers a conformational change of the s protein exposing hr1 and hr2 to form a 6-helix bundle fusion core structure further leading to membrane fusion and viral rna release18 19 20 21 furthermore s protein carries b-cell epitopes which induces the body to produce neutralizing antibody and provides immune protection22 because the s protein is involved in viral infection and is responsible for inducing host immune response and virus-neutralizing antibodies it has been considered a key target for vaccine designantigen-specific targets of s protein include full-length s protein s1 subunits rbd and s2 subunits viral vector vaccines encoding full-length s protein or s1 subunits have been demonstrated to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies in various animal models23

24 however some non-neutralizing epitopes on full-length s protein or s1 subunits may compete with neutralizing epitopes leading to several safety concerns including inflammatory and immunopathological effects such as pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration and antibody-dependent enhancement ade following subsequent viral challenge of vaccinated animals22

25

26 ade is a phenomenon in which non-neutralizing antibodies are produced following an infection or a vaccination leads to enhanced infection27 one approach to mitigate the adverse effects of ade is to narrow the immune response to target only critical or beneficial epitopes28 vaccines based on rbd elicited a robust protective immune response and neutralizing antibodies at the same time rbd does not contain non-neutralizing epitopes that may cause harmful immune responses which is a hot spot for cov vaccine development it is worth mentioning that rbd has relatively low immunogenicity and often requires repeated doses and adjuvants29 30 31 because the s2 subunit is highly conserved and not prone to mutation s2 region has become an important target for the development of protective vaccines however reports regarding the presence of neutralizing epitopes in s2 and a protective role for antibodies to s2 have been inconsistent several studies demonstrated that s2 domain could induce specific cellular immune response and a high level of total igg but little neutralizing antibodies against coronavirus infection32

33 on the contrary there are also reports that showed that s2 domain contains neutralizing epitopes and could induce neutralizing antibodies34

35n protein serves multiple functions in viral replication transcription and assembly of the viral genome complex which is more conservative than other proteins such as s and m therefore n protein has been also widely reported as a target antigen n proteins have been shown to be highly immunogenic and capable of triggering t cell responses36 remarkably many studies indicated that the serum containing anti-n protein does not contain neutralizing antibodies against coronavirus infection37

38 in addition vaccines based on n protein not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of sars-cov-challenged mice39

sars or mers inactivated by physical ultraviolet or radiation or chemical methanol -propiolactone and formalin methods has been shown to cause high levels of neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity in several animal models including mice rabbit and ferret47 48 49 however eosinophil infiltration in the lungs of animals vaccinated with inactivated sars-cov vaccine or mers-cov vaccine has raised concerns about the safety and ultimate protective efficacy of inactivated vaccine50

51 in addition a double-inactivated sars-cov doubly inactivated by formalin and uv irradiation vaccine provides poor protection against lethal disease in aged-animal models following heterologous challenge52 this result may be attributed to respiratory dendritic cells rdcs migration to draining lymph nodes dlns progressively decreases as mice age decreases in virus-specific cd8 t cell responses in lungs and more severe disease in older mice infected with sars-cov53

54 based on the above results candidate vaccines against emerging coronaviruses should emphasize the efficacy in older animal with virus infectionthe live-attenuated virus vaccine composed of recombinant sars-cov lacking the e gene rsars-cov-e produces significant neutralizing antibodies and virus-specific t cell responses55

56 more recently a live attenuated sars-cov was generated through mutation of transcription regulatory networks trns where the attenuated virus effectively limits virulence reversal and protects mice against challenge57 another study reported that rmers-cov-e a mutant of the mers-cov prepared using a new dna cloning vector system only replicates in a small number of cells but can produce enough antigen to stimulate protective immunity in the host58 although vaccine candidates based on the live-attenuated coronaviruses have the potential to induce a highly effective immune response and protection it may present biosafety problems associated with virulence recovery55nucleic acid vaccines including dna and rna vaccines are based on plasmids or messenger rna that encode vaccine antigens and they are introduced into the host to produce immunological response to protect organisms against diseases59 the efficacy of dna-based vaccines against sars-cov and mers-cov infections has been widely evaluated in a phase i clinical trial a sars dna vaccine produces cellular immune responses and neutralizing antibody in healthy adults60 additionally a dna vaccine encoding the mers-cov s protein induces strong cd8 and cd4 t cell immunity and antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice camels and nonhuman primates nhps and protects vaccinated rhesus macaques from infection by mers-cov61

62 gls-5300 a dna vaccine expressing mers-cov s-protein antigen is the first mers-cov vaccine to advance into human trials the vaccine induced durable immune responses as most participants maintained detectable s1 binding antibodies and had cellular immune responses at almost 1 year after the last vaccination63 nevertheless cov dna vaccines based on full-length s protein may cause a th2-related harmful immune response leading to liver damage in vaccinated animals one study comparing the immunogenicity of mers-cov dna vaccines expressing s or s1 in mice showed that plasmids expressing the s1 ps1 subunit triggered a balanced th1th2 response thereby avoiding the risk of immunopathological risk associated with th2 response64 moreover immunization of mice with ps1 vaccine induced significantly higher levels of ifn- compared to ps vaccine64messenger rna mrna vaccines carry transcripts encoding antigens and use the host cell translational machinery to produce the antigens which then stimulates an immune response65 because of high yields of in vitro transcription reactions mrna has the potential for rapid inexpensive and scalable manufacturing which greatly shortens the development time and can respond quickly to epidemics compared to dna vaccines mrna vaccines do not need to pass an additional membrane barrier nuclear membrane so it does not have safety concerns about integration into the host genome66 due to the above advantages mrna vaccines are becoming a powerful tool against coronavirus infectionhowever their application has been restricted by the instability and inefficient in vivo delivery of nucleic acid dna or mrna67

68 to provide protection from degradation and facilitate their entry into targeted cells efficient delivery systems for nucleic acid vaccines particularly the nanocarriers have been explored extensivelyviral vectors have a molecular mechanism that assists the target gene to enter cells and infect them which is an important vector platform for cov candidate vaccines viral vector-based vaccines encoding s protein of mers-cov and sars-cov have been widely studied to date adenovirus ad modified vaccinia ankara mva attenuated parainfluenza virus bhpiv3 and rabies virus rv have been used as vaccine vector69 70 71 72 73 a previous report has indicated sars-cov s-specific neutralizing antibodies and mucosal responses are elicited in african green monkeys immunized with bhpiv3sars-s vector vaccines protecting african green monkeys against sars-cov infection69 another study reported that a single inoculation with the rv-based vaccine expressing sars-cov s protein can induce a strong sars-cov-neutralizing antibody response70 in addition mers-cov s-specific neutralizing antibodies and antigen specific t cell response are induced in mice after immunizing them with human adenovirus or mva-based mers-cov s-expressing vaccines71

72 furthermore compared with mers-cov s-encoding ad5 vaccines mers-cov s1-encoding ad5 vaccines might induce higher levels of neutralizing antibodies73 in a recent study rad5 constructs expressing cd40-targeted s1 fusion protein rad5-s1fcd40l exhibited full protection against lethal mers-cov challenge and prevented severe perivascular hemorrhage within the lungs as compared to non cd40-targeted vaccine rad5-s174 currently mers-cov s protein expressed by chimpanzee adenovirus chadox1 or modified vaccinia ankara mva vectors are at phase i clinical trial75

76 indeed viral vectors expressing s protein can induce viral neutralizing antibodies in vivo providing an effective platform for the development of sars-cov-2 vaccine however some viral-vectors such as certain serotypes of adenoviruses may fail to induce effective immune responses owing to the high prevalence of virus-neutralizing antibodies in the human population resulting in elimination of viral vectors77 thus caution should be taken when developing cov vaccines using viral vectorsvirus-like particles vlps are multiprotein structures that mimic the organization and conformation of native viruses but devoid of infectious genetic materials vlp is a potential candidate for the development of safe and effective cov vaccines which can efficiently stimulate innate and adaptive immune response functions bacterial insect yeast and mammalian cells expression systems have been widely used in the production of vlps one study indicated a chimeric vlps that coexpression of sars-cov s protein and e m and n proteins of mouse hepatitis virus resulted in the efficient production of neutralizing antibodies thus inhibiting sars-cov replication in the lung78 the other chimeric vlps expressing sars-cov s protein and influenza m1 protein can induce neutralizing antibodies and protect mice against deadly challenges79 similar as sars-cov vlp vaccines that induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies against cov infection mers-cov vlp vaccines also elicit antigen specific cellular immune response against infections of mers-cov80 the vlp vaccine is a potential tool to provide protection against novel pandemic pathogens however vlps as a preventive vaccine still have many problems to be considered for example viral mutations might allow the virus to evade antibody-mediated neutralizationsubunit vaccines are composed of highly purified antigens which require only a part of the pathogen to generate a protective immune response subunit vaccines are characterized by high security controllable performance and easy production on a large scale thereby gradually becoming the focus of more and more researchers compared to the full-length s protein rbd contains several critical neutralizing epitopes and lacks non-neutralizing epitopes that may cause harmful pathological responses therefore rbd-based subunit vaccines not only can induce effective neutralizing antibodies but also avoid adverse immune responses from the safety and effectiveness perspectives the rbd-based cov vaccines are more attractive candidates in the development of cov vaccinessince the sars and mers outbreaks subunit vaccines based on sars-cov and mers-cov rbd have been extensively studied and tested showing sufficient effectiveness and strong protection against cov infection in various animal models81 82 83 84 85 for example rbd-fc rbd fused with human igg1 fc elicits long-term humoral immune response and produces neutralizing antibodies that protects the vaccinated mice from the sars-cov challenge without causing immunopathological damage81 also a newly designed rbd without the fc tag induces robust humoral and t cell responses particularly neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice protecting mice against sars-cov infection82 it has been demonstrated that s377-588-fc which is a fusion protein of rbd fragment s377-588 spike residues 377588 and human igg1 fc induces the higher-titer igg antibodies and neutralizing antibodies among all rbd fragments in mice83 a study has also shown that in vaccination of mers-cov rbd-fc induces humoral igg antibody response comparable to those induced by sc vaccination including neutralizing antibodies but more robust systemic cellular immune responses and higher local mucosal immune responses in mouse lungs84 in the rhesus macaque a recombinant receptor-binding domain rrbd protein vaccine can also induce sustained and robust immunological responses85 these studies suggest that rbd-based cov vaccines have potential for preventing respiratory infections caused by cov further enhancing beneficial strategies for emerging coronavirus infection however it is worth noting that highly purified proteins are generally low immunogenicity and often require the addition of vaccine adjuvantsto summarize an effective vaccine against coronavirus infection often needs to induce the body to produce strong humoral immune response and cellular immune response the current advancements and vaccine strategies in the development of in the development of sars-cov vaccines and mers-cov vaccines are listed in table 2

 apart from inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines nucleic acid- viral vector- and vlps-based vaccines particularly subunit vaccines containing the rbd of cov s protein are critically importantaluminum alum adjuvant is the longest and most frequently used adjuvant in licensed vaccines with an extensive safety record alum is a th2-type adjuvant that induces strong humoral immune response including the production of neutralizing antibodies86 therefore alum is incorporated into a range of vaccines against viral infection where neutralizing antibodies to viral antigens are required for protection including human papillomavirus rabies and hepatitis b87aluminum adjuvant has been widely used in the development of cov vaccine due to a variety of advantages noted above several studies have indicated that rbd-based subunit vaccines in the presence of alum induce powerful serum-specific and neutralizing antibodies providing a degree of protection against viral challenges85

88 it is noteworthy to mention that eliciting powerful cellular and humoral immunity is critical for a potential cov vaccine virus-specific t cells can secrete ifn- and promote virus clearance meanwhile effector t cells can further differentiate into memory t cells which is expected to respond quickly and effectively to subsequent cov infection89

90 although alum successfully induces antibody-mediated protective immunity its ability to induce cellular immune responses is limited one approach to overcome the limitations of alum is to use it in combination with other adjuvants to enhance cellular immune responsesanother approach that has an extensive history of use as cov vaccine adjuvants are emulsions freunds adjuvant is a water-in-oil emulsion divided into complete freunds adjuvant cfa and incomplete freunds adjuvant ifa as a powerful agonist for th1 cells cfa can induce th1 cytokines and enhance cellular and humoral immune responses while ifa generally induce th2 cytokines91 92 93 mice immunized with sars-cov rrbd antigen together with freunds adjuvant induce not just high titer of neutralizing antibodies but relatively high levels of ctl and th responses94 freunds adjuvant induces a more balanced th1 and th2 immune response providing more comprehensive protection against coronavirus infection freunds adjuvant is not approved for use in human vaccines due to its toxicity95 despite this montanide isa-51 also known as incomplete freunds adjuvant ifa has been approved for human use in 201296

97 similar as classic freunds water emulsion the addition of montanide isa-51 in rbd-based vaccines can produce strong antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies response against cov infection83

98the toxicity of freunds adjuvant mainly comes from the non-degradable oil in the ingredients to avoid the toxicity problem of freunds adjuvant oil-in-water emulsions prepared from biocompatible oils such as squalene eg sas and mf59 were developed99 100 101 the sigma adjuvant system sas is a stable oil-in-water emulsion containing monophosphoryl lipid a which has been used in animal experiments one study indicated that the sars-cov rrbd protein with sas protect mouse against lethal sars-cov challenge where the protection correlated well with the high titer of neutralizing antibodies102 in addition mers-cov s1 protein together with sas was identified to elicit robust serum neutralizing activity against several mers-cov strains in immunized mice103mf59 another squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion has been licensed in europe for adjuvanted influenza vaccines it is revealed that mers-cov rbd in trimeric form with mf59 elicits highly efficacious th2-based igg1 and th1-based igg2 antibody responses as well as neutralizing antibodies against pseudotyped and live mers-cov protecting 83 of hdpp4-tg mice from lethal mers-cov infection fig 4
99 100 101 similarly the activation of igg subtype antibody response and production of neutralizing antibodies following immunization with rbd-fc and mf59 resulting in the fully protection against mers-cov infection105 additionally mf59 induces stronger and broader igg subtype antibody response than several other commercial adjuvants including freunds adjuvant aluminum monophosphoryl lipid a and montanide isa5199 100 101 based on the security and effectiveness of mf59 it becomes a promising candidate adjuvant for the development of coronavirus subunit vaccinethe innate immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps mainly through pattern recognition receptors prrs as one of the best characterized prrs toll-like receptors tlrs which are widely distributed in antigen presenting cells and play an important role in triggering innate immunity and priming the adaptive immune response107 therefore several tlr agonists have been investigating as virus-specific vaccine adjuvants to induce strong and sustained immune responses108

109the toll-like receptor tlr families have been characterized as key players in rna virus detection and antiviral immunity polyinosinic acidpolycytidylic acid polyic is a synthetic double-stranded rna dsrna analogue that acts as a tlr3 receptor agonist inducing the production of type i ifn and inflammatory cytokines through a trif-dependent pathway110 previous reports have indicated mice deficient in the tlr3 signaling way are extremely susceptible to sars-cov infection showing increased lung pathology and higher viral titers111 additionally intranasal treatment with polyic induces both innate and t cell immune responses against viral infections protecting aged animals from infection by iav or sars-cov as well as providing more rapid virus clearance112 furthermore mers-cov s protein together with poly ic effectively trigger cd8 t-cells response to accelerate mers-cov clearance without immunopathological effects113 these results suggest that polyic a potent type i ifn inducer should be evaluated as a promising adjuvant in cov subunit vaccinestlr4 mainly recognizes lipopolysaccharide lps derived from the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria unlike other tlrs tlr4 agonists mediate the production of inflammatory cytokines and type i ifn via myd88 as well as trif signaling pathway114 it has been demonstrated that pretreatment with tlr4 ligands provides protective immunity against infections by sars-cov112 monophosphoryl lipid a mplaa tlr4 agonistis an attenuated version of lipopolysaccharide lps mpla has proven its safety and effectiveness in licensed vaccines including human papillomavirus and hepatitis b vaccines115

116 previous work has shown that inclusion of mpla as an adjuvant in influenza vaccine promotes mucosal and systemic th1-skewed immune responses after pulmonary vaccination117 in addition sars-cov s protein with adjuvanated tlr3 and tlr4 agonists successfully induce high expression of antigen-specific igg and neutralizing antibodies without eosinophilic infiltrations and elicit th117 cytokine responses in the lungs after the sars-cov challenge infection in the mouse model118 the above results indicated that tlr4 agonist as a powerful th1-type adjuvant can effectively improve the immunogenicity of the cov subunit vaccines and reduce the th2-related eosinophilic pathological responsetlr9 recognizes unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine cpg motifs that are commonly found in bacterial and viral dna and then mediates the antiviral response of type i ifn via the tlr9-myd88 pathway119 cpg-containing oligodeoxynucleotides cpg odn sequence 1018 as an adjuvant for immunization against hepatitis b virus hbv has been proven to significantly increase neutralizing antibody titers in clinical trials120 recently it has been approved for adults in the united states121 a novel cpg odn bw001 has been shown to effectively activate b and nk cells and stimulate the body to secrete high level of ifn-a and ifn- thereby producing strong anti-sars-cov activity122 furthermore cpg have been identified to be superior to other tlr agonists tlr3 agonists polyic tlr78 agonists r848 in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and activation of sars-cov s peptide specific cd8 t cell response123 due to the strong ability of cpg to induce cellular immunity it is often used in combination with alum to supplement the defects of alum in inducing cellular immunity for instance mice immunized with sars-cov s protein amino acids 318510 s318510 together with alum and cpg odn show higher humoral and cellular immune responses than those immunized with s318510 antigen and alum alone fig 5

124 the above findings suggest that cpg can be used as a potent adjuvant for coronavirus vaccinessting stimulator of interferon genes a central component in the innate immune response plays an important role in defense against viral and intracellular bacterial infections sting is a transmembrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum following stimulation by cytosolic cyclic dinucleotides cdns sting undergoes a conformational change resulting in a downstream signaling cascade involving the activation of nf-b signaling pathway and the production of type i interferon125

126 sting agonists are potent adjuvants capable of eliciting robust humoral and cd8 t cell immune responses in mice by simulating the early phase of viral infection without concomitant excess inflammation127 meanwhile recombinant mers-cov rbd antigens with cyclic diguanylate monophosphate cdgmp a canonical sting agonist have shown to effectively elicit neutralization antibody and antigenspecific t cell responses128

to summarize the application of vaccine adjuvant requires a thorough understanding of the effect of adjuvants on immune response and mechanisms of action the application of adjuvants in subunit vaccines are listed in table 3

128 in addition to safety considerations the design of adjuvants must also pay attention to the ability to selectively induce and regulate the types of immune responses in the body so as to effectively promote the humoral and cellular immunity to combat coronavirus infection it is also noteworthy to mention that an existing well-established adjuvant could be combined with new immunostimulants eg tlrs agonist to improve the breadth and intensity of the immune responses which has become a potential strategy for exploring efficient adjuvant systemssars-cov-2 has spread rapidly since its outbreak and has now posed a risk to countries worldwide making it urgent to develop a safe and effective vaccine against the infection this review introduces the structure and functions of coronavirus s protein and summarizes the advancements and potential strategies of sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines based on cov s protein the cov s protein-based vaccines are further classified into different types including viral vector nucleic acid dna and rna vlp and protein-based vaccines subunit vaccines have become the focus of current research due to their numerous advantages but it often requires appropriate adjuvants to enhance their immunogenicity in the usa aluminum mf59 and cpg are adjuvants included in licensed vaccines these three adjuvants have shown induction of serum neutralizing antibodies and protection against infection in mice challenged with an infectious virus which might be used for cov subunit vaccine administration85

123 however alum alone cannot induce a potent th1 response unless combined with another adjuvant such as cpg this adjuvant combination will improve the effectiveness of the cov subunit vaccines124 similarly in order to effectively activate the complex and orderly natural immune system and produce the expected acquired immune response it is sometimes necessary to use an adjuvant combination30 here we believe that adjuvant formulations that induce a balanced th1 and th2 immune response can more effectively improve the immunogenicity of the antigen73

104 becoming a new trend in the development of coronavirus adjuvants ideally an effective cov vaccine is required to induce both robust humoral and cell-mediated immunities even though many promising vaccine candidates have been reported there are still no commercial vaccines available against sars-cov and mers-cov the comprehensive lessons and experiences brought by the outbreak of sars and mers provide valuable insights and progress on how to respond to covid-19with the spread of covid-19 scientific institutions and pharmaceutical companies around the world are racing against time to develop sars-cov-2 vaccine according to who there are at least 100 research projects on sars-cov-2 vaccines in the world129 in addition to traditional inactivated virus and live-attenuated virus vaccines the developments of most sars-cov-2 vaccines are also based on some new technological routes such as mrna vaccines subunit vaccines viral vector vaccines and dna vaccines up to now eight candidate vaccines have entered clinical trials including three inactivated vaccines from wuhan institute of biological products130 beijing institute of biological products131 and sinovac132 two adenovirus vector vaccines ad5-ncov from cansino biologicals133 and cov001 from inovio134 two mrna vaccines mrna-1273 from moderna135 and bnt162 from biontech136 and one dna vaccine ino-4800 from inovio137 although some progress has been made in the development of sars-cov-2 vaccines it is important to realize that vaccine development is a rigorous scientific exploration process due to many challenges of verifying the effectiveness of vaccines it is still very likely that no sars-cov-2 vaccine will be available in the market for human in near future therefore sars-cov-2 vaccine development still requires the unremitting efforts of researchers in the worldchunting he and ming qin collected and reorganized the literature material chunting he wrote the manuscript xun sun revised the manuscript all of the authors have read and approved the final manuscriptthere are no conflicts of interest to declareviral infection of mammals results in certain typical responses by the host immune system these responses are initiated by the innate immune system which recognizes molecular patterns such as double-stranded rna that are unique to pathogens the adaptive immune system  which consists of t cells that can kill virus-infected cells and b cells that produce pathogen-specific antibodies  then proceeds to mount a response initiation of the adaptive andor innate immune response results in the production of chemokines and other cytokines that induce a pro-inflammatory response and attract cells such as neutrophils and macrophages to sites of infection these cells in turn might release cytotoxic substances such as matrix metalloproteinases although these responses are crucial to clear the infection all of these processes can cause damage to normal host tissues indeed side-effects of the immune response account for many of the signs and symptoms in human infections for example during infection with hepatitis b virus hepatitis c virus measles virus or respiratory syncytial virus123 consequently a normal immune response often results in a transient disequilibrium of tissue homeostasis and this is required for clearance of an infection but can contribute to disease in this review we consider any immune response that results in an increase in clinical disease or tissue destruction to be immunopathologicalin many cases immunopathogenesis is the outcome of immune dysregulation rather than of a normal response table 1 this could occur in one of three ways first viral infection might result in an intense inflammatory response that compromises physiological function or results in excessive destruction of host tissue in this situation viral infection might interfere with the normal feedback mechanisms that control inflammation and pro-inflammatory chemokines or other cytokines might be produced in large amounts or for an excessive period for example induction of expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 il-6 is a consequence of activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase  p38mapk by the murine coronavirus murine hepatitis virus mhv4 excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators might then result in an unchecked influx of pro-inflammatory cells to the site of infection several of these types of cell most notably neutrophils and macrophages contribute to inflammation by producing toxic agents such as reactive oxygen species that kill both infected and normal cells at sites of infection which would further exacerbate the response and result in immunopathological changes such as haemophagocytosis5 several of the released pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour-necrosis factor tnf also induce apoptosis which would result in increased tissue destruction in addition activated t cells that are not specific for the infecting virus or host antigens at the site of infection could traffic to sites of inflammation and contribute to tissue destruction presumably through the production of chemokines or other cytokines this has been shown for mhv-infected mice and is known as bystander activation table 1second direct infection of immune cells by a virus might cause increased or dysregulated production of immune mediators distinct from the aberrant production of chemokines and other cytokines previously discussed for example infection of mice with mhv strain 3 mhv-3 results in production of the procoagulant prothrombinase by macrophages leading to fulminant hepatitis and death6 discussed in detail laterthird adaptive immune responses might become directed against host epitopes and this would result in autoimmune reactions pathogen-specific antibodies or t cells might also recognize a host protein or epitope through a process known as molecular mimicry in other cases prolonged infection and the ensuing tissue destruction might result in presentation of host-protein-derived t- or b-cell epitopes that were previously cryptic through a process known as epitope spreading the response to these epitopes might prolong the inflammatory response with consequent tissue destruction even after virus has been cleared these autoimmune responses would be limited to a certain tissue or cell type by the specificity of the immune cells involved several such mechanisms of autoimmune immunopathogenesis have been described for models of both coronavirus infection and non-coronavirus infection these are described in table 1antibodies might also contribute to immunopathogenesis with regard to coronaviruses virus-specific antibody increases the uptake of several viruses by macrophages  including the feline coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv  resulting in activation of these macrophages and secretion of chemokines and other cytokinesin several animal models of coronavirus infection the immune system contributes considerably to the disease process  indeed the pathology that is seen in several models is wholly or at least partly immune mediated in this review we discuss the role of the immune system in the pathology that is seen in animals with coronavirus infections as a window onto the pathological processes that occur in humans infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov we focus on murine and feline coronavirus infections because an immunopathological role in disease has been most clearly documented in these settings
sars a severe human coronavirus infection
in the winter of 20022003 sars emerged in china and subsequently spread throughout the world in the nine months between november 2002 and july 2003 8437 cases of this new disease resulting in 813 deaths were reported to the world health organization by 29 countries the aetiological agent of this disease a coronavirus was identified by several research groups in april 2003 and the virus has been named sars-cov after the syndrome it causes78coronaviruses are the largest of all of the rna viruses and they have a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome of 3032 kilobases9 fig 1 as a family the coronaviridae have a broad host range and cause a wide variety of gastrointestinal respiratory and systemic diseases in animals including infectious bronchitis in birds a fatal disease with multi-organ involvement in felines and enteritis in pigs cows turkeys and dogs in humans coronaviruses cause respiratory disease and to a lesser extent gastroenteritis the viruses human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e have long been known to be causative agents of the common cold and the more recently identified agents hcov-hku1 and hcov-nl63 cause more severe although rarely fatal infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract101112 sars-cov which causes a much more severe respiratory disease seems to be an enzootic virus in southeast asia several species that might be infected such as masked palm civets paguma larvata are consumed as food in parts of china and the wet markets at which live animals are bought and sold are likely venues for the initial crossover event to humans8 the 20022003 outbreak of sars in humans probably resulted from an interspecific transfer of the virus by aerosols from live exotic animals that were infected with sars-cov to workers in these wet markets sera from masked palm civets raccoon dogs nyctereutes procyonoides and chinese ferret-badgers melogale moschata were shown to contain neutralizing antibodies that were specific for sars-cov and virus that was nearly identical to the strains that were isolated from infected humans was detected in masked palm civets131415 however a specific animal reservoir for the virus has yet to be definitively identifiedinfection of humans with sars-cov typically causes an influenza-like syndrome of malaise rigors fatigue and high fevers in two-thirds of infected patients the disease progresses to an atypical pneumonia with shortness of breath and poor oxygen exchange in the alveoli many of these patients also develop watery diarrhoea with active virus shedding which might increase the transmissibility of the virus respiratory insufficiency leading to respiratory failure is the most common cause of death among those infected with sars-cov8 consistent with these clinical observations the host cell-surface receptor for sars-cov angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is detected in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract1617 because it binds ace2 sars-cov might contribute to lung-tissue injury by a novel mechanism ace2 has a protective role during acute lung injury by binding ace2 sars-cov leads to the downregulation of ace2 expression and might therefore negate the protective effect of ace2 this mechanism of injury was shown in a mouse model using sars-cov spike glycoprotein through which the virus binds ace2 but it has not yet been confirmed in humans or animals that are infected with sars-cov1819 severe cases of sars are associated with lymphopaenia neutrophilia mild thrombocytopaenia and coagulation defects20 haemophagocytosis which is indicative of cytokine dysregulation is also detected in some patients with severe disease2122damage to the lungs of patients who are infected with sars-cov seems to occur directly by viral destruction of alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages as well as indirectly through production of immune mediators although the exact role of these direct and indirect mechanisms remains controversial viral load as determined from titres in nasopharyngeal aspirate diminishes 1015 days after the onset of symptoms even though clinical disease and alveolar damage worsen indicating that the host immune response is responsible for some of the pathology in sars-cov-infected patients2324 however nasopharyngeal viral titres do not necessarily reflect viral loads in the lungs and high concentrations of virus have been detected in several organs at autopsy including the lungs intestine kidneys and brain252627infection of macrophages and lymphocytes is likely to be a key component in sars-cov-induced pathogenesis sars-cov directly infects t cells contributing to lymphopaenia and to atrophy of the spleen and lymphoid tissue25 the murine coronavirus mhv-3 also infects and destroys lymphocytes thereby facilitating viral replication and persistence28 sars-cov-infected lymphocytes similar to fipv-infected macrophages in domestic cats might transport the virus to distant organs resulting in systemic infection25 macrophages both infected and uninfected are detected in large numbers in the lungs of patients who died as a result of sars222529 although infected macrophages have been found in vivo sars-cov causes an abortive infection of these cells in vitro303132 sars-cov also interferes with the initiation of the innate immune response by inhibiting the expression of type i interferons ifns by infected cells including human monocyte-derived dendritic cells dcs and macrophages ifn production requires the phosphorylation and dimerization of a constitutively expressed protein ifn-regulatory factor 3 irf3 irf3 is not activated at least in vitro after infection with sars-cov3031323334 by contrast expression of chemokines such as cxc-chemokine ligand 10 cxcl10 cc-chemokine ligand 2 ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 and ccl8 is upregulated by abortively infected dcs and macrophages and might contribute to the influx of monocytes andor macrophages that is observed in infected tissues3034 cxcl10 and ccl2 expression are also upregulated in the blood of patients with sars35 expression of cxcl8 also known as il-8 which is an attractant for neutrophils is also upregulated in the serum of patients with sars353637 consistent with a role for cxcl8 in pathogenesis severe disease is associated with an increase in the number of neutrophils in the blood2038although these studies indicate that upregulation of expression of pro-inflammatory molecules contributes to the pathogenesis of sars increased serum concentrations of two anti-inflammatory molecules  transforming growth factor- and prostaglandin e2  were detected in another study39 increased concentrations of these anti-inflammatory molecules might impair clearance of virus the mechanism by which chemokines and other cytokines are regulated in infected patients is not known but sars-cov induces the activation of p38mapk in monocytes39 the murine coronavirus mhv also induces p38mapk activation and inhibition of p38mapk activation results in decreased production of infectious mhv4 induction of p38mapk expression by mhv results in production of il-6 and phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 4e eif4e which increases cap-dependent including mhv-specific protein production by analogy it is possible that increased cytokine production by the monocytes of patients with sars might be an untoward consequence of a mechanism that is used by the virus to increase replication in some cells4together these findings are consistent with models in which the immune system contributes to the sars disease process understanding the immunopathogenesis of sars could provide new insights into effective treatments for this illness
feline coronavirus infections
macrophage infection and dysfunction feline enteric coronaviruses fecvs generally cause mild or asymptomatic infections mainly of domestic cats although cases have been reported in wild feline populations40 domestic cats often become persistently infected with fecv occasionally these animals develop the uniformly fatal disease infectious peritonitis which is caused by a macrophage-tropic variant of fecv that is known as fipv indeed virulent strains of fipv replicate more efficiently in feline peritoneal macrophages in vitro than do avirulent strains of fecv41 however most strains of fipv are antigenically identical to their avirulent fecv counterparts and the genetic changes that are responsible for the gain in virulence are not well understoodin an elegant longitudinal study de groot and colleagues42 showed that domestic cats that were experimentally infected with fipv developed a multiphasic disease initially all animals developed fever weight loss and lymphopaenia but could contain the infection total lymphocyte counts recovered with time however in most animals the infection relapsed as was shown by an increase in viral load these increased viral burdens resulted in repeated bouts of disease which again coincided with fever weight loss and lymphopaenia fipv-infected felines develop histological evidence of serositis and pyogranulomatous vasculitis in the more common wet form of fip also known as the effusive form yellow ascitic fluid gradually accumulates as the disease progresses there is also a dry form of the disease which does not involve the accumulation of ascitic fluid antigenantibody-complex formation and complement activation occur in the late stages of disease and might contribute to the production of ascitic fluid in the wet form of disease43the clinical signs and lymphocyte depletion are postulated to be a direct consequence of the infection of macrophages and dcs by fipv in support of this idea both macrophages and dcs express cd13 also known as aminopeptidase n the receptor for fipv and infection of macrophages by fipv has been shown in vitro4144 fig 2a b infected macrophages traffic throughout the body resulting in a disseminated infection in lymph nodes infection of macrophages and dcs might alter the interaction of these cells with t cells so that they dampen rather than reinforce the fipv-specific t-cell response this might occur through induction of expression of il-10 probably produced by macrophages which is present in increased amounts in infected lymph nodes45 the production of il-10 might skew the immune response away from a protective t helper 1 th1-cell response towards a non-protective th2-cell response thereby diminishing the ability of immune cells to clear the virus regarding the lymphopaenia lymphocyte apoptosis is commonly observed in infected lymphoid tissues although lymphocytes are not themselves infected by the virus424647 so lymphoid-cell depletion is probably mediated by a soluble factor in support of this idea conditioned media from peritoneal or splenic cells that were isolated from infected domestic cats and cultured in vitro induced the apoptosis of t cells46 the specific factor that is responsible for apoptosis has not yet been identified although tnf a factor that is implicated in lymphocyte apoptosis is detected at increased levels in domestic cats with fip4849 by contrast domestic cats that are exposed to fipv but do not develop disease show lymphoid hyperplasia which is consistent with the development of a protective t-cell response50antibody-dependent enhancement of fipv infection as disease progresses fipv-infected macrophages are deposited in the endothelium of small blood vessels in organs such as the liver spleen and kidneys and granulomas subsequently form at these sites granulomas consist of monocytes andor macrophages b cells and cd4 t cells with only small amounts of virus detected5152 these pyogranulomatous lesions are associated with severe damage to the endothelium and are responsible for many of the manifestations of disease such as liver and renal disease in infected domestic catsanother manifestation of fip is b-cell hyperplasia with associated hypergammaglobulinaemia although the aetiology of b-cell hyperplasia is not known it most probably results from aberrant cytokine production by infected macrophages neutralizing antibodies that are raised during fipv infection and other coronavirus infections are mainly directed against spike protein in the case of fipv however the presence of these antibodies does not provide sterilizing immunity instead these antibodies opsonize virus particles and facilitate their entry to monocytes andor macrophages through fc receptors receptors for igg40 fig 2a c furthermore antigenantibody complexes are deposited in the blood-vessel walls these complexes activate complement leading to vasculitis and oedema and might thereby contribute to the development of the wet form of fip40 antigenantibody-complex formation and its consequences occur late in the course of disease and are predictive of a poor outcome53 indeed the humoral response that develops in fecv-immune domestic cats does not protect animals against fipv infection and might contribute to a particularly fulminant disease known as early death syndrome this enhanced form of disease has not been documented for animals that are naturally infected but has been shown for domestic cats that are passively or actively immunized against fipv administration of spike-protein-specific antibodies to uninfected domestic cats or active immunization of domestic cats with recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses spike protein results in an accelerated disease course after infection with fipv5455 this syndrome does not develop in fecv-infected domestic cats possibly reflecting the ability of fipv to replicate more efficiently in macrophages this accelerated pathogenesis of fipv in immunized animals provides strong support for the idea that the immune response is an important contributing factor to disease
murine coronavirus infections
immune-mediated demyelination the result of an excessive immune response several strains of mhv cause acute and chronic neurological diseases in susceptible mice and rats the jhm and a59 strains of mhv cause demyelination this infection has been intensively studied because it is a useful model of the human disease multiple sclerosis565758 in early studies demyelination was thought to result from virus-mediated lysis of infected cells5960 however it is now clear that myelin destruction is largely immune mediated fig 3 accordingly mice that receive sub-lethal doses of irradiation or are congenitally immunodeficient such as mice with severe combined immunodeficiency scid or mice that are deficient in recombination-activating gene 1 rag1  activity do not develop demyelination after infection with mhv-jhm61626364 both rag1-- and scid mice lack t and b cells but have normal numbers of macrophages and natural killer cellsin one model of infection an attenuated variant of mhv-jhm mhv-jhm 22-v-1 with a tropism for oligodendrocytes is used to inoculate susceptible mice usually c57bl6 or balbc mice6165666768 these mice develop signs of demyelination including hind-limb paralysis and gait disturbances by 7 days after infection the virus is cleared by 1214 days after infection but the neurological deficits persist mhv-jhm infection of the central nervous system cns results in a large infiltration of b cells and cd4 and cd8 t cells mhv-jhm-specific cd8 t cells are required for initial clearance of virus which occurs through perforin- and ifn--dependent pathways whereas mhv-jhm-specific antibody is required to prevent reactivation of virus61656667 however the influx of these t cells also seems to set up a destructive cascade of cytokine production that results in demyelination these t cells are mainly directed against mhv-jhm antigens although in one report the authors identified myelin-specific cd4 t cells in the cns of the infected rat a possible example of epitope spreading69histological evidence of demyelination is present in the spinal cords of mhv-jhm-infected mice beginning at 5 days after infection with maximal myelin destruction occurring at 1421 days after infection most tissue destruction occurs when infectious virus has been completely or partially cleared7071 viral antigens are not detected in areas of demyelination whereas they are found in adjacent white matter that appears to be normal indicating that myelin destruction is a direct consequence of clearance of virus72 large influxes of activated macrophages and microglia are found in these areas of demyelination70 indicating that these cells have a crucial role in the pathological processboth cd4 and cd8 t cells can mediate disease6472 mice that have defective mhc class i or class ii expression and therefore lack cd8 or cd4 t cells respectively develop demyelination when infected with mhv-jhm or mhv-a59 refs 64 73 other studies have used adoptive transfer of mhv-jhm-specific immune cells to infected rag1--mice in the absence of transferred cells these mice do not develop demyelination after infection with mhv-jhm but transfer of splenocytes results in robust demyelination infected rag1-- mice that are reconstituted with either cd4 or cd8 t cells from a mouse that is immune to infection with mhv-jhm also develop demyelination demyelination can also be induced by cd8 t cells that do not recognize viral or cns antigens if these t cells are sufficiently activated74 a process that is known as bystander activation table 1 accordingly mhv-jhm-infected rag1 mice that expressed a single t-cell receptor specific for an epitope encoded by another virus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus developed demyelination but this only occurred when the transgenic t cells were activated by cognate antigenalthough the antiviral t-cell response is crucial for mhv-jhm- or mhv-a59-induced demyelination in normal mice mhv-jhm-specific antibodies in the absence of any transferred t cells can mediate demyelination in infected rag1 mice75 virus-specific t cells and antibodies activate macrophages andor microglia resulting in their migration into the white matter of the cns and subsequently in demyelination the activation and migration of macrophages and microglia might be the most crucial process for demyelination because virus-encoded expression of a single macrophage attractant ccl2 is sufficient to induce demyelination in mhv-jhm-infected rag1 mice in the absence of transferred t cells or antibody76soluble factors also have a key role in mhv-jhm-induced demyelination the cytokine ifn- is directly involved in clearance of virus from oligodendrocytes67 and is required for demyelination induced by cd8 t cells but not by cd4 t cells61727778 several studies have shown that certain chemokines contribute to maximal viral clearance and demyelination but none has been shown to be required for either chemokines such as ccl4 ccl5 cxcl9 and cxcl10 are crucial for lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration into the mhv-jhm-infected cns and they positively reinforce the milieu in which demyelination takes place79808182collectively these data indicate that myelin destruction is immune mediated virus-specific t cells mediate myelin destruction in immunologically intact mice but in some circumstances demyelination clearly occurs in their absence a common feature in all forms of demyelination is the activation and migration of macrophages andor microglia into the white matter and this process is sufficient in the absence of t or b cells for myelin destruction in mhv-jhm-infected mice as occurs in fipv-infected domestic cats macrophages and microglia can be infected by mhv-jhm718384 but there are no data indicating that direct infection of macrophages is a cause of the immune dysregulation that is observed in these animals instead a generalized excessive but perhaps appropriate response by both infected and uninfected macrophages seems to be crucial for demyelinationmhv-3-mediated lethal hepatitis induction of expression of a novel prothrombinase mhv-3 causes various diseases with the outcome dependent on the strain age and immune status of the mouse host85 semi-susceptible strains such as c3h mice and f1 crosses of resistant and susceptible strains become persistently infected which manifests mainly as neurological disease ependymitis encephalitis and hydrocephalus are hallmarks of this disease59 mhv-3-infected c3h mice also develop a chronic thrombotic vasculitis with viral antigen detected in endothelia the pathogenesis of this disease is not well understood but it is likely to be immune mediated mhv-3 unlike the neurotropic mhv-jhm and mhv-a59 strains infects t and b cells this infection is largely non-productive but results in lymphocyte death perhaps by apoptosis with consequent cellular and humoral immunosuppression this immunosuppression is an important contributory factor to the persistence of mhv-3 ref 28infection of susceptible strains of mice with mhv-3 results in an acute hepatitis with death occurring a few days after inoculation the receptor for mhv-3 cd66 also known as ceacam1 is expressed by macrophages86 and infection of these cells has a central role in the pathogenesis of the liver failure that is seen in these animals macrophages from susceptible mouse strains that are infected with mhv-3 upregulate the production of several pro-inflammatory molecules both in vitro and in vivo including a transmembrane procoagulant molecule fibrinogen-like protein 2 fgl2 also known as fibroleukin6878889 fig 4 expression of fgl2 results in cleavage of prothrombin to thrombin which initiates the coagulation cascade that begins with fibrin deposition this deposition of fibrin throughout the hepatic sinusoids and venous system results in inadequate perfusion or lack of perfusion to the liver and accelerates the necrosis that is caused by the direct cytotoxicity of mhv-3 to hepatocytesthis upregulation of expression of the prothrombinase fgl2 occurs only in macrophages monocytes and to a lesser extent endothelial cells in the liver of susceptible strains of mice even though mhv-3 can also replicate in the liver-resident macrophages of resistant strains of mice upregulation of fgl2 expression by macrophages and monocytes correlates with the severity of liver disease considerably better than do viral titres expression of fgl2 depends on activation of p38mapk expression of the mhv-3 nucleocapsid protein and binding of the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 hnf4 which is constitutively expressed by macrophages to the fgl2 promoter9091 how the nucleocapsid protein induces hnf4 binding to the promoter of fgl2 is unknown similarly the factors that abrogate upregulation of fgl2 expression in resistant strains of mice are also unknown

role of robust innate immune response in acute respiratory disease avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv causes marked respiratory disease especially in young chickens9293 similar to sars-cov ibv also infects organs other than the respiratory tract ibv replicates in the gastrointestinal tract but infection of the gut does not usually result in clinically evident disease ibv also infects the kidneys and some strains of virus cause severe nephritis which results in a high rate of mortality9293 at present there is no evidence that ibv infects macrophages it is clear that virus-induced cytolytic destruction accounts for many of the pathological changes that are observed in this infection however there are indications that an immunopathogenic component contributes to ibv-induced diseasemuch of the respiratory disease that is observed in young chickens with severe clinical signs is a result of mucosal thickening and excessive production of a thick mucus in the airways which asphyxiates the infected host92 although it has not been proven for ibv-infected chickens it is probable that this excessive production of mucus is mediated by several cytokines such as il-1 il-6 and cxcl8 which are secreted by infected epithelial cells in other respiratory-virus infections94 cxcl8 is an attractant for neutrophils which are one of the main cellular components of the nasal exudates that are found in infected chickens neutrophil depletion by 5-fluorouracil has been shown to reduce the thickness of the nasal exudate thereby diminishing epithelial-cell damage and cilia loss95 similarly the early stages of renal disease are characterized by a massive infiltration of neutrophils96 collectively these observations indicate that the cellular innate immune response to the virus is an important factor in the development of severe diseasechronic lymphocytic nephritis under certain conditions depending on age at time of inoculation and strain of ibv and of chicken ibv causes a persistent infection with an interstitial lymphocytic nephritis in the kidneys929397 similar to the mhv-infected cns lymphocytic infiltration and ongoing renal damage have been shown when viral loads are low or undetectable97 the precise roles of persistent virus and the host immune response in ibv-induced renal disease are not known but by analogy with other coronavirus infections it is probable that the chronic nephritis that is observed in these animals is partially immune mediated
an immunopathogenic component in sars
several features of sars indicate but do not prove that the host immune response contributes to disease these have been described in detail in previous sections and are summarized in table 2 however as also outlined in this review the pathogenesis of several animal coronaviruses includes an immune-mediated component it is therefore reasonable to suggest that similar mechanisms occur in sars clearly it is crucial to determine the extent to which the pathological changes that are observed in sars result from direct destruction by virus compared with immune-mediated elimination of infected cells in fipv-infected domestic cats increased viral replication initiates a cascade of events that leads to injury to the immune system as well as to several organs4243 whereas in mice with mhv-mediated demyelination clinical disease and myelin destruction increase as virus is cleared707176 in patients with sars virus is detected in the lungs and in immune cells at the time of death indicating that virus directly causes pulmonary and immune-system injury252627 however the kinetics of viral clearance from sites of infection in individual patients need to be established before the role of the host immune response in the disease process can be fully evaluatedseveral features that are common to animals infected with fipv or mhv and to patients infected with sars-cov are consistent with immunopathological disease these include the propensity of virus to infect macrophages and dcs and the presence of increased and perhaps pathological systemic concentrations of chemokines and other cytokines in animals infected with mhv or fipv activated macrophages are present at sites of inflammation and participate in tissue destruction406270 activated macrophages are also present in the lungs of sars-cov-infected individuals sars-cov-infected macrophages and dcs express increased amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines303234 consistent with this increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory chemokines and other cytokines are present in most infected patients35363739 and by analogy with other coronavirus infections as well with ards adult respiratory distress syndrome98 expression of these pro-inflammatory mediators might contribute to diseaseanother immunopathological mechanism antibody-dependent enhancement of disease is observed in immunized domestic cats after challenge with fipv55 and it occurs when tissue-culture cells are exposed to recombinant viral vectors that are coated with the sars-cov spike protein99 however this phenomenon has not been shown in most immunization studies7 and it needs to be confirmed using infectious sars-cov
future directions
fortunately the world has not witnessed a re-emergence of sars since 2003 to be prepared for any outbreak that might occur in the future it is crucial to understand the pathogenesis of this disease in vitro studies will be useful for investigating how sars-cov modifies gene expression in primary target cells such as macrophages dcs lymphocytes and pulmonary epithelial cells however many of the outstanding issues that have been discussed in this review will be answered only in the context of sars-cov-infected animals or humans particularly in the absence of any resurgence of disease in humans it will be most important to develop an animal model that accurately reproduces the human infectioncurrent animal models of coronavirus infection are useful for testing vaccines and antiviral drugs but they do not reproduce the pulmonary or immune-system disease that is observed in individuals with sars7 although sars-cov replicates in the lungs of mice hamsters and domestic cats these animals remain asymptomatic100101102103 initial reports indicated that cynomolgus macaques macaca fascicularis and ferrets develop clinically evident respiratory disease and would therefore be useful animal models for studying sars however these results have not been reproducible101104105106107108 only an animal model will allow investigators to determine the relationship of viral load to disease outcome as well as to evaluate fully the role of infection and dysfunction of macrophages and lymphocytes in the disease process in the case of another human coronavirus hcov-229e development of a mouse model of infection required transgenic expression of the human host-cell receptor cd13 disruption of the innate immune response of the mouse and adaptation of the virus to growth in cd13-expressing mouse cells109 mouse and rat ace2 molecules are less-efficient receptors for sars-cov than is human ace2 ref 110 and the development of a useful murine model of sars will probably require transgenic expression of human ace2 however by analogy with the mouse model of hcov-229e infection the development of a transgenic mouse might be only the first step towards developing a useful murine model the knowledge gained from the study of an animal model will facilitate the development of specific therapies that are designed to minimize pulmonary disease and optimize the anti-sars-cov immune response whether it be excessive but not necessarily dysregulated suppressed or boththe severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus is a positive-stranded rna virus 297 kb in length with approximately 14 open reading frames1 it was identified as a human pathogen for the first time in 2003 as part of an intensive investigation into the cause of a series of fatal pneumonia cases that started in hong kong but then rapidly spread to over 30 different countries2 3 the outbreak was eventually brought under control by quarantine measures but not before more than 8000 people worldwide were infected and there were over 800 confirmed deaths this translated into an overall case fatality rate of 10 but with mortality rates approaching 50 in the elderly4 those most likely to get serious complications or die from sars virus infection were individuals over 65 years of age or who had a chronic illness such as diabetes or hepatitissars virus is spread by aerosol in the form of respiratory droplets or through close personal contact being absorbed through mucous membranes it has a typical incubation period between initial infection and development of symptoms of 37 days symptoms include a high fever dry cough shortness of breath headache muscle aches sore throat fatigue and diarrhea lung histology in fatal cases revealed a marked diffuse alveolar damage inflammatory cell infiltrate bronchial epithelial denudation loss of cilia and squamous metaplasia5 deaths resulted from respiratory heart andor liver failure infected individuals recovering from coronavirus infections may become susceptible to reinfection due to rapidly waning immunity6 7 in fact those with waning immunity may be at risk of even more severe disease upon coronavirus reinfection8 sars homologous reinfection studies showed that although immune animals cleared lung virus much faster than naive animals the incidence and severity of lung inflammation was not reduced9 this suggests that illness severity is not just dictated by sars viral load but is also influenced by host factors given the possibility of future human outbreaks development of a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine platform would be beneficial in particular lessons learned from development of sars vaccines may also be applicable to other coronavirus infections such as the recently emerged middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus10
initial attempts to produce sars vaccine candidates were based on traditional methods where sars virus was grown in cell culture under biosafety level bsl-3 conditions and then inactivated with formaldehyde beta-propriolactone ultraviolet irradiation or a combination of these these initial inactivated whole virus vaccines provided modest protection in animal models inducing low titers of neutralizing antibody and earlier lung virus clearance but did not completely prevent infection11 one such inactivated vaccine was administered to a small number of human subjects in a phase 1 clinical trial and was shown to be able to induce neutralizing antibodies12 although no immediate safety issues were identified the subjects were not exposed to sars virus and hence any risk of vaccine exacerbation of lung immune-pathology by this vaccine remains unknownof note animals immunized with similar inactivated vaccines developed a severe lung eosinophilic immunopathology when challenged with sars virus13 14 15 16 this lung pathology was exacerbated further when sars vaccines were formulated with alum adjuvant in an attempt to increase their immunogenicity9 despite inactivated vaccines combined with alum adjuvant being able to reduce virus replication in young animals they failed to reduce virus replication in older animals in which their use was associated with severe lung eosinophilic pathology postchallenge13 this finding is particularly concerning as the elderly are a major target population for sars vaccines being most at risk of complications and mortality if the animal data translates to humans this suggests that inactivated vaccines might not only fail to protect the elderly but may even increase their risk of serious illness if exposed to sars virusthe problem of lung eosinophilic pathology was also seen in mice immunized with venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles expressing the sars nucleocapsid protein17 similarly mice immunized with vaccinia virus encoding the sars nucleocapsid protein developed a severe pneumonia characterized by increased th2 and th1 cytokines reduced il-10 and tgf-beta thickening of the alveolar epithelium and lung infiltration by eosinophils lymphocytes and neutrophils15 hence given these problems of poor immunogenicity difficulty of bsl-3 manufacture poor efficacy in the elderly and risk of exacerbated disease due to eosinophilic lung immunopathology inactivated whole virus formulations are poor candidates for safe and effective sars vaccinesa major advance in vaccine development was the identification that the sars virus spike s protein mediates cell entry via its ability to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and cd209l thereby triggering virus endocytosis into target cells18 19 a human monoclonal antibody binding the s protein n-terminal domain was shown to be able to block infection thereby identifying s protein as a major target of sars virus neutralizing antibodies20 consistent with this monkeys could be protected against sars infection by intranasal immunization with a s protein-encoding live parainfluenza vector21 s protein was also shown to be the target of cd4 and cd8 t cell responses suggesting these may also be important to sars protection22 a recombinant s protein vaccine was manufactured using an insect cell expression system but was found to be considerably less immunogenic that inactivated whole virus vaccine requiring 100 times more antigen to achieve the same level of immunogenicity23 attempts to improve the immunogenicity of s protein vaccine by formulation with alum adjuvant again resulted in severe lung eosinophilic immunopathology in response to sars virus infection marking this as another potentially unsafe approach13 16 this confirmed that the problem of lung eosinophilic immunopathology was not just confined to inactivated or nucleocapsid protein vaccines but was a more general problem of vaccines made from any sars virus antigenwhat is the mechanistic basis of lung eosinophilic immunopathology this question is not just of academic interest as sars-associated lung immunopathology bears a striking resemblance to the lung eosinophilic pathology previously seen with an alum-adjuvanted formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus rsv vaccine in clinical trials this vaccine caused increased mortality when immunized children became infected with rsv24 hence any sars vaccine that induces lung eosinophilic immunopathology could be equally unsafe in human subjectslung eosinophilic immunopathology did not arise in naive mice pretreated with anti-s protein antibody before challenge suggesting it is not due to an antibody-dependent enhancement mechanism17 lung immunopathology might instead be due to an aberrant host immune response to sars virus exacerbated by vaccine priming as the ability of inactivated or recombinant vaccines to induce eosinophilic immunopathology is dramatically exacerbated by formulation with alum adjuvant a known th2-polarising adjuvant this implies that the problem might be vaccines that prime an excessive th-2-response andor that fail to prime for a sufficient th1 response sars virus itself mediates broad ranging immune modulatory effects that might be expected to lead to strong th2 immune bias s protein binds lung surfactant protein d a collectin found in the lung that activates macrophages but not dendritic cells dc25 autopsy lung samples of patients dying after sars infection revealed down regulation of type 1 interferon and cxcl10 a chemokine involved in t cell recruitment and inhibition of the stat1 pathway26 conversely sars virus enhances production of interleukin-6 il-6 and il-8 inflammatory cytokines that inhibit the ability of dc to prime t cells27 gu-rich ssrnas from sars virus activate tlr7 and tlr8 in mice and thereby induce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tnf- il-6 and il-12 leading to lethal acute lung injury28 thus sars virus has the capacity to exacerbate lung inflammation while at the same time inhibiting antiviral interferon responsessars virus uses multiple mechanisms to inhibit the host type 1 interferon response with open reading frame orf 3b orf 6 and nucleocapsid proteins all playing a major role nucleocapsid protein inhibits the synthesis of interferon while orf 3b and orf 6 proteins inhibit both interferon synthesis and signaling29 in addition orf 6 protein inhibits nuclear translocation of stat1 the importance of stat1 to protection is demonstrated by stat1 knockout stat1 mice being unable to clear sars virus infection resulting in increased virus lethality30 furthermore stat1 mice infected with sars virus had evidence of t cell and macrophage dysregulation with increased alternatively activated macrophages and a th2-biased immune response as stat6 is essential for development of alternatively activated macrophage the importance of alternatively activated macrophages to sars pathology was able to be demonstrated using stat1stat6 double-knockout mice which exhibited reduced lung disease in response to sars virus challenge31 on the host side cd8 t cells are responsible for virus clearance and adoptive transfer of immune splenocytes or sars-specific t cells reduced lung virus titers and enhanced survival32 the importance of th1-cellular immunity to viral control may help explain the many mechanisms that sars virus has developed to subvert th1-cellular responses by suppressing th1 responses the sars virus may thereby impart an unbalanced th2 bias to the antiviral lung immune response which could amplify and exaggerate any preexisting th2 bias already imparted by immunization with a th-2 biased sars vaccine this thereby provides a plausible explanation for the vaccine-exacerbated lung eosinophilic pathology observed in recipients of alum-adjuvanted or unadjuvanted inactivated whole virus and recombinant s protein vaccines this is supported by data from a ferret sars virus reinfection model where reinfected animals or ferrets previously immunized with an alum-adjuvanted inactivated vaccine candidate failed to mount an effective type 1 interferon response33 in mice sars-associated lung pathology was shown to be prevented by pretreatment of alveolar macrophages with polyic a tlr3 agonist which may reflect its ability to prime for a strong type 1 interferon response34 hence the aberrant host immune response causing sars-associated lung immunopathology is complex with roles played by alternatively activated macrophages neutrophils nfkb activation lack of a type 1 interferon response and excess il-i il-6 and tnf production due to inflammasome activation by the sars envelope protein-encoded ion channel31 35 36 37 38 39
elderly human subjects infected with sars virus experienced an extremely high mortality rate approaching 504 sars-infected aged macaques similarly developed more severe pathology than young adult animals even though viral replication levels were similar this suggests that increased sars mortality in the elderly may reflect as much an aberrant host response as toxic effects of the virus in keeping with this aged macaques showed greater nfkb activation in response to sars infection and this was associated with increased inflammatory gene expression but lower expression of type i interferon40 treatment of aged animals with type 1 interferon reduced expression of inflammatory genes such as il-8 and reduced lung pathology despite not changing lung virus levels40 it has been shown that aged mice exhibit increased lung prostaglandin d2 in response to lung infection that correlates with impairment of dc migration and lower t cell responses41 more severe clinical disease in aged animals could be attenuated by blocking prostaglandin d2 with small-molecule antagonists41 thus multiple factors likely contribute to the increased mortality in elderly subjects suffering from sars infection including intrinsic dc defects increased production of dc-inhibitory factors such as prostaglandin d2 predisposition to an increased inflammatory response and reduced th1 immune responses an ongoing challenge is to develop a sars virus vaccine strategy that is able to overcome all of these obstacles and is thereby safe and effective in the elderlythere is a critical need to identify suitable sars vaccines that do not run the risk of exacerbating coronavirus-associated lung immunopathology advax is a polysaccharide adjuvant based on microcrystalline particles of -d-2-1polyfructo-furanosyl-d-glucose delta inulin42 43 44 it has been shown to enhance vaccine immunity against a wide variety of pathogens including influenza45 46 japanese encephalitis47 west nile virus48 and hepatitis b49 enhancing both humoral and cellular immunity and inducing a balanced th1-th2 response46 49 it has also been shown to be safe and nonreactogenic in human vaccine trials50 51 when combined with either recombinant s protein or inactivated sars advax adjuvant alone or combined with a tlr9 agonist enhanced neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses reduced lung viral load and completely protected against sars lethality52 notably animals immunized with advax adjuvant formulations had minimal or no lung eosinophilic pathology postchallenge in stark contrast to the severe immunopathology observed in animals immunized with antigen alone or combined with alum adjuvant fig 31
 thereby highlighting the critical importance of adjuvant selection for sars vaccine development protection against lung immunopathology correlated with a strong memory th1 response in the advax-immunized animals52
tlr agonists including lipopolysaccharide polyu or polyic when formulated with inactivated sars virus have similarly been shown to help prevent lung immunopathology53 what all of these successful strategies have in common is that they prime for a th1-immune response suggesting that this is the key to avoiding lung eosinophilic immunopathologyprotection against sars virus involves coordinated action of memory cd4 and cd8 t cells and neutralizing antibody vaccines that fail to induce th1 immunity against the sars virus run the risk of exacerbating lung disease54 hence the key to any successful sars vaccine will be the inclusion of an adjuvant able to induce robust cellular immunity together with long-lived neutralizing antibodies important questions remain on how best to protect elderly subjects the most vulnerable population for lethal human coronaviruses another important issue is how best to provide protection against heterologous sars virus strains unfortunately with the passage of time since the sars epidemic funding for sars research has dried up and some of these questions may never be answered while the sars epidemic was halted by quarantine measures there is an ongoing need for a safe and effective vaccine platform that could be used in the event of future human coronavirus threats notably the mers coronavirus has emerged to become a major human threat unlike sars mers has not been halted by quarantine procedures creating an urgent need for a safe and effective mers vaccine55 it is not yet known whether mers vaccines will suffer from the same problems as sars vaccines such as low immunogenicity and lung eosinophilic immunopathology but this seems likely hence similar strategies as described above will be required to make mers vaccines safe and effective mers will almost certainly not be the last new coronavirus to cause human disease identifying the need for ongoing research into the unique host-pathogen interactions contributing to coronavirus pathology and infection outcomes and to develop an effective coronavirus vaccine platformnp is supported by federal funds from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases

role in the writing of this manuscriptimmunotherapy of cancer has moved from preclinical development into clinical practice 12 for example prophylactic vaccination using non-self antigens such as virus-derived proteins from human papilloma viruses reduce the incidence of virus-induced tumors 34 moreover the description of tumor-associated self antigens 56 has opened new avenues for vaccination approaches that target eradication of established tumors cells indeed recent phase iii trials have shown that patient-specific cellular vaccines containing tumor antigens can improve survival of patients even with advanced disease 78 however since the production of tailored vaccines for individual patients requires laborious and expensive routines generation of simple and efficient off-the-shelf reagents should be fosteredbiological factors that make the development of therapeutic antitumor vaccines cumbersome include the immunosuppressive microenvironment within the tumor tissue itself 910 and remote inhibitory effects such as the preferential differentiation of t regulatory treg cells 1112 it has been proposed that a combination of tumor antigens with immune-modulatory cytokines can overcome tumor-induced immunosuppression andor deviation 13 cytokines that foster activation of lymphocytes such as il-2 or il-15 have been evaluated in preclinical models and are currently tested in clinical studies 1416 to augment tumor-specific immunity likewise cytokines that act mainly on myeloid cells such as granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf or fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand flt3l have been shown to improve the efficacy of cancer vaccines 1718 however cytokines generally exhibit a wide range of functions for example il-2 is a potent stimulus for the activation of nave t cells but fosters at the same time activation-induced cell death of cd8 effector t cells 19 and induces treg cells in tumor patients 20 likewise gm-csf can foster generation and survival of myeloid suppressor cells 2122 hence it is important that cancer vaccines deliver such pleiotropic cytokines to those cells that optimally induce and maintain anticancer immune responsesdendritic cells dcs sample antigen in peripheral organs and transport the immunogenic material to secondary lymphoid organs to initiate and maintain t and b cell responses 23 dcs have to be appropriately stimulated to achieve full differentiation of t cells 24 and to overcome potential tolerizing stimuli within the microenvironment of secondary lymphoid organs 25 notably it is important the dcs are directly activated through pattern-recognition receptors to achieve full maturation 26 and to successfully induce rejection of tumors 27 attenuated viral vectors exhibit several important advantages that make them attractive vaccine vehicles for antitumor vaccination first viral vaccines can be produced in large quantities and stored as off-the-shelf reagents second viruses generally infect professional antigen presenting cells such as dcs and third viral infection triggers dc maturation 28 we have recently suggested to utilize attenuated coronaviruses as vaccine vectors because i these positive-stranded rna viruses replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm without a dna intermediary ii recent technological advances permit heavy attenuation without loss of immunogenicity iii their large rna genome offer a large cloning capacity and iv both human and murine coronaviruses efficiently target dcs 29 in a previous study we found that murine coronavirus-based vectors can deliver multiple antigens and cytokines almost exclusively to cd11c dcs within secondary lymphoid organs 18 moreover induction of cd8 t cells directed against human tumor antigens and efficient transduction of human dcs with tumor antigen-recombinant human coronavirus 229e 18 indicate that coronavirus-mediated gene transfer to dcs should be considered as a versatile approach for antitumor vaccination in the present study we evaluated the impact of flt3l or lymphoid cytokines co-expressed with a gfp-tagged model antigen in murine coronavirus vectors on antitumor immunity we found that dcs transduced in vivo with vectors encoding for flt3l efficiently activated tumor-specific cd8 t cells broadened the epitope repertoire and secured therapeutic tumor immunity interestingly il-2 and il-15 showed a significantly lower adjuvant effect on cd8 t cell priming and failed to protect against established tumors indicating that coronavirus-mediated in vivo targeting of dcs in conjunction with the myeloid cell-stimulating cytokine flt3l is well-suited to generate therapeutic antitumor immunitycoronavirus-based multigene vaccine vectors were designed on the basis of the mouse hepatitis virus mhv genome figure 1a to achieve propagation deficiency and to maintain at the same time replication competence mhv-encoded accessory genes ns2 he gene4 gene5a were deleted and the non-structural protein 1 nsp1 was truncated by introducing a mutation that reduces mhv pathogenicity but retains immunogenicity 30 moreover the structural gene e was deleted to further hinder virion formation 31 as surrogate tumor antigen we used a fusion protein of the enhanced green fluorescent protein egfp and the gp33 cd8 t cell epitope derived from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv glycoprotein to compare the adjuvant effects of cytokines acting mainly on myeloid cells versus lymphocytes the genes encoding for murine flt3l il-2 or il-15 were inserted between the replicase and spike genes figure 1a propagation of mhv-based vectors was achieved in 17cl1 packaging cells that provide the e protein in trans figure 1b importantly the vectors failed to propagate in primary macrophages figure 1c and dcs not shown in vitro but efficiently delivered their antigen to dcs resulting in transduction rates of 20 - 40 figure 1d in vitro transduced peritoneal macrophages and dcs rapidly produced flt3l or il-2 following transduction with the respective vector figure 1e whereas il-15 could not be detected following transduction with mhv-il15gp not shown notably il-15 is known as a cytokine that is trans-presented by il-15r 32 and hence can usually not be measured using conventional detection systems furthermore we found that neither transduction with mhv-gp vector induced any of the three cytokines nor did the cytokine-expressing vectors elicit non-specific cytokine production not shown thus coronavirus vectors can specifically deliver antigen and different immune-modulatory cytokines to their major target cellswe have shown previously that the murine coronavirus preferentially infects macrophages and dcs in vivo 33 moreover severe attenuation of mhv further focusses its target cell range to cd11c dcs 18 this pronounced dc-specificity was not altered by insertion of flt3l or lymphoid cytokines following iv application of 106 vector particles into c57bl6 b6 mice egfp expression was detectable mainly in mhcii iabhighcd11c dcs figure 2a whereby the cytokines roughly doubled in vivo transduction efficacy figure 2b in vivo delivery of il-2 figure 2c and flt3l figure 2d resulted in high cytokine production after 48 h whereas il-15 could neither be detected in serum nor in spleen not shown importantly comparable to the transient elevation of gm-csf levels following coronavirus-mediated delivery 18 both il-2 and flt3l levels had normalized at day 4 post application not shown since maturation of dcs is critical for induction of protective immunity 23 we determined expression of the maturation markers cd40 and cd86 on in vivo transduced egfp dcs as shown in figure 2e only the flt3l-encoding vectors led to upregulation of both maturation markers interestingly enhanced expression of cd40 and cd86 was restricted to those dcs that expressed egfp figure 2f indicating that the presence of the viral vector within dcs and direct production of the myeloid cell-stimulating cytokine flt3l led to optimal dc maturation to compare the adjuvant effects of the different cytokines encoded by the coronavirus vectors we first assessed magnitude and duration of transgene-specific cd8 t cell activation in addition to determine cytokine-mediated changes in epitope usage we monitored cd8 t cell responses against the h2-db-binding gp33-41 34 and the h2-kb-binding gp34-41 35 epitopes which are both present in the gp33-egfp transgene using iv application of 105 pfu of each vector we found that induction of gp34-specific cd8 t cells responses was best supported by flt3l leading to superior expansion of tetramer-binding cd8 t cells and differentiation towards ifn--producing effector t cells figure 3a importantly initial expansion of gp34-specific cd8 t cells following vaccination with mhv-gpflt3 was comparable to the responses induced by the fully replication-competent lcmv figure 3b and 3c surprisingly although il-2 and il-15 have been described as cytokines that support generation of memory t cells 36 the flt3l-encoding vector better supported the persistence of transgene-specific cd8 t cells figure 3b and 3c as shown previously 18 mhv-gp vectors failed to raise a substantial response against the h2-db-binding gp33 epitope figure 3d likewise the vectors encoding for il-2 or il-15 did not elicit a pronounced cd8 t cell response against the gp33 epitope whereas vector-encoded flt3l promoted a broadening of the antigen reactivity towards gp33 figure 3d this finding was corroborated using adoptive transfer of gp33-specific p14 tcr transgenic t cells one day before application of the vectors again flt3l very efficiently supported the expansion of gp33-specific cd8 t cells figure 3e indicating that this cytokine functions as an optimal adjuvant for dc-specific targeting approachesinduction of potent cd8 t cell responses against tumor antigens is critical to establish and maintain tumor immunity 37 to assess the impact of lymphoid versus flt3l-mediated adjuvant effects on protective tumor immunity we utilized two different tumor models which provide compatibility with the lcmv-gp system due to the expression of a gp33 minigene 3839 in the first model we assessed metastatic growth of murine b16f10 melanoma cells to this end 5105 b16f10-gp or parental b16f10 cells were applied to b6 mice which resulted in metastatic growth of tumor cells in lungs figure 4a vaccination of recipient mice on day 7 before tumor challenge with 105 pfu of the different coronavirus vectors had completely blocked growth of b16f10-gp tumor cells whereas formation of metastatic foci in lungs by parental b16f10 cells was not affected figure 4a moreover prophylactic vaccination with 102 pfu of il-2 or il-15 encoding vectors reduced the tumor burden whereas the same dose of flt3l vector completely prevented tumor growth figure 4a careful titration of the cytokine-encoding vector doses and compilation of several series of experiments in the prophylactic vaccination setting revealed that indeed only 102 viral particles of mhv-gpflt3l were sufficient to completely protect the mice from tumor challenge figure 4b to assess whether cytokine-encoding vectors can elicit therapeutic tumor immunity mice were first inoculated with b16f10-gp tumors and vaccinated 10 days later with 105 pfu of the different coronavirus vectors again ten days later ie at day 20 post tumor inoculation melanoma cells had almost completely covered the whole lung surface in control and mhv-gp vaccinated mice whereas therapeutic vaccination with cytokine-encoding vectors had reduced the tumor load figure 4c importantly determination of affected lung surface revealed that only vaccination with the flt3l-encoding vector was able to significantly reduce the tumor load figure 4dclearance of rapidly growing metastatic tumors is certainly a challenge for the immune system however metastatic tumors such as the b16 melanoma cells can reach secondary lymphoid organs and thereby contribute  most likely due to their mhc class i expression  to the amplification of antitumor cd8 t cells 40 in contrast tumors which arise in peripheral tissues can escape immune surveillance in the absence of appropriately activated t cells 41 to assess whether coronavirus vector-based vaccination can prevent growth of such peripherally growing tumors we applied 5105 lcmv-gp recombinant lewis lung carcinoma llc cells sc into prophylactically vaccinated b6 mice as shown in figure 5a all coronavirus-based vectors were able to protect the animals under these conditions however when we assessed the efficacy of the vaccines in a therapeutic approach ie applying the vaccines on day 4 post tumor inoculation only flt3l-encoding vectors achieved an almost complete block of tumor growth figure 5b taken together these results indicate that different cytokines can improve immunogenicity of coronavirus vectors however maturation of dcs through vector-encoded cytokines that preferentially activate myeloid cells is essential for the generation of therapeutic tumor immunityrecent clinical trials have shown that viral vector-based vaccination against cancer is feasible safe and suitable to achieve protective tumor immunity 42 for example a randomized placebo-controlled study in patients suffering from castration-resistant prostate carcinoma n125 showed that a heterologous prime-boost regimen with different poxvirus vectors delivering prostate-specific antigen increased the median survival by 85 months 43 notably this approach using an off-the-shelf vaccine yielded an efficacy comparable to the personalized cellular vaccine sipuleucel which increases survival of patients suffering from incurable prostate cancer by 41 months 7 nonetheless the high immunogenicity of viral vectors results in the induction of antiviral immunity which makes heterologous prime-boost schemes necessary to guarantee repeated exposure to the target antigen 44 hence coronavirus vectors based on human dc-targeting common cold viruses 18 represent a potential asset for future clinical trials that utilize heterologous prime-boost approaches importantly vaccination with attenuated murine coronavirus vectors permits usage of the vectors even in homologous prime-boost schemes hence leading to the maintenance of effector t cells at high frequencies 18 since human coronaviruses causing common cold frequently re-infect their hosts 45 it is possible that this human viral vector family may be utilized as well in homologous prime-boost approachesthe ability of dcs to induce antigen-specific tumor immunity can be enhanced by immunological adjuvants such as toll-like receptor tlr ligands which lead to optimal immune activation only when dcs are stimulated directly through their tlrs 2627 likewise cytokines that stimulate the myeloid compartment such as the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf facilitate dc maturation and foster their survival 46 our previous study revealed the importance of dc-specific gm-csf delivery for both dc maturation and prolongation of antigen presentation through improved dc survival leading to sustained cd8 t cells immunity against viral infection and tumors 18 here we found that a second myeloid cell-stimulating cytokine very efficiently enhanced the immunogenicity of coronavirus vectors notably the flt3l vectors were even more effective than the gm-csf vectors in preventing metastatic growth of melanoma cells 18 moreover mhv-flt3lgp vectors but not gm-csf-encoding vectors 18 elicited a broadening of the epitope repertoire with presentation of two epitopes from the gp33 minigene thus the iterative approach of coronavirus vector optimization using a single model antigen and standardized read-out methods facilitates the definition of cytokines that display optimal adjuvant effects for this vaccinein this study we also evaluated the adjuvant effect of cytokines that act more downstream in the immune activation cascade the lymphocyte-stimulating cytokines il-2 and il-15 are known to enhance proliferation of t cells to foster differentiation of cd8 t cells and to control formation of t cell memory 36 however despite sharing two out of three of their receptor units common gamma chain and il-2il-15-r these cytokines impact differently on t cell differentiation il-2 is most important for the early expansion of t cells and via activation-induced cell death the limitation of the t cell overshoot 47 il-15 on the other hand is essential for survival of high-affinity t cells during the memory phase 48 and ensures thereby the maintenance of protective t cell memory responses it is important to note that both il-2 and il-15 are highly efficient adjuvants that have been shown to enhance tumor-specific t cell responses 36 our data confirm that il-2 and il-15 improve cd8 t cell activation and induction of prophylactic tumor immunity also when incorporated in a coronavirus-based vaccine that delivers the cytokines directly to dcs in vivo it is interesting to note that neither the secreted and systemically acting il-2 nor the more locally acting trans-presented il-15 reached the efficacy of the dc-stimulating flt3l flt3l is a highly immunostimulatory cytokine that supports for example control of parasitic infections both in mice and humans 49 moreover flt3l efficiently mobilizes dc precursors for example in humans with metastatic colon cancer 50 the results of the present study suggest that high vaccine immunogenicity can be achieved through direct transduction of dcs via a coronavirus vector with concomitant delivery of a potent dc maturation factor such as flt3l clearly further analyses are warranted to reveal the molecular events involved in flt3l-mediated adjuvant effects in this system in addition it is possible that a combination of different cytokines delivered by coronavirus vectors in homologous prime-boost regimen eg flt3l followed by il-15 vectors or vice versa will result in a further improvement of coronavirus vector-induced antitumor immunityin conclusion incorporation of cytokines into coronavirus vectors substantially improves their performance since these vectors almost exclusively target dcs expression of cytokines that facilitate dc maturation and foster their survival such as gm-csf or flt3l is highly efficient and facilitates generation and maintenance of antitumor cd8 t cells therefore coronavirus-based

sars-cov-2 is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense rna virus generally coronavirus falls into four genera--    on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures  and  coronaviruses infect only mammals while the  and  coronaviruses mainly infect birds
22 23 24 25
 among them there are 7 species that can infect human beings that is common coronavirus including hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 that belong to  coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and cov-hku1 that belong to  coronaviruses and three highly pathogenic viruses sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov-2 that all belong to  coronaviruses17

26

27 the novel coronavirus was initially isolated from three patients and the complete genome sequences were obtained the three sars-cov-2 genomes clustered together within the sarbecovirus subgenus which shows the typical -coronavirus organization a 5 untranslated region utr replicase complex orf1ab s gene e gene m gene n gene 3 utr and several unidentified nonstructural open reading frames
1
 chinese researchers have found that a gene sequence of coronavirus carried by chinese rhinolophine is 96 identical with that of sars-cov-2 thus rhinolophine is considered as the natural host of sars-cov-227

28 unfortunately the intermediate host has not been determined yet although it is speculated that pangolin may be the intermediate host based on the results of gene comparison it was showed that sars-cov-2 was closely related with 88 identity to two bat-derived sars-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 collected in 2018 in zhoushan eastern china and sars-cov about 79 identity but was more distant from mers-cov about 50 identity
29
 furthermore according to the rich knowledge about sars-cov and the newly released sequence of sars-cov-2 the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov-2 including its receptor-binding motif rbm that directly contacts angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is similar to that of sars-cov strongly suggesting that sars-cov-2 uses ace2 as its receptor
30
 currently more structural and functional studies confirmed that ace2 acted as the receptor for sars-cov-231

32it is known that most of the current influenza vaccines are inactivated vaccines which plays a very important role in protecting people from influenza virus infection some approaches such as formaldehyde uv light and -propiolactone have been applied in the preparation of inactivated vaccines against sars-cov which generally induced robust serum-neutralizing antibody ab response in different immunized animals
39 40 41
 for instance he y et al showed that high-titer antibodies elicited by the inactivated sars-cov in the immunized animals could recognize s protein especially the receptor-binding domain rbd in the s1 subunit and potently block sars-cov entry
42
 some groups evaluated the safety of the inactivated vaccine for sars-cov and the results showed that all vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody and significant reductions of sars-cov after viral challenge however challenge of mice given any of the inactivated vaccines led to occurrence of lung lesion based on th2-biased immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration
43 44 45
 in addition fan luo et al intramuscularly immunized chinese rhesus macaques with 25 g beta-propiolactone-inactivated whole sars-cov z-1 vaccine and boosted the immunization on day 7 although this study revealed no exacerbation of infection in the immunized macaques following the challenge with sars-cov ns-1 the authors suggested that an antibody-dependent enhancement ade assay should be performed in vitro to examine whether the immune sera induced by inactivated vaccine would mediate ade in some cell lines such as k562 thp-1 and monkeys peripheral blood mononuclear cells
46
 therefore we should be cautious in using the inactivated sars-cov as a vaccine since it may cause harmful immune andor inflammatory responseshistorically and contemporarily live-attenuated vaccines have been used successfully in controlling measles mumps rubella polio yellow fever and chickenpox infections and outbreaks47

48 some researchers constructed recombinant forms of the full-length sars-cov s protein or rbd of s protein that was encoded into the highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus ankara mva
49
 recombinant adeno-associated virus raav
50
 or an attenuated parainfluenza virus bhpiv3 respectively51

52 balbc mice were inoculated intranasally or intramuscularly with mvas and neutralizing antibodies were induced moreover mvas administered by either route elicited protective immunity as shown by reduced titers of sars-cov in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of the mice after viral challenge du let al evaluated the immune protection of a raav encoding rbd vaccine in mouse model by intranasal inoculation which induced strong mucosal immune responses and provided long-term protection against sars-cov infection
53
 other groups reported that immunization of monkeys via the respiratory tract with bhpiv3sars-s induced the production of sars-cov-neutralizing serum antibodies after the challenge with sars-cov all monkeys inoculated with bhpiv3sars-s did not shed any sars-cov while monkeys in control group shed sars-cov for 5-8 days49

52 weingartl h et al immunized ferrets with rmva-s and the immunized ferrets developed a more rapid and vigorous neutralizing antibody response compared with control animals however after challenge with sars-cov they also exhibited stronger inammatory responses in liver tissue than control animals suggesting that vaccination with rmva-s is associated with enhanced hepatitis
54
 which is not seen in the above infection model it is suggested that we should not only use mice or monkeys as animal model but also use ferrets as the infection model because of its sensitivity to sars-cov thus sometimes we do not observe the pathological damage caused by vaccine immunization which may be that the animal model used is not representative enoughnotably live-attenuated vaccines are associated with the risk of reversion by either mutation- or recombination-driven processes which can cause dangerous outbreaks in unvaccinated populations including animals
48
 several groups have tried to develop novel strategies in controlling fidelity and attenuating rna virus pathogenesis in the case of coronavirus some mutants have been identified to prevent reversion to repaired virulence55

56 rachel l graham et al provided a proof that rewiring the transcription regulatory networks trns limited reversion in an live-attenuated coronavirus vaccine candidate which are effective against sars-cov
56
 some sars-cov vaccine candidates were tested in clinical trials showing that they could elicit antibody responses and are safe57

58 although their long-term safety profiles have not been reportedenvelope s protein is the most important surface protein of coronavirus figure 2
 which is related to the viral infectivity the s protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion59

60 and is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity61

62 generally the s protein of coronavirus is functionally divided into the s1 subunit responsible for receptor binding and the s2 subunit responsible for cell membrane fusion
63 64 65 66
 by aligning sars-cov-2 s protein sequence with those of sars-cov and several bat-sl-covs we predicted that the cleavage site for generating s1 and s2 subunits is located at r694s695
67
 in addition it has been reported that s protein has strong immunogenicity and can induce high titer neutralizing antibody
63
 rbd of sars-cov s1 is located in s318-510 and the key rbm is s425-494 of which r453 is critical for the complex formation
68
 notably n479 and t487 of the rbd are important for the high-affinity association of s protein with ace2
69 70 71 72
 residues 442 472 and 480 also contribute to receptor recognition and host range of sars-cov although not as much as residues 479 and 48725

73

74 besides a point mutation at r441 or d454 of the rbd of sars-cov disrupts the antigenic structure and binding activity of rbd to ace275

76 by comparing the amino acid sequence of s protein between sars-cov-2 and sars cov it was found that the similarities of primary sequence between sars-cov-2-s and sars-cov-s isolated from human civet or bat are around 76-78 for the whole protein around 73-76 for the rbd and 50-53 for the rbm7

30in s1 subunit sars-cov-2 and sars-cov shared around 50 conserved amino acids and the three-dimensional structure of sars-cov-2 rbd was composed of a core and an external subdomain which was more similar to that of sars-cov
29
 we aligned the sequence of s protein between sars-cov ncbi reference sequence nc0047183 and sars-cov-2 ncbi reference sequence nc0455122 as shown in figure 3
a the five key residues responsible for the binding of the sars-cov rbd residues 442 472 479 480 and 487 sars-cov numbering to the ace2 receptor were variable in the sars-cov-2 rbd residues 455 485 493 494 and 501 sars-cov-2 numbering although the five critical residues in sars-cov-2 rbm were different with that of sars-cov residue gln493 provide favorable interactions with human ace2 consistent with sars-cov-2s capacity for human cell infection other critical residues in sars-cov-2 rbm particularly asn501 are compatible with but not ideal for binding human ace2 suggesting that sars-cov-2 has acquired capacity for human-to-human transmission phylogenetic analysis indicates that sars-cov-2 also potentially recognizes ace2 from a diversity of animal species except for mice and rats implicating that these animal species may act as intermediate hosts or animal models for sars-cov-2 infections
30
 s2 subunit of coronavirus is divided into two domains hr1 and hr2 we confirmed that sars-cov-2 hr1 and hr2 regions are able to interact with each other to form six helix bundle 6-hb which brings the viral and cellular membranes in close proximity for fusion64

77 as shown in figure 3b several amino acid residues in hr1 of sars-cov-2 which are concentrated from 922 to 943 were variable with sars-cov residues 904-925 while hr2 is completely identical between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov not shown suggesting that sars-cov-2 s2 especially hr2 is a conserved target for pan-coronavirus vaccine together these results suggest that s protein plays an important role in the infection and immunogenicity of coronavirus which promotes some research teams to prepare a vaccine based on full-length s protein of sars-cov-2a number of vaccine candidates based on the full-length s protein of sars-cov have been reported in succession and generally could induce high level of immune response and potent protective immunity35

78 79 80 for example the expression of full-length s protein and its trimer of urbani strain by recombinant baculovirus can induce adequate neutralizing antibody against human and palm civet sars pseudoviruses that bears s proteins of homologous or heterologous sars-cov variants such as tor2 gd03t13 and sz3 strains in vaccinated mice
81
 these reports suggested that the full-length s protein is highly immunogenic and able to induce protection against sars-cov challenge besides the neutralizing antibodies alone may be able to suppress virus proliferation however the risk in safety and final protective effect of the full-length s protein-based vaccine should not be underestimated some groups reported that although full-length s protein of sars-cov elicited a neutralizing antibody response it also induced harmful immune responses including triggered infection of human b cells or other immune cells by sars-cov and enhanced sars-cov infection with anti-sars-cov-s immune-serum after challenge with homologous sars-cov
82 83 84
 last year liu l et al identified that anti-s protein igg in productively infected lungs caused severe acute lung injury by skewing inflammation-resolving response in sars-cov macaque models subsequently these antibodies were injected into healthy macaques that were then challenged with sars-cov interestingly the macaques receiving the antibodies showed more severe lung injury than the control group indicating that antibody induced by sars s protein vaccine candidate may cause antibody dependent enhancement ade
85
 thus it is speculated that the s protein of sars-cov contains some epitopes which may induce humoral or cellular immune responses that exacerbate the pathology in some coronavirus infections
86
 protein science an american biotechnology company once spent tens of millions to make a full-length s-protein vaccine of sars-cov however the vaccine development was suspended because of the safety problems in the immunized animals exactly liu g et al found that peptide s597-603 of s protein induced antibodies that enhanced infection both in vitro and in non-human primates
87
 perhaps s protein-based vaccines against sars-cov could be engineered to avoid ade via elimination of the s597-603 epitopefull length s protein has been truncated into rbd as a vaccine candidate rbd of sars-cov-s contains major antigenic epitopes that can induce not only neutralizing antibodies but also cd8 t cell-responses43

63

88 89 90 91 he yet al identified the neutralizing epitopes on the rbd of sars-cov-s by a panel of 27 mabs isolated from the immunized mice six structure-dependent epitopes and two adjacent linear epitopes were found suggesting that the epitopes capable of inducing highly potent neutralizing ab responses are mainly conformational epitopes 92 in addition the neutralizing epitopes in mers-cov rbd was confirmed to be mainly conformational as well93

94 the modifications in amino acid residues of mers-cov-s-rbd based on the structure design could improve its protection against mers-cov infection
94
 enlightening that s-rbd or modified s-rbd of sars-cov-2 is promising for the development of vaccine against sars-cov-2we have compared the immunogenicity and immune protection of rbd vaccine with full-length s protein the results suggested that the rbd from either sars-cov or mers-cov had induced ab responses with higher titer more potent neutralizing activity and provided longer-term protection in vivo against sars-cov infection compared with that induced by full-length s protein more importantly sars-cov rbd did not cause immune damage in the animal model while full-length s protein could do51

95 96 97 it is speculated that there are some super-antigens in the region beyond the rbd of the full-length s protein in this way after the full-length s protein enters the animal model it will induce abundant non-specific antibodies and immune cell activation subsequently eliciting a large amount of cytokines which will lead to severe immune damage just like the pathogenic course of sars-cov but why the antibody titer induced by full-length s protein is not as high as that induced by rbd it is speculated that the antigen competition might result in a lower level of neutralizing antibody induced by full-length s protein than that induced by rbd therefore rbd-based subunit vaccine may be the ideal and safer alternative for the development of coronavirus vaccineinterestingly some groups also found that the recombinant rbds derived from the s protein of tor2 gd03 and sz3 the representative strains of human 20022003 and 20032004 sars-cov and palm civet sars-cov respectively induced high titers of cross-neutralizing abs against pseudoviruses expressing s proteins of tor2 gd03 and sz3
98
 suggesting that the major neutralizing epitopes of sars-cov are maintained in the process of cross species transmission thus rbd-based vaccines could induce extensive protection against human and animal sars-cov variants probably the rbd of s protein may serve as one of the most effective and safest vaccines for the prevention of sarssince both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov recognize ace2 on the cell surface as the receptor can rbd-based sars-cov-specific vaccines cross protect individuals from sars-cov-2 infection unfortunately ying t et al showed that the most potent sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies eg m396 cr3014 that target the ace2 binding site of sars-cov failed to bind sars-cov-2 s protein indicating that the different amino acids in rbd between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 has an important effect on the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies
99
sars-cov s2 subunit which is responsible for fusion between virus and target cell membranes is expected to be a vaccine candidate against sars-cov66

100

101 several groups showed that s2 of sars-cov andor mers-cov s protein could induce neutralizing antibodies although their neutralizing potency is generally lower than that of antibodies specific for rbd
102 103 104
 however guo et al investigated the immune responses against the recombinant s2 fragment residues 681-980 in balbc mice and found that the s2 fragment could induce specific cellular immune response and a high level of total igg but little neutralizing antibodies against infection by sars-cov
105
 additionally zeng f et al purified the total s1- and s2-specific igg from mice immunized with recombinant s1 or s2 proteins respectively and found that anti-s1 and anti-s2 iggs were able to abolish the binding between s protein and its cellular receptors although anti-s1 igg showed a significantly higher blocking efficiency
106
 as shown in figure 2b the amino acid sequences of hr1 and hr2 are highly conserved and homologous between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in fact these domains are also highly conserved in other coronaviruses
104
 thus the s2 subunit has potential to be used as a target for the development of pan-cov vaccine against divergent virus strains altogether these results suggested that the s2 domain of sars-cov s protein as a vaccine candidate may be able to prevent the infection of sars-covsars-cov can also bind to host cells through alternative receptors such as dc-sign dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin andor lsign liverlymph node-sign107

108 seven asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in the s protein including residues at positions 109 118 119 158 227 589 and 699 are crucial for dc-sign-or l-sign-mediated virus entry
109
 notably a sars-cov-specific human monoclonal antibody cr3022 could bind potently with sars-cov-2 rbd however the epitope of cr3022 does not overlap with the ace2 binding site within sars-cov-2 rbd
99
 suggesting that sars-cov-2 may also have other receptor binding sites except for ace2 which should be noted in our vaccine design against sars-cov-2 besides optimization of sequences components or immunization routes inclusion of appropriate adjuvants or application of combinational immunization approaches are usually required for preparing an effective vaccine110

111all these above results indicated that the modification of the sars-cov s protein specifically by retaining the conserved amino acids especially the conserved sequence in the rbd region and removing the possible epitopes that may cause immune damage may be a good strategy to prepare a broad-spectrum vaccine against sars-cov and sars-cov-related virusvery recently many research teams have launched the development of vaccines against sars-cov-2 the safety is a crucial issue that we need to be aware of when making vaccines meanwhile there is another issue needs attention the human and civet isolates of sars-cov nestle phylogenetically within the spectrum of sars-cov-like sl-cov strains isolated from the bats and the civets may have served as intermediate amplification hosts that enable sars-cov to cross species for animal-to-human transmission70

112 113 114 115 additionally rna virus might well mutate in ways that would make previously effective vaccines useless thus development of a safe and effective vaccine against both human and animal sars-cov strains is highly important for preventing future sars outbreaks on the other hand given the high prevalence and wide distribution of coronaviruses increasing humananimal interface activities the large genetic diversity and frequent recombination of cov genomes novel coronaviruses are likely to emerge periodically in humans due to frequent cross-species infections and occasional spillover events a broad-spectrum sars vaccine that is effective against all the coronaviruses using ace2 as their receptor can be applied immediately when we face the recurrent threat of coronavirus particularly taken sars-cov-2 as an example the virus might disappear before the vaccine is developed therefore development of safe and broad-spectrum vaccines against sars-cov-2 and other sars-cov-related virus is of great significance for protecting human from cov infection based on the above analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various vaccines against sars-cov the modified s protein is expected to be a candidate for a cross protective vaccine against sars-cov and sars-cov-related virus notably we have recently demonstrated that a vaccine based on rbd of s protein against sars-cov could effectively cross neutralize sars-cov-2 moreover several scientists have tried to design a vaccine against all -coronavirus especially these ace2-associated onesin addition to antigens adjuvants can enhance the immune response and reduce the amount of antigen required for each dose of vaccine so that more doses of vaccine can be produced and provided to more people the choice of adjuvants also affects the efficacy of respiratory virus vaccines and adjuvant has also been applied in the rd of sars-cov-2 vaccine lung is a complex organ which is rich in immune cells such as macrophages the pulmonary epithelial cells aecs also have the characteristics of some immune cells such as secreting a large number of pulmonary surfactant a d ps-a ps-d the ps layer forms a strong barrier to prevent nanoparticles and hydrophilic molecules from accessing them so as to protect the aecs from pathological damage
116
 type i interferons ifn-is are the chief immune mediators to protect the body from viral infections and can be secreted by aecs as well as immune cells following viral infection therefore the activation of stimulator of interferon genes sting in these two cell types can effectively enhance the production of ifn-i and recapitulate the immune responses provoked by viral infection
117
 however it is still a great challenge to delivery stng agonists into the cytosol of aecs without destroying the integrity of ps layer recently two research teams from china and the united states cooperated to ingeniously use ps-biomimetic liposomes ps-gamp to encapsulated 23-cyclic guanosine monophosphateadenosine monophosphate cgamp a natural and effective sting agonist118

119 because of its resemblance to ps ps-gamp disguises self and escapes from immune surveillance following intranasal immunization together with sp-a and sp-d ps-gamp enters the alveolar macrophages ams from which ps-gamp fluxes into aecs through gap junctions between ams and aecs subsequently the sting pathway in ams and aecs was activated without breaching ps and alveolar epithelial barriers through this mechanism the adjuvant ps-gamp combined with inactivated h1n1 vaccine generated broad-spectrum cross protection not only effectively against h1n1 but also against heterosubtypic h3n2 h5n1 and h7n9 virus infection within two days after a single immunization this cross protection lasted for at least 6 months and induced the persistence of lung cd8 trm cells in vivo it is also showed that ps-gamp could enhance the recruitment and differentiation of cd11b dendritic cells dc and cd8 t cells as well as the humoral response
120
 thus ps-gamp strategy is a promising universal mucosal adjuvant for developing broad-spectrum vaccines against betacoronavirus lineage b sars-cov sars-cov-2 sarsr-covsthere was a significantly harmful immune response after immunizing animals with inactivated vaccine against sars-cov following challenge with the homotypic virus although no obvious safety problem was observed in animal model after immunization in addition the inactivated vaccine against one serotype of dengue virus denv can enhance individual infection with other serotypes
121
 these observations suggested that harmful response after immunization with inactivated vaccine against sars-cov-2 might also happen even if the inactivated sars-cov-2 vaccine does not elicit serious harmful immune response it may enhance the infection of the mutated andor another novel coronavirus by ade the subunit vaccine based on rbd can avoid ade however rbm cannot serve as a universal vaccine candidate because of its large variation among different virus strains the biggest advantage of mrna and dna vaccines or vector vaccines that is currently under clinical trials in the united states is that they do not need adjuvants however there are still potential safety risks of these mrna or dna vaccines therefore the modified rbd combined with t cell epitopes and effective mucosal adjuvants will be the best choice for the preparation of a broad-spectrum and safe coronavirus vaccine of course it should be noted that the choice of vaccine depends on the mortality rate of the disease for infectious diseases with high mortality such as ebov the effectiveness of vaccines is more important than safety however for low mortality disease such as covid-19 the safety of vaccines is more important than effectiveness additional safety concerns relate to effectiveness and safety against antigenic variants of sars-cov and for safety of vaccinated persons exposed to other coronavirusesin a word a safe and effective vaccine for covid-19 is urgently needed however regulators need to evaluate its safety through a series of virus strains and more than one animal model before allowing the covid-19 vaccines to be used in humans simultaneously regulators should also see strong preclinical evidence that vaccines can prevent infection and we should speed up the rd progress on the premise of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine
122
 in addition the vaccine preparation and adjuvant selection for sars-cov-2 in the future should attach great importance to its broad-spectrum cross protection so that if there is similar virus diseases emerged in humans or animals the vaccine can be applied immediately to exert its protective effectthe authors declare no conflict of interestin december 2019 the first patient with an atypical form of pneumonia was diagnosed in china a disease that would later be referred to as covid-19 by the world health organization who one month later in january 2020 the causative agent of the covid-19 disease the sars-cov-2 virus was deciphered and identified and its genome was published rapidly 1by mid-april 2020 the extent of impact of covid-19 on the global population was becoming evident the most adversely affected region per capita was western europe the most seriously affected population being the elderly especially those with extensive co-morbidities and weakened immune systems the causes for regional differences in covid-19 will require months of analysis if not years to ascertain more focused approaches to reduce the impacts of covid-19 in the near-term especially on the most vulnerable populations need to be pursued in parallel with longer-term approaches to lessen the impact of covid-19 or other coronavirus-driven diseases across all demographicsas of mid-april the very short-term measures that have been implemented to reduce the transmission of sars-cov-2 are the same as those that were taken to reduce the transmission of sars-cov during the 2002-2003 sars pandemic good hygiene and quarantine with the latter being far more severe and extensive than the quarantine implemented in 2002-2003 other short-term measures that have been implemented on a very sporadic basis are what can be termed tactical treatments these tactical treatments do not strengthen the immune system but rather have the goal of containing the adverse impacts of the viral attack some examples of tactical treatments that have been tested are eidd-2801 remdesivir favipiravir chloroquine hydroxychloroquine combination of lopinavir and ritonavir tocilizumab losartan to name a few tests so far have yielded very mixed resultsa second avenue being pursued to amelioratereduce the effects of covid-19 is development of vaccines to induce viral immunity the bulk of the present review addresses the status and prospects of this vaccine approachthe third leg of this triad of approaches to ameliorate the ravaging effects especially for the most vulnerable of covid-19 is what can be called the strategic treatment approach 2 this approach has the goal of strengthening the immune system to allow its adaptive component to neutralize the incoming coronavirus without the need for external support strategic treatments eliminate tangible factors that contribute to weaken the immune system some examples of such factors based on existing studies include titanium dioxide air pollution chlorpyrifos aluminum sulfate prenatal alcohol exposure zno oil fly ash and many others 3-9 also the real life exposure scenario in which we are exposed continuously to combination of stressors influences in the long term the immune system and the response of the organism to the viral stressors 10-14tsatsakis et al 15 have shown how pollutants can influence the immune system particularly by modulating ahr pathway and how these effects can be prevented by more strict regulations while some positive impact may result in the short-term from strategic treatments their main impact will probably be for the long-term except for those whose immune systems have suffered irreversible damage or those who have an overwhelming genetic predisposition to immune dysfunction because strategic treatments appropriate to any specific individual are difficult to identify and difficult to eliminate because of ingrained habits some emphasis needs to be placed on those types of treatments that do not require severe lifestyle alterationsthis work aims to analyze the strategies and challenges regarding the development of effective vaccines against sars-cov-2 the discovery of a vaccine against the novel coronavirus is an important component of the three-pronged approach described initially given that the pandemic cannot seem to be entirely stopped by social distancing and good hygiene practices the tactical therapies identified so far have not been entirely effective especially for the most vulnerable individuals being unable to prevent severe disability and ultimately death while healthcare systems are still struggling not to crumble under pressure from coronavirus patients research laboratories around the world are competing to produce an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 as soon as possible in order to be able to stop the spread of the new coronavirusglobal immune deficiency is a risk factor for anti-covid-19 vaccine efficacy particularly in elderly who have been exposed to a myriad of factors that contribute to weakening of the immune system as described previously these factors also result in diseases such as obesityobesity-related eg type ii diabetes metabolic syndrome and immune-mediated cancers mechanistic reasons for these diseases include weakness of antigen recognition decreased immune cell quantity and functionality increased levellength and timing of humoral immune alterations of components reduced initiation of cellular responses and memory cell disorders other associations with immunodeficiency include age-dependent humoral and immune cell alterations immunosenescence malnutrition 19 protein-energy-micronutrient deficit and telomere shortening 20 in addition past or current treatments affect the scalable ineffectiveness of vaccines in both older adults 21 and children 22 especially in immunocompromised 23exposure to immunosuppressive drugs 24 or residence in developing countries 25 with a low socioeconomic status is associated with a higher viral mortality compared to residence in developed countries 26 current global obesity prevalence in adult and children is also a risk factor for anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine inefficacy due to higher levels of il-6 27 and decreased igg concentrations parasitic infections respiratory tract infections such as complicated pneumonia 28 can also affect subsequent immune response to anti-sars-cov-2 vaccination 29adjuvant purity and safety knowledge gaps of the relative contribution of the innate and adaptive responses to protection against individual pathogens and the precise mode of action of individual adjuvants 30 are existing negative factors in vaccine efficacy anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines will be available by vaccine market players according to current orphan drug 31 and vaccine legislation 3233 due to the fight against sars-cov-2 pandemic this means that design defect failure to warn and negligence in testing may also affect vaccine efficacy under those conditions long-term safety testing of vaccines in humans will be non-existent there is no data on whether anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines will be first licensed in developed countries 34 or if all vaccine production facilities will be adequate to assure a reliable supply of new anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines 35 in a timely manner and are compatible with specifications and improved adult vaccine design strategy by who or immunobiography 36 and heterogeneity of immune responses in the elderly subpopulations 36the safety of the vaccine is initially assessed in laboratory studies with mice or rabbits if the animals do not show signs of disease after receiving the vaccine then the tests begin in humans and the number of subjects gradually increases 37 duration of the clinical trial on average for a classical vaccine after preclinical stage - in vitro and in vivo tests is as follows 3839in phase i also called the first human test the vaccine is given to a small group of healthy volunteers 10 to 100 the purpose is not to test whether the vaccine protects against the disease but whether it is safe or whether it causes severe side effectsin phase ii the candidate vaccine is administered to a larger group of subjects 100-1000 and in phase iii to an even larger group 1000-100000 separate studies may be required in adults children and the elderly it sometimes happens that vaccines that seem safe when given to a small number of people show side effects when given to a larger number of people this is explained by the fact that any rare complication is less likely to occur when the group of subjects is small continuous monitoring is important in case of complications that occur with delayed effect 40 during a pandemic these sequential studies may be shortened and partially overlapped but it is important that thousands of vaccinated people are followed for several months before the general purpose vaccine is approvedif there are more severe signs of inflammation or if the vaccine causes the immune system to malfunction in other ways the candidate vaccine may not be suitable for widespread use when such adverse effects are identified delays in the production process inevitably occur 41 at present only two potential vaccines against the sars-cov-2 virus are in the first phase and this by a derogation from the rule - skipped animal studies fig 1the first vaccine that does not follow all research steps is called mrna-1273 and will be tested in the first phase in seattle there is an explanation for the speed of approval which is related to the fact that the coronavirus is not used in the vaccine development it is an experimental vaccine made by a new method based on rna basically the rna molecule in the vaccine teaches the cells to produce the disease-specific antigen and trains the body for the real enemy but there is also a small problem to date no vaccine based mrna technology has been approved for any disease although a few have reached the second phase of testing 42the second vaccine is ad5-ncov the vaccine is created by genetic engineering and tries to teach the body to recognize the coronavirus protein s which is delivered via a type-5 adenovirus adenoviruses are a family of about one hundred double-stranded dna viruses that cause various diseases in humans and animals and type-5 is often used for genetic recombinationalthough clinical trials have begun for these two candidates and are likely to begin soon for other potential vaccines it is unlikely to move to phase ii earlier than a few monthsvaccines stimulate immunity to the virus but can also stimulate inflammation in the body this can manifest itself either as pain or inflammation at the site where the subject was injected or as general symptoms such as fever or fatigue symptoms similar to covid-19 disease for most vaccines these reactions are mild and affect only a small proportion of subjectswhen a vaccine causes the production of antibodies in mice or in humans this does not necessarily mean that the vaccine will protect against the disease ideally before moving on to human studies researchers should be able to demonstrate that the vaccine will protect laboratory animals from the disease when they are experimentally infected with the virus in the case of diseases caused by previous coronaviruses sars and mers it was difficult to find an animal species that would be affected by the disease in the same way as humans are affected however previous research may help scientists speed up the animal testing process for covid-19 the protective effect of a human vaccine is assessed using a series of studies similar to the series of safety studies if the vaccine elicits an immune system response for example if antibodies can be detected in the phase i study then larger phase ii and phase iii studies can be performed to see if the vaccine protects against infection or diseasealthough covid-19 is a new disease research on sars and mers has helped us understand how the human body responds to coronaviruses and how the response of the immune system generates protection against disease 43 restricted human studies can also be used to calculate the correct dose and schedule for the vaccine some vaccines generate a strong immune response after a single dose but others require a booster dose after a month or longer this strategy also increases the duration of studiesto assess whether a vaccine prevents covid-19 among those exposed to the infection it should be tested in phase iii studies in a setting where the infection is actively occurring in response to the west african ebola outbreak in 201415 the rvsv ebola vaccine went through all three phases of clinical development in just 12 months through the centralized coordination of who mdecins sans frontires and manufacturer during this period there were still cases of ebola in guinea and the protection of the vaccine was demonstrated by vaccinating the contacts of the residual cases as they appeared in the community 44in the case of pandemic vaccines tens or hundreds of millions of doses are needed this production process takes at least six months if the production lines already exist any new vaccine involves a new production process which involves several quality control stepsthe manufacturer must ensure that each vaccine produced is of consistent quality and requires repeated testing moreover because vaccine manufacturing is a biological process inevitably some batches of vaccines will fail for reasons that are not always clear which can further delay production there are quite a few manufacturers in the world that can produce vaccines on a large enough scale to meet the needs of a pandemicbefore initiating each stage of the human testing process the developer must provide evidence that the vaccine has early indications of protection and is safe among those who have been tested research ethics committees review clinical trial plans and authorities such as the european medicines agency ema and food and drug administration fda oversee the entire vaccine development process before approving it for general use these assessments usually take several weeks or months 45 although such approvals could be shortened in the event of a pandemic many potential covid-19 vaccines use new technologies so regulators will not be able to rely on the experience of similar vaccines to speed up the process developers of the covid-19 vaccine were given a target to produce a vaccine in 12-18 months while historically vaccines took 15-20 years to develop there are diseases against which vaccines do not yet exist despite decades of work for example more than 100000 children die each year from respiratory diseases caused by another rna virus rsv respiratory syncytial virus which causes pneumonia despite 50 years of research and 18 products developed there is currently no rsv vaccine available 46numerous scientific research groups are working on the development of a covid-19 vaccine using a number of different approaches having many groups in the race is important as most vaccines entering clinical trials will fail for safety or efficacy reasonssars-cov-2 is part of the coronavirus family as is sars-cov-1 which generated the 2003 sars epidemic and mers-cov which generated the mers epidemic in 2013 47the new sars-cov-2 coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes a respiratory infection called covid-19 coronavirus infectious disease - 2019 with an average incubation period of 5 days between 2 and 14 days 48 the disease is characterized by predominant respiratory symptoms cough difficulty breathing fever of moderate intensity in about 80 of cases but may have severe manifestations bilateral interstitial pneumonia with progression to respiratory failure acute respiratory distress ards the main cause of mortality there are also cases with gastrointestinal manifestations especially diarrhea and in some patients especially in the young ones hypoanosmia loss of sense of smell and hypodysgeusia alteration of the sense of taste have been reported as early symptoms 49shortly after the publication of the genetic structure of sars-cov-2 the first two vaccines were developed sars-cov-2 virus structure is composed of an rna molecule surrounded by a series of structural and functional proteins 50 known structural proteins are protein s or spike - which leads to the characteristic appearance protein m membrane protein e envelopes protein n nucleocapsid of these protein s has the role of attaching to receptors in human cells and facilitating the fusion of viral content with the cell in the case of sars-cov-2 the receptor is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 which is found in large quantities in the respiratory tract and lung parenchyma 51-54 the initial infection of sars-cov-2 occurs in the ciliary epithelial cells of the bronchi 5556the binding of protein s to ace2 is greatly favored by the existence of the polybase cleavage site - a protein fragment cleaved by the furin enzyme commonly found in the human body allowing protein s fragments s1 s2 and s3 to perform their function in addition to fusing the viral envelope with the cell membrane the virus also infects the human cell through endocytosis the cell membrane around the portion that binds to the virus forms a vesicle inside the cell detaches from the membrane and introduces the virus into the cell via that vesicle through the process of entering the cell the virus loses its envelope which fuses with the cell membrane and the viral rna is free in the cytoplasm carrying out two processes replication and transcription first the cellular components responsible for rna transcription produce viral proteins and the rna is copied subsequently these proteins and copies of the initial rna are packed into new virions released from the cell to spread the infection 57humoral immunity consists of the production of specific antibodies against these antigens these are i antibodies that appear rapidly during infection and disappear rapidly igm and ii antibodies that appear slower and persist in the body for a long time even after the infection is cured igg 58cellular immunity requires training certain immune cells to recognize and destroy the virus it has been observed in sars-cov-2 infection that the number of cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes is low in the peripheral blood because they are destroyed in the process of elimination of the virus but has high concentrations of activation markers 59 regarding the sars-cov virus memory cells capable of recognizing it have been identified in the blood of healed patients several years after the infection the persistence of memory cells is an important element to consider in the development of the anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine 60 cases have been described where the sars-cov-2 infection recurs after being considered cured 61on the other hand there is evidence that coronaviruses are equipped with mechanisms by which they can sometimes evade immune attack first after infection of the cell the vesicles in which the virus is located are lacking in the receptors that could recognize the virus as an invader of the body second interferon synthesis with antiviral function is inhibited by coronaviruses and the presentation of viral antigens by pca is low in infected patients 62current pandemic of covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 is a global epidemiological problem the solution of which will require establishment of large-scale production of the vaccine given the experience of previous coronavirus outbreaks showing a high variability of the virus it is required to develop a vaccine production platform providing the scalability technological flexibility and versatility these vaccines must provide high efficacy safety and tolerabilitythis is due to the time required to prove that the proposed vaccine is safe and effective as well as the time required to produce millions of doses many candidate vaccines which initially look promising are likely to fail during the testing process the process of developing a new vaccine begins with a so-called candidate vaccine which a team of scientists believes to have potential this is the fastest part of the process and takes up to a few weeks thus some candidate vaccines are being developed in russia against covid-19 the shemyakin and ovchinnikov institute of bioorganic chemistry is developing liposome-encapsulated dna-protein vaccine based on the covid-19 spike antigens and its dna coding sequence and vlp vaccine based on hsb antigen fused with covid-19 spike antigens the vaccine candidates against covid-19 based on live attenuated recombinant influenza vector platform are developed by fsbsi chumakov federal scientific center for research and development of immune- and biological products of russian academy of sciences and smorodintsev research institute of influenza who national influenza centre the fsbsi chumakov federal scientific center for research and development of immune- and biological products of russian academy of sciences is developing two vaccines based on an attenuated and an inactivated strain of the covid-19 virus isolated in centre chumakov personal communication of professor egorovfor efficient application of sars-cov-2 vaccines not only the production procedure needs to be developed but also requires a large-scale production followed by vaccination program targeting muti-million population of different regions only such a complex approach will allow combatting of the coronavirus disease pandemic new technologies do not require the work with live virus making their production much easier but still needing further scientific and technological evidence fig 2the mrna encoding ribonucleic acid vaccine encodes a stable prefused form the form before being fused to the cell membrane of the host cell of spike protein s 63 protein complex s is required for membrane fusion and host cell infection and has been the target of vaccines against mers and sarsmembrane fusion viral and cellular is an essential step when encapsulated viruses enter cells fusion of the double lipid layer requires catalysis to overcome a high kinetic barrier and viral fusion proteins are agents that perform this catalytic function 64 although coronavirus uses many different proteins to replicate and invade cells protein s is the main surface protein that it uses to bind to a receptor - this becomes a bridge to the human cell after protein s binds to the human cell receptor the viral membrane fuses with the human cell membrane allowing the viral genome to enter the human cells and initiate infection 49the mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 is based on a relatively new genetic method that does not require growing the virus in the laboratory the technique transforms the human body into a living laboratory because the whole process is no longer carried out in the laboratory but directly in the body that received the vaccine 65the technique is actually based on messenger ribonucleic acid mrna fragments the genetic material that is copied from dna and encodes proteins moderna company loads its vaccine with viral mrna which encodes the proteins of the new coronavirus and then injects it into the body immune cells from the lymph nodes process the mrna and synthesize specific viral protein antigens so that other immune cells recognize them 66 mrna is like a software molecule in the body which then produces viral proteins that can generate an immune response 67 how the body processes the viral protein is often very different from the way it processes the same protein of the vaccine thus one of the theoretical benefits of introducing mrna into a vaccine is that the body causes the viral protein to behave in exactly the same way that the virus would have directed the host to do 63 table idna vaccines represent the latest direction of development in the manufacture of vaccines vaccines obtained by recombinant dna technology are produced by genetic modificationthe dna encoding the target molecule is introduced via a plasmid or viral vector in a suitable microorganism or cell line in which dna is expressed and translated into protein the product is subsequently recovered by extraction and purification the injected dna is a plasmid plus a promoter that provides immunogenic protein synthesis 69an advantage of this type of vaccine is that it stimulates both humoral and cellular immunity also this type of vaccine is stable and does not require maintenance under controlled conditions refrigeration as is the case for conventional vaccines in contrast to live attenuated vaccines the risks arising from a potential inadequate attenuation of vaccine strains are not present in dna vaccines 70 other advantages of this new technology are the fact that the plasmids used are easy to manufacture in large quantities and the immunity conferred is long-term the disadvantages identified so far with regard to dna vaccines are due to the fact that this type of vaccine is limited to protein immunogens 71a clinical trial for a new dna vaccine against coronavirus has begun this is called chadox1 ncov-19 and it was initially developed to prevent mers 72 this vaccine is based on an adenovirus vaccine vector and on sars-cov-2 spike protein 73 it has been modified so that it cannot be reproduced in the human body and the genetic code that transmits instructions for the production of coronavirus spike protein has been added allowing the adenovirus to produce this protein after vaccination the result is the formation of antibodies against the spike protein known to be on the surface of sars-cov-2 74the ino-4800 vaccine is another new dna vaccine to prevent sars-cov-2 infection it is entering human phase i testing 75 the phase i study will enroll up to 40 healthy adult volunteers each participant will receive two doses of ino-4800 every four weeks and initial immune responses and safety data from the study are expected by the end of the summer preclinical data have shown promising results in immune response in several animal models also the preclinical results for the inovio sars-cov-2 vaccine were consistent with the results of the phase i study for the middle east respiratory syndrome mers vaccine caused by another type of coronavirus here the inovio dna vaccine was well tolerated and induced high levels of antibody response in 95 of subjects generating t cell-mediated responses in nearly 90 of study participants long-term antibody response was maintained for up to 60 weeks in the case of the anti-mers vaccine 75 table iisubunit vaccines contain only certain antigenic determinants of pathogenic microorganisms and are obtained either starting from conventional cultivation processes or by recombinant dna technology 76antigen determinants included in the vaccine increase the efficiency of the immune response and the presence of a small number of pathogens reduces the risk of side effects subunit vaccines mainly contain surface fragments of pathogens because these types of structures are weak immunogens to obtain vaccines with suitable efficacy the antigens are conjugated with protein molecules 77antigen purifiers sometimes lead to loss of immunogenicity requiring coupling with a protein carrier or with an aluminum salt however adjuvants are associated with the onset of local reactions to the vaccination site also the duration the immunity conferred by vaccination is lower except for live vaccines 78 table iiialong with traditional virus vaccines viral vectors are widely used in which genome of one virus is used to deliver the antigen of another virus thus allowing development of a platform technology of virus production these technologies are available for large-scale production of vaccines drawbacks of such vaccines include a large variation of purification methods need for a reliable confirmation of purity and activity of the virus 79 tables iv and vvaccine development based on the recombinant proteins and virus-like particles vlps is a more innovative approach antiviral vaccines are usually developed on the basis of surface proteins that form vlps production of vlps in the cells with further reconstruction into the stable and immunogenic forms is a multi-stage process substantial issues appear for the vlp production for non-enveloped viruses nucleic acid based vaccines are very interesting from the platform technology viewpoint allowing the same process to be used for the production of different antigens they elicit both humoral and cell immune responses 80production of these vaccines may be based on e coli cell fermentation and corresponding technologies of extraction and purification of plasmids ensuring their structural integrity 81 table vianother category of vaccines is vaccines containing whole microorganisms but inactivated by chemical or physical methods this type of vaccine has the advantage of higher stability however effectiveness is lower and requires reminders of immune system vaccines with inactivated live virus require stabilization of the structure in the dry form separate supply of the solvent and cold-chain transportation these factors complicate the production process and lead to increase of their cost 82 table viilive attenuated vaccines were the first vaccines utilized these types of vaccines are obtained through cultivation of microorganisms under suboptimal conditions or through successive passage in cultures techniques that determine attenuation of virulence while maintaining the capacity to induce the immune response 83although characterized as very effective live attenuated vaccines have the disadvantages of risks related to the possible occurrence of mutations leading to the virulence reversal as well as contra-indication in the case of immunocompromised persons table viiithe lv-smenp-dc vaccine lentiviral minigene vaccine shenzhen geno-immune medical institute entered phase i clinical trial in march 2020 it is a vaccine based on dendritic cells modified with a lentiviral vector expressing synthetic minigens based on selected viral protein domains and is administered with antigen-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes 84pathogen-specific aapc vaccine shenzhen geno-immune medical institute phase 1 clinical trial 85 is based on lentiviral vector modified artificial antigen presenting cells aapcs expressing synthetic minigens based on selected viral protein domainsthe development and manufacture of a covid-19 vaccine is an urgent issue but it is likely to take many months to resolve although many companies have announced that the covid-19 vaccine will be ready soon this will be quite difficult to do in reality 72the main reason is that before being put on the market the vaccine should be safe both in the short-term and in the long-term this is very important because in the history of vaccine production there have been situations of contamination with other viruses fortunately without major consequences 16 for example one third of the polio vaccines administered in the us between 1955 and 1963 also contained simian virus 40 sv40 and more recently rotavirus vaccines have been discovered to also have swine circoviruses 86-88in order to avoid such situations everything to be tested on humans should first be checked for purity and then sterile production lines provided this takes time in rare cases certain antibodies generated by immunization may promote an aggravated form of the disease a situation called ade antibody dependent enhancement 89 when these antibodies re-establish contact with the virus they will actually help it enter the cells and cause infection ade has been described in many viral infections influenza dengue zika etc but also in coronaviruses the mechanism of ade has not been confirmed for coronavirus in humans 90several animal studies have shown that some types of anti-sars and anti-mers vaccines although effective in generating antibodies can lead to more severe forms of disease when the virus is subsequently inoculated 91the second reason is that the vaccine must not only be safe but also effective it must be able to determine the synthesis of antibodies of a certain type at a certain concentration titer and to provide protection for a reasonable timehowever vaccines never generate immunity to all vaccinated people 92 the causes are complex and vary from genetic and immunological factors to the quality of the vaccines themselves and how they are administeredage is an important aspect and some influenza studies have shown that aging of the immune system dramatically decreases the effectiveness of vaccination 93 therefore for any future anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine all these aspects should be evaluated and the primary immunization failures minimized by adjusting the doses or number of administrationsassuming that the vaccine will generate an effective immune response to a sufficient number of individuals among those vaccinated the time frame of vaccine protection is questionable 94 for example after measles vaccination a small percentage of those who initially respond well lose their protective antibody status within a few years a phenomenon called secondary immunization failure 95this is why it takes time to check the post-vaccination persistence of anti-covid antibodies last but not least both safety and efficacy are significantly dependent on the type of vaccine ie the technology or platform usedsome technologies are very new and therefore require more careful testing others are old but need to be adapted for covid-19 another aspect is not only the ability of a company to develop the technology but also its large-scale production capacity so that it is quickly accessible globally because there is no commercially available anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine precedent for the proposed platforms completely new production lines capable of generating billions of doses in a few months must be considered and this must be done without stopping the production of current vaccines already included in the official protocols and guidelines at present this capacity will be reached with difficulty and will represent an unprecedented effort dna and rna vaccines are based on the principle of insertion of these nucleic acids in some cells of the vaccinated ones forcing them to make immunogenic viral proteins 96 although some recent data seem encouraging these concepts have questionable efficiency in humans non-replicative vectors are actually common viruses eg adenovirus genetically modified to display sars-cov proteins on the outer surface 97 but they are so common that many of us have already met with them throughout our lives and as a result we already have immunity and neutralize them before they do their jobthe attenuated viruses would be variants of sars-cov-2 made less or not at all pathogenic by genetic engineering they are by far the most immunogenic but there is a risk that they will become pathogenic after mutations 98inactivated viruses viral fragments and synthetic peptides are all relatively weakly immunogenicthe analysis of these variables is normally done over 10 years in the form of a trial the stages of a trial are inflexible standardized intensely regulated for the purpose of maximum safety and efficacy of the final vaccinethe first stage is the preclinical research in which the technology that will be included in the vaccine is selected and then the efficacy and safety profile of human cells in vitro and animal models in vivo is tested if the expected anti-infectious effect is seen in vitro and cells do not die excessively then in vivo animal studies are conducted mice are usually the perfect candidate for in vivo studies because they are about 85 genetically similar to humans relatively inexpensive and do not raise major ethical issues 99 however one of the notable differences between the human and the mouse is fixed in the case of the ace2 receptor gene to which sars viruses bind during infection mice simply do not make the respiratory syndromes they eliminate the virus relatively quickly from the body this is why it is necessary for either the genetically modified mouse to have a human ace2 receptor or to use ferrets and monkeys and this makes everything much more expensive and more difficult to accessthe preclinical stage lasts between 1 and 2 years and is by far the most selective it is estimated that less than 20 of the vaccines tested are able to progress to human tests some fail because the product does not work others because they can no longer find financing 1100after obtaining the vaccine the first people vaccinated will be the highest risk categories for everyone else the term is sometime in 2022 possibly long after we have naturally acquired immunitythere are still many unknowns related to coronavirus immunity and that is why obtaining a vaccine is difficult future mutations in sars-cov-2 could occur at any time which automatically means a high risk of any vaccine becoming useless no vaccine has been obtained for any other coronavirus so far and no one can guarantee its success yet it is possible that we will have the anti-covid vaccine in a very short time without having the benefits from long-term testing results the vaccine will probably not be available to all of us for 18 monthsscientists began working on coronavirus vaccines during sars and mers outbreaks but their efforts did not materialize because of a myriad of difficulties since this extremely severe current coronavirus pandemic covid-19 the spread of the outbreak appears much broader than was the case for sars there is also the possibility of the disease becoming endemic and seasonal in its appearance according to some investigators this explains why many research groups and companies are undertaking efforts to develop an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 all over the world also speeding up all the usual phases needed to develop and test a vaccine in the humanan important feature in the landscape of vaccine research and development for sars-cov-2 is represented by the varied range of evaluated technological platforms including nucleic acids dna and rna virus-like particles peptides viral vector replicative and non-replicative recombinant proteins live attenuated viruses and inactivated viruses many of these platforms are not currently the basis of vaccines already authorized but experience in areas such as oncology encourages developers to exploit new opportunities for increased development and manufacturing speedsthere is not an effective therapy for severe covid-19 and social distancing is extremely costly from a social and economic perspective therefore the development of an effective vaccine along with efforts to implement immune-enhancing strategic treatments and shorter-term efforts to identify tactical repurposed treatments should be considered major public health priorities we hope to get this key tool for disease prevention and to do this quite soonit is unknown whether there ever will be a successful sars-cov-2 vaccine but the efforts of the scientific community in attempting to develop such a vaccine is without precedent thus covid-19 vaccines are a never ending storycoronavirus disease 2019 covid-2019 is caused by a novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and was identified as a pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 1 as of april 12 2020 more than 18 million people were confirmed to have been infected and tested positive for covid-19 with over 114000 deaths worldwide 2 this virus was first identified in the respiratory tract of patients with pneumonia in wuhan hubei china in december 2019 which was then indicated as a newly identified -coronavirus ncov 34 see fig 1 fig 2 fig 3
sar-cov2 is an enveloped non-segmented positive sense rna virus that is included in the sarbecovirus ortho corona virinae subfamily which is broadly distributed in humans and other mammals 56 its diameter is about 65125 nm containing single strands of rna and provided with crown-like spikes on the outer surface sars-cov2 is a novel -coronavirus after the previously identified sars-cov and mers-cov which led to pulmonary failure and potentially fatal respiratory tract infection and caused outbreaks mainly in guandong china and saudi arabia in covid-19 research many studies have demonstrated that bats are suspected as the key reservoir of the viruses by finding as much as 962 identical genome sequencing of sars-cov-2 with bat cov ratg13 37 in this review we hypothesize that since the covid-19 virus has several complex immune-evasion components that contribute to its virulence we suggest this more complete understanding can be used to develop an effective approach in the treatment of diseases caused by this virusa sample isolation from pneumonia patients who were some of the workers in the wuhan seafood market found that strains of sars-cov-2 had a length of 299 kb 8 structurally sars-cov-2 has four main structural proteins including spike s glycoprotein small envelope e glycoprotein membrane m glycoprotein and nucleocapsid n protein and also several accessory proteins 9 the spike or s glycoprotein is a transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of about 150 kda found in the outer portion of the virus s protein forms homotrimers protruding in the viral surface and facilitates binding of envelope viruses to host cells by attraction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 expressed in lower respiratory tract cells this glycoprotein is cleaved by the host cell furin-like protease into 2 sub units namely s1 and s2 part s1 is responsible for the determination of the host virus range and cellular tropism with the receptor binding domain make-up while s2 functions to mediate virus fusion in transmitting host cells 31011the nucleocapsid known as n protein is the structural component of cov localizing in the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi region that structurally is bound to the nucleic acid material of the virus because the protein is bound to rna the protein is involved in processes related to the viral genome the viral replication cycle and the cellular response of host cells to viral infections 1213 n protein is also heavily phosphorylated and suggested to lead to structural changes enhancing the affinity for viral rna 10another important part of this virus is the membrane or m protein which is the most structurally structured protein and plays a role in determining the shape of the virus envelope this protein can bind to all other structural proteins binding with m protein helps to stabilize nucleocapsids or n proteins and promotes completion of viral assembly by stabilizing n protein-rna complex inside the internal virion the last component is the envelope or e protein which is the smallest protein in the sars-cov structure that plays a role in the production and maturation of this virus 12in supporting the process of entry of the virus into the host cell sars-cov2 binds to the ace2 receiver that is highly expressed in the lower respiratory tract such as type ii alveolar cells at2 of the lungs upper esophagus and stratified epithelial cells and other cells such as absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon cholangiocytes myocardial cells kidney proximal tubule cells and bladder urothelial cells 14 therefore patients who are infected with this virus not only experience respiratory problems such as pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards but also experience disorders of heart kidneys and digestive tractas a member of the nidovirus family coronavirus infection sars-cov2 can be contracted from animals such as bats and fellow humans this virus can enter the human body through its receptors ace2 which are found in various organs such as heart lungs kidneys and gastrointestinal tract thus facilitating viral entry into target cells the process of cov entering into the host cell begins through the attachment of the s glycoprotein to the receptor the ace2 in the host cells such as in type ii pneumocytes in the lungs 15 this attachment occurs in the binding domain of s protein of sars-cov-2 receptors which are present at 331 to 524 residues and can bind strongly to human ace2 and bat ace2 13 the entry and binding processes are then followed by fusion of the viral membrane and host cell 11after fusion occurs the type ii transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 that is present on the surface of the host cell will clear the ace2 and activate the receptor-attached spike-like s proteins 15 activation of the s proteins leads to conformational changes and allows the virus to enter the cells 16 both of these proteins tmprss2 and ace2 are the main determinants of the entry of this virus based on the research of sungnak et al nasal epithelial cells specifically gobletsecretory cells and ciliated cells display the highest ace2 expression throughout the respiratory tract 17 furthermore entered-sars-cov-2 will subsequently release its genomic material in the cytoplasm and become translated in the nucleithe genomic material released by this virus is mrna that is ready to be translated into protein in its genome range this virus is complemented by about 14 open reading frames orf each of which encodes a variety of proteins both structural and non-structural that play a role in its survival as well as virulence power in its phase of transformation the gene segments that encode nonstructural polyproteins are the ones this process first translates into orf1a and orf1b to produce two large overlapping polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab by contributing a ribosomal frame shifting event 19 the polyproteins are supplemented by protease enzymes namely papain-like proteases plpro and a serine type mpro chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro protease that are encoded in nsp3 and nsp 5 subsequently cleavage occurs between pp1a and pp1ab into nonstructural proteins nsps 111 and 116 respectively the nsps play an important role in many processes in viruses and host cells table 1
 102021many of the nsps subsequently form replicase-transcriptase complex rtc in doublemembrane vesicles dmvs which are mainly an assembly by rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp- and helicase-containing subunits the canonical rdrp domain residing of cov nsp 12 and av nsp9 furthermore the complex transcribes an endogenous genome template of viral entry to negative-sense genes of both the progeny genome and subgenomic rna as intermediate products and followed by transcription to positive-sense mrnas that are mainly mediated by rdrp 192022next the subgenomic proteins become translated into structural and accessories proteins such as m s and e proteins that subsequently are insulated in the endoplasmic reticulum and then moved to the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment ergic meanwhile the previously replicated genome program can directly join the n protein to the nucleocapsid form and move into the ergic in this compartment nucleocapsids will meet with several other structural proteins and form small wallet vesicles to be exported out of the cell through exocytosis 1019generally the bodys immune response to sars-cov2 and sars-cov is closely similar being mediated by cytokines 23 a case report in wuhan from 99 covid-19 patients revealed that there was an increase in the total number of neutrophils interluekin-6 il-6 serum and c-reactive protein about 38 52 and 86 respectively and 35 decrease of total lymphocytes 24 other research found increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf 5 the conditions are correlated with severity and mortality of this disease which suggest the potential of cytokines forming as found occurring in sars-cov and mers-cov infections 25the entry of the virus into the host cell triggers stimulation of the hosts immune response which will first be encountered by innate immune system cells via antigen presenting cells apc eg dendritic cells and macrophages as frontline of the immune system 1526 apc have pattern recognition receptors prr including toll-like receptors tlrs nod-like receptors nlrs rig-i-like receptors rlrs and other small free molecules that are located in various places in host cells such as plasma membranes endosomal membrane lysosomes endocytolysosomes and cytosol they recognize pamp comprised nucleic acids carbohydrate moieties glycoproteins lipoproteins and other small molecules that are found in the structural components of viruses or intermediate products such as dsrna and induce cascade signaling to produce immune system cell effectors each of the prrs could induce a different biological response to subsequent protein activation 2326for example toll like receptor 4 tlr-4 might recognize the outer component of cov the protein spike furthermore through mediation of myd88 this introduction will trigger the activation of nf-b transcription factors and the pathogen-activated protein kinases mapks pathway to induce proinflammatory proteins meanwhile activation of endosomal receptors such as tlr-3 and tlr that could recognize the rna or dsrna genome of coronavirus leads to recruitment of trif adapter protein directly trif subsequently activates the irf3 and nf-b transcription factors to induce proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon- and tnf- although the introduction of pamp through tlr-4 can also recruit trif adapter proteins the recruitment must be mediated by tram and tiram 1525 26 27 this secret of proinflammatory cytokines is the initial response in the first line of defense against virus infection furthermore type i inf in turn will form complexes with its receptors ifnar and subsequently activate the jak-stat pathways jak1 and tyk2 kinases further phosphorylate stat1 and 2 followed by its complexation with irf9 and together they migrate into the nucleus to initiate the transcription of ifn-stimulated genes isgs and lead to suppression of viral replication and prevent the severity of the disease 25 however excess releasing of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as ifn- ifn- il-1 il-6 il-12 il-18 il-33 tnf- tgf and chemokines ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 cxcl8 cxcl9 cxcl10 from immune effector cells causes hyperinflammation which will eventually lead to ards 2829as the presenter of foreign antigens the apc will present the antigen of cov to the cd4  t-helper cells by mhc class 1 and this leads to releasing of il-12 as a co-stimulatory molecule to further stimulate the th1 cell activation in addition to th1 stimulation releasing of interleukin-12 and ifn- an increase in mhc class i expression and nk cell activation is also needed for resistance of viral replication for the eradication of virus-infected cells it also initiates production of proinflammatory cytokines via the nf-b signaling pathway il-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that also is increased when sars-cov2 infection occurs these cytokines further recruit neutrophils and monocytes to the site of infection and activate several other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including il-1 il-6 il-8 il-21 tnf- and mcp-1 15263031next activation of th1 cells could stimulate cd8  t cells which are one of the effectors of t cells that will target and kill cells infected with cov at the same time cd4 t cells could stimulate humoral immune responses by producing antigen-specific antibodies via activating t-dependent b cells 152830the antibodies produced are generally igm and igg which have a unique presence pattern in response to the presence of coronavirus 28 generally this infection will produce a specific igm that can only last 12 weeks but igg with a longer period in addition to the formation of antibodies exposure to this virus also cause the formation of cd4 t cells and cd8 memory that can last for four years 32 in fact based on findings in patients who recovered six year after coronavirus infection t cell memory was still able to hit the peptide spike when the first exposure occurred 33 this further explains and directs researchers to the development of vaccines against the corona virus especially to sars-cov-2 which is now a pandemic outbreak in the worldwide 28generally viruses including coronavirus have number of avoidance ways from onslaught of immune system cells to better survive and infect host cells 2830 the strategy can be applied to various processes both at the time of introduction before entering the cell and when it has entered the host cell during the recognition process this virus can use avoidance strategies through the formation of double vesicles on the outside of the cell the formation of these vesicles causes shield recognition of cytosolic prrs to dsrna as an intermediate product of replication virus 28in addition to the formation of a double vesicle this virus has 8 proteins capable of avoiding the immune system through the blocking of inf nsp1 is a non-structural group of proteins from sars-cov that can suppress the work of infi through host translational machinery inactivation rna-host degradation and inhibition of phosphorylation of stat1 the mechanism could cause infi failure to induce replication and dissemination of viruses at an early stage and leads to increased severity of disease 2527 the composition of the viral rna genome including sars-cov which has a 5 cap less than the host cell rna makes it easy for immune system cells to recognize its presence and induce an immune response to get around this the virus developed a strategy of mimicking the host capping machinery this strategy employs two non-structural proteins namely nsp 14 which initiates cap formation and subsequently follows modifying the cap of viral rnas by nsp 16 so that rna viral seems similar to host cell rna and avoids any prrs recognition 273435other nonstructural proteins from coronavirus that also have the ability to prevent this virus from immune responses are nsp3 that encoded two functional proteins macrodomains and plpro cleavage of nsps both of these proteins appear to be employed as actors in the evading of sars-cov from immune response-induce viruses this possibility was supported by fehr et al in their in vivo study in balbc mice that were infected by sars-cov-lacking macrodomains the findings of this study revealed that although there was an increase in expression of type i ifn isg15 cxcl10 and the proinflammatory cytokines il-6 and tnf followed by significantly higher survival there was no lung pathology development in the mice 36 the finding is closely similar to other studies conducted in mice demonstrating a lack of deubiquitinating enzyme dub activity in mers-cov dub is another role of plpro to help coronavirus evade attack from a hosts immune response by antagonizing the ifn response from these findings we hypothesized that the decline in function of the two proteins may lead to the direct introduction and sticking of immune troops to continuously infected cells and prevented the replication of the virus and the life cycle 3738 in addition to using nonstructural proteins sars-cov could utilize its protein accessories to avoid immune responses for example the gene segment located on orf3b of this virus has the ability to antagonize the inf signaling pathway and cause inhibition of the effector cell activation cascade for eradication and inhibition of viral replication 39 equally of concern the protein encoded in orf6 could inhibit jak-stat signaling pathway by binding to karyopherin-2 and tethers karyopherin-1 on internal membranes to lead to blocking nuclear translocation of the transcription factor stat1 27there is no specific treatment for eradication of the sars-cov2 virus in patients accordingly the therapeutic approach that can be done is to use another -coronavirus approach such as sars-cov or mers-cov treatments some possible therapies can be given according to the approaches including lopinavirritonavir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine aerosol inhalation of alpha-interferon twice per night also could be used in some cases coronaviruses such as mers-cov have commonly used combinations of interferon- combined with ribavirin 4041 this therapy seems to be able to give results at the beginning of therapy that is 14 days after being diagnosed but this effect disappears when entering day 28 furthermore loutfy et al found that the combination of interferon with steroid drugs can accelerate lung repair and increase oxygen survival levels therapy using interferon- is still confusing other studies have concluded that this therapy does not have a beneficial effect on patients 3842as a matter of fact as with epidemics that have occurred before and since the death ratio caused by covid 19 is quite high mitigation methods need to be developed one of which is through the development of vaccines that have not yet been found specific vaccines could be used to initiate the formation of specific antibodies against the sars-cov2 virus this development is being temporarily developed in various parts of the world and is the focus of todays global efforts in fact according to a news release from jakarta globe on march 27 2019 the g20 has set aside about usd 4 billion for the development of the vaccine 4043spike or s protein-based vaccine is one approach to developing vaccines that has attracted the attention of many researchers in the discovery of the coronavirus vaccine s protein has an rbd located in the s1 subunit of the virus that facilitates entry of the virus into the host cell by binding to its receptors on the host cell ace2 furthermore the existence of mapping and genomic characterization of these proteins has increasingly answered the puzzle in the development of this vaccine 4445 research by yang et al that used combined dna demonstrated protein s could activate the immune response through t cell production that subsequently form antibodies which can neutralize the virus in mice another study shown that this strategy was effective to elicit protective immunity producing neutralizing antibodies in mice 4647 further studies with closely similar results conducted by gao et al and he et al that used reconstructed vaccine which originated from s1 fragment of sars-cov revealed that it could stimulate immune response and induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies to blocking s protein binding and prevent sars-cov entry 4849in addition through recent developments in vaccine-based therapy for cancers and other diseases therapeutic development efforts also focus on drug discovery that can stop the spread and replication of the virus in the host cell that is intended for patients who have already contracted an infection these include camostat mesylate which is a serine protease inhibitor that can inhibit the performance of tmprss2 enzyme activity in the coronavirus entry process this drug has been used clinically in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis so that it is considered to be a potential therapy for covid-19 treatment 50 51 52 in addition to the two therapeutic approaches above other potential therapeutic development pathways for patients with this viral infection can be done through blocking ace2 receptors and rna interference using sirna or microrna 52 53 54it is now well-known that the pathogenesis of ards-induced coronaviruses involves microrna in the cell nuclei this discovery gave rise to new knowledge in the development of microrna-based anti-coronavirus therapy approaches microrna-based therapy has been proven both in vitro in vivo and clinically to cure diseases in the form of viral infections cancer and other degenerative diseases 5455in summary we conclude that coronavirus has unique and complete components its immune-evasion components that contribute to evade from recognition of the immune system lead infectivity and fatality to hostit is now well-known that the pathogenesis of disease-induced coronaviruses the development of therapy will be more specific for example the development of serine protease inhibitor or rbd-based vaccine also became coronavirus therapy approach however further research is necessary to develop these findings for clinical application in patients

coronavirus infection immuno-evasion of coronaviruses approaches for sars-cov-2-related disease therapy and figure designnone declarednone declaredthe 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 emerged after six other human coronaviruses four common human coronaviruses that cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses including 229e alpha coronavirus nl63 alpha coronavirus oc43 beta coronavirus and hku1 beta coronavirus were first recorded in the 1960 s two other human coronaviruses are sars-cov and mers-cov which lead to severe lung infections known as severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome  mers respectively 12 the sars-cov outbreak occurred in 2002 starting in china and spreading to other countries with a death rate of 11 the mers-cov outbreak occurred in 2012 starting in saudi arabia and spreading to other countries with a death rate of 37 now we are seeing the outbreak of 2019-ncov which can affect both upper respiratory and lower respiratory tracts and causes unusual viral pneumonia named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 or novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia ncip all of the three coronaviruses that have caused human pandemics are of beta coronavirusesto date no experiment has proven which innate immune receptors undertake the detection of sars-cov patients with severe sars-cov infection show the aberration of the innate immune system 6 in particular the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine type i ifns and interferon-stimulated genes isgs would undergo oscillations that are clearly favorable to sars-covthe release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines occurs on the first day of infection high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with sars-cov disease correlate with acute respiratory distress syndrome in aged animals 6the upregulation of type i ifns and isgs is not observed until two days after infection studies show that ifn deficiency does not exacerbate sars-cov disease in animals while treatment with type i ifns could help control sars-cov replication therefore it is possible to suppose other innate immune mechanisms which will have an essential role in immunity against sars-cov 6microparasites are living organisms smaller than parasites that reproduce in a single host thereby resulting in the host-mediated immune responses macroparasites are bigger and can have multiple hosts the 2019-ncov involves cytokines and chemokines from the initiation to the elongation phases of the disease 7 in its initiation stage the 2019-ncov would increase plasma concentrations of different cytokines including il1 il1r il7 il8 il9 il10 basic fgf gcsf gmcsf ifn ip10 mcp1 mip1a mip1b pdgf tnf and vascular endothelial growth factor 7 critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu showed higher levels of il2 il7 il10 gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf compared with those who did not need to be in an icu 7 the work of 2019-ncov seems to be an interplay between different t-helper th cell population subsets eg th1 th2 and treg there are instances in both microparasites and macroparasites which have been correlated with such this orchestration of immune responses mycobacterium tuberculosis is a prototype of microparasites linked to all three th1 th2 and treg cell expansion 8among patients presenting in primary care with clinical symptoms of illness the prevalence of dyspnea and acute respiratory distress syndrome is about 51 and 27 at the median of 8 and 9 days from illness onset with about 40 requiring icu at the median of 105 days from illness onset a study of 12 patients infected with the 2019-ncov revealed abnormalities in the plasma content of biochemical and immune parameters 9 of note blood abnormalities including hypoalbuminemia the low number of lymphocytes low percent of neutrophils and high level of lactate dehydrogenase ldh angiotensin ii and c-reactive protein crp were associated with the severity of lung injuryin the case of viral respiratory infection the process through which the immune system can continually recognize viral particles and seek to eliminate infected cells takes place with difficulty this is partly because the respiratory tract with an extensive mucosal surface area and its exposure to the environment has everything favorable for microbial colonization and surveillance and partly because of the nature of virus that is pathogenic more than bacteria and its power of attachment to the mucosal surface and to interact with it so that the respiratory epithelium will be liable to superinfection and this is what occurred with the spanish flu pandemic in 19181919 10 hence it would be understandable that the presence of a virus by which it increases bacterial adherence interferes with the epithelium barrier integrity induces production of adhesion proteins and viral factors and downregulates the function of immune cells destroys the equilibrium of the respiratory system 10besides the respiratory system coronaviruses will tend to affect the nervous system and gastrointestinal system in animals 1113 on the evidence of having been transmitted from animals to humans zoonotic diseases all three coronaviruses sars-cov mers-cov and 2019-ncov are correlated with an aggressive form of the disease the transmission of the 2019-ncov to humans occurs directly and indirectly it mainly occurs through a direct transmission of respiratory droplets indirect transmission that happens through touching surfaces contaminated with the virus is a less possible source of spread 14the 2019-ncov spreads during the clinical latency stage and therefore classical models for epidemic outbreaks do not apply to the particular case of 2019-ncov also an average reproductive number of 311 indicates that the average number of secondary cases with the 2019-ncov is increasing 15 the official data estimate that the average clinical latency stage lasts 7 days or more and it is longer than the median incubation period of 52 days 214 days 15 thus there is a promising point that the treatment of symptomatic individuals can be useful however it should be mentioned that the reproduction number varies over time depending on the estimation models the average reproduction number estimated by stochastic methods mathematical methods and exponential growth are 244 42 and 267 respectively 16 moreover simulation methods predict that with continuing efforts wuhan would achieve a reproduction number of less than one soon 17 here we frame immunogenetic explanations for the epidemiological dynamics of covid-19wuhan where the condition of 2019-ncov first appeared has experienced the worst drought year of the last 40 years additionally december when 2019-ncov first recognized is the first month of winter both with time and place the outbreak of sars-cov occurred in precisely the same condition during the winter season and in low humidity we can therefore understand the relation between the origin of the 2019-ncov and the changing condition of climateboth winter and low humidity act as a stressor for the immune system evidence indicates the association of cold temperature and low humidity with respiratory tract infections in the manner that the lower the environmental temperaturehumidity the more and the sooner respiratory tract infections occur in a population 18 early interferon-gamma ifn- induction in viral infections indicates a battle between the innate immunity and the virus in colder temperature ifn- production by the rig-i-like receptors rlrs that are essential for the recognition of viral rna by the innate immunity decreases in airway cells so well adapted for viral replication 19 then the immune system would commence fever to allow the expression of the tlr4 and trigger from this a series of anti-viral immune responses characterized by the production of cytokines 20 with nearly 99 reporting the most common symptom of 2019-ncov infection at onset is feverthe mean age of people with covid-19 is 524 years 21 age could strongly predict the fate of 2019-ncov disease 56-year-old became the youngest patient with severe covid-19 by contrast children and adolescents are the least likely group to be infected with the 2019-ncov occurring in only 2 of patients 19 years of age or younger even if they get sick they will get a mild form of disease without serious complications with an average probability of 02 of dying a study of 9 infants with the 2019-ncov infection reported fever and mild upper respiratory tract symptoms as the only symptoms of the virus 22one of the most remarkable features of anti-viral immunity is that it shows adaptation in its strategy to the stages of human life the innate immune cells are born capable of making t regulatory cell cytokine interleukin-10 il-10 and t helper 17 th17 cell cytokines il-6 and il-23 but incapable of induction of t helper 1 th1 cell cytokines type i interferons ifn- and il-12 23 the diversity of the t-cell receptor tcr repertoire decreases with age while a new lineage of oligoclonal t cells that express natural killer nk-related receptors nkr is formed 24taken together the real-time data of the 2019-ncov infection in addition to the experimental evidence regarding those immunological features which are prominent in neonates and children more than in adults it seems that the importance of the immunomodulatory cytokine il-10 should be exaggerated in anti-2019-ncov immunity moreover aging is a condition associated with inflammation whereas the neonatal period related to an immature antiinflammatory response considering the pro-inflammatory response as the initiator of sars-cov infection there is a logical possibility in an overwhelming inflammatory reaction in the aged subjects supporting this old animals with sars-cov infection show high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines conjointly with the signs and symptoms of respiratory failure 6men constitute more than two-thirds of the reported cases 73 vs 27 7 also men are more than 15 times more likely to die from covid-19 death rate 28 vs 17generally sexual differences play an important role in affecting the immune system function and in therefore driving variability in response to infections in particular men are generally thought to produce a lesser amount of type i ifns and inflammatory cytokines and possess a lower number of circulating t cells 25 all that is expected to be required for the defense against viruses has been deficient in men compared to women this distinction between the anti-viral immunity of men and women exists due to the genetic factors environmental factors and hormonal factorscomorbidity is present in more than 30 of cases with covid-19 7 except for less than 1 of the total a chronic condition has been found in all cases that died from covid-19 arranged by their related mortality rates the chronic conditions in the victims of the virus include cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic respiratory disease hypertension and cancer all these conditions in the long-term tend to make the immune system imperfect in both innate and adaptive immune functions 26the renin-angiotensin system ras is detectable in several tissues and serves as a hormone system and contributes to the regulation of blood pressure through the generation of autocrine or paracrine signals the ras and its key player angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 have been implicated in cardiovascular diseases through mediating inflammation 27 2019-ncov binds to the ace2 receptor therefore we might expect that 2019-ncov poses a significant threat to patients who on their own already have problems in the ras and it would be partly because the process of inflammation takes place more than before infection occursviruses in the family of coronaviridae vary in a remarkable degree to become genetically mutated though they all share the genetic mutability by recombination mechanism and error-prone replication  a fundamental mechanism of genomic variation and virulence using this mechanism sars-cov became mutated and increased its virulence whereas mers-cov has not changed significantly from its discovery in 2012 28 the former binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and the latter to the cd26 receptor 28 ace2 receptor appears to be the cellular receptor for the 2019-ncov as well as for cov-nl63 which results in a mild to moderate lung disease taken together binding the same receptor would not necessarily pertain to the same behavior by sars-cov and 2019-ncovthe pathogenicity of the disease seems to be associated with its transmissibility in terms of the more the reproductive number the less the severity of the disease the 2019-ncov with the overall case fatality rate of 465 as of 29 march 2020 and the reproduction number greater than one would probably exhibit a trend similar to that of h1n1 in 1918 28phylogenetic analysis indicates a common ancestor to which human 2019-ncov human sars-cov and the bat sars-cov converge additionally the four structural viral proteins spike s membrane m nucleocapsid n and envelope e imply a high degree of shared identity in range 977-100 between the human and bat coronaviruses 29 it supports the view that the human 2019-ncov is descended from an animalsars-cov and 2019-ncov enter the cell in the same way  through binding ace2 which is present in lung and gastrointestinal epithelia 30 however poor conservation of the receptor-binding motif of 2019-ncov known as the structural protein spike s with that of sars-cov indicates that this new protein has undergone modification 31 when compared with the spike gene of a marine coronavirus and a bat coronavirus the spike gene of the human 2019-ncov varies at different points due to both synonymous mutations and non-synonymous substitutions 29 the varieties partly explain that the human 2019-ncov has adopted a new structure to become fitted for attachment to the human cellsthe three extremely virulent strains 2019-ncov mers-cov and sars-cov show similar profiles of b-cell epitopes however the novel coronavirus exhibits a distinct pattern of t-cell epitopes in particular cd8 t-cell epitopes which are mainly engaged in anti-viral immunity appear to have mutated more frequently in 2019-ncov than those of cd4 t-cell epitopes in mers-cov and sars-cov 31covid-19 is a life-threatening living challenge for both epidemiology and immunology the current evidence points out the effect of this novel coronavirus on inhibition of anti-viral immune responses and therefore its powerful capacity for replication in the host cells on the other hand covid-19 has shown the highest incidence rate and mortality rate in the elderly population and people with certain comorbidities who are known to have differences in their immune profile the review concludes that tracing the epidemiological character of the virus provides an understanding of the immunity of the disease it can help with the prevention and treatment of the disease in the most vulnerable individualsno specific drug exists for covid-19 however patients can be given a variety of medicines and supplementations that improve immune responses including metformin glitazones fibrates sartans and atorvastin also there is a long list of a less safe but better choice in terms of anti-viral immunity to provide to the patients eg cyclosporine lopinavir-ritonavir interferon beta ribavirin monoclonal antibodies and anti-viral peptides an in vitro study testing the effects of seven drugs on the infection rate of the covid-19 reported that chloroquine an anti-malarial agent and remdesivir an anti-ebola drug effectively inhibited the 2019-ncov infection 32 it was strengthened by evidence that remdesivir was successful in both preventing and controlling mers-cov-induced clinical disease in nonhuman primates 33 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors acei and angiotensin receptor blockers arb are apparently required for the normalization of the abnormally high level of angiotensin ii patients with covid-19 9 however no consensus has yet been reached about the use of acei and arb in patients with covid-19 34 the other challenge is that whereas the 2019-ncov is isolated from the host and grown in host cells there is no animal model of disease to judge the condition is caused by 2019-ncov 35 all the propositions need testing in an animal model of disease before human useno doubt a future line of research should be devoted to the development of vaccines for active immunization against 2019-ncov the viral genome and its structural proteins have a direct tendency to impair immune surveillance as the analysis of protein sequences has shown eight hla-dr epitopes that are located in the spike envelope and membrane of the 2019-ncov play an essential part in the obstruction of the immune surveillance 29 also there are b-cell and cytotoxic t lymphocyte epitopes that are uniquely present on the surface glycoprotein of 2019-ncov 36 these epitopes are likely a vaccine target for the 2019-ncov superinfection with an apathogenic dsrna virus strengthens the upregulation of ifns which are the key player of anti-viral immunity 37 it could be shown that this method called the superinfection therapeutic sit strategy promotes the resolution of viral infections both dna and rna viruses 38 however this does not determine whether it would confer a benefit in the case of 2019-ncov as well another era in the treatment of infection with 2019-ncov can be devoted to the clinical development of t-cell productsthe first and ultimate picture of covid-19 is a lung injury accompanied by a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines however the use of anti-inflammatory drugs eg corticosteroids has its own adverse side-effects and more importantly as demonstrated by a few avalabe studies 3941 its effects on the clinical endpoints seem to be not more than standard anti-viral agents plus supportive care finding immune biomarkers that can distinguish severe-to-critical from mild-to-moderate infection would help to designate targets for immunotherapy of covid-19coronaviruses are large enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses with genome sizes ranging from

hosts zhou et al 2020 they mainly infect the lower respiratory tract and cause severe pneumonia hotez et al 2020 sometimes leading to fatal acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting in high morbidity and mortality cytokines and chemokines which are triggered by the innate immune system during virus infections have long been thought to play an important role in immunity but dysregulated and excessive immune responses may cause immunopathology channappanavar and perlman 2017 research shows that robust sars-cov replication accompanied by delayed ifn-i signaling promotes the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages resulting in elevated lung cytokinechemokine levels vascular leakage and impaired virus-specific t cell responses

interleukin-1 il-1 il-2 il-6 and il-8 kadkhoda 2020 in patients with severe covid-19 lymphopenia is a common feature with drastically reduced numbers of cd4 t cells cd8 t cells b cells and natural killer nk cells as well as a reduced percentage of monocytes eosinophils and basophils furthermore sars-cov-2 may have an antibody-dependent enhancement effect cao 2020 xu et al 2020although there have been outbreaks of coronavirus diseases such as sars and mers when the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 outbreak occurred there were no effective vaccines or drugs available to prevent or cure the disease clinical development of multiple vaccines and screening of specific antiviral drugs were initiated in parallel with attempts to contain the outbreak currently more than 115 candidate vaccines for sars-cov-2 are being developed globally five advanced candidates have recently moved into clinical development including mrna-1273 from moderna ad5-ncov from cansino biologicals ino-4800 from inovio lv-smenp-dc and pathogen-specific aapc from shenzhen geno-immune medical institute thanh le et al 2020it became apparent that coronaviruses can cross the species barrier and cause life-threatening infections in humans ji et al 2020 nishiura et al 2020 therefore further attention needs to be paid to these new coronaviruses in addition coronaviruses causing high pathogenicity and high mortality in animals have attracted increasing attention for example highly virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv which appeared in china in 2010 and the united states in 2013 caused large global economic losses to the pig industry due to the lack of effective vaccines and drugs kong et al 2019 li et al 2012 stevenson et al 2013 another coronavirus swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov which is a novel bat-hku2-like coronavirus was responsible for a large-scale fatal outbreak of in pigs in china that caused the death of more than 24000 piglets across four farms zhou et al 2018 obviously the role of vaccines is an effective way not only to enhance the ability of individuals to fight the virus but also to stop the spread of the virus to be better prepared for future outbreaks of unknown human coronavirus pathogens platform technologies to accelerate vaccine development should be employedtargeted rna recombination was the first reverse genetic system devised for coronaviruses at a time when it was not clear whether a full-length clone could be successfully constructed masters and rottier 2005 constructing an infectious clone of a coronavirus using targeted rna recombination requires two steps first constructing a chimeric coronavirus that carries the mouse hepatitis virus mhv s gene and has a strict mouse cell affinity and second rescuing the targeted recombinant coronavirus on a specific cell dependent on the virus fig 3a targeted rna recombination was the first reverse genetic system devised for mhv subsequently the method was applied to the construction of full-length cdna in other coronaviruses including pedv and feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv haijema et al 2003 li et al 2013 targeted rna recombination presents clear limitations for example it does not operate on parts of the genome that code for replicating enzymes
in vitro ligation uses unique type ii restriction endonucleases eg bgli sapi and bsai that cleave several bases away from their recognition site allowing for the reassembly of authentic coronavirus genomes from smaller fragments detailed steps can be found in the published literature cockrell et al 2017 the assembled full-length cdna containing a t7 rna polymerase promoter at the 5 end and a poly a tail at the 3 end is transcribed in vitro to generate capped full-length transcripts that are used together with capped n gene transcripts to efficiently rescue infectious virus after the transfection of susceptible cells fig 3b the first coronavirus full-length infectious cdna clone was also generated for tgev using in vitro ligation yount et al 2000 in addition sars-cov mers-cov pedv and sars-cov-2 were constructed using in vitro ligation scobey et al 2013 xie et al 2020 yount et al 2003 zaki et al 2012 this method can avoid the instability and virulence of viral cdna in bacteria as it depends on the t7 rna polymerasethe bacterial artificial chromosome bac system allows the assembly of a full-length cdna copy of the viral genome in bac plasmids such as pbelobac11 a low-copy-number plasmid that presents strictly controlled replication leading to one or two plasmid copies per cell almazan et al 2008 bac plasmids contain a 5 cytomegalovirus promoter of the viral genome allowing for the transcription of the viral genome following the transfection of bac dna into mammalian cells in addition coronavirus bacs contain a poly a tail a hepatitis d virus ribozyme and bovine growth hormone termination and polyadenylation signals to create genomic rna with an authentic 3 end fig 3c the first full-length infectious coronavirus cdna clone was generated for transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev using the bac system in addition sars-cov mers-cov fipv and pedv have been successfully developed balint et al 2012 li et al 2017 the bac system presents several advantages including the high stability of exogenous sequences unlimited production of the cdna clone high efficiency of cdna transfection into mammalian cells easy manipulation for genes and intracellular expression of the viral rna fehr 2020recently transformation associated recombination tar cloning has been used to construct infectious clones of coronaviruses including mhv mers-cov and sars-cov-2 httpswwwbiorxivorgcontent10110120200221959817v1 the overall strategy is as follows fig 4a viral rna is prepared from several overlapping dna fragments by rt-pcr or chemical synthesis no virus available the 5- and 3-terminal dna fragments contain the t7-rna polymerase promoter upstream of the coronavirus at the 5 end a restriction endonuclease cleavage site downstream of the polya sequence and overlapping sequences with the tar plasmid pvc604 then all the fragments are used to transform saccharomyces cerevisiae strain vl6-48n and the positive colonies are screened for the correct assembly of the yeast artificial chromosome yac containing virus genome and purified the yac the plasmid is linearized using restriction endonuclease and subjected to t7 rna polymerase-based in vitro transcription to generate transcripts the rna transcripts together with capped n gene transcripts are transfected into bhk cells to obtain the corresponding virions the tar cloning system can rapidly reassemble at least 14 fragments with remarkable efficacy usually  90 of the clones are correctthe vaccinia virus cloning vector also can be used to construct infectious coronavirus clones and represents a generic approach to reverse genetics thiel and siddell 2005 vaccinia virus vectors allow large fragments 2631 kb of foreign genes to be inserted without affecting virus replication and vaccinia viruses can easily produce high titer strains the process of cloning coronavirus cdna in vaccinia virus is as follows fig 4b first of all the virus genome is analyzed for useful naturally encoded endonuclease restriction sites that can later be used to ligate cloned cdna inserts and generate a set of plasmid dnas that cover the full-length virus genomic sequence upstream of the viral 5 end there should be an eagi or a bsp120i restriction endonuclease site to allow insertion of the cdna into the noti site of the vaccinia virus genomic dna by in vitro ligation downstream of the 3 end of the virus genome a polya tail and unique restriction endonuclease site should be cloned second long cdna fragments are assembled by in vitro ligation to obtain a full-length virus cdna fragment third the full-length fragment or several fragments are inserted into a vaccinia virus genome by in vitro ligation finally the vaccinia virus containing the full-length cdna virus genome is linearized and used as a template for in vitro transcription using bacteriophage t7 rna polymerase and transfected into bhk cells to obtain the corresponding virions currently vaccinia virus vectors are successfully applied to reverse genetic manipulation of several coronaviruses including hcov-229e ibv mhv and sars-cov thiel et al 2001 thiel and siddell 2005 van den worm et al 2012chemical synthesis of the viral genome is widely used for the construction of infectious clones using a chemical synthesis system the complete genome of the virus can be synthesized to construct a full-length genomic cdna clone especially in the absence of a natural template this method was recently used to construct an infectious clone of sars-like cov becker et al 2008 in general the ability to quickly and efficiently introduce virtually any type of genetic modification point mutations insertions or deletions into the coronavirus genome and recover recombinant virus is desirable crisprcas9 technology is an efficient platform for manipulating the modification of full-length infectious cloning of coronaviruses which can generate recombinant viruses within a week peng et al 2020 shen et al 2019 wang et al 2019a moreover a combination of bacterial artificial chromosome and lambda red recombination with the i-scei homing endonuclease method was used to engineer genetic alterations of the mers-cov fehr 2020 muth et al 2017 importantly the optimized reverse genetics platform used in this study will simplify the construction of mutant infectious clones and help accelerate the progress in coronavirus researchvirus-infected cells react quickly to invading viruses by producing type i interferons ifn- and type iii interferons ifn-1234 and establish an innate antiviral state which provides a first line of defense against viral infection type iii ifns are mainly produced by epithelial cells and play a major role in diseases that cause mucosal immunity such as pedv and pdcov however most coronaviruses commonly suppress interferon levels in infected cells reverse genetics technology provides a very useful platform in the study of virulence and host innate immune-related mutations and in the rational design of coronavirus live attenuated vaccine candidates according to current research the 5 utr several structural proteins nonstructural proteins and the 3 utr of coronaviruses all have more or less influence on virulence and the life cycle of the virus here we summarize the coronavirus genes associated with virulence replication and innate immunity table 1
 and potential vaccines based on reverse genetics table 2
it is well known that among four coronavirus genera only alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses produce the nsp1 protein which is located at the n-terminal of the replicase polyprotein pp1a in terms of both sequence identity and size nsp1 of alphacoronaviruses shares low similarity with nsp1 of betacoronaviruses to date the crystal structure of nsp1 from several coronaviruses sars-cov tgev and pedv has been resolved which is important to understand the role of nsp1 in the pathogenesis of viruses and its interaction with host cell proteins shen et al 2018 shen et al 2019 the nsp1 protein of coronaviruses is a vital virulence factor widely demonstrated in both alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses jimenez-guardeno et al 2015 lokugamage et al 2015 shen et al 2018 shen et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 not only inhibiting the expression of host genes with different mechanisms but also playing a significant regulatory role in evading the hosts natural immune response nsp1 mainly inhibits the production of ifns zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018c additionally some studies have shown that abolishing the anti-ifn function of nsp1 can attenuate viruses which has been demonstrated in mhv and sars-cov jimenez-guardeno et al 2015 lei et al 2013the nsp2 proteins of some coronaviruses are dispensable for viral replication in cell culture but those viruses lacking nsp2 such as mhv and sars-cov show attenuated viral growth and rna synthesis graham et al 2005 however the pathogenicity of these viruses in mice has not been further reported in addition amino acids 1120 of tgev nsp2 are involved in the regulation of inflammation via nf-b activation wang et al 2018bthe multidomain in nsp3 an essential component of the replicationtranscription complex is the largest protein encoded by the coronavirus genome with an average molecular mass of approximately 200 kda lei et al 2018 in all coronaviruses highly conserved functional domains within nsp3 are present papain-like protease domains ubiquitin-like domains and adp-ribose-phosphatase domains lei et al 2018 using a recombinant sars-cov strain with reduced nsp3 de-adp-ribosylation activity showed that this mutant strain led to virus attenuation in mice but protected them from an otherwise lethal sars-cov infection and significantly enhanced the innate immune response indicating that it is an important virulence factor for sars-cov fehr et al 2016 v787s of nsp3 is thought to induce attenuation of mhv and the mutant mhv strain elicits protective immunity mielech et al 2015 n1347a of nsp3 is also thought to be associated with the virulence of mhv fehr et al 2015 pedv and tgev 5901215aa via nf-b nsp3 proteins have been proven to evade the host immune system wang et al 2019b in addition 102 and 61 amino acid substitutions were found in nsp2 and nsp3 of sars-cov-2 compared with sars-cov or sars-like bat cov respectively and these differences warrant further investigation wu et al 2020the nsp4 genes of coronaviruses are significant in viral replication and pertain to cellular membrane rearrangements beachboard et al 2015 both h120 and f121 in sars-cov nsp4 play critical roles in viral replication sakai et al 2017 however whether nsp4 affects the virulence of the virus needs to be further verified by using reverse geneticsthe coronavirus nsp5 protease 3clpro mpro processes nsp proteins at 11 cleavage sites and is essential for virus replication making it a high value target for the development of anti-coronavirus therapeutics jo et al 2020 tomar et al 2015 it has been reported that coronavirus nsp5 cleaves nf-b essential modulator and stat2 inhibiting ifn production which has been verified in fipv pedv and pdcov chen et al 2019 wang et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 mhv nsp5 t26id65g which confers resistance to a broad-spectrum coronavirus 3c-like protease inhibitor also has a slight effect on the virulence and replication of mhv deng et al 2014coronavirus nsp6 is associated with autophagy cottam et al 2014 scientists used reverse genetics to verify that deletion of any of regions encoding nsp7 nsp8 nsp9 and nsp10 in mhv was lethal to virus deming et al 2006 furthermore pedv nsp7 was found to inhibit the ifn- and irf3 promoter activities zhang et al 2016 and nsp8 can suppress type iii ifn activities zhang et al 2018bthe 148-amino acid nsp10 subunit contains 2 zinc fingers and is known to interact with both nsp14 and nsp16 stimulating their respective 3-5 exoribonuclease and 2-o-methyltransferase activities a series of studies have shown that nsp10 is a major regulator of the sars-cov replication function bouvet et al 2014 the single and double mutations r80ae82a-exon in mhv nsp10 disrupt the nsp10nsp14 interaction and compared to the wild-type virus exon these mutations rendered the virus 5 and 10 times more sensitive to treatment with the rna mutagen 5-fluorouracil respectively the results showed that nsp10 is important for cov replication fidelity and support the hypothesis that nsp10 functions to regulate nsp14-exon activity during viral replication smith et al 2015coronavirus nsp14 has 3-to-5 exoribonuclease exon and n7-methyltransferase n7-mtase activities the former is a proofreading function that is required for high-fidelity replication the inactivation of mhv-cov exon activity by the nsp14 mutations d89a and e91a are relatively stable even after passaging mhv-exon 250 times without reversion of the exon mutation site however novel amino acid changes within the rna-dependent rna polymerase and nsp14 of mhv-exon p250 indicate that multiple replicase proteins could compensate for the exon function during replication and will likely inform the design of countermeasures for endemic and emerging covs by defining novel common targets for stable virus attenuation or direct inhibition graepel et al 2017 mhv-exon activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response case et al 2018 the inactivation of sars-cov exon activity by the nsp14 mutations d90a and e92a was attenuated in both young and aged disease models compared to virulent wt and it provided complete protection against lethal challenge in a susceptible immunosenescent mouse model of the lethal sars-cov infection graham et al 2012 the recombinant tgev virus with a mutation in zinc finger 1 of the exon domain of nsp14 induced weak antiviral responses including reduced expression of beta interferon ifn- tumor necrosis factor tnf and interferon-stimulated genes therefore coronavirus nsp14 plays a potential role in regulating innate immune responses becares et al 2016 in addition pedv nsp14 was found to suppress type i and type iii ifn activities zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018cnsp15 encoded by coronavirus is a nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease nendou that plays an essential role in the life cycle of the virus zhang et al 2018a mhv with the nsp15 h262a mutation that inactivates the endou activity of nsp15 resulted in greatly attenuated disease in mice and stimulated a protective immune response deng et al 2017 pedv endou activity is also a key virulence factor and coronavirus nsp15 is a target for generating live attenuated vaccine deng et al 2019nsp16 has 2-o-methyltransferase mtase activity and it is conserved across the entire coronavirus family increasing its appeal as an attenuation target yong et al 2019 several recent works have shown that although disruption of nsp16 activity in mhv d129a sars-cov d130a mers-cov d130a and pedv kdke to aaaa rendered an attenuated strain it induced stronger type i and type iii interferon responses and protected animals from the challenge hou et al 2019a menachery et al 2017a menachery et al 2018 however without sufficiently attenuated virulence the nsp16 mutant could be combined with another attenuating mutation in nsp1 nsp14 or s protein which will produce a stable attenuated virus capable of protection from heterologous challenge hou et al 2019a menachery et al 2018the coronavirus s protein which is a class i fusion protein located at the surface of the virus includes the receptor binding s1 subunit and the membrane fusion s2 subunit shang et al 2020a walls et al 2020 the coronavirus s protein is considered a major target for the development of subunit vaccines and major virulence genes two chimeric viruses with the reciprocally exchanged s gene were generated one is a highly virulent strain and the other is an avirulent strain showing that the s gene is only one of the necessary determinants for virus virulence wang et al 2018a another report examined the role of the s gene in pedv pathogenesis with different generations of strains in the same way although the results showed that the s gene plays a role in virulence other genes might also important in determining virulence kao and chang 2019 three recombinant ibvs beaur-m41 s1 beaur-qx s1 and beaur-m41 s based on the beaur backbone expressing a heterologous s1 or s from m41 or qx conferred incomplete protection against homologous challenge based on ciliary activity and clinical signs however the protection efficiency of beaur-m41s was higher than that of beaur-m41 s1 ellis et al 2018 coronavirus virions assemble at the endoplasmic reticulum er-golgi intermediate compartment ergic and some of them including sars-cov tgev ibv and pedv possess conserved motifs of yxx andor kxhxxkkxx in the cytoplasmic tail of the s protein hou et al 2019b ujike et al 2016 a recombinant pedv with deletions or a mutation in the two motifs yxx andor kxhxxkkxx showed that the yxx motif triggers endocytosis of s proteins and that the motif kvhvq is involved in the retention of the s proteins in the er-golgi intermediate compartment the loss of both motifs significantly enhances syncytia formation in vero cells and reduces virulence in pigs hou et al 2019b the ntd of the s protein can attenuate a highly virulent coronavirus which was confirmed by a recombinant virus icpc22a-s1197aa and ictgev-s1224aa but the virus may lose important epitopes for inducing robust protective immunity which provides new insights for the development of a new attenuated vaccine hou et al 2017 wang et al 2019a in addition 27 amino acid substitutions were found in the sars-cov s protein compared with sars or sars-like cov and whether these differences could affect the host tropism and transmission property is worthy of future investigation wu et al 2020the coronavirus e protein is the smallest protein of the major structural proteins and is an integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus life cycle including assembly budding and pathogenesis schoeman and fielding 2019 viruses lacking e protein form infectious virions but their replication efficiency and virulence are significantly reduced this seems to indicate that the e protein is an important virulence factor in coronavirus but is not essential for some coronaviruses castano-rodriguez et al 2018 fett et al 2013 jimenez-guardeno et al 2015 shang et al 2020b mers-cov and tgev lacking the e gene are not successfully rescued but they can spread from cell to cell via expression of the e protein almazan et al 2013 ortego et al 2002coronavirus m proteins are major structural proteins and are required for virion assembly the s e and m proteins can form virus-like particles vlps with structural integrity wang et al 2017 both peptides m131 and m132161 in the sars-cov m protein are immunogenic he et al 2005 but the m protein of sars-cov has not been investigated for its protective efficacy against sars-cov infection several studies have shown that the coronavirus m protein also inhibits ifn production shokri et al 2019 siu et al 2009 the mers-cov m protein inhibits type i ifn production through the inhibition of tbk1-dependent phosphorylation of irf3 lui et al 2016coronavirus n proteins have been associated with multiple functions in the viral life cycle including the regulation of viral rna synthesis the packaging of the viral rna in helical nucleocapsids and virion assembly through the interaction with the viral m protein mcbride et al 2014 expression of the n protein is also necessary for efficient recovery of the virus from infectious cdna clones unlike the s protein the n protein has no ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies but it may induce specific antibody and cellular immune responses the n protein plays an important role in viral pathogenesis since balbc mice immunized with recombinant virus mva-mers-n exhibit stronger t cell responses and anti-n monoclonal antibodies protect mice from lethal infection by mhv nakanaga et al 1986 veit et al 2018 immunodominant sars-cov-n regions n1 1422aa and n3 110422aa produce specific antigens in balbc mice and react with the serum of sars patients hence they can be used as effective sars dna vaccines dutta et al 2008 the sars-cov n protein is also an ifn antagonist that inhibits ifn synthesis by inhibiting irf-3 and nf-b interfering with trim25-mediated rig-i ubiquitination or attenuating ptac-mediated rig-imda5 activation ding et al 2017 hu et al 2017coronavirus accessory proteins have been generally regarded as dispensable for in vitro viral replication for example pedv with the orf3 gene entirely deleted could replicate similarly to wild-type pedv beall et al 2016 likewise deletions of ns6 from pdcov orf8a from sars-cov orf3 orf4 and orf5 from mers-cov and orf3 and orf5 from ibv do not affect replication and the deletion of these accessory proteins could attenuate viruses showing that accessory proteins are also related to the virulence of viruses almazan et al 2013 castano-rodriguez et al 2018 menachery et al 2017b zhang et al 2020 the accessory proteins of coronaviruses are often used as target regions for the insertion of exogenous gene since they are dispensable notably some accessory proteins have ion channels and are related to the innate immune response kint et al 2016 wong et al 2018 yue et al 2018 zeng et al 2016 some accessory proteins interact with host cells potentially helping viruses evade the immune system and increase their virulence comar et al 2019 fang et al 2018 orf4a orf4b and orf8b of mers-cov seem to be involved in viral evasion of nf-b mediated host immune responses lee et al 2019 therefore the mutant virus lacking some accessory proteins is potentially a safe and promising vaccine candidate to prevent coronavirus infectionto date viral vectors utilizing modified vaccinia virus ankara measles virus rv vectors or adenovirus have been used to express the glycoprotein of coronaviruses including sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and have been shown to be immunogenic according to in vivo assays kato et al 2019 thanh le et al 2020 to date a recombinant novel coronavirus vaccine using an adenovirus type 5 vector that expresses the s protein has entered phase i clinical trials thanh le et al 2020 researchers designed recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus-based vaccines expressing the mers-cov s protein that induced the highest neutralizing antibody titer and the strongest cytokine-induced t cell responses and these may confer protection against mers-cov infection kim et al 2019 recombinant parainfluenza virus 5 piv5-expressing the mers-cov s protein can induce neutralizing antibodies and robust t cells in a human dpp4 knock-in c57bl6 congenic mouse model hdpp4 ki and protect mice from fatal mers-cov infection li et al 2020b an attenuated parainfluenza virus encoding the full-length s protein of sars-cov was used for the vaccination of african green monkeys and monkeys with this vaccine were protected from subsequent homologous sars-cov infection bukreyev et al 2004 another novel recombinant influenza a virus h1n1pdm09 with mers-cov was generated and the inactivated chimeric bivalent vaccine induced potent and specific neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov and h1n1pdm09 in balbc mice shehata et al 2019 the use of reverse genetics to construct recombinant vaccine strains could achieve a single immunization and prevent two diseasescoronaviruses generally exhibit restricted cell and tissue tropism which is dependent on the s glycoprotein of individual coronavirus strains millet and whittaker 2015 understanding the cell and tissue tropism of a virus is helpful to further research the pathogenesis of the virus and save vaccine production costs vaccines against ibv both live attenuated and inactivated are currently produced in embryonated hen eggs which is a cumbersome and expensive process because most ibv strains do not replicate in cultured cells previous studies have shown that the s2 subunit of the avirulent beaur strain is responsible for its extended cellular tropism for vero cells bickerton et al 2018b later recombinant ibvs with the immunogenic s1 subunit were derived from the ibv vaccine strain and the virulent field strain was generated using reverse genetics the recombinant ibvs are able to replicate in both primary chicken kidney and vero cells which would enable ibv vaccines to be grown in cell lines rather than expensive embryonated hen eggs bickerton et al 2018a moreover recombinant ibv with a mutant s2 site furin s2 site led to neurotropism cheng et al 2019 tgev has both enteric and respiratory tropism tgev s219a in the s protein was required to confer enteric tropism and a 6 nt insertion at position 1124 could increase virus stability and virus titers after passage in cell cultures sanchez et al 2019 the mhv amino acid lysine at 194 in the nsp1 protein can promote virus replication in the liver and this study further confirmed that nsp1 is a betacoronavirus virulence factor zhang et al 2015a recombinant coronavirus would efficiently express green fluorescent protein gfp which is commonly applied as a tool for high-throughput drug screens and neutralizing antibody assays feline coronavirus fcov is one of the most significant coronaviruses tissue culture-adapted type i fcov often loses pathogenicity which complicates research on type i fcov-induced feline infectious peritonitis fip therefore researchers established a recombinant reporter c3663 virus carrying the nanoluciferase nluc gene they examined the inhibitory effect of 68 compounds on c3663 replication in fcwf-4 cells and infectivity in a canine-derived cell line by using the reporter c3663 virus finally they successfully screened a canine cell line a72 that permitted fcov replication but with low efficiency and aberrant viral gene expression terada et al 2019coronaviruses have repeatedly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens the best-known examples include sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 chan et al 2020 all of which pose a marked threat to human health in addition four other coronaviruses are known to infect humans including hcov-229e hku-nl63 hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 which cause mild illnesses li et al 2020a yan et al 2020 bats are generally thought to be the natural reservoir of a range of coronaviruses graham et al 2013 some bat coronaviruses also have the potential to emerge in human populations letko et al 2020 and these include the sars-like virus shc014-cov in horseshoe bats menachery et al 2015 human coronaviruses likely originated from bats and then jumped into another amplification mammalian host before crossing species barriers to infect humans in addition to coronaviruses harming human health the new emergence of animal coronaviruses has been a threat to animal health in the past decade for example porcine enteric alphacoronavirus pedv and sads-cov tan et al 2020 zaki et al 2012 zhou et al 2018 to date there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these coronavirus infections an ideal live attenuated vaccine should replicate effectively in the host not causing diseases but stimulating enough protective immune responses without reverting to a virulent phenotypeone of the most promising applications of reverse genetics is to realize the development of live attenuated vaccines by mutating or deleting virulence-related genes to produce the ideal coronavirus vaccine strain through reverse genetics a deeper knowledge of the coronavirus-host interaction host immune responses and pathogen immune evasion strategies is needed for example host cell pathways affected during coronavirus infection need to be identified and these proteins of coronavirus suppressing the host innate immunity and the specific signaling pathway also need to be identified combining reverse genetics with metagenomics and structural biology can help characterize pre-emergent coronavirus populations allowing the field to make predictions about which zoonotic coronaviruses are likely to emerge prepare for future outbreaks and facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies against coronavirus infection johnson et al 2018 in addition effective broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are still needed hopefully live attenuated vaccines based on reverse genetics will be available in the near future and will prove to be highly effective tools against coronavirusesviral infections are sensed by the host innate immune system through toll-like receptors and retinoic acid-inducible gene-i-like receptors which trigger innate immune signal transduction leading to production of type i interferons ifns and hundreds of proinflammatory cytokines that suppress viral spread kawai and akira 2008 in return viruses have evolved at least three mechanisms to evade or antagonize host innate immunity one is blocking ifn induction host innate immunity is initiated by recognition of cellular rna sensors and viral rna which in turn interacts with the adaptor ips-1 to activate the ifn transcription factor irf-3 and nf-kb through kinases tbk-1ikki and ikk kawai and akira 2008 many viruses encode proteins to block the ifn induction pathway examples include the influenza a virus ns1 protein lu et al 1995 garcia-sastre 2001 the reovirus sigma3 protein jacobs and langland 1998 the ebola virus vp35 protein cardenas et al 2006 the poxvirus e3l protein xiang et al 2002 the herpes simplex virus us11 protein poppers et al 2000 and the murine cytomegalovirus m142 and m143 proteins valchanova et al 2006 the second mechanism is interfering with ifn-activated signaling mainly through interacting with the janus kinases jak-1 tyk-2 stat-1 and stat-2 to block the jak-stat signaling pathway examples include the ebola virus vp24 protein reid et al 2006 the paramyxovirus c and v proteins didcock et al 1999 gotoh et al 2003 and the rabies virus p protein brzozka et al 2006 the third method is inhibiting the specific antiviral proteins that mediate the antiviral state viral dsrna-binding proteins are mostly studied for their capability of preventing activation of pkr or the 25 oasrnasel system as demonstrated by the reovirus sigma3 imani and jacobs 1988 the herpesvirus us11 protein poppers et al 2000 the poxvirus e3l langland and jacobs 2004 the cytomegaloviruses dsrna-binding proteins hakki and geballe 2005 and the influenza virus ns1 protein min and krug 2006coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens that are divided into three groups based on serological criteria the group ii coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and mouse hepatitis coronavirus mhv encode a number of proteins that antagonize host innate immunity the orf 3b and orf 6 proteins inhibit both ifn synthesis and signaling kopecky-bromberg et al 2007 the nucleocapsid protein inhibits nfkb promoter and ifn synthesis kopecky-bromberg et al

2007 narayanan et al 2008 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr analysis revealed that sars-cov nsp1 has a novel -barrel structure mixed with -helixes almeida et al 2007 more recently sars-cov nsp1 was found to block host translational machinery function by binding to the ribosome small subunit kamitani et al 2009 these studies suggest that coronavirus nsp1 is a major virulence and pathogenicity factor kamitani et al 2006 wathelet et al 2007 zust et al 2007little is known about the biological function of group i coronavirus nsp1 proteins in this study we conducted a comparative study of nsp1 proteins from groups i and ii coronaviruses we compared models for nsp1 proteins of hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 with models of sars-cov we analyzed the interaction between nsp1 proteins and cellular proteins by co-immunoprecipitation co-ip finally we systematically investigated the mechanism by which group i coronavirus nsp1 proteins suppress host protein synthesis including in the innate immune

 the mrna levels for cell ifn- ifn- promoter-driven firefly luciferase or cmv promoter-driven renilla luciferase were inhibited by 052 ct values by nsp1 proteins from hcov-229e hcov-nl63 and sars-covsuppression of host protein synthesis by sars-cov nsp1 protein including in the innate immune system has been seen in several studies kamitani et al 2006 zust et al 2007 narayanan et al 2008 since the group i coronavirus nsp1 proteins also interact with the cellular translational machinery we examined the influence of hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 nsp1 proteins on host immune and non-immune protein synthesis luciferase reporter assays showed that synthesis of the innate immune promoter ifn-- and isg15-driven genes was suppressed by 520-folds in hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 nsp1-expressing 293 cells fig 4a synthesis of non-immune promoter-driven genes including for sv40 hsv-tk and cmv promoters was inhibited to a similar extent by the two group i coronavirus nsp1 proteins fig 4b in contrast sars-cov nsp1 suppressed promoter activity by only 35-folds by all assays fig 4 titration of the released ifn- proteins in cell supernatant by elisa revealed similar results the ifn- levels in coronavirus nsp1-expressing cells were 415-folds lower than in control cells fig 4cstudies on nsp1 proteins of group ii coronavirus sars-cov and mhv revealed a novel mechanism for interaction between host and viral proteins group i coronaviruses also encode nsp1 proteins of only about 110 amino acids with relatively high conservation within the group but with a high degree of polymorphism with sars-cov nsp1 which has 179 amino acids however the nmr analysis revealed that the segment from residue 13 to 128 of sars-cov nsp1 determined its core structure almeida et al 2007 and this corresponded to the overall length of the group i coronavirus nsp1 proteins therefore we built models for the nsp1 proteins of hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 two low-pathogenic group i human coronaviruses for comparison with nsp1 from the highly pathogenic sars-cov careful inspection of the sequence alignment showed that most of the structurally important hydrophobic residues are conserved or similar for nsp1 proteins from hcov-229e hcov-nl63 and sars-cov computational modeling demonstrated overall similarity in the three-dimensional nsp1 structures from the two group i coronavirus and sars-covbioinformatics suggest that group i coronavirus and sars-cov nsp1 proteins might have similar biological functions recent studies revealed that sars-cov nsp1 suppresses host protein synthesis by interacting with the ribosomal 40s subunit kamitani et al 2009 in this study we demonstrated that the group i coronavirus nsp1 proteins also bound to the ribosomal 40s subunit as shown by co-ip further analysis showed that activation of irf-3 was not affected but synthesis of host immune and non-immune proteins was potently suppressed by group i coronavirus nsp1 proteins it seemed that synthesis of these proteins was more strongly inhibited at translational level than transcriptional level these results indicate that group i coronaviruses have evolved a mechanism strikingly similar to sars-cov for antagonizing host cell proliferation and innate immunity using nsp1 our results are in general consistent to that of kamitani et al 2006 who firstly reported that sars-cov nsp1 inhibited ifn- mrna transcription and ifn- promoter-driven luciferase protein synthesis however in our study the inhibition of ifn- mrna transcription and luciferase protein synthesis was less strong than that reported by kamitani et al 2006 most probably due to different expression levels of nsp1 in their study the sars-cov nsp1 was driven by a chicken -actinrabbit -globin hybrid promoter ag promoter in pcaggs vector which is known for its robust expression in eukaryote cells in this study nsp1 was driven by a cmv promoter which was probably less efficient than the hybrid ag promotermost human coronaviruses are low-pathogenic viruses that often cause mild lower respiratory tract infections like common cold thiel and weber 2008 however sars-cov infection appears highly pathogenic and causes severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome characterized by the presence of diffuse alveolar damage weiss and navas-martin 2005 surprisingly few viral particles are isolated from lung tissues of sars-cov infected patients but levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are greatly elevated in the lung a hyperinflammatory response is presumed to be the key determinant of the high pathogenicity of sars-cov rather than rapid viral spread de lang et al 2009 the specific mechanism for sars-cov pathogenicity is not known but a number of viral coding proteins may be involved weiss and navas-martin 2005 the nsp1 protein of sars-cov is defined as a major pathogenicity factor kamitani et al 2006 wathelet et al 2007 however our results showed that the nsp1 proteins from low-pathogenic coronaviruses suppressed host protein synthesis more strongly than nsp1 from sars-cov indicating that the nsp1 protein is actually a virulence factor for facilitating viral spread but is not a major determinant in coronavirus pathogenicity although an engineered sars-cov with a mutated nsp1 was greatly attenuated in an animal model wathelet et al 2007 caution should be taken in developing this mutant virus as human vaccine because of the pathogenicity factors still present in the virionsars-cov and mhv fail to induce or induced only weak and delayed innate immune responses spiegel et al 2005 spiegel and weber 2006 roth-cross et al 2007 zhou and perlman 2007 the underlying mechanism for this phenomenom is not fully understood but nsp1 is proposed to be a major factor in the ability of the viruses to antagonize host innate immunity kamitani et al 2006 wathelet et al 2007 zust et al 2007 narayanan et al 2008 however surprisingly activation of host innate immunity and induction of type i ifn were observed for the group i coronavirus tgev la bonnardiere and laude 1981 charley and laude 1988 charley and lavenant 1990 we also found that group i coronaviruses hcov-229e steadily activated ifn transcription factors and infected cells produced robust ifn- unpublished data this study clearly showed that the hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 nsp1 proteins also potently suppressed host innate immune protein synthesis like nsp1 from sars-cov implying that group ii coronaviruses do not employ nsp1 to evade host innate immunity the mechanism underlying the different innate immune responses for the two groups of coronaviruses remains to be further investigatedcoronaviruses covs belong to the subfamily orthocoronavirinae in the family of coronaviridae in the order nidovirales and this subfamily including coronavirus coronavirus coronavirus and deltacoronavirus
1
 coronaviruses primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and mammals and in the last decades have shown to be capable of infecting humans as well
2
 the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 has demonstrated the lethality of coronaviruses when they cross the species barrier and infect humans
2
 sarscov and merscov all belong to the coronavirus family
3
 recently a novel flulike coronavirus covid19 related to the mers and sars coronaviruses was found at the end of 2019 in china
4
 
5
 and the evidence of humantohuman transmission was confirmed among close contacts
6
 the genome of covid19 is a singlestranded positivesense rna
7
 the sequence analysis showed that the covid19 possessed a typical genome structure of coronavirus and belonged to the cluster of coronaviruses including sarscov and merscov
7
 covid19 was more than 82 identical to those of sarscov
8
 
9
 covid19 may spread worldwide with the pandemic currently there is no registered treatment or vaccine for the disease in the absence of a specific treatment for this novel virus there is an urgent need to find an alternative solution to prevent and control the replication and spread of the virus we have done an online search on pubmed and web of science with the keywords of sars mers and coronaviruses we summarize and propose therapeutic options available for the treatment of this novel coronavirusesvitamin a is the first fatsoluble vitamin to be recognized and carotene is its plantderived precursor table 1 there are three active forms of vitamin a in the body retinol retinal and retinoic acid vitamin a is also called antiinfective vitamin and many of the bodys defenses against infection depend on an adequate supply researchers have believed that an impaired immune response is due to the deficiency of a particular nutritional element
10
 vitamin a deficiency is strongly involved in measles and diarrhea
11
 and measles can become severe in vitamin adeficient children in addition semba et al
12
 had reported that vitamin a supplementation reduced morbidity and mortality in different infectious diseases such as measles diarrheal disease measlesrelated pneumonia human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection and malaria vitamin a supplementation also offers some protection against the complications of other lifethreatening infections including malaria lung diseases and hiv
13
 jee et al
14
 had reported that low vitamin a diets might compromise the effectiveness of inactivated bovine coronavirus vaccines and render calves more susceptible to infectious disease the effect of infection with infectious bronchitis virus ibv a kind of coronaviruses was more pronounced in chickens fed a diet marginally deficient in vitamin a than in those fed a diet adequate in vitamin a
15
 the mechanism by which vitamin a and retinoids inhibit measles replication is upregulating elements of the innate immune response in uninfected bystander cells making them refractory to productive infection during subsequent rounds of viral replication
16
 therefore vitamin a could be a promising option for the treatment of this novel coronavirus and the prevention of lung infectionb vitamins are watersoluble vitamins and work as part of coenzymes each b vitamin has its special functions for example vitamin b2 riboflavin plays a role in the energy metabolism of all cells vitamin b2 deficiency had been suspected to occur among us elderly
17
 keil et al
18
 had reported that vitamin b2 and uv light effectively reduced the titer of merscov in human plasma products vitamin b3 also called nicotinamide could enhance the killing of staphylococcus aureus through a myeloidspecific transcription factor and vitamin b3 was efficacious in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings
19
 moreover vitamin b3 treatment significantly inhibited neutrophil infiltration into the lungs with a strong antiinflammatory effect during ventilatorinduced lung injury however it also paradoxically led to the development of significant hypoxemia
20
 vitamin b6 is also needed in protein metabolism and it participates in over 100 reactions in body tissues in addition it also plays important role in body immune function as well as shortage of b vitamins may weaken host immune response they should be supplemented to the virusinfected patients to enhance their immune system therefore b vitamins could be chosen as a basic option for the treatment of covid19vitamin c is another watersoluble vitamin and it is also called ascorbic acid which means noscurvy acid vitamin c is best known for its role in the synthesis of collagen in connective tissues and acts as an antioxidant vitamin c also supports immune functions and protects against infection caused by a coronavirus
21
 for example atherton et al
22
 had reported that vitamin c increased the resistance of chick embryo tracheal organ cultures to avian coronavirus infection vitamin c may also function as a weak antihistamine agent to provide relief from flulike symptoms such as sneezing a running or stuffy nose and swollen sinuses
23
 three human controlled trials had reported that there was significantly lower incidence of pneumonia in vitamin csupplemented groups suggesting that vitamin c might prevent the susceptibility to lower respiratory tract infections under certain conditions
24
 the covid19 had been reported to cause lower respiratory tract infection so vitamin c could be one of the effective choices for the treatment of covid19vitamin d is not only a nutrient but also a hormone which can be synthesized in our body with the help of sunlight in addition to its role in maintaining bone integrity it also stimulates the maturation of many cells including immune cells a high number of healthy adults have been reported to be with low levels of vitamin d mostly at the end of the winter season
25
 in addition people who are housebound or institutionalized and those who work at night may have vitamin d deficiency as do many elderly people who have limited exposure to sunlight
26
 the covid19 was first identified in winter of 2019 and mostly affected middleaged to elderly people the virusinfected people might have insufficient vitamin d in addition the decreased vitamin d status in calves had been reported to cause the infection of bovine coronavirus
27
 therefore vitamin d could work as another therapeutic option for the treatment of this novel virusvitamin e is a lipidsoluble vitamin and it includes both tocopherols and tocotrienols vitamin e plays an important role in reducing oxidative stress through binding to free radicals as an antioxidant
28
 vitamin e deficiency had been reported to intensify the myocardial injury of coxsackievirus b3 a kind of rna viruses infection in mice
29
 and increased the virulence of coxsackievirus b3 in mice due to vitamin e or selenium deficiency
30
 in addition the decreased vitamin e and d status in calves also caused the infection of bovine coronavirus
27

longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas are important mediators of inflammation and adaptive immune responses
31
 omega3 and omega6 pufas predominantly promote antiinflammatory and proinflammatory effects they are precursors of resolvinsprotectins and prostaglandinsleukotrienes respectively
31
 begin et al
32
 had studied plasma lipids levels in patients with aids and had found that a selective and specific lack of the longchain pufas of omega3 series which are found in high concentrations in fish oils in addition protectin d1 the omega3 pufaderived lipid mediator could markedly attenuate influenza virus replication via rna export machinery in addition treatment of protectin d1 with peramivir could completely rescue mice from flu mortality
33
 leu et al
34
 had found that several pufas also had antihepatitis c virus hcv activities therefore omega3 including protectin d1 which served as a novel antiviral drug could be considered for one of the potential interventions of this novel virus covid19selenium is an essential trace element for mammalian redox biology
35
 the nutritional status of the host plays a very important role in the defense against infectious diseases
36
 nutritional deficiency impacts not only the immune response but also the viral pathogen itself
10
 dietary selenium deficiency that causes oxidative stress in the host can alter a viral genome so that a normally benign or mildly pathogenic virus can become highly virulent in the deficient host under oxidative stress
10
 deficiency in selenium also induces not only impairment of host immune system but also rapid mutation of benign variants of rna viruses to virulence
37
 beck et al
38
 had reported that selenium deficiency could not only increase the pathology of an influenza virus infection but also drive changes in genome of coxsackievirus permitting an avirulent virus to acquire virulence due to genetic mutation
39
 it is because that selenium could assist a group of enzymes that in concert with vitamin e work to prevent the formation of free radicals and prevent oxidative damage to cells and tissues
37
 it was reported that synergistic effect of selenium with ginseng stemleaf saponins could induce immune response to a live bivalent infectious bronchitis coronavirus vaccine in chickens
40
 therefore selenium supplementation could be an effective choice for the treatment of this novel virus of covid19zinc is a dietary trace mineral and is important for the maintenance and development of immune cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system
41
 zinc deficiency results in dysfunction of both humoral and cellmediated immunity and increases susceptibility to infectious diseases
42
 zinc supplement given to zincdeficient children could reduce measlesrelated morbidity and mortality caused by lower respiratory tract infections
43
 increasing the concentration of intracellular zinc with zincionophores like pyrithione can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of rna viruses
44
 in addition the combination of zinc and pyrithione at low concentrations inhibits the replication of sars coronavirus sarscov
44
 therefore zinc supplement may have effect not only on covid19related symptom like diarrhea and lower respiratory tract infection but also on covid19 itselfiron is required for both host and pathogen and iron deficiency can impair host immunity while iron overload can cause oxidative stress to propagate harmful viral mutations
45
 iron deficiency has been reported as a risk factor for the development of recurrent acute respiratory tract infections
46

interferons ifns have divided into type i and type ii interferons as a member of type i ifn ifn is produced very quickly as part of the innate immune response to virus infection ifn inhibits the replication of animal and human coronaviruses
47
 
48
 the investigation in vitro also demonstrated that type i interferons including ifn could inhibit the replication of sarscov
49
 however interferon was reported not to possess antiviral activity against sars coronavirus
50
 kuri et al
51
 further reported that ifn transcription was blocked in tissue cells infected with sarscov and the cells were able to partially restore their innate immune responsiveness to sarscov after priming with small amounts of ifns moreover tan et al had tested the inhibition of sars coronavirus infection in vitro with clinically approved antiviral drugs they found that the complete inhibition of cytopathic effects of the virus was observed with specific subtypes 1b n1 n3 and human leukocyte interferon  in culture
52
 haagmans et al
54
 also reported in vivo that pegylated recombinant ifn2b a registered drug for chronic hepatitis c
53
 could protect type 1 pneumocytes against sars coronavirus infection in monkeys macaques the drug given at 3 days before infection could reduce viral replication and lung damage as compared with the control monkeys
55
 it was also considered as a candidate drug for sars therapy at that time and the effectiveness of synthetic recombinant ifn for the treatment of sars patients was demonstrated in a pilot clinical trial
56
 in addition interferons have also been found to be potent inhibitors of merscov replication
57
 moreover the combination of interferon2a with ribavirin was administered to patients with severe merscov infection and the survival of these patients was improved
57
 these findings suggest that these approved ifns could be also used for the treatment of this novel coronavirusintravenous gammaglobulin ivig was first developed in the late 1970s 
58
 and is probably the safest immunomodulating drug available for longterm use in all ages however it does have adverse reactions during the sars outbreak in 2003 ivig was used extensively in singapore however onethird of critically ill patients developed venous thromboembolism including pulmonary embolism despite the use of lowmolecular weight heparin prophylactic
59
 it was due to the iviginduced increase of viscosity in hypercoagulable states of sars patients
60

thymosin 1 ta1 is a thymic peptide hormone and it has a peculiar ability to restore the homeostasis of the immune system
61
 it is was first isolated from thymic tissue in the midsixties and it had gained much attention for its immunostimulatory activity
62
 it was chemically synthesized and used in diseases where the immune system was hindered or impaired
63
 besides its role in thymocyte development thymosin 1 could also increase resistance to glucocorticoidinduced death of the thymocyte
64
 thymosin 1 could also be used as immune enhancer to sars patients and it was effective in controlling the spread of the disease
65
 
66
 methylprednisolone was often used during the current treatment of covid19 and the side effect of corticoidinduced death of thymocytes should be considered so it is wise to use thymosin 1 before the administration of methylprednisolonethymopentin tp5 munox a synthetic pentapeptide corresponding to the active site of thymopoietin had been shown to restore antibody production in old mice
67
 additionally it could enhance the antibody response in humans when it was applied subcutaneously three times a week at doses of 50 mg
68
 moreover thymopentin could also be used as an adjuvant treatment for nonresponders or hyporesponders to hepatitis b vaccination
69

levamisole a synthetic lowmolecularweight compound is the first member of a new class of drugs that can increase the functions of cellular immunity in normal healthy laboratory animals
70
 however levamisole can act as either an immunostimulant agent or an immunosuppressive agent depending upon the dosing and the timing so its clinical use should be carefully taken joffe et al
71
 had reported that levamisole and ascorbic acid treatment in vitro could reverse the depressed helperinducer subpopulation of lymphocyte in measles therefore the use of levamisole could also be considered for the treatment of covid19cyclosporine a is a very important immunosuppressive drug and it has been widely used in transplantation the emerging use of cyclosporine a has greatly improved the survival rates of patients and grafts after solidorgan transplantation
72
 cyclosporine a is also used for the treatment of autoimmune disorders luo et al
73
 had speculated that nucleocapsid protein np of sarscov played an important role in the process of virus particle assembly and release and it might also bind to human cyclophilin a cyclophilin a is a key member of immunophilins acting as a cellular receptor for cyclosporine a
74
 cyclophilin a has played an important role in viral infection which either facilitates or inhibits their replication
74
 in addition the inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine a could block the replication of coronavirus of all genera including sarscov as well as avian infectious bronchitis virus
75
 therefore the nonimmunosuppressive derivatives of cyclosporine a might serve as broadrange coronavirus inhibitors applicable against the emerging novel viruslike covid19glycyrrhizin is an active component of liquorice roots in chinese medicine cinatl et al
76
 had reported that glycyrrhizin could inhibit the replication of sarsassociated virus in vitro and it had already been suggested as an alternative option for treatment of sars at that time baicalin another chinese herb is a flavonoid which is isolated from radix scutellaria baicalin was also found to have the ability to inhibit sarscov in vitro
50
 ginseng stemleaf saponins could highly enhance the specificantibody responses for newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus
40
 therefore chinese medicine could also be considered as a choice to enhance host immunity against the infection of covid19in summary the general treatment for viral infection including nutritional interventions and all kinds of immunoenhancers has been used to enhance host immunity against rna viral infections therefore they may also be used to fight covid19 infection by correcting the lymphopenia of patientscinanserin an old drug is wellknown for serotonin receptor antagonist it could inhibit the 3 chymotrypsinlike 3clike protease and was a promising inhibitor of replication of sarscov
78
 the 3clpro was also been found to be encoded in covid19
7
 therefore cinanserin may be a better choice for the treatment of covid19 infectionflavonoids are an important class of natural products and have several subgroups which include chalcones flavones flavonols and isoflavones
79
 flavonoids have many functions besides antioxidant effects and they also have antiviral abilities shimizu et al
80
 had found that flavonoids from pterogyne nitens could inhibit the entry of the hepatitis c virus jo et al
81
 had suggested that the anticoronavirus activity of some flavonoids herbacetin rhoifolin and pectolinarin was due to the inhibition of 3clike protease 3clpro other flavonoids herbacetin isobavachalcone quercetin 3dglucoside and helichrysetin were also found to be able to block the enzymatic activity of merscov3clpro
82
 moreover ryu et al
83
 had reported that biflavonoids from torreya nucifera also brought inhibition effect of sarscov3cl prodiarylheptanoids is a natural product and is extracted from the stem bark of alnus japonica it had been found to be able to inhibit papainlike protease of sarscov
77

therefore cinanserin together with flavonoids and other natural compounds could be chosen as alternative choices to fight covid19 infection through targeting coronaviral proteasessui et al had found one recombinant human monoclonal antibody mab singlechain variable region fragments scfvs 80r against the s1 domain of s protein of sarscov from two nonimmune human antibody libraries the mab could efficiently neutralize sarscov and inhibit syncytia formation between cells expressing the s protein and those expressing the sarscov receptor ace2
89

chloroquine is a 9aminoquinoline known since 1934 apart from its wellknown antimalarial effects the drug also has many interesting biochemical properties including antiviral effect in addition it had been used against viral infection
90
 moreover chloroquine was also found to be a potent inhibitor of sars coronavirus infection through interfering with ace2 one of cell surface binding sites for s protein of sarscov
91

emodin is an anthraquinone compound derived from genus rheum and polygonum and it is also a virucidal agent
92
 emodin could significantly block the interaction between the s protein of sarscov and ace2 therefore emodin might abolish sarscov infection by competing for the binding site of s protein with ace2
93

promazine antipsychotic drug shares a similar structure with emodin it has been found to exhibit a significant effect in inhibiting the replication of sarscov
94
 as compared to emodin promazine exhibited potent inhibition of the binding of s protein to ace2 these findings suggested that emodin and promazine might be able to inhibit sarscov infectivity through blocking the interaction of s protein and ace2
93
 therefore the monoclonal antibody scfv80r chloroquine emodin and promazine could be used as alternative choices for the treatment of covid19nicotianamine is an important metal ligand in plants
95
 and it is found a novel angiotensinconverting enzyme2 inhibitor in soybean
96
 so it is another potential option to be used to reduce the infection of covid19ribavirin a broadspectrum antiviral agent is routinely used to treat hepatitis c table 3 during the outbreak of sars ribavirin was used extensively for most cases with or without concomitant use of steroids in hong kong
97
 however there was considerable skepticism from overseas and local experts on the efficacy of ribavirin
98
 because there was a report mentioned that ribavirin had no significant activity against sarscov in vitro
52
 and the use of ribavirin was found to be associated with significant toxicity including hemolysis in 76 and decrease in hemoglobin in 49
99
 however morgenstern et al
49
 had reported that ribavirin and interferon synergistically inhibited the replication of sarsassociated coronavirus in animal and human cell lines in view of adverse reactions and the lack of in vitro efficacy the use of ribavirin should be seriously considered for the treatment of covid19 even in combination with other antiviral drugsthe combination of lopinavir with ritonavir is widely used as a boosted protease inhibitor in the treatment of hiv infection
100
 lopinavir lpv is usually combined with ritonavir rtv to increase lopinavir halflife through the inhibition of cytochrome p450
101
 chu et al
102
 had found that the use of lpvrtv with ribavirin in the treatment of sars was associated with a better outcome kim et al
103
 had also reported a successful case of merscov disease treated with triple combination therapy lpvrtv ribavirin and ifn2a in south korea regarding this novel virus covid19 kims triple combination therapy should be considered as an option at the early stage of the diseaseremdesivir rdv a nucleoside analog gs5734 had been reported to inhibit human and zoonotic coronavirus in vitro and to restrain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov in vivo
104
 recently the antiviral activity of rdv and ifn was found to be superior to that of lpvrtvifn against merscov in vitro and in vivo
101
 in addition rdv could improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral loads and severe lung pathology in mice which was impossible for lpvrtvifn
101
 recently a first covid19infected case was reported in the united states and the use of remdesivir was administered when the patients clinical status was getting worse
105
 therefore the use of rdv with ifn could be a better choice for the treatment of covid19 comparing with that of the triple combination of lpvrtvifn however randomized and controlled trials are still needed to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivirnelfinavir is a selective inhibitor of hiv protease which is responsible for posttranslational processing of hiv propeptides
106
 yamamoto et al
107
 had found that nelfinavir could strongly inhibit the replication of sarscov therefore nelfinavir could also be an option for the treatment of covid19arbidol arb is a russianmade small indolederivative molecule and is licensed in russia and china for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza and other respiratory viral infections
108
 arbidol had been found to be able to block viral fusion against influenza a and b viruses as well as hepatitis c virus
109
 arbidol could also inhibit hepatitis c virus by blocking hepatitis c virus entry and replication in vitro
110
 in addition arbidol and its derivatives arbidol mesylate had been reported to have antiviral activity against the pathogen of sars in the cell cultures and arbidol mesylate was nearly 5 times as effective as arbidol in reducing the reproduction of sars virus in the cultured cells
111

nitric oxide no is a gas with diverse biological activities and is produced from arginine by no synthases no is able to interact with superoxide forming peroxynitrite which in turn can mediate bactericidal or cytotoxic reactions
112
 in addition no had played an important role in regulating airway function and in treating inflammatory airway diseases
113
 rossaint et al
114
 reported that the beneficial effects of no inhalation could be observed in most patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome no was also found to inhibit the synthesis of viral protein and rna
115
 moreover akerstrm et al
116
 had reported that organic no donor snitrosonacetylpenicillamine could significantly inhibit the replication cycle of sarscov in a concentrationdependent manner therefore the no inhalation could be also chosen as an option for the treatment of severely covid19 infected patientslipoic acid ala a naturally occurring disulfide compound acts as a cellular coenzyme and has been applied for the treatment of polyneuropathies and hepatic disorders for years table 3
117
 ala as an antioxidant has played a pivotal role in scavenging free radicals to protect against oxidative damage in several diseases
118
 in addition ala also had its capability to enhance intracellular glutathione gsh levels
118
 and to normalize the oxidative stress induced by dexamethasone in chicken
119
 wu et al
120
 also reported that the oxidative stress in host cells was an important factor in the infectivity of human coronavirus 229e and the glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd deficiency was another factor that enhanced human coronavirus 229e infection the addition of lipoic acid to g6pdknockdown cells could attenuate the increased susceptibility to human coronavirus 229e infection
120
 interestingly baur et al
121
 also found that lipoic acid was effective to inhibit the replication of hiv1 in summary we speculate that ala could be also used as an optional therapy for this new virusfemales generally mount more robust immune responses to viral challenges than males which can result in more efficient virus clearance
122
 epidemiological studies showed that males experiencing a higher rate of incidence and case fatality compared with females after sarscov infection
123
 
124
 during the mers outbreak the disease occurrence rate in men was almost twice as much as in women and the case fatality rate was the same as the occurrence rate among men and women
125
 in addition channappanavar et al had reported that male mice were more susceptible to sarscov infection compared with agematched female mice however the mortality was increased in female mice when the ovariectomy was done or the estrogen receptor antagonist was given
126
 wei et al
127
 also found that serum levels of prolactin folliclestimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone of sars patients were significantly higher than those of control groups while estradiol e2 pregnancy hormone and thyroidstimulating hormone were considerably lower than those of normal controls interestingly estrogenic compounds had been found to reduce influenza a virus replication in primary human nasal epithelial cells derived from female but not male donors
128
 in addition resveratrol a phytoestrogen from grape seeds and red wine had been reported to be a potent antimers agent in vitro
129
 therefore 17estradiol or phytoestrogen could also be an alternative option to be considered for the treatment of covid19mucroporinm1 is a scorpion venomderived peptide and has broadspectrum virucidal activity against many viruses including measles influenza h5n1 viruses and sarscov
130
 therefore this peptide could also be used for the treatment of covid19 infection as well as the new drug design to target covid19in this review we summarize all the potential interventions for covid19 infection according to previous treatments of sars and mers we have found that the general treatments are very important to enhance host immune response against rna viral infection the immune response has often been shown to be weakened by inadequate nutrition in many model systems as well as in human studies however the nutritional status of the host until recently has not been considered as a contributing factor to the emergence of viral infectious diseases therefore we propose to verify the nutritional status of covid19 infected patients before the administration of general treatments in addition we also found coronavirusspecific treatments and antiviral treatments were very useful for the treatment of sars and mers they should also be considered as potential treatments for covid19 infection the other compounds should also be chosen as alternative options for the treatment as well as new drug designsto complete the eradication of virus infection the covid19related vaccines are warranted the vaccine development for sars had already attracted the attention of many scientists in the past avian ibv is similar to sarscov and both viruses belong to coronavirus ibv is in group 3 and sars belongs to group 4
131
 bijlenga et al
55
 had suggested that avian live virus ibv vaccine strain h be used to treat sars in 2005 however preliminary tests in monkeys should be taken before the startup interestingly children are seldom attacked by covid19 as well as sarscov it may be due to the required vaccine program for every child the rnavirus vaccines and the adjuvants in vaccine programs may help children escape from the infection therefore the rnavirusrelated vaccines including measles mev polio japanese encephalitis virus influenza virus and rabiesrelated vaccines could be used as the most promising alternative choices to prevent humantohuman transmission through immunizing health care workers and noninfected population as wellrecombinant measles vaccine expressing s protein of sars and mers were also tried by many researchers escriou et al
132
 had generated liveattenuated recombinant measles vaccine candidates expressing the membraneanchored s protein of sarscov sarscovsvaccine and they had found that the vaccine could induce highest titers of neutralizing antibodies and protected immunized animals from intranasal infectious challenge with sarscov bodmer et al
133
 had reported that two liveattenuated measles virus vaccines either expressing s protein or n protein of merscov could induce robust and multifunctional t cell responses in the mouse model frantz et al
134
 also mentioned that recombinant measles vaccine could induce stronger and t helper 1biased responsesregarding shortterm protection and prevention of viral infection passive immunotherapy should not be neglected
135
 monoclonal antibody therapy is one of the best forms of passive immunotherapy a human igg1 mab cr3014 had been generated and it had been found to be reactive with whole inactivated sars coronavirus in addition cr3014 could be used as prophylaxis for sars coronavirus infection in ferrets
136
 however cr3014 was found to be able to block the interaction in parent sarscov strain but not in escape variants this led to the ineffectiveness of cr3014 to prevent infection in humans cr3022 was another monoclonal antibody and it had been found to neutralize cr3014 escape viruses
136
 the combination of cr3014 and cr3022 had also been reported to have the potential to control immune escape
135
 however the clinical trial of cr3022 with cr3014 had never been tried due to the high cost of manufacturingconvalescent plasma can also be called passive immunotherapy it is usually chosen when there are no specific vaccines or drugs available for emerging infectionrelated diseases
137
 arabi et al had tested the feasibility of convalescent plasma therapy as well as its safety and clinical efficacy in critically ill mers patients they found that convalescent plasma had an immunotherapeutic potential for the treatment of merscov infection
138
 in addition convalescent plasma from recovered sars patients had also been reported to be useful clinically for treating other sars patients
139
 
140
 importantly the use of convalescent plasma or serum was also suggested by the world health organization under blood regulators network when vaccines and antiviral drugs were unavailable for an emerging virus in summary these findings suggest that the current childrens rnavirusrelated vaccines are the best alternative methods to be used to vaccinate the uninfected people and health care workers convalescent plasma should be routinely used for the treatment of covid19 infected critically sick patients if it is available the avian ibv vaccine is also another choice for clinical trials if its safety has been approved in monkeys therefore we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging covid19 if the infection is uncontrollablethe authors declare that there are no conflict of intereststowards the end of the first decade of the 21st century during december 2019 numerous pneumonia incidences of unidentified cause appeared in wuhan hubei china with clinical presentations greatly resembling flu and viral pneumonia after virus isolation and analysis of viral genome sequence from infected patients samples a novel coronavirus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 or sars-cov-2 initially designated as novel coronavirus or ncov-2019 was identified from an unknown source sars-cov-2 is the causative agent of respiratory disease which is recently named as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organisation who human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 is a major concern for the health care workers and a preliminary r0 reproductive number as the number of new infection one infected person generates on average throughout its infectious period measure of 1425 was reported by the who httpswwwwhointhealth-topicscoronavirus since its appearance within a months time enormous number of new cases are piling up and the actual r0 value may be quite higher than previously calculated wu et al 2020 epidemiological data suggest that approximately as of february 29 2020 79251 people infected with this virus in mainland china and multiple cases also reported from other parts of the world httpswhosprinklrcomhttpswwwmedpagetodaycominfectiousdiseasepublichealth84698 so far 60 other countries reported sars-cov-2 infection although most of the cases are migrants of china indicating a single introduction of this virus among the other countries south korea 3150 cases italy 889 cases japan 234 cases iran 388 cases singapore 96 cases hongkong 94 cases and usa 64 cases reported significant number of cases and the situation is getting complicated with time current findings indicate that various subtypes of coronaviruses are in circulation within the bat population including other species such as birds cats dogs pigs mice horses whales before they acquire the ability to cross the species barriers to cause human infection it is still unanswered that how sars-cov-2 has caused an outbreak in wuhan the initial wave of infection found associated with the seafood market of wuhan strengthening the hypothesis that close contact between the live or dead animal with an individual may be responsible for the initiation of the outbreak in the recent past there are examples of zoonotic transmission of bird flu which directly jumped from avian species to human but no transmission between the humans were established which kept the disease under control however the ability to spread among human to human upon close contact makes sars-cov-2 as a very important contagious agent to study and monitor whose devastation has already been established in wuhan hubei chinacovid-19 is one of the most alarming diseases in the globe at this moment the number of patients infected with sars-cov-2 is increasing in almost steady rate although in some days less number of cases was reported total number of cases reached to 20000 in first 12 days 40000 in next 7 days and more than 80000 in just 33 days infections are causing varied clinical manifestation from mild symptoms to severe respiratory attacks although there is possibility of asymptomatic infection it has spread in many other countries beyond china therefore proper handling and management of the disease is critically important to prevent a pandemichistory has taught several lessons regarding the endemic nature of emerging viral infections virus faces major challenges from pre-existing immunity to remain in the population other important factors such as case fatality rate cfr r0 and the reservoir hosts are crucial in influencing viral endemicity by analysing cfr of different rna viruses and their longevity in circulation throughout the globe it was found that viruses with higher cfr cfr 5 die out after few passages of infections sooner or later whereas viruses with low cfr remain endemic with a seasonal outbreak like common flu caused by influenza viruses figure 1 although it is very difficult to calculate actual cfr until the outbreak ends an initial estimate suggests that cfr for sars-cov-2 is 258 much closer to seasonal flu than the other coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov of the recent past ie 10 and 35 respectively httpswwwwhointemergenciesmers-coven indicating the ability of the sars-cov-2 to remain in circulation with low cfr throughout the world as per the recent data covid-19 has already claimed 2924 lives mainly in china although few deaths reported from other parts of the world however as of february 29 2020 39556 infected individuals already recovered from sars-cov2 infection who will eventually acquire immunity to the virus httpswwwmedpagetodaycominfectiousdiseasepublichealth84698 the covid-19 recovered population increases day by day with herd immunity of the population a virus may re-infect a person with pre-existing immunity either in its present form which is very unlikely or with acquired mutations to persist in the circulation sars-cov-2 recovered populations may enable the selection of mutant viruses and their spread in the communityin this review we will discuss the critical factors influencing the continued viral appearance and periodical infection we will also discuss the novelty of this virus and its potential threat to cause periodic infection we have collected data from different studies and also analysed the genome sequence to define the evolutionary relationship of this virus moreover we have predicted the reason for the severity of this disease with literature supportcoronaviruses are enveloped and belongs to the family coronaviridae which is further subdivided into four genera alpha beta gamma and delta coronaviruses woo et al 2007 lefkowitz et al 2018 they possess a long positive-sense single-stranded rna genome ranging between 264 kb to 317 kb which is largest for any rna virus big rna genome of coronavirus provides additional flexible power in host adaptation and genome modification the genome organisation is overall same in all coronaviruses figure 2 two short untranslated regions utr are present at the 5 and 3 end of the genome and the coding genes are present in between the utr the arrangement of the coding gene is 5-replicase orf1ab spike s envelope e membrane m nucleocapsid n3 however variable numbers of additional orfs are present in between spike and nucleocapsid genes in different strains of coronaviruses the transcription regulatory motif trs is present at the 3 end of the genome which plays an important role in rna replication and recombination lai et al 1985the complete genome size of the sars-cov-2 is approximately 29 kb 29825 nt-29903ntthe orf1ab gene is the largest gene segment of the coronavirus and it constitutes two orf ie orf1a and orf1b the position of the orf1ab gene in sars-cov-2 251-21541 nt slightly changes to starting codon position as compared to sars-cov 265-21486 nt and mers-cov 279-21514 generally a slippery sequence uuuaaac followed by a putative pseudoknot structure sequence is present in between the orfs the replicase orf1ab is cleaved by papain-like protease plpro and 3 c-like protease 3clpro the orf1ab gene of the coronavirus genome encodes1516 non-structural proteins nsp at the consensus cleavage site the nsp 12 and nsp 13 encode the rna-dependent rna polymerase and helicase protein respectively the newly emerging sars-cov-2 possesses a single point mutation at a slippery sequence a haemagglutinin esterase he gene is present downstream to orf1ab and upstream to the s gene which is absent in coronaviruses infecting humansthree surface glycoproteins are found in all classes of coronaviruses ie spike s envelope e and membrane m the s proteins are type i membrane glycoproteins responsible for the formation of spikes present on the surface of coronaviruses the s proteins are cleaved into the receptor binding s1 domain and cell membrane fusion s2 domains the sars-cov-2 s2 domain represents higher identity with bat derived coronavirus strains than the s1 domain therefore the receptor-binding domain of sars-cov-2 is more similar to that of sars-cov 2002-03 and it has found that it uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as cellular receptor lu et al 2020 however some key amino acid substitution at positions 439 501 493 485 and 486 were observed in the sars-cov-2 receptor-binding domain those were thought to be important in sars-cov lu et al 2020 the e and m genes are conserved among all the coronaviruses these two genes encode two small transmembrane proteins associated with the envelope of all coronavirusesthe coronavirus nucleocapsid n protein is a virion structural protein the n protein interacts with the viral genomic rna and helps in packaging of rna genome into virus particles by recognising a specific sequence the n protein-dependent assembly of the viral rna packaging signal is already established in sars-cov intracellular co-localization of n with replicase components is required for rna synthesis variable numbers of small orfs are present between the various conserved genes downstream to the n gene the 3a protein of sars-cov modulates virus release by forming a transmembrane homotetramer complex within channel protein other than the virus release the 3a protein helps in sars-cov-induced cell death golgi fragmentation and the accumulation of intracellular vesicles like the sars-cov and mers-cov the sars-cov-2 virus possesses several other small orfs orf9 orf13 orf14 orf10 at the downstream to n gene marra et al 2003 the function of the n gene and small orfs of sars-cov-2 is not yet knownbefore the emergence of sars-cov in 2002 construction of phylogenetic tree for coronaviruses based on the pol or n gene was a standard practice using this method initially sars-cov was proposed as a member of gammacoronavirus marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 however further analysis of the amino-terminal domain of the spike protein of the sars-cov revealed that 19 out of the 20 cysteine residues was spatially conserved within the betacoronavirus group rota et al 2003 on the other hand only five residues were found conserved within the alphacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus group rota et al 2003 furthermore the subsequent whole genome-based phylogenetic analysis concluded that sars-cov is a member of the betacoronavirus lineage phylogenetic analysis based on rdrp gene of sars-cov-2 revealed that it belongs to the genus betacoronavirus eickmann 2003we have constructed a phylogenetic tree of the sars-cov-2 based on available sequences in genbank and gisaid data bank figure 3 phylogenetic analysis based on the spike gene of the sars-cov-2 represents that it belongs to the genus betacoronaviruses from the analysis of the sequences published since the emergence of sars-cov-2 it is evident that this virus is stably spreading without any noticeable mutation as they are clustered in a single group analysis from the phylogenetic tree represents that all the sars-cov-2 strains are distinctly separated from previously reported coronavirus endemic strains sars-cov and mers-cov hence the sars-cov-2 is termed as novel coronavirus analysis performed in our study also revealed that this virus is very similar to the bat derived coronavirus strain the sars-cov-2 and bat derived yunnanratg132013 coronavirus strain derived from common ancestor although they differs in in the size of the spike genes spike gene size in ratg133809 bp sars-cov-23822bp since sars-cov and mers-cov also derived from the bat bat originated human infecting coronavirus strain is not a novel event as shown in earlier studies that sars-cov and mers-cov used civets and camel respectively as an intermediate host to gain infection potentiality towards human guan et al 2003 alagaili et al 2014 it may be predicted that in case of sars-cov-2 transmission there may be one or more intermediate host present in between bats and humanprevious cases of human coronavirus infection commenced by sars-cov and mers-cov was accountable for severe pneumonia leading to high mortality the mechanistic explanation of their high morbidity and mortality is inadequately explained rapid virus replication reaching to high titres and associated enhanced inflammation is believed to be a cause of disease severity initial data from china shows that the sars-cov-2 produced observable symptoms primarily ards acute respiratory distress syndrome in elderly populations similar to human cases of h7n9 infection in china table 1 an earlier study with h7n9 infection also found the clinical exhibition of disease with high fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics chen et al 2013 a recent study on sars-cov-2 infection showed that all the 41 patients had pneumonia and manifestations of a critical respiratory ailment similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus and was associated with icu admission and high mortality huang et al 2020it is known that coronaviruses such as human sars-cov and bat sars-like cov sl-covzxc21 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as their receptor and recent reports suggest that sars-cov-2 also uses the identical receptor for entry into the host cell zhou et al 2020 ace2 is an essential enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system ras that plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure and maintaining electrolyte and fluid homeostasis ace2 also protects an individual against severe acute lung damage that can be triggered by sepsis acid aspiration severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the lethal avian influenza a h5n1 and h7n9 virus infection kuba et al 2005 yang et al 2014 zou et al 2014 moreover recent studies have shown that ace2 negatively regulates inflammatory responses during bacterial or viral infections yang et al 2014 sodhi et al 2019 sars-cov-2 infection utilizes ace2 for viral attachment and subsequent entry into cytosol therefore rapid replication of sars-cov-2 may reduce the surface expression of ace2 in the lung tissue which may cause further intensification of the inflammation and severity of the disease pathology glowacka et al 2010 figure 4 a recent study have found that smoking is associated with higher expression of ace2 when compared with the non-smokers which may be one of the reasons of some population for the vulnerability towards novel sars-cov-2 infection liu et al 2017 cai 2020the pathophysiology of disease outcome depends on the extent of inflammatory responses within the host in absence of any specific antiviral drugs the primary therapeutic strategy to treat sars-cov-2 infection should be managing the inflammatory responses with anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids previous studies on sars patients have found a positive outcome when treated with corticosteroids chen et al 2006 who recommendations for managing this novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 infection discourage the application of corticosteroids the explanation for not using corticosteroids could be delayed viral clearance from the respiratory tract or blood with other corticosteroid-induced complications in the treated patients previously infected with sars and mers lee et al 2004 arabi et al 2018 russel et al 2020 during the pandemic in 2009 of influenza a infection a prospective cohort study showed reduced mortality in patients with h1n1 pdm09 viral pneumonia when treated with mild doses of corticosteroid li et al 2017 therefore these disparities in findings suggest that randomized controlled trials must be carried out to conclude the beneficial effect of corticosteroid medication in coronavirus-induced inflammation associated difficulties however doctors from the chinese thoracic society have recommended the application of corticosteroids to critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia with a low to moderate dose 051 mgkg per day methylprednisolone or equivalent for short term 7 days zhao et al 2020viruses face potent challenges from the host pre-existing immunity before they establish periodical infection the role of pre-existing immunity broadly studied for influenza virus infection biswas et al 2020 host immunity also allows the selection of mutant viruses to cause a new round of infection within the host with pre-existing immunity towards the earlier strains if the sars-cov-2 can withstand the new mutations and remains flexible to infect its host towards disease progression it will persist in circulation the primary wave of sars-cov-2 infection is under progress at present the majority of the exposed population will acquire some immunity eventually and the real hurdles for the viruses to defeat or bypass existing immunity will reflect with the acquired mutations within the virus in future to defeat host immunity viruses must mutate without losing their infectivity so far there are no published data regarding infection ability of sars-cov-2 and their mutation potential under robust immunological selection pressure within the host previous data from sars-cov and mers-cov infected individuals indicated that antibody response tends to be short-lived but remain longer depending on the severity of the infection t cell responses often target highly conserved internal proteins and are long-lived channappanavar et al 2014 alshukairi et al 2016 sars-cov-specific memory t cells but not memory b cells or antibody could be detected six years after infection in sars survivors tang et al 2011 in conclusion these studies present some ideas regarding selection pressure from the host immunity ie milder coronavirus infection may produce a short-lived humoral immune response as of february 29 2020 sars-cov-2 infected 85406 people and the infection turns into fatality for more than 2924 cases however as per the available data 39561 individual got recovered after infection percent recovery from this population indicates that  93 of the population already recovered from sars-cov2 infection this percentage was calculated as below within infected population total no recoveredtotal no of recovered  total no of death it can be predicted that at least 93 of the total population which may likely to go higher with the end of this outbreak will develop immunity towards this novel virus so far there is no vaccine available although in future vaccinated individual will also acquire some immunity the possibility of the future outbreak by sars-cov-2 will depend on the longevity of host immunity and bypassing of existing or pre-existing immunity by the mutant virus figure 5the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases critically depend on reservoir hosts which can sustain the pathogen with a moderate or asymptomatic infection in the population even in the presence of resistance from primary hosts coronaviruses are found widely within bat pig cow and several other species previous reports also suggest that this virus is also presents in birds molecular phylogenetic analysis performed in this study showed that neighbouring virus to sars-cov-2 was from bats with 96 similarity suggesting novelty of sars-cov-2 we dont know how this virus mutated and its time frame however recent estimates with bedfords analysis predicted that sars-cov-2 and ratg13 derived from a common ancestor sometimes between 25 and 65 years ago httpswwwsciencemagorgnews202001mining-coronavirus-genomes-clues-outbreak-s-origins these observations are indicative of the existence of intermediate host or reservoir before the sars-cov-2 gained entry into the human population figure 4 it is utmost important to find out its intermediate host to control the ongoing and future outbreakbased on the gene bank data apart from the lung and oropharyngeal fluid this virus also isolated from faces and blood this observation represents that sars-cov-2 transmitted through droplet and human to human might be through the orofecal route but immune-pathogenesis of this novel virus is probably different from the previous endemic strain of coronaviruses the faecal oral route is very common in birds for transmission of avian viruses migratory birds play a very important role in the dissemination of avian influenza viruses from different parts of the globe during seasonal migrations bailey et al 2018 coronaviruses such as human sars-cov and bat sars-like cov sl-covzxc21 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as their receptor and recent reports suggest that sars-cov-2 also uses the same receptor for entry into the host cell we have compared the ace2 gene from avian species and the data suggest conservation of amino acids of ace2 protein within most of the birds data not shown we examined the interacting residues of the receptor-binding domain rbd of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 with critical residues of ace2 from different species from human poultry gallus gallus mallard anasplatyrhynchos swan goose ansercygnoidesdomesticus shelduck tadornacana and we found limited amino acids conservation in comparison to human counterpart table 2 moreover there is no experimental proof for betacoronavirus like sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection in the birds although a recent study has shown the significant presence of alpha and gammacoronaviruses in ducks shorebirds and herons in australia chamings et al 2018 these observations allow us to believe that the birds are less prone to betacoronavirus infection or the least chance of bird infection from betacoronaviruses significantly the bird poses alpha and gammacoronaviruses that are incompetent to infect a human hence the risks of spread of the sars-cov-2 through bird to human are very unlikely at its present form qinghai lake in china is one of the biggest breeding sites for different migratory bird species there may be a possibility that this novel virus may acquire the ability to infect other animals including the migratory birds therefore it is extremely important to find out the reservoir of this novel coronavirus within the other animals including the migratory birds if there are any figure 6one of the most worrying things about any outbreak is the spreading of viruses from mild or asymptomatic individuals which is probably happening in case of sars-cov-2 infection if this trend continues then the virus may establish itself in the population and quarantine will be very difficult to stop the virus spread phylogenetic analysis based on the spike gene nucleotide sequence performed in this study has shown that all the sars-cov-2 sequences are forming a single cluster without any branching indicating sars-cov-2 conservation throughout this ongoing outbreak earlier studies have shown that spike protein was a target of a robust humoral immune response in case of sars or mers viral infection these findings advocate that virus that caused the initial outbreak of sars-cov-2 is still in circulation without any major changes very little or absence of pre-existing immunity in the community or selection pressure within the population probably allowed sars-cov-2 to remain in circulation in its original form moreover sars-cov-2 has very limited cfr as opposed to sars-cov and mers-cov without killing its host table 1 will able to produce new virus particles alongside some mutations till now most of the deaths have occurred in the elderly population due to novel coronavirus infection whereas children and young adults exhibit relatively milder disease therefore sars-cov-2 infection will enable the host to develop humoral and cell-mediated immunity and simultaneously the immune selected viruses may acquire mutations with higher infection potential or altered antigenicity this will likely empower them to evade pre-existing immunity towards their predecessor counterpart in the host during the subsequent waves of infection as depicted in figure 1 current estimates based on the available information suggest that more than 93 individual have recovered from this novel coronavirus infections the virus may adapt itself to produce infection within the recovered population in future to sustain its presence in the environment the ability of the virus to cause infection in the host with pre-existing immunity will be the most important criteria to establish itself in the circulation the recovered population may keep under monitor to find if any reinfection leads to the creation of any mutant strain due to the selection pressure therefore we must prepare ourselves for mutant strains of this novel virus to avoid future devastationsince there is no antiviral and vaccine to fight against sars cov-2 a vaccine or therapeutics is a primary need at this moment currently several companies have started preparing vaccines for this novel virus although efficacy will depend on the selection of antigen and the viruss ability to bypass the vaccine-induced immunity we must look at the conservation among different epitopes in immune selected strains while choosing the right vaccine candidates structurally spike protein carries rbd like haemagglutinin ha of the influenza virus with a similar function we must look at the amino acid conservation in different domain of the spike protein mutation in the immune dominance region of the vaccine candidate will make them ineffective for future outbreaks recently physicians from china are urging recovered patients to donate plasma which may be useful to protect covid-19 something like a 100 years old practice during 1918 flu in case of pandemic 1918 influenza infection three waves of infection killed more than 50 million worldwide in two years where the second wave was the most devastating the first wave of the 1918 flu pandemic flu had resembled common flu epidemics people most at risk were the weak and elderly while younger healthier people recovered easily apparently resembling covid-19 in its present form most of the studies have found an analogy between covid-19 and influenza disease pathophysiology time will tell us whether sars-cov-2 and associated covid-19 will be established as the new flu of 21st centurysevere acute respiratory syndrome sars is a recently discovered viral disease characterized by fever cough acute fibrinous pneumonia and high infectivity chang 2005 outbreaks of sars during 2003 caused concern around the world as a serious health threat comprehensive prevention and treatment measures were taken internationally while at the same time research on the sars coronavirus and development of a vaccine therapeutic drugs and biological products was commenced immediately research has been successful and considerable progress has been made in all of these fields chow et al 2003analyses of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the sars coronavirus demonstrated that it did not belong to any of the three known subgroups of coronaviruses and therefore was identified as a new kind of coronavirus wang and ding 2003 recent progress has been made in production of biological products against sars as high-titer human antiserum against sars coronavirus has been found to be capable of inhibiting the multiplication of the sars virus the prospect of confirming passive immunity against sars for infected patients and for non-infected individuals at risk is feasiblepassive immunization and short-term protection with high antibody titers has historically been an effective way to combat fulminating infectious disease during the outbreak of sars in china in 2003 some positive results were achieved by passive immunization when the sera of recovered sars patients were used no adverse reactions were observed in the first vaccinated volunteers in order to provide new and effective passive immunization against sars basic studies on the sars coronavirus antibody should be carried out these studies should include searching for better antibody sources increasing output and improving techniques of production and purification in this study we have successfully immunized specific pathogen-free spf chickens and then purified a high-titer anti-sars coronavirus yolk immunoglobulin igy with neutralizing activity against sars coronavirussars coronavirus antigen was prepared using sars virus strain bj01 and kindly provided by the chinese academy of military medical sciences beijing china the virus culture was inactivated by -propiolactone and purified on a sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously yin and liu 1997 thirty 17-week-old spf leghorn hens were provided by the experimental animal center of the harbin veterinary research institute the chinese academy of agricultural sciences harbin china chickens were immunized by injecting 018 mg of sars coronavirus antigen into the pectoral muscle the second and third booster injections of 030 mg antigen were administered 2 and 4 weeks later blood was harvested before and after each immunization and eggs were harvested when they became available the isolation of igy from individual eggs was performed using the protocol described by akita and nakai 1993 briefly the egg white was separated from the egg yolk and discarded the yolk was mixed vigorously with sterilized water and left standing overnight at 4 c the mixture was then centrifuged at 1200  
g at 4 c for 30 min and the supernatant was purified by chromatography the protein concentration in harvested eluate was measured by thin-layer gel scan the recovery rate of crude protein before chromatography was found to be 56 while the purity was 92 after chromatography the eluate was subjected to analysis by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds-page and western blot the isolated igy had a high purity as confirmed by sds-page and purified igy had good biological activity as confirmed by western blot the activity of igy in sera and yolks diluted at 1200 in phosphate buffer saline pbs from immunized animals was assessed using an indirect elisa assay as described previously huang et al 2005 fig 1
 after immunization of spf chickens with sars coronavirus antigen there were no detectable antibodies against sars coronavirus in the yolks of eggs laid in the first 3 weeks after the first immunization the production of anti-sarsv antibody in yolks was found to commence 2 weeks after the igy was produced in seruman igy-neutralizing virus assay was performed in laminar-flow safety cabinets briefly serially diluted samples of the igy were incubated with 200 tcid50 of sars coronavirus at 37 c for 1 h then inoculated onto vero e6 cells and incubated at 37 c in a co2 incubator uninfected vero e6 cells and sars-positive serum or spf chicken serum were used as controls for this experiment the igy did not react with vero cells when tested by indirect fluorescent antibody technique infectivity titers were calculated using a standard tcid50 assay the highest antibody dilution that inhibited cytopathic effect in 50 of the vero e6 cells inoculated with this dilution was regarded as the 50 neutralization titer the results of neutralization experiments table 1
 indicated that yolk antibody till 1640 dilution was effective in neutralizing the sars coronavirus and were consistent with the elisa result when extracted yolk antibody was usedfor the lyophilization procedure yolk was isolated and mixed with phosphate buffer saline at a ratio of 19 vv followed by centrifugation and degreasing aliquots were loaded into 4-ml bottles to which less than 001 gml merthiolate was added each bottle was vacuumed and lyophilized according to standard methods the samples were tested for antibody titers before and after lyophilization igy after drying showed good physical properties including pale yellow color the binding activity of igy in elisa did not change significantly after lyophilization table 2
 stability testing of lyophilized igy demonstrated that igy binding did not decrease significantly until the temperature reached 90 c for 15 min in hot water table 3
 indicating the igy had good heat stability there was no change in igy activity under acid conditions from ph 7 to 2 after treatment at 37 c for 2 h table 4
 furthermore binding activity of lyophilized igy did not change after 5-month storage at either 20 4 c or room temperature table 5
igy from spf chickens provides a rich source of antibody that is easy to obtain and is cost effective the advantages of spf chicken igy over antibodies from other mammals include a high concentration and freedom from specific pathogens making the use of igy a broader prospect for development schade et al 1992 tini et al 2002 the igy from spf chickens in our study maintained good biological and neutralization activity at environmental conditions the recovery rate after purification by water dilution and the level of purity after further purification were promising the binding of igy remained unchanged after lyophilization also making it feasible for the product that had been prepared in this way to be used for passive immunization and short-term protectionsince the first outbreak of sars transmission of the virus has been controlled and the potential for an epidemic has been alleviated by isolation of suspected patients in combination with drug therapy based on clinical and epidemiological characteristics of sars long-term control of sars however will require a combination of active and passive immunizations drug therapy and other comprehensive measures it is therefore of vital importance to be able to produce vaccines and passive immunization products for effective control of sars the development of high-titer anti-sars coronavirus igy described in this study would appear to have potential as a new anti-sars biological product for passive immunization as it effectively neutralized the sars coronavirus in the present study anti-sars igy was already prepared as a crude and purified product while an indirect elisa test was used for quality control of igy production to facilitate the process of mass production of purified igy the techniques of degreasing and purification would be key points for further study after evaluation using experimentally infected animal models anti-sars igy produced in this study has the potential to be commercially manufactured the efficency of capsules produced from crude igy or spray powder and intravenous solution manufactured from more highly refined igy will need to be determined as the next step in development of igy productscoronaviruses belong to the enveloped rna viruses with a positive sense and non-segmented genome 1 until now coronaviruses including middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 casituve agent of coronavirus 2019 covid-19 are known to infect the human and cause respiratory disorders with high pathogenesis that led to regional and global outbreaks 2 the coronaviruses are categorized into the nidovirales orders coronaviridae family and coronavirinae subfamilies which this subfamily include four genera -coronavirus -coronavirus -coronavirus and -coronavirus 3from november 2002 to june 2003 a viral respiratory disorder emerged in southern china and rapidly spread the other countries resulting in more than 8000 confirmed cases 4 sars patients exhibit flu-like symptoms and pneumonia that in severe circumstances cause lethal respiratory failure and acute distress syndrome in 2012 mers-cov was reported from saudi arabia as a causative agent of respiratory malady similar to sars causing two major outbreaks in saudi arabia 2012 and south korea 2015 resulting in over 2000 confirmed cases 5 previously two coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 have been identified to cause mild upper respiratory symptoms although sometimes they cause severe low respiratory infection in the elderly infants as well as immunocompromised individuals covid-19 is a new infection that was first reported on 31 december 2019 wuhan hubei province china that could cause a respiratory malady influenza-like disorder with symptoms such as dry cough fever tiredness headache diarrhea sore throat and in more severe cases it could induce pneumonia 6 until 31 may 2020 over 5934936 confirmed covid-19 cases and 367166 approved mortality were recorded worldwide by more than 216 countries areas or regions 7in spite of the not completely clear pathologies mechanism of covid-19 infection viral and host-related factors are known to be crucial in the infection process during covid-19 infection host factors stimulate the immune responses to the sars-cov-2 virus meanwhile it has to be considered that immunopathogenesis is correlated with an out-of-control immune response which may lead to pulmonary tissue injury therefore there is an urgent need to better understanding of the interactions among host immune responses and viral factors of sars-cov-2 as well as host-related factors that will offer fundamental insights into the treatment and control of the disease in this study we first review the literature of the sars-cov-2 proliferation cycle then summarize the current information of critical immune reactions activated during covid-19 infectionthe positive-sense rna genome 30 kb of sars-cov-2 contains a 5 cap construct conjoint with a 3 poly-a tail that allows performing as mrna for translating replicate polyproteins the 5 end of the genome has a leader and untranslated region utr sequence that comprises the compositions required for transcription and replication of rna the sars-cov-2 genome organization is 5-leader-utr-replicase-s-e-mn-3 utr-poly a with intrinsic genes inside the structural genes at the 3 end of the genome 3 8 9 sars-cov-2 has a pleomorphic morphology with a diameter of 60120 nm 3 9 the genome of sars-cov-2 is positive sensitive non-fragmented rna with an astonishingly large size in a range of 27 to 32 kb 8 9genomic rna of the sars-cov-2 virus contains five caped and 3-polyadenylated including seven open reading frames orf orf 1a and 1b comprise two-thirds of the virus genome encoding unstructured poly-proteins the rest of orfs code structural proteins such as spike protein s envelopes protein e membrane protein m as well as nucleocapsid protein n additionally in some cases the hemagglutinin esterase he gene is located between orf 1b and orf s the structural proteins fold and enter into endoplasmic reticulum and transport to the transitional gap of endoplasmic reticulum-golgi the sars-cov-2 replication cycle has steps including attachment and penetrance replication of virus replication genome transcription and replication structural protein translation assemblage and discharging the virus 810 figure 1 presents a schematic overview of the sars-cov-2 replication cyclethe noticeable characteristic of coronaviruses is the spike proteins in a club-shaped form that give them the shape of a solar corona the m protein is a common marker in the virion which is a small 30 kda structure encompassing three transmembrane domains and a short n-terminal glycosylated ectodomain and a very larger c-terminal endodomain 8 9 currently it has been suggested that this protein could adopt two distinct conformations enabling to improve membrane shape along with attachment to the nucleocapsid 3protein e of the sars-cov-2 virus 12 kda is a transmembrane structure with an n-terminal ectodomain and a c-terminal endodomain having an ion channel action additionally this construct promotes the assembly and discharge of the virus the n protein is a unique construct within the nucleocapsid which includes one n-terminal and a c-terminal domain besides this protein is phosphorylated which improves the affinity for rna of viruses compared with the other non-viral rnas n protein attaches the viral genome with a beads-on-a-string type pattern another structural viral protein is he which exists in -coronaviruses and plays as a hemagglutinin that attaches to sialic acid on host glycoproteins and contains acetyl-esterase activity which is suggested to enhance the cell entry mediated to s protein and viral spread via the host mucus 3 8 9 11following the receptor attachment sars-cov-2 needs to reach the host cell cytosol binding is performed via s protein cleavage by a cathepsin followed by cell membrane fusion cleavage is carried out at two sites in the s2 segment and fusion occurs inside acidic endosomes but some coronaviruses like murine coronavirus so-called mouse hepatitis virus mhv could fuse into the host plasma membrane 3 1113 the next step is the translation of the replicase gene encodes two big orfs from genomic rna in the virion 11these orfs rep1a and rep1b form two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab use a slippery sequence 5-uuuaaac-3 and an rna pseudoknot is performed which triggers the ribosomal frameshift of the rep1a reading frame to the rep1b polyproteins pp1a compromise the eleven non-structure proteins nsps including nsps 1 to nsps 11 while pp1ab compromise nsps 1 to nsps 16 coronaviruses encode proteases for example papain-like proteases coded by nsp3 and a serine-type protease the major protease coded by nsp5 gene at the next step the nsps move inside the replicase-transcriptase complex to form an environment for synthesis and replication of rna as well as sub-genomic rnas transcription synthesis of viral rna forms sub-genomic and genomic rnas sub-genomic rnas provide mrnas for transcription of the structural and accessory genes that are located downstream of the replicase polyproteins also it has been shown that coronaviruses can recombine using non-homologous and homologous recombination 1113upon replication and subgenomic rna synthesis the structural proteins including s e and m are entered into the endoplasmic reticulum and migrate inside the secretory pathway within the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment ergic where genomes encapsidated by n protein fuse into ergic membranes which contains structural proteins and form mature virions 3the m proteins along with e proteins prompt proteinprotein cooperation that is necessary for coronaviruses assembly 1113 n proteins increase the production of virion like particles vlps revealing that the integration of encapsidated genomes into the ergic promotes the development of the viral particle 3 12 13 moreover the s proteins are incorporated into virions at this step besides the m proteins bind to the nucleocapsid that improves the completion of the virions assembly finally the virion is transferred outside of the cell and releases through exocytosis 3 9penetrating to the target cell is a crucial point in the replication cycle of sars-cov-2 the primary marker of this stage is an adequate attachment of the s glycoprotein to a cell surface receptor 14 15 s1 ward is implicated in receptor attaching which includes n- and c-terminal domains that both may play as the receptor-binding domain rbd having significant determinants of cell tropism located in s1-ctd region the elongated s2 domains of stalk form the spike trimer are essentially implicated in starting the integration of the viral envelope and membranes of the target cell sars-cov-2 binds to special cellular receptors via the s protein that makes deformation of the s proteins and then intercedes the fusion among the viral and cell membranes leading to discharging the nucleocapsid into the host cell 16 17receptor attachment is the principal marker of the host spectrum and tissue tropism of coronavirus coronavirus has acquired cell surface factors as receptors for example aminopeptidase n apn for 229e angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 for sars as well as sars-cov-2 dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 for mers and o-acetylated sialic acid for oc43 host proteases mediate the activation of s protein for example activation of s protein of sars-cov-2 requires further cleavage by the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin l and another trypsin-like serine protease 1820furthermore s protein of sars-cov-2 encompasses two cleavage locations for furin which is a ubiquitously expressed protease 21 besides the above-mentioned proteases extracellular cell surface-related and lysosomal ones have an essential impact on sars-cov-2 entry via triggering the integration of s protein 1821 in the case of sars-cov-2 the integration of viral and cellular membrane is initiated following the s protein cleavage via cell surface-related tmprss2 transmembrane protease serine 2 22 the same protease is required for cleavage and promotion of the 229e and mers s protein 23the innate immunity is a well-maintained defense mechanism for accelerated recognition and control of pathogens and subsequent promotion of the adaptive immune response sufficient trigger of the innate immunity depends on detecting the pathogen molecular patterns pamps via pattern recognition receptors prrs including toll-like receptors tlrs rig-i-like receptors rlrs nodlike receptor nlr ctype lectinlike receptors and freemolecule receptors in the host cytoplasm 24following the promotion via pamps prrs absorb adaptor proteins that comprise complex signaling pathways involving several kinases 25 this signaling pathway eventually results in the promotion of the essential transcription factors such as the nuclear factor interferon regulatory factor 3 irf3 nuclear factor-kappa b nf-b and activator protein-1ap-1 25 26 synergistically these agents release type i interferons that are secreted and act nearby interferon  receptor ifnar the antiviral effect of interferon type i has interfered through different mechanisms 27 additionally chemokines and cytokines are ordered to stimulate inflammatory reactions which is responsible for extensive tissue damage 26 pamps include lipids lipoproteins proteins and nucleic acids of bacterial viral parasitic and fungal origin detected by tlrs 28 also pamps recognition via tlrs can happen in cell membranes lysosomes endosomes as well as endocytolysosomes overall various tlrs could trigger different biological reactions via subsequent stimulation of several adapter proteins like myeloid differentiation factor 88 myd88 tir-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon- trip tollinterleukin-1 receptor tir domain-containing adapter protein tirap as well as trif-related-adaptor-molecule tram 25 29currently just a limited report is available on the host innate immune status of sars-cov-2 infected patients in one report where 99 cases in wuhan were examined increased total neutrophils 38 diminished total lymphocytes 35 increased serum il-6 52 and enhanced c-reactive protein 84 were detected 30 increased neutrophils and diminished lymphocytes also associate with the disease severity and mortality in covid-19 patients 6 furthermore patients needing icu care had raised plasma levels of several innate cytokines to include ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tnf 31 these clinical characteristics intimated the likelihood of involvement of highly pro-inflammatory statuses in the disease progression and severity this early sharp rise in the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines has also been reported in sars-cov and mers-cov infection implying a potential similar cytokine storm-mediated disease severity the robust innate immune response toward viral infection relies profoundly on the interferon ifn type i responses and its downstream cascade that completes in managing viral replication and initiation of the effective adaptive immune response 32 33macrophages and dendritic cells play a crucial role in the innate immune and adaptive immune responses these cells can stimulate t lymphocytes and b lymphocytes therefore induce coupling promoting innate and adaptive immunity the immature dendritic cell has a high migration capacity and mature dendritic cells could considerably trigger t cells in the central link of regulation and maintaining the immune responses dendritic precursor cells are differentiated into dendritic cells via adjusting inducers such as granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor interleukin-4 il4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf 34 35 cd4 positive t cells and cd8 positive t cells have an essential function by adjusting immune reactions toward viruses and the risk of autoimmunity and inflammation 36 cd4 positive t cells elevate the production of virusspecific antibodies via stimulating tdependent b cell activation 37 and cd8 positive t cells are cytotoxic and can kill the cells infected with the virus 38additionally t helper cells generate proinflammatory cytokines via the nuclear factor kappa b nfkb signaling pathway 39 interleukin 17 il17 cytokines call up monocytes and neutrophils to the infected area through inflammation and stimulate other downstream cytokine and chemokine cascades including interleukin 1 il1 interleukin 6 ll6 interleukin 8 il8 interleukin 21 il21 tnfbeta and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp1 40 41 such information has been considered for related vaccine design and therapeutics developing studies 42 recently it has been demonstrated that t cell response to sars s protein and other structural proteins eg the m and n proteins is longlasting suggesting that the design of vaccines based of viral structural proteins could stimulate dominant effective and longterm memory responses toward virus 43 a recent finding shows that humoral immunity is necessary for controlling the persistent phase of coronavirus malady 44 45 current evidence well-indicate that th1 type response is key to the reliable control of sars-cov and mers-cov and presumably valid for sars-cov-2 as well similar findings of distinct cd8  t cells have been reported during the mers-cov clearance in a mouse model too consequently this knowledge can be beneficial in the case of sars-cov-2 as well however in the case of sars-cov-2 recent reports propose that the pbmcs of sars-cov-2 infected individuals have shown adequate mitigation in the cd8  and cd4  t cell counts which may result in compromised t memory cell production and persistence in sars-cov-2 survivors 46the complement system has a critical function in the immune responses to infection caused by the coronavirus since this system enables the detection and response to viral particles considering its potency to harm the host tissues the complement system is regulated via inhibiting proteins of serum c3a and c5a show a proinflammatory activity that could initiate the recruitment of the inflammatory cell such as activation of neutrophil cells 47 blocking c3a and c5a could be a treatment for severe lung damage and the antic5a antibody has shown to save the mice from mers infection 2 activation of complement and the contact system through the formation of bradykinin may perform a role in the sars-cov-2-induced pulmonary edema and its recommended that further work is necessary to verify the information although complement is sufficient in defending against various viruses it does not seem to be protective against the coronavirus c3 knockout mice contaminated with sars-cov had fewer lung disease than wild-type mice proposing that complement may have a role in coronavirus pathogenesis some evidence suggests that revealed pulmonary edema may be bradykinin-induced and could be the reason that corticosteroids antihistamines and other traditional mediations for edema are not sufficient ace2 is a co-receptor for sars-cov-2 and studies so far have not achieved a benefit or risk correlated with the application of either ace-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists 48macrophages are critical producers of type i interferons and other pro-inflammatory cytokines which trigger antiviral protection even though they potentially contribute to immune pathology mediated to viral infections 49 interferons mediate direct antiviral influences that restrict viral replication via activatingregulating a group of well-defined antiviral effectors such as protein kinase r pkr and ribonuclease l rnase l while inflecting other facets of the innate and adaptive immune responses via stimulating a wide variety of interferon-inducible genes 50there are two main pathways via them host cells sense invading viruses and trigger the interferon pathway the cytoplasmic interferon induction pathways and tlr associated pathway 51 tlrs including tlr3 tlr7 tlr8 as well as tlr9 could recognize viruses in endosomal compartments as they penetrate cells 52 in contrast cytoplasmic caspase activation and recruitment domain card rna helicases rig-i and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 mda5 identify viral rnas in the cytoplasm 53 pathways are activated by pamps including double-stranded rna that is a byproduct of virus replication or constructed single-stranded rnas mediated to incoming viral genomes being common objective 54 the cytoplasmic interferon induction pathways and tlr use various adaptor proteins to mediate signaling with the tlr dependent pathways applying myd88 and trif downstream of the multiple adaptors these pathways share some typical signaling molecules and transcription factors for example interferon regulatory factor 3 irf-3 activator protein-1 as well as nf-kb for initiation the type i interferon expression subsequently type i interferons induce the janus kinasesignal transducers and activators of transcription jakstat signal pathway which enhances the transcription of genes induced by interferons 55 interferons restrict the spread of virus particles and have an immunomodulatory activity to improve the phagocytosis by macrophage cells as well as restriction of natural killers function to infected target cells and t and b lymphocytes 56the viral nucleic acids subsequent infecting plasmalike dendritic cells are detected via tlr7 and tlr9 to trigger the inflammatory cytokine formation and type i interferons associated with irf as well as nfb although coronaviruses are susceptible to interferon  and  these viruses persist highly pathogenic in this situation 55 however the n proteins of sars play as an antagonist for immune escape protein and interferon reactions of the host comparing with sars-cov which is thought to induce inadequate interferon response sars-cov-2 robustly triggers the expression of numerous ifn-inducible genes isgs these isgs display immunopathogenic potentials defined by the overrepresentation of genes implicated in inflammation 57the c-x-c motif of chemokine 10 cxcl10 and cc motif of chemokine ligand 3 ccl3 are formed as the earliest chemokines following viral infection cxcl10 overexpression in the central nervous system by a murine coronavirus demonstrated that exaggerated natural killer cells aggregation in immunodeficient recombination activating gene 1 rag1 negativenegative mice could be involved in the virus clearance despite the primary natural killer cell recruitment there are few documents of a direct antiviral activity for wild type virus their potential to secrete interferon- can enhance the presentation of antigen through regulation of major histocompatibility complex class i mhc 1 and class ii mhc 2 molecules 58 59augmented ccl3 has shown to be associated with the innate and adaptive immune reactions via inducing recruitment promotion as well as the maturation of dendritic cells and t lymphocytes cytokines like il-1 il-1 il-6 as well as il-12 rapidly produce in the corona infected cells like tnf- il-12 as well as il-1 are formed in resident host cells in reply to virus infection stimulation of adaptive immune reactions can change the composition and expression of infiltrating cells and chemokine in the viral infection site although c-x-c motif chemokine 9 cxcl9 cc motif chemokine ligand 2 ccl2 ccl3 cc motif chemokine ligand 4 ccl4 cc motif chemokine ligand ccl5 and cc motif chemokine ligand ccl7 are formed in acute viral infection cxcl9 and cxcl10 can gather the activated t cells and natural killers overall cxcl10 is indicated to be the sustained and major chemokine in viral infection 59as shown by the recent studies increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines eg interferon  interleukin il- 1b il-6 il-12 and chemokines cxcl10 and ccl2 are correlated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung involvement in sars patients similarly to what occurs in mers-cov infection 60 huang et al 34 recently reported that infected patients with covid 19 also show enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines the demonstration of increased levels of il-1b ifn cxcl10 and ccl2 firmly pointed toward the activation of t-helper-1 th1 cell function more importantly the so-called cytokine storm emerged as the principal factor driving a more severe clinical course this idea has been originated from the observation that covid-19 patients requiring icu admission revealed higher concentrations of cxcl10 ccl2 and tnf as compared with those in which the infection was less severe and did not require icu admission to further complicate the issue it should be highlighted that in patients with sars-cov-2 infection as a difference from sars-cov infection there is also an enhanced secretion th2-immune-oriented cytokines such as il-4 and il-10 whose main effect is to repress inflammation 60although host airway epithelial cells provide a primary aim for infection dendritic cells in the respiratory epithelium are sentinels of the host immune reactions that detect viral pathogens and present their antigens to t cells it has been found that 229e triggers massive cytopathic effects cpe in dendritic cells for example the large syncytia and cell death monocyte is more resistant against viral infection and cpe of 229e because of the expression levels of cd13 one membrane receptor for 229e is similar and cell death and cpe are acquired after 24 h of the 229e infection of monocytes cell death stimulated by 229e is independent from tnf- fas ligand fasl tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand trail as well as caspases confirming that viral replication is the causative agent of the cpe the result of dendritic cell death at the initial step of 229e infection might affect the central control of virus release and the establishment of persistent immune memory therefore the individuals could be reinfected again by 229e 61kidney cell lines from african green cynomolgus and rhesus monkey have demonstrated to be sensitive toward sars infection additionally in a study by kaye et al it was shown that kidney cells derived from a buffalo green monkey were actively infected with sars with titers up to 47 log10ml higher than input sars virus like the levels in other monkey kidney cells they showed that the most monkey kidneyderived cell lines like vero e6 assisted sars replication having titers 3947 log10ml higher than input sars virus titers 62 63high titers of sars available in these cells must be regarded while applying them for virus isolation and proper safety guidelines must be pursued the capacity of sars to replicate effectively in kidney cell lines could be due to the presence of ace-2 receptors in the kidney 64 also ace-2 is expressed in gastrointestinal lung as well as heart tissue 65 the primate kidney cell lines are specifically sensitive toward sars infection this virus has been collected from the kidney of an infected human so it has been proposed that human kidney cell lines could also provide replication of sars 66 in a report by kaye et al it was found that sars could be collected in various cell lines indicating that this virus could acquire high titers across multiple cell lines even in the absence of cpe 62 the relative contributions of virus replication and cytopathic effects or immunopathological host responses to the severe and fatal consequences of covid-19 lung infections have as yet to be determined in a pioneer study schifanella et al showed that sars-cov-2 replication and cytopathic effects in type ii alveolar pneumocytes make focal lung damage in a somebody with no history of pulmonary symptoms 67autoimmune diseases occur as a consequence of atypical immune reactions for the detection of non- and self-antigens 68 until now up to 80 autoimmune diseases have been identified 69 many agents have been mediated to autoimmune diseases like age genetics and infection 70interestingly viral agents are being regarded as main infective agents which induce the autoimmune diseases in sensitive people and some strategies have been offered to define the interrupt self-tolerance in the host by various viral infections multiple processes have been suggested for initiating and triggering the autoimmune disease induced virus molecular mimicry is the most probable process and happens when a virus antigen mimics a host antigen and stimulates cross-reactive t lymphocytes epitope spreading is another process for example the destruction of host tissue due to t lymphocyte activation unique to the virus has shown to induce promoting autoreactive t lymphocytes and liberation of self-antigens surrounded the inflammatory site bystander promotion is the stimulation of autoreactive t lymphocytes because of the cytokine formation in immune reactions targeted by the virus also encrypted antigens from the host are formed from particular tissues during tissue damage targeted by the virus additionally superantigens stimulate a wide variety of nonspecific t lymphocyte clones it has been found that coronavirus parainfluenza and metapneumovirus are significantly mediated to rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder contributing to interactions between environmental and genetic agents it has been reported that rheumatoid arthritis due to the formation of autoantibodies in genetically susceptible individuals could be triggered by some driving factors like the virus 71 however an association between respiratory viral infections like coronavirus and developing rheumatoid arthritis is proposed 72it has been found that cd 4 positive and cd8 positive t lymphocytes can link the demyelination in vivo for example rodents theilers encephalomyelitis viral infection and murine coronavirus 73 additionally some reports have declared that cd8 t lymphocytes distinct to myelin could stimulate a progressive type of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis eae also these cells account for major infiltrating immune cells in demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis individuals moreover cd8 positive t lymphocytes stimulate demyelination in theilers encephalomyelitis virus infection in vivo reduced level of demyelination has been identified in cd4 positive t lymphocytes deficient mice infected by murine coronavirus infection which is consistent with an activity for cd8 positive t lymphocytes in a study by pewe et al their findings support the notion that cd8 positive t lymphocytes can associate with demyelination independent to cd4 positive t lymphocytes also they found that interferon- is significant for demyelination mediated to cd8 positive t lymphocyte demyelination was not diminished when depleted interferon- negativenegative splenocytes were translocated 74interferon- has many impacts on inflammation in the central nervous system for example as a proinflammatory molecule and in adjusting the trafficking of leukocyte cells and the population dynamics of t lymphocyte 75 interferon- in pro-inflammatory activity is participated in roles including activation macrophage cells adjusting mhc i and ii transcription and stimulating adhesion molecules necessary for their penetrating the central nervous system also interferon- is contributed to the stimulation of chemokines expression such as ccl2 ccl7 ccl4 ccl5 cxcl9 and cxc l10 that are chemoattractants for monocytes and lymphocytes and are up-regulated in infected mice central nervous system 74 overall these findings show that interferon- is important for demyelination associated with cd8 positive t lymphocytes in mice infected by murine coronavirus because of macrophage activation and migration inside the central nervous systemchannappanavar et al has reported a pathogenic cascade that drives to ards and death this mechanism is possible operative in covid-19 infections that study suggest a scenario in which viral replication leads to a delayed interferon response accumulation and activation of monocytemacrophages and neutrophils which in aggregate result in an excessive immune response accountable for the alveolar and endothelial apoptosis 76 there is certainly a complexity in the participation of type i ifns concerning early and late responses the former may limit virus replication through induction of interferon-stimulated genes at the same time the latter can worsen disease by heightening the recruitment and function of macrophages and other innate immune cells 77 the dysregulation of inflammatory responses starts pulmonary injury that leads to ards patients admitted for severe covid-19 infections should probably hold maintenance therapies these judgments are properly left to the rheumatologyinfectious disease teams using care of them rheumatologists and infectious disease experts should be managing concurrently in this epidemic as precise data are not accessible thus making recommendations speculativepeople at the highest risk for severe corona infection comprise individuals aged  60 years and those with underlying situations like diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disorder cancer as well as a chronic respiratory disease surprisingly covid infection in infants noted to be relatively mild and rare with up to 24 of the cases additionally mortality increases with age having the highest rate in individuals  80 years based on findings and analysis it has found that males are more at risk than females 78 although males and females have been infected at equal rates the death number in males was 28 compared with 17 among females additionally the crude death ratio is higher among males 47 in comparison with females 28 79when a woman is pregnant her body and immune system naturally become weak consequently the mother could be infected more easily pregnant women experience immunologic and physiologic alterations which might make them more susceptible to respiratory infections such as covid19 80 some individuals are at risk for corona infections including chronic respiratory patients like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma emphysema bronchitis as well as chronic heart patients like heart failure chronic kidney disorder people with chronic liver disorder like hepatitis and chronic neurological conditions patients such as parkinson motor neuron disorder multiple sclerosis 81obesity is a type of sustained low-grade inflammation along with serving as an energy-storage depot adipose tissue has endocrine activities forming adipokines with immunomodulatory influences 82 leptin is a proinflammatory adipokine expressed in the lung predominantly produced by white adipose which contributes to physiological conditions including maturation 83 it is also involved in respiratory control and pathological conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd obstructive sleep apnoea inside the respiratory system 84 obesity sufferers show high circulating rates of leptin that potentially mediated via the up-regulation of suppressor of cytokine signalling-3 also interferon expression happens by the same jak-stat signaling pathway which is negatively controlled through suppressor of cytokine signalling-3 suggesting a critical pathway by which interferon reactions are attenuated against respiratory viruses in obese individuals 85 table 1 presents some of the important host factors involved in the coronavirus pathogenesisviruses usually demonstrate a difference in gaining sensitivity and clinical manifest indicating that virus pathogenesis could have resulted from complicated intercommunication between viruses and hosts this variability upon infection has been mediated to a range of agents like viral strain and sequence variation age immune status and the genetic background of the host innate antiviral immunity prepares the primary line of protection toward pathogenic invasions by sensing pamps via prrs for example activation of the cytoplasmic dna sensor stimulates the formation of interferon to defend against viruses which is also significant for the establishment of interferons in mousepox infection 96 interferons impede the replication of the virus via stimulating hundreds of interferon-induced genes that control activities of antiviral influencers 97variations in the genetic material of the multiple innate immune pathway genes which cause antiviral effector activities influence the infection 98 in the midst of interferon-stimulated genes interferon-stimulated transmembrane proteins expressed at the plasma membrane and membrane of endocytic vesicles limit many other enveloped virus infections through inhibition of the viral envelope fusing with membranes of cells interferon-induced transmembrane-3 variants that diminish gene expression or encode truncated forms are connected to a higher risk of influenza disease and a more serious health condition 99 host cells apply rnase l to destroy viral rna and stimulate the formation of interferon through rig-i to protect against rna viruses 51contrasted to another  rna viruses coronaviruses have a particularly large genome and employ a complex genome expression approach next to a role in fundamental virus replication or virus assembly various of the coronavirus proteins expressed in the infected cell play a part into the coronavirus-host interplay for instance by interacting with the host cell to generate optimal conditions for coronavirus replication via modifying host gene expression or by hindering the hosts antiviral defenses 100 these sars-cov-2host interplays are essential to viral pathogenesis and will eventually determine the consequence of infection due to the intricacy of the sars-cov-2 proteome and replication cycle our understanding of host determinants implicated in coronavirus replication is yet in an initial step compared to what is understood for some other  rna virusesthe knowledge about coronavirus including replication of the virus cell biology and pathogenesis has an accelerated progress rate because of the availability of reverse genetics systems currently the raised interest in this class of viruses is due to the covid-19 pandemic and resources have been provided for studying these viruses the impressive speed by which the covid-19 was identified and the genome was sequenced along with the earlier accumulated data on the other members of the corona-virus family has provided a lot of new insight about this universal health issue there are still many significant and intriguing aspects remaining to be identified about covid-19 since coronaviruses appear with a periodical pattern and unpredictably disperse quickly as well as stimulated severe disorders they are regarded as a constant threat to human life there are no approved vaccines or drugs for remedying coronaviruses disorders and many animal reservoirs for coronaviruses and recombinant coronaviruses are existing future directions for covid-19 studies include the further gaining knowledge of the replication mechanisms clarifying the virulence molecular determinants and tropism and the immune reactions these studies should have special regard toward probable activities of group-specific proteins developing vaccine techniques and antiviral drugs for human viruses although many new insights have been provided in regard to the covid-19 it is still very critical to study about the isolation and definition of new coronaviruses with pathogenic potential for humansthe family of coronaviruses cov are enveloped rna viruses which can be highly pathogenic to human beings 1 before long the epidemics of the two highly infectious coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 2 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 3 had resulted disastrous effects to human beings globally the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and coronavirus disease-2019 covid-19 originated from wuhan china in the end of 2019 has caused thousands of deaths 4 phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov-2 indicated that it is closely related to sars-cov 79 and a little more distant to mers-cov50 5 the pathological changes of covid-19 dead puncture suggest that its pathological characteristics are very similar to sars-cov and mers-cov-induced viral pneumonia 6 thus it is critical to identify common patterns between these lethal pathogens and immune responsecoronavirus has specific immune response and immune escape characteristics and then causes severe pathogenic mechanisms through inflammation which leaded to severe pneumonia pulmonary oedema ards or multiple organ failure and even death 7 cytokine storm also known as cytokine cascade or hypercytokinemia is caused by infection drugs or autoimmune diseases of the bodys excessive immunity response 8 pioneering investigations have confirmed that increased volumes of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum eg il-1b il-6 il-12 ifn- correlated with pulmonary inflammation and severe lung impairment in sars patients 9 mers-cov infection was also described to provoke increased concentrations of cytokines il-15il-17 tnf- and ifn- 10 it is reported that victims infected with sars-cov-2 also demonstrate high amounts of il-1b ifn- ip10 and mcp1 which may attribute to activated th1 t helper cell responses 11 although these virus invaded human bodies through various proteinssars-cov angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace-2 mers-cov dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ddp-4 sars-cov-2 ace-2 possibly the similar cytokine cascade from immune response which caused severe damage has been widely covered 12hence identifying the key cytokines induced by coronavirus infection and the cells involved in the regulation of cytokine storms blocking their signal transduction will greatly reduce the inflammatory response and damage to the lung tissue and multiple organs of patientssars-cov-2 shows 88 identity to the sequence of sars-like coronaviruses and about 50 to the sequence of mers-cov due to the similar structure their pathogenesis is similar sars-cov-2 just like sars-cov requires the ace-2 mers-cov enters target cells not via ace-2 but via binding to dpp-4 both ace-2 and dpp-4 are expressed in several human tissues while the virus enters the cells antigen presentation subsequently stimulates the bodys humoral and cellular immunity which are mediated by virus-specific immune cells immune response causes a lot of symptoms and the main death cause of coronavirus is cytokine storm which is the deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response covid-19 induced strong immune response is resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which are similar to the symptoms of sars-cov and mers-cov infections hence although the pathogenesis of covid-19 is poorly understood the similar mechanisms of sars-cov and mers-cov still can give us a lot of information on the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infection to facilitate our recognition of covid-19 figure 1to explore sars-cov induced immune responses infected mice group was analyzed lungs from mice were harvested at 12 24 and 48 hours post-infection and at least 3 biological replicates were collected as pneumonia in the elderly is more susceptible to infection and the symptoms are heavier the changes in inflammatory factors at 12 24 and 48 hours after the infection of the sars virus in elderly rats were analyzed and multiple factors were found to occur il-1 il-1  il-6 and il-10 presented a significant higher level and was more obvious at 24 hours while the level of il-7 showed moderate fluctuation and il-23 a decreased trend figure 2 the results showed that sars-cov infection induced a cytokine stormas for interferon system which protects mammals against virus infections we analyzed the changes of interferon at 12h 24h and 48h after infection with sars virus in elderly rats we found ifn-2 ifn-1 and ifn2 all demonstrated higher expression volumes especially in 24h figure 3 which suggest the onset such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdcs and proinflammatory monocytes in terms of changes in chemokines which synergistically induce a proinflammatory recruitment the level of ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 and ccl10 are all drastically elevated in 24h and remained high level in 48h in the meantime cxcl3 expression increased in 24h but decreased in 48h and cxcl5 expression showed a decreased trend in 24h and 48h compared to 12h figure 4 taken together these rising molecules reflected anti-viral response from the host in the early phasein order to explore the common pattern of immune response after coronavirus contagion we analyzed the situation in mers-cov infected human microvascular endothelial cells so we analyzed the expression genes of interleukins and interferons after 24h and we found interleukins il-6 il-23 il-10 il-7 il-1 il-1 and interferons ifn-2 ifn2 ifn- have increased dramatically figure 5 which indicated an elevated anti-virus immune responseto explore the immune differences between young and aged mice we analyzed the cytokine variation after sars-cov infected for 12 and 24 hours the results showed that several cytokines increase more significantly in aged mice than young mice figure 6 it indicated that coronavirus may cause more severe cytokine storms in elderly patients to quantify the immune response on cell level we applied ssgsea method to compare the variation of different immune cells of aged and young mice after sars-cov infection the level of t cells nk cells and monocytes increased significantly both in aged and young mice lymphoid cells show an elevated level in young mice but remained stable comparatively in aged mice and granulocytes tend to decrease both in aged and young mice after the infection interestingly monocytes aged mice increased more quickly 24h than in the young mice 48h figure 7 the results showed that coronavirus infection can cause strong immune response in both young and old mice lymphocyte-mediated immune responses are more severe in young mice but monocyte-mediated immune responses are more rapid in older micefor further study we analyzed immune cells in peripheral blood of 463 patients with covid-19 disease table 1 we found that total lymphocytes cd3 cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes significantly went down in the severe type patients compared to the common type figure 8 which indicated sars-cov-2 can impose hard blows on human lymphocyte resulting in lethal pneumonia moreover total lymphocytes and cd8 t lymphocyte counts decreased more severely in patients  50 years old than those below 50 which suggest that young patients are more likely to bounce back and cd3 or cd4 lymphocyte counts showed no significant difference between different age groupspathological manifestations of covid-19 greatly resemble what has been seen in sars and mers infection which massive interstitial inflammatory infiltrates diffused in the lung 6 the cellular fibromyxoid exudate which caused severe alveolar impairment from postmortem autopsy indicates the cytokine storm may play a critical role in patient rapid death in this study we found that genes coding interleukinsil-1 il-1 il-6 il-10 chemokines ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 ccl10 and interferons ifn-2 ifn-1 and ifn2 raised significantly in sars-cov treated mice within 24h which in line with the elevated infiltration of t cells nk cells and monocytes and similar pattern of cytokine projection were found in the mers-cov infected groupinvestigating the inflammatory profile in sars and mers may advance our knowledge of the immune-pathological process in covid-19 treatment in this study we reviewed sars-infected mice and mers-treated human micro vascular endothelial cells to clarify the association between temporal changes in cytokinechemokine profiles and the six immune cell infiltration patterns we retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 463 cases with common and severe type covid-19 who discharged before february 6 2020 we found that severe type of patients suffered more serious symptoms like higher fever and took more time to recover which may suggest the fluctuation of immune indices is of predictive valueto explore the specific mechanism of immune environment changes we analyzed potential influencing factors cytokines not merely aid in the process of antimicrobial immunity but are liable for immune-pathological damage to owner cells causing significant morbidity or even fatality in multiple respiratory disorders as well 17 18 chemokines like cxcl10 ip10 and ccl2 mcp-1 proved to be up-regulated in monocytesmacrophages by sars-cov which is consistent with our results 19 the clinical progression of mers cases proves that secretion of monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 mcp-1 cxcl10 is out of control 20 pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 ccl5 and interferon-stimulated genes cxcl10 are involved in toll-like receptors tlr signaling 21 these molecules are effectors on the process of respiratory virus infections towards the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which is lethal to the covid-19 patients 22 il-12 is the main cytokine secreted by dcs that manages the differentiation of cd4 t cells into th1 cells and serves essential duty in cell-mediated immunity and il-23 which includes in the il-12 family are predominantly pro-inflammatory cytokines which contribute critical roles in the growth of th17 cells 23 24 increased expression of il-12 and il-23 after sars-infected lung tissue in mice may indicate the activated response of th1 and th17 cells which is observed in mers victims as well 10 interesting in the sars-cov infected cells the ace-2 was significantly correlated with neutrophils nk cells th17 cells th2 cells th1 cells dc which may call for further investigations 25ifn- is regarded as one of the bodys primary antiviral defenses ifn- exerts its effects through intercellular communication resulting the induction of ifn- and interferon-stimulated genes isgs which make up an important aspect of host antiviral defense 26 notwithstanding particular cell types such as pdcs and monocytes have been confirmed to produce more ifn than other cell types when viral infection committed 27 and elevated level of ifn and monocyte infiltration in our analysis validates this the innate immune response on the basis of pdcs and monocytes may play substantial role in the formation of the cytokine storm which damages the lung severelylymphopenia is common in covid-19 patients severe lymphocyte reduction occurred in about 10 of patients especially in the heavy group which is consistent with the latest reported results 28 flow cytometry showed that cd3 cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes had decreased to varying degrees and aged patients suffered a more severe decrease in total lymphocytes and cd8 t lymphocytes about 40 of patients had a decrease in cd4  t lymphocytes and the incidence was higher in the heavy group than in the common group this shows that sars-cov-2 may mainly attack lymphocytes in the body which can cause the reduction of cd4  t lymphocytes resulting in decreased immune function and infection and severe cases of severe pneumoniain a word we analyze the cytokine profiles in sars-cov infected mice and mers-cov infected human micro vascular cells interleukin il-1 il-1  il-6 il-10 chemokine ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 ccl10 and interferon ifn-2 ifn-1 and ifn2 increased dramatically in sars-cov treated mice within 24h as for mers-cov treated cells interleukins il-6 il-23 il-10 il-7 il-1 il-1 and interferon ifn-2 ifn2 ifn- showed a significant ascending trend in 24h subsequent analysis revealed elevated abundance of t cells nk cells and monocytes in both young and aged mice group treated by sars-cov and impaired lymphocyte system in severe and aged covid-19 patients indicates the disease is more likely to progress when cytokines exhausted and functional lymphocytes suppressed thus catching the window of treatment for covid-19 according to these immune molecules may be criticalmicroarray datasets related to gene expression were obtained from the geo database for

weiss  navas-martin 2005 the coronaviruses infecting humans belong to the serologicalphylogenetic clades group i alphacoronaviruses and group ii betacoronaviruses group i includes hcov-229e human coronavirus 229e and hcov-nl63 while group ii includes sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 the viruses sars-cov-1 and mers-cov on average cause the most severe symptoms and their outbreaks were successfully monitored and halted at the other end of the spectrum the viruses hcov-229e hcov-nl-63 hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 tend to cause only mild symptoms and are very commonthe centers for disease control and prevention cdc
httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirusgeneral-informationhtml states common human coronaviruses including types 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses like the common cold most people get infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lives the same agency lists the common symptoms caused by these viruses as runny nose sore throat headache fever cough and general feeling of being unwell but also explains that they occasionally cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia or bronchitis the viruses 229e and oc43 have been known since the 1960s reviewed in

plotkin  plotkin 2018 it is interesting to consider whether common human coronavirus infections may have induced some level of protection against sars-cov-2the two major arms of immune memory concern antibody secretion by b cells and killing of infected cells by cd8
 t cells for a coronavirus infection in mouse both immune responses were needed to efficiently control the virus reviewed by

qiu

amanat

httptoolsimmuneepitopeorgmhci for prediction of their affinity to a set of representative human mhc-i allelesbased on combinations of experimental results and computer learning various software has been created that with some degree of reliability can predict how efficiently peptides can bind to the grooves of various mhc-i alleles in the present study we used the artificial neural network ann function

et al 2008 the software owners state that ic50 values of 50 nm and 500 nm are considered high and intermediate affinity respectively and are found for most epitopes known to stimulate cytotoxic t cells therefore
table 1 only indicates the predicted ic50 values if lower than 500 nm
table 1 shows these expected affinities for twelve mhc-i alleles that are rather representative for sets of mhc-i alleles with similar binding properties supertypes and so represent a large part of the human mhc-i binding repertoire

li
et al 2008 found that a sars-cov-1 15 aa peptide sequence their replicase 4701-4715 peptide encompassing the sars-cov-2hcov-shared orf1ab4725 and orf1ab4726 epitopes that are predicted to bind well to the mhc-i alleles hla-a0201 and hla-b3901 see our
table 1 was associated with a cd8
 t cell response against sars-cov-1 in humans however
li
et al 2008 also found such cd8
 t cell response associated with a sars-cov-1 15 aa peptide their nucleocapsid 106-120 peptide encompassing the sars-cov-2hcov-shared n 106 n 107 n 108 an n 109 epitopes for which our analyses did not predict mhc-i binding see our
table 1the mhc-i binding affinity is considered the most selective in determining which peptides are presented but also steps in the peptide processing and loading pathways may play selective roles which are difficult to capture in prediction software 
nielsen
et al 2005 we argue that if such steps would be selective for presentation in most cases they would probably not differentiate between the 9 aa epitope in the sars-cov-2 context versus the respective hcov context since most of those epitopes are within stretches that also show many similarities in the neighboring residues 
extended datanot all stable complexes of mhc-i with non-self peptides elicit a strong immune response but immunogenicity features are hard to predict with meaningful reliability by
in silico analysis 
calis
et al 2013 and in the present study we refrain from such predictions
table 1 should foremost be understood as evidence of principle and a list of promising peptides whereas only future experiments can prove mhc-i-mediated immune memory involving these or other peptidesin regard to sars-cov-2 recognition the common human coronaviruses may also induce some mhc-ii-mediated immune memory by cd4
 helper t cells for shared epitope use by different coronaviruses see
zhao
et al 2016 cd4
 helper t cells can help stimulate cells involved in antibody or cell-mediated cytotoxic immune responses 
neefjes
et al 2011 however for this topic we refrained from detailed software predictions because comparison of mhc-ii epitopes across different viruses is harder than for mhc-i epitopes namely although the core of mhc-ii bound peptides is also only 9 aa the surrounding amino acids are also part of the bound peptide that tends to be 12-25 aa

 helper t cells 
arnold
et al 2002immune memory means that a secondary immune response upon renewed encounter with the same pathogen is faster and stronger than the primary immune response during the first encounter with the pathogen this is based on expansion of specific b and t cell clones which specifically recognize pathogen-derived epitopes with some of those cells becoming memory cells 
paul 2013 this principle also causes that for a booster vaccinationimmunization the requirements for efficiently inducing an immune response are lower than for a first vaccinationimmunization eg

et al 2012 as discussed above peoples past infections with common coronaviruses probably did not induce a b cell memory for making antibodies that can neutralize sars-cov-2 however as the current study shows by analysis of linear 9 aa epitopes these common human coronaviruses are expected to induce cd8
 t cells that may potentially kill sars-cov-2-infected cells and so can help eradicate the virus there are several possible ways to exploit this probable immune memory for example if using rna for immunization 
cohen 2020 it may be best to also include sars-cov-2 genes that encode mhc-i epitopes that match those of the common coronaviruses alternatively delivery of these epitopes to the mhc-i presentation system may be tried by peptide or protein based vaccines eg

kupferschmidt  cohen 2020 protein -coding vaccines for example encompassing a large part of the sars-cov-2 orf1ab product would have an advantage over peptide-vaccines by including multiple possible mhc-i and also mhc-ii epitopes and be less dependent on mhc-allele matching and the quality of software predictions naturally as for any new vaccine strategy it should be carefully assessed whether the benefits of the induced type of immunity outweigh the potential deleterious health effects caused by an increased inflammation response

upper respiratory infections that comprise 20 of the annual common colds worldwide 1 however the recent identification of a novel human coronavirus as the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars dramatically demonstrated the potential of this virus family to cause devastating and potentially pandemic disease as well as economic and social disruption 2 although coronavirus replication and pathogenesis has been the focus of many years of research by numerous dedicated investigators many unanswered questions remain about exactly how these viruses proliferate in the host organism and bring about disease see outstanding issues of chief importance is the question how can we inhibit coronavirus-induced diseases such as sars at present there are no clinically proven treatments for sars and care of infected persons has been mostly empiric this review gives a brief description of coronavirus replication and sars coronavirus sars-cov pathogenesis describes the current therapies for treating sars and highlights recent advances in the identification of crucial molecular targets for the rational design of antivirals and therapeuticspatients diagnosed with sars exhibit an atypical pneumonia with a lower respiratory tract infection associated with pulmonary lesions alveolar damage mononuclear infiltrate and the presence of large multi-nucleated cells in the lungs although there have been no detailed studies of sars-cov pathogenesis the clinical progression of sars has been shown to follow a tri-phasic pattern 3 early-stage symptoms last approximately 710 days and include fever and general myalgia that is coupled with increasing viral load at this phase symptoms are thought to be primarily a consequence of viral-induced cytopathic effects mid-stage disease occurs between 10 and 14 days revealing an increase in fever occurrence and diarrhea and is accompanied by a slight decrease in viral load specific antibodies against sars-cov can be detected in patient sera at this stage of disease progression suggesting that viral replication as well as host immune response might be contributing to illness during late-stage infection a clinical worsening occurs that is associated with decreased viral shedding nearly 20 of patients suffer acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and require ventilatory support 3 at late-stage infection lung and immunopathological damage and severe lymphopenia have been proposed to be a direct result of an excessive immune responsebecause both viral replication and the host immune response are hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of sars-cov it is important to understand both aspects of virus biology to define potential therapeutics that combine direct antivirals and immune modulators viral factors influencing disease might include those that serve the sole purpose of enhancing virulence much like toxins as well as factors that cause cytotoxic effects on the host cell as a mere consequence of viral replication to date most of the individual sars proteins have no known functions and no potential virulence factors have been identified therefore our discussion will be limited to the molecular determinants of coronavirus replication the viruscell interactions that occur during replication and their suspected contribution to pathogenesis and the involvement of the immune system in enhancing the severity of coronavirus diseaseit is not known how damage to infected cells caused by coronavirus replication impacts the severity of disease the three main cytopathic effects of coronavirus replication on the host cell are syncytia multi-nucleated cell formation the initiation of apoptosis programmed cell death and the induction of cellular autophagy degradation of intracellular components in lysosomes for many coronaviruses syncytia formation is a hallmark of infection during replication in cell culture syncytia form as a result of the cellcell fusion caused by viral attachment proteins spike or s located on the infected cell surface binding to receptors on adjacent cells the lung pathology of sars patients noted the presence of syncytia however sars-cov does not cause vero african green monkey kidney cells to become multi-nucleated in culture 3 it remains unknown whether this cellcell fusion event disrupts normal cellular processes leading to cytotoxicity apoptosis is another potentially detrimental effect of coronavirus replication one report showed an increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the spleen lung and lymph nodes of sars patients as compared with normal tissues 4 the apoptotic cells include pneumocytes lymphocytes and monocytes which despite this increase in programmed cell death were still more numerous in infected tissues coronavirus-induced apoptosis has been studied in greater detail for the model coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv specifically as it relates to the demyelination of the central nervous system cns in mice one study revealed that mhv induces apoptosis of oligodendrocytes upon entry of the virus into the cell and that this process does not require ongoing viral replication 5 presumably the induction of programmed cell death is mediated either by signaling via a cell surface receptor that is activated upon virus attachment and entry or is caused directly by a component of the incoming coronavirus virion in support of the latter it has been shown that expression of the sars structural protein nucleocapsid in cultured cells leads to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the induction of apoptosis 6 it is not apparent whether the initiation of apoptosis is beneficial to coronavirus replication or instead just a by-product of viral entry by contrast activation of the host cell autophagy pathway which is normally involved in protein and membrane recycling is actually required for the efficient replication of mhv 7 mhv and probably all coronaviruses induces the formation of intracellular double-membrane vesicles that serve as scaffolds for viral enzymes these double-membrane vesicles are derived from host cell autophagosomes and inhibiting components of the autophagy pathway disrupts viral replication mhv infection increases the amount of cellular protein degradation by activation of autophagy consequently this process could have severe cytotoxic effects on cells and contribute to viral pathogenesisthe capacity of a virus to modulate the immune response can have a pivotal effect on the course of disease and the fate of the infected host the severe lung inflammation macrophage infiltration and lymphopenia seen in sars patients suggests that the host immune response contributes significantly to the high morbidity and mortality of sars still it is not known why the immune system is so highly induced upon infection with sars-cov it is probable that the adaptive immune response plays a role in sars pathogenesis however the robust activation of the innate response specifically inflammation seems to be the most devastating in terms of exacerbating disease elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines chemical signals that recruit immune cells to infected tissues have been detected in sars-cov-infected persons for example pediatric sars patients show markedly elevated levels of the cytokine il-1 a primary mediator of inflammation that is also implicated in cellular apoptosis 8 a recent study of adult sars patients has demonstrated that as the severity of symptoms worsens levels of the il-6 promotes antibody-producing b cells increase whereas levels of il-8 and tgf- inhibits immune cell activation decrease 9 for mhv innate immune responses are implicated in the neuropathology seen in infected mice in particular the capacity of different strains of mhv to differentially stimulate cytokine release in the cns directs the type of infiltrating leukocyte populations and alters the severity of viral encephalitis 10 the results of these studies support the contention that cytokine dysregulation during coronavirus infection might account at least in part for the severity of clinical diseaseto date there are no clinically proven therapies for coronavirus infections in animals or in humans during the acute sars epidemic of 2003 the severity and high mortality of the disease led to the use of numerous and often combined empiric antiviral drugs and immune modulating therapies specifically based on the clinical observations and inferences patients infected with sars-cov were treated with steroids to inhibit inflammation and with the antiviral ribavirin a nucleoside analog proven clinically effective for several other rna viruses the limitations of clinical and virological measures and the lack of controlled studies make it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of ribavirin and steroid therapy to significantly lessen the severity of sars in a preliminary study the use of interferon-alpha inf in combination with corticosteroids was associated with a more rapid resolution of radiographic lung abnormalities 11 interferons inhibit viral infection both by activating immune cells and by altering the intracellular environment to restrict viral replication thus making them good candidates for therapeutics moreover one study reported that the administration of human immunoglobulin from convalescent patient sera showed some clinical benefits suggesting that antibodies against sars-cov might decrease viral load 12 known antivirals targeting the viral enzymes such as the proteinases have also been tested as potential inhibitors of coronavirus replication the cysteine proteinase inhibitor e64-d was shown to dramatically reduce sars-cov replication under cell culture conditions 13 additionally the human immunodeficiency virus hiv aspartic acid proteinase inhibitor lopinavirritonavir decreased sars-cov replication in vitro and was associated with reduced morbidity and mortality in infected patients when compared with untreated individuals 14 based on these preliminary reports further evaluation of both e64-d and lopinavirritonavir using controlled studies is warrantedour current understanding of basic coronavirus biology based on years of research by a cadre of committed investigators has provided a molecular basis for the design of new antivirals specifically the majority of what is known concerning intracellular coronavirus replication has been determined using mhv as a model system although the details of sars-cov replication remain to be determined the similarities between mhv and sars-cov at level of the replicase proteins enzymes that replicate the viral rna suggests that these two viruses can have similar intracellular replicative processes 15 thus what we know about mhv can be applied to the development of drugs targeting the sars-cov replication machinery table 1
coronavirus replication is initiated by binding of the viral attachment protein spike or s to specific receptors on the surface of the host cell and entry of the viral genome positive-strand rna into the cytoplasm fig 1
 molecules involved in viral attachment and entry represent the first targets for inhibition of the viral lifecycle the type of receptor utilized by different coronaviruses is the primary determinant of the capacity of these viruses to replicate within a specific cell type or tissue for sars-cov angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace-2 has been identified as a functional receptor 16 the fact that ace-2 is expressed in numerous tissues in the human body supports the observation that sars-cov has been detected in the blood lung liver and kidneys one report characterized the determinants of sars-cov entry into cells and the three-dimensional crystal structure of spike the viral attachment protein has been solved 17 18 these studies provide the blueprints for the development of inhibitors of viral entry probably targeting the spike glycoprotein or the viral receptor ace-2following entry of the genome rna molecules into the cytoplasm the next stage in the virus lifecycle is generation of the viral proteins required for rna synthesis enzymes or proteins involved in the synthesis of viral rna can in theory be inhibited without detrimental effects on the host cell and are thus ideal targets for antivirals coronaviruses generate proteins required for viral rna synthesis first as a large polyprotein which is subsequently cleaved into smaller products by viral-encoded cysteine proteinases 1 15 among these mature protein products are an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp an rna helicase and several putative rna processing enzymes 19 it is hypothesized that mature proteins must be newly translated and processed to function in viral rna synthesis specifically the addition of proteinase inhibitors at anytime during the mhv lifecycle abolishes viral rna synthesis and halts replication 20 these results combined with the clinical and in vitro studies with proteinase inhibitors and sars-cov suggest that the viral proteinases are principle targets for drug design the determination of the crystal structure of the sars-cov main picornavirus 3c-like proteinase 3clpro facilitates the design of such drugs by elucidating determinants of inhibitor binding 21 moreover a bioinformatics model of the catalytic core of the sars-cov rdrp has been proposed allowing insight into the structure and function of this key viral enzyme during rna synthesis 22 other important targets are proteins involved in the formation of membranous cytoplasmic viral replication complexes which serve as scaffolds for the viral proteins to mediate rna synthetic activities cells that have an engineered deletion of autophagy gene 5 atg 5 are unable form both autophagosomes as well as viral-induced double-membrane vesicles these cells do not support efficient viral replication suggesting that components of the cellular autophagy pathway can be targets for antiviral development 7the assembly and release of coronavirus virions from the host cell is the final stage of the viral lifecycle although the molecular determinants of coronavirus assembly and release are not well characterized these processes represent additional targets for inhibition of replication following viral rna synthesis in the cytoplasm newly synthesized genome rna molecules are transported to sites of virion particle assembly by an unknown mechanism for mhv virus assembly and budding occur in the endoplasmic-reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment ergic 23 several mhv proteins including the helicase and the nucleocapsid protein also translocate to the ergic during times of particle assembly and are thought to be involved in the delivery of the rna to be packaged into newly budding virus 24 thus inhibiting the capacity of helicase and nucleocapsid to deliver genomic rna molecules to the ergic would probably hinder particle assembly trafficking of assembled coronaviruses to the cell surface where they are released is not well understood but is presumed to occur through the normal exocytic processesalthough the sars outbreak is now under control the likelihood of possible human and animal reservoirs suggest that this virus will continue to pose a worldwide public health threat understanding the biology and pathogenesis of coronaviruses is crucial to the development of antivirals and therapeutics for potential intervention in the case of a sars-cov reemergence such drugs will probably target factors involved in the cellular destruction caused by viral replication as well as factors influencing immune-mediated damage highest priority should be given to the development of antivirals that will block sars-cov replication inhibitors of early steps in the virus lifecycle could block early- and mid-stage cytopathic effect and possibly decrease immunopathological damage observed in sars-cov-infected personssince the last identified naturally occurring case of sars in july 2003 remarkable progress has been made in studies to identify targets for interference with virus replication to identify potential therapeutics for sars-cov to develop animal models for replication and pathogenesis and to test potential vaccine candidates in a recent comprehensive study more than 10000 natural and synthetic compounds were assayed for the capacity to inhibit sars-cov replication in cell culture 25 this screen identified approximately 50 putative antivirals that are currently in clinical development suggesting that a cure for sars might be closer than once thought but the question that remains is  should the development and testing of therapeutics and vaccines be sustained because sars appears to have retreated into its unknown endemic host and is not causing human disease the answer to that question is yes for several reasons first there have been isolated cases of sars since july 2003 resulting from lab-associated infection but also possibly from de novo transmission from animal to human as the recent cases from china attest the very characteristics of sars-cov that resulted in the worldwide epidemic are the same ones that is make it possible to reemerge including a relatively long incubation period nonspecific prodrome and variably efficient transmission second the natural host or mechanism for introduction and maintenance in humans is not known and thus it is important to have strategies for implementation in the case of new outbreaks third many of the strategies being tested have probably application to other coronaviruses of humans and animals and thus are potentially important in their own right finally there are discussions about sars-cov biosafety and biosecurity both for inadvertent and possible intentional outbreaks it is therefore essential to understand targets for therapeutics and to define strategies for prevention in summary the application of knowledge concerning the clinical manifestation of coronavirus disease and the molecular determinants of coronavirus replication will provide a foundation for the rapid development of effective inhibitors of these pathogenic viruses
how can we prevent or treat coronavirus diseaseshow does damage to infected cells caused by coronavirus replication impact the severity of diseasewhat is the role of the host immune response in the pathogenesis of sars-covwhat are the molecular targets for inhibiting coronavirus replication
classified within the coronaviridae family sars-cov-2 shares the main common characteristics of this family coronaviruses are enveloped with large 30-kb single-stranded positive-sense rna 17 their genome is divided into two parts 5 two-thirds and 3 one-third with the former including open reading frames orf1a and orf1b that encode pp1a and pp1ab two large polyproteins that can be cleaved to nonstructural proteins nsp116 required for the synthesis of new viral genetic material the rest of the genome includes genes that encode the structural proteins to produce virions and accessory genes that play a role in the host response 17structural proteins include the spike s glycoprotein known for its pathogenicity that comprises two functional subunits s1 as the receptor-binding domain and s2 that mediates fusion between the virus envelope and host cell membrane other coronavirus proteins include nucleocapsid n involved in genome replication a membrane m protein from the host endoplasmic reticulum or golgi responsible for virus assembly and the envelope protein e figure 2a table 1 sars-cov-2 highly resembles sars-cov-1 sharing 77 similarity with the residual amino acids of the s protein 1 also the similarity of n m and 3a proteins in sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 implies a similar pathogenic pathway sars-cov-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 a cell surface receptor that converts the vasopressor octapeptide angiotensin-ii to the vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 and is highly expressed in the vascular endothelia lung kidney small intestine epithelial cells immune cells and testis 1819 following binding to ace2 the virus enters the cell through either an endosome in acidic environments or by s glycoprotein cleavage with host cell proteases such as tmprss2 and furin 2022 using their own rna polymerase coronaviruses replicate their genome in the host cell cytoplasm and employ the host ribosome machinery to produce proteins subsequent viral assembly occurs in the host endoplasmic reticulumgolgi intermediate complex and mature virions are released through a secretory mechanism in smooth-walled vesicles resulting in endoplasmic reticulum stress figure 2bthe human body uses pattern recognition receptors to identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns and endogenous danger or damage-associated molecular patterns the most well-known pattern recognition receptors include the toll-like receptors tlrs cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene i rig-i the rig-i-like receptor rlr and the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor nlr tlrs such as tlr7 are induced in response to recognized particles 2324 including single-stranded rna viruses and stimulate proinflammatory cytokines and interferons ifns type i and iii 25 the latter released from virus-infected cells upregulates ifn-stimulated genes which is a first step in limiting viral entry or viral replication 26 at later stages ifns can inhibit viral assembly the viral spread and modulate the immune system by promoting macrophage natural killer nk- t- and b-cell activities 27 it has been suggested that coronavirus can antagonize ifns and thereby evade the immune system 28rig-i-like receptors which reside on mitochondria can detect rna viruses and activate mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins in turn increase proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin il-6 tumor necrosis factor- tnf- that are related to nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells nf-b pathway interferon regulatory factors and inflammasome-related cytokines il-1 and il-18 23 elevated inflammasome pathways in normal aging have been associated with age-related chronic diseases 2930 by further stimulating inflammasome pathway activity viral infections can exacerbate age-related impairment of immunological responses with aging the decline in innate immunity attenuates ifn responses to viral infection in neutrophils monocytes and macrophages and nk cells 24273132 moreover costimulatory signals are reduced from the antigen-presenting cells including macrophages b cells nk and dendritic cells that are required to activate t cells 32coronaviruses have been shown to activate both the nlrp3 inflammasome and the nf-b pathway 3334 of particular importance are elevated levels of tnf--converting enzyme tace a proteolytic enzyme in the processing of tnf- tnf receptors tnfrs and ace2 both ace2 and tace levels are associated with poor prognosis in heart failure in addition tnfr-1 and tnfr-2 are strongly associated with kidney failure in older adults 35 ace2 is an enzyme that promotes the formation of angiotensin 1-7 which has anti-inflammatory functions 3638 however ace2 expression levels in human aging and ace2 activity upon sars-cov-2 infection remain to be elucidatedmoreover in response to viral infections plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level increases to neutralize proteases such as tmprss2 and thus reduces the infectivity transforming growth factor-beta tgf-beta increases in response to persistent inflammation and is known to trigger serpine1 expression the gene encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 which further increases tgf-beta levels 26 of note increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level a known marker of senescence 39 may increase thromboembolism and coagulopathy which are risk factors for acute cardiovascular events and stroke 26 similar to mesr-cov sars-cov-2 also has been reported to have a furin-like cleavage site 40 furin another host cell protease stimulates both nlrp3 and nf-b inflammatory pathways and activates tgf-beta 41 notably tgf-beta and growth differentiation factor 15 a member of tgf-beta superfamily are known markers associated with aging 42 as well as significant prognostic markers in acute respiratory distress syndrome 4344adaptive immunity that identifies and responds to specific pathogens includes humoral and cellular immunities which are mediated by b cells and cd8 and cd4 t cells respectively b lymphocytes are triggered to differentiate into immunoglobin-producing plasma cells by cytokine production from cd4 cells 42 increased levels of all immunoglobulins ig including iga from respiratory mucosal cells igm and igg have been reported in response to coronavirus 23 igm is the first antibody secreted in response to acute viral infection igg produced later and enhanced upon reinfection facilitates phagocytosis of infected cells and antibody-dependent cellular toxicity by both nk and cd8 cells 45 with aging there is a shift from the nave toward memory b cells alterations in the key stimulatory factors mediating the b-cell response to antigens as well as reduced capacity for antigen recognition sites on antibodies to recognize novel pathogens moreover in response to antiviral vaccines long-lived plasma cells decrease 46with aging in addition to the decreased number of nave t cells communication between t cells and antigen-presenting cells which is required to convert nave t cells to memory cells is reduced 47upon viral infection the activated cytotoxic cd8 cells release the lysing enzymes to degrade infected cells and viral genomes if cd8 cells fail to eliminate the virus cytokines released from cd4 t effector cells induce augmented inflammatory responses 48 decreased numbers of nave cd8 t cells and reduced t-cell receptor diversityas well as alterations in distribution and function of effector memory and regulatory cd8 t cellslead to impaired recognition of new antigens and accumulation of dysfunctional memory t cells 4951 of note transcription factor foxo3 that is expressed on t cells was shown to play an essential role in the regulation of t-cell functions in response to pathogens 52notably an age-dependent sex discrepancy in immune systems has been demonstrated 53 and the incidence of coronavirus infection has also been reported to be higher in men than women with sars-cov-1 viral titers and the accumulation of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils in the lungs were higher among men than women 5455 a study of epigenomics and transcriptomics of immune cells has suggested a bimodal reduction in b-cell function in men first in the early 30s and then at age 65 years and older 53 the sex- and age-dependent immune cell-specific epigenetic and transcriptomic discrepancy can also underlie the sex and age differences in severity of covid-19 symptoms moreover estrogen receptor signaling 56 variability in testosterone levels and androgen receptor expression have been implicated in the variability of immune responses 57 notably androgen receptor element genes are upstream to the tmprss2 transcription start site and regulate its expression 58 while more rigorous epidemiological data on sex and age distribution of covid-19 are warranted 59 more investigation on sex- and age-dependent immune response to rna viral infections will shed more light on covid-19 severitythe accumulation of somatic mutations genomic instability and attenuated dna repair have been shown in aging immune cells the overexpression of oxidative stress seen with a viral infection along with attenuated dna repair capacity could accelerate genome instability and apoptosis in noninfected cells 6061among dna repair mechanisms p53 plays a vital role in response to low levels of stress and protects cells from oxidative damage conversely higher levels of oxidative stress eg increased inflammatory responses secondary to viral infection result in persistent activation of p53 and increased mitochondrial outer membrane permeability which in turn leads to apoptosis figure 3 62 although p53 can downregulate coronavirus replication via regulation of the cell cycle 63 the coronavirus papain-like protease degrades p53 and allows replication of infected cells 64 further the dna damage response can play a role in the pathogenesis of rna viruses through induction of apoptosis deleterious somatic mutations and excessive stimulation of inflammatory immune responses figure 3 65 additionally coronavirus can inhibit the activity of the cyclin-dependent protein complex resulting in inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein which is an important tumor suppressor protein and cell cycle check 66of note coronavirus accessory proteins such as the 7a protein also mediate apoptosis by interfering with bcl-x an antiapoptotic protein additionally coronavirus accessory proteins 3a and 9b as well as structural proteins such as s e m and n modulate apoptosis by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and activating the p38 mapk pathway figure 3 6768collectively adverse cellular responses to dna damage and diminished dna repair capacity have been associated with genome instability and a decline in immune system function this hallmark of aging not only is likely to be a risk for poor outcomes in older adults but also is likely to be amplified by coronavirus infectionmitochondria through several functions play pivotal roles in cell homeostasis they play a powerhouse role with metabolic oxidation via the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the production of adenosine triphosphate via the electron transport chain and the beta-oxidation of fatty acids with aging mitochondrial phosphorylation capacity is decreased accordingly the increased energy expenditure secondary to a cytokine storm can lead to a nonadaptive state overwhelming the metabolic reserve capacity of mitochondria among older adults who have covid-19 as a normal body function against pathogens mitochondria also produce reactive oxygen species ros 69 however excessive ros production can be damaging in a similar way to encountering coronavirus infection 70 moreover augmented ros production known as one of the contemporary theories of aging has been associated with age-related diseases and decreased life span 71 though diminished with aging detoxifying systems including catalase superoxide dismutase glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase with selenium and magnesium as their cofactors 72 vitamins e and c and coenzyme q10 all help minimize ros-induced tissue damage 73 supplementation with coenzyme q10 an integral part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain has been linked with antioxidant activity less severe respiratory viral infections and less severe inflammatory response 74as mentioned above mitochondria regulate innate and adaptive immunity eg viral rna activates mitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins via rig-i on mitochondria which in turn stimulate nf-b nlrp3 pathways and interferon regulatory factors mitochondria also mediate cytotoxic responses to lung cell stress 7576together the combination of impaired respiration diminished adenosine triphosphate production increased ros and reduced detoxification capacity with dysregulated immune functions seems likely to play a pivotal role in the increased inflammation and severity of covid-19with aging epigenomic alterations play a pivotal role in distinguishing immune cell phenotypes and regulating inflammatory responses to intrinsic or extrinsic stressors age is one of the main drivers of variations in chromatin structure measured by the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing atac-seq 53 specific epigenetic modifications such as chromatin accessibility via histone acetylationmethylation play essential roles in response to viral infection 7779 shared epigenomic patterns of aging result in decreases in nave t cells and increases in monocytes and cytotoxic cell functions however the magnitude of alterations is more significant in men than in women with an accompanied loci-specific methylation decline in the b cells 53 as such sex and age differences in epigenetic patterns of immune cells in part can explain variability in the severity of covid-19moreover the epigenetic changes in cpg-sites located in subtelomeric regions that control innate immunity can mediate inflammatory responses to covid-19 chronic viral infection can accelerate aging as measured by the epigenetic clock 80 it remains to be elucidated whether these epigenetic clocks based on chronological or biological age 8081 can predict the severity of covid-19 and subsequent exacerbation of chronic diseases in covid-19 survivorstelomeres which are repetitive nucleotides ttagggn at the ends of each chromosome play a role in maintaining genome stability and regulate innate immunity in response to viral infection regions near telomeres called subtelomeres contain cg-enriched genes that regulate innate immunity 82 influenced by telomere length these genes regulate telomere repeat-containing rna terra transcription and their expression can be upregulated in response to viral infection via activation of interferon-stimulated genes therefore diverse telomere lengths often observed with aging immune cells 83 can underlie differential responses to viral challenge 82 another consequence of telomere attrition is the premature induction of genome instability in viral-specific cd8 memory t cells that results in senescent or antiapoptotic cells 84 thus telomere attrition coupled with dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection is another hallmark of aging that can contribute to the severe outcomes in older adults with covid-19the process of autophagy is modified by aging and thus can play a role in controlling viral infection through diminished viral degradation as well as by dysregulating innate and adaptive immunity 85the autophagy process includes the functions of several protein complexes in the absence of stress the mtorc1ulk12 complex inhibits the initiation of autophagy under stress including viral infections mtorc1 is inhibited which subsequently activates a series of proteins that result in the induction of autophagy and virion encapsulation and degradation of viral particles 86moreover autophagy regulates the bridge between the innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection by inducing antigen-presenting cells such as b cells macrophages and dendritic cells antigen-presenting cells in turn present viral antigens to cd4 t cells to release cytokines and regulate adaptive immune responses the early autophagic process induces the release of interferon-gamma ifn- from cd4 t cells to promote cd8 t cells nk cells and macrophages in response to viral infection 87 moreover the autophagic process controls the inflammatory response preventing the accumulation of ros and the inflammasome pathway via targeting pro-il-1 for lysosomal degradation 88 while some viruses evade the direct autophagy-mediated function immune-mediated effects of autophagy can still control viral infection and inflammatory-mediated tissue damage therefore impaired autophagy a hallmark of aging possibly contributes to the severity of covid-19 and poor outcomes in older patients niclosamide and valinomycin two fda-approved drugs for other purposes enhance autophagy and diminish viral replication 89 however the antiviral effect of polyamines such as spermidine a bolster of autophagy has been debated 90 of note rapamycin and its analogs and also vitamin d3 drugs with suggestive antiaging effects have antiviral efficacy by increasing autophagy 91 despite its immunosuppressive effects in transplant patients rapamycin inhibition of mtorc1 improves immune function in older adults and increases the response to vaccines some clinical trials using rapamycin have shown no serious side effects in humans 9295 therefore rapamycin by improving immunity is expected to improve outcomes in older adults with covid-19clinical manifestations of covid-19 have indicated that hostvirus interactions such as cytokine storm and coagulopathy underlying comorbidities and possibly polypharmacy are all possible culprits for the spectrum of covid-19 severity to combat both acute and chronic conditions related to covid-19 enhancing response to the vaccine and antiviral therapies using drugs that boost immune system response and enhance body system health is warranted older adults with an attenuated response to vaccine or antiviral medications might skew the pandemic figure toward epidemy in the older population therefore some antiaging modalities possibly attenuate the severity of covid-19 and increase response to vaccines when they become available thus combating sars-cov-2 requires methods that go beyond direct targeting of the virus to include those approaches that support bodily system function via improving immunity especially in older adultsas such interfering with pathways associated with the hallmarks of aging has the potential to improve the response to antiviral drugs 96 potential drugs include agents that reduce mitochondrial ros production and boost the immune system rapamycin has been shown to increase the immune response to the influenza vaccine and boost immune function in older adults 9394 metformin an old antidiabetic drug and also a candidate antiaging modality interferes with viral replication and hostviral interactions 97 increasing sirt6 an enzyme regulating multiple age-related signaling pathways has been shown to reduce the immense inflammatory response to the fatal dengue virus infection 98 some of the chloroquine-related family drugs which are treatment candidates for prevention and treatment of covid-19 also interfere with beta-galactosidase a marker of senescence in cells 99 however the efficacy and safety of chloroquine drugs in older adults require more dataalthough lists of drugs and vitamins have been suggested 100 at this writing none of the ongoing clinical trials has considered recruiting older patients thus the impact of all potential therapies and safety in older adults remains to be determined we suggest an accelerated understanding of the interactions between covid-19 and the host hallmarks of aging in order to identify biomarkers with which to screen individuals at higher risk understanding the mechanisms of covid-19 will likely arise from comparing the disease risks and response to treatments in young men and women with covid-19 versus older patientsto do this we need to include older adults in clinical trialsthe covid-19 outbreak is a worldwide public health problem with health consequences that are likely to persist for many years currently older adults and patients with comorbidities and other unknown risk factors have developed more severe and critical complications and therefore are at higher mortality risk both the incidence and severity of disease appear to be more prominent in men than women which can be partially explained by both age-dependent and -independent sex dimorphism in the immune system coronaviruses use host factors for replication these factors are affected by age and the same mechanisms as those linked with the hallmarks of aging some of the hallmarks of aging coupled with immune system responses and comorbidities seem likely to play a pivotal role in the severity of covid-19 innate immunity with cytokine storms coagulopathy neutralizing antibodies cellular immune responses such as cd4 and cd8 t cells b cells nk cells monocytes and macrophages and inflammatory host responses along with specific virus antigen epitopesall have interactive roles in disease development diminished reserves and stress response capacity coupled with the reduced immune response to vaccines place older adults at higher risk for critical health complications and mortality especially during times of acute stress together with antiviral interventions the key hallmarks of aging can offer insights for the identification and treatment of patients most at risk and help elucidate the basis for age and sex differences in response to such stressors application of candidate antiaging drugs such as rapamycin and metformin and antiviral drugs with potential senolytic effects possibly boost the immune system of older adults further investigation requires immediate attention such drugs can also prevent the possible post-covid-19 accumulation of morbidities and accelerated biology of aginglactic acid bacteria lab are a group of gram-positive bacteria that includes species of lactobacillus leuconostoc pediococcus and streptococcus consumed for centuries lab has enjoyed a long and safe association with humans and animals for healthy food over the past decade there has been increasing interest in the use of lab as mucosal delivery vehicles the application of lab stems from research into effective strategies to deliver vaccine antigens which may come into contact with the mucosal tissues for the first time such as the intranasal oral and genital mucosal surfaces lavelle and ohagan 2006 malik et al 2007 mucosal delivery of therapeutics or vaccines for chronic diseases and infections of mucosal origin could increase their potency and specificity because the mucosal immune system builds an effective iga barrier in no more than 3 days contact with the mucosal tissues will neutralize the pathogenic microorganism outside of the host there are abundant studies in the field of lab vaccines one major advantage of the use of lab as a delivery vehicle for vaccines is that the bacteria can elicit both antigen-specific secretory immunoglobulin ig a and an effective systemic immune response the specific igas have the same function as the neutralizing iggs some candidate lab vaccines elicited antigen-specific iga responses in faeces saliva or bronchoalveolar and intestinal lavage fluids wells and mercenier 2008 additionally lactobacilli are probiotics that may confer health benefits to the host bengmark and gil 2006 corthesy et al 2007 isolauri et al 2002 saarela et al 2000 and there is accumulating evidence that lactobacilli are effective at preventing intestinal disease in both humans and animals due to their ability to inhibit pathogen adhesion to the intestinal wall and prevent inflammatory processes blum and schiffrin 2003 de vrese and marteau 2007 ouwehand 2007 sartor 2005 sheil et al 2007 because the porcine digestive tract is similar to the digestive tract of human infants with respect to anatomical and histological features and digestive physiology kararli 1995 oswald et al 2003 tadros et al 2003 the pig has been used as an animal model to study gastrointestinal diseases of human infants gunzer et al 2002 and vaccination studies against these diseasescoronaviruses covs comprise a large family of enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses that infect a broad range of animal hosts as well as humans well-known representatives are porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus porcine respiratory cov porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus canine cov feline cov bovine cov human covs severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated cov murine hepatitis virus mhv avian cov infectious bronchitis virus ibv and turkey cov tcov the most famous and critical coronavirus is the middle east respiratory syndrome virus found in africa and asia siddell et al 1983 this study investigates whether mucosal immunization is effective in stimulating a protective immune response against cov infection transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev which is a member of the genus coronavirus family coronaviridae and order nidovirales is an enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes highly fatal acute diarrhoea in newborn pigs cavanagh 1997 the viral rna consists of a single strand comprised of three major structural proteins a phosphorylated nucleoprotein n protein and two glycoproteins the membrane m and the spike s proteins schwegmann-wessels and herrler 2006 the s protein has four sites a b c and d both the a and d sites were demonstrated to induce tgev-neutralizing antibodies di-qiu et al 2011 however the a site is highly glycosylated and thus is not suitable for expression in the lab prokaryotic expression vector additionally the different tgev sites induce different immune responses following infection with virulent transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus isolated mesenteric lymph node cd4 t cells mounted a specific proliferative response against infectious or inactivated purified virus upon secondary in vitro stimulation anton et al 1996 the peptide n321 defines a functional t helper epitope that elicits t cells capable of collaborating with b cells specific for different tgev proteins anton et al 1995 the most important finding is that oral immunization with a recombinant lactobacillus vaccine and infection with tgev elicit various immune responses such as humoral immunity and cellular immunity here an oral lactobacillus casei vaccine against anti-transmissible gastroenteritis virus developed in our laboratory was used to study the mucosal immune response jiang et al 2014 in this l casei vaccine repetitive peptides expressed by l casei specifically the mdp and tuftsin fusion protein mt are repeated 20 times and the d antigenic site of the tgev spike s protein is repeated six timesthe pig model was developed to study intestinal mucosal immune responses ruan and zhang 2013 probiotic feed supplementation may benefit the animal host directly by preventing infection and combating the causative agent of the intestinal disorder by balancing the disrupted equilibrium of the enteric flora and augmenting the hosts immune responses however lab vaccine has not received national law or certification for human or animal use against coronaviruses the first clinical trial to use recombinant lab demonstrated that the containment strategy for l lactis expressing recombinant il-10 was effective against crohns disease braat et al 2006 our laboratory has researched the lab vaccine for more than one decade and we have developed many lab vaccines in the field of piglet diarrhoea di-qiu et al 2011 liu et al 2011 qiao et al 2009 yigang and yijing 2008 this study is the last step to obtain new drug certification in china this lactobacillus vaccine has been demonstrated to increase the treg population in the mouse model jiang et al 2014 tregs effectively depressed t and b cell proliferation and some studies demonstrated that this regulation also depressed proliferation in inflammatory bowel disease our study investigated whether the recombinant lactobacillus vaccine gradually increased the breg and treg populations during the immunization process at the first step of immunization unpublished data the intestinal immune system of the pig maintains its ability to mount an active immune response against pathogens and exhibits tolerance to at least food antigens and probably commensal flora through an extremely complex network of cellular and humoral immune interactions consequently it is important to elucidate the immunological inductive sites of the protective mucosal immune response following oral immunization in pigsthis vaccine could induce tgev antibody immune responses in both the humoral and mucosal immune systems mdp and tuftsin possess substantial immunopotentiating properties and can induce cellular-mediated immune responses upon oral administration in mice however their use in oral vaccines against tgev challenge in the pig host may have different results furthermore the only host and target of the vaccine of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus is the weaning piglet there have been no clear reports concerning whether tgev infection stimulates th1 or th2-type immune response the relationship between humoral and cellular immune responses is not clear moreover whether the systemic or mucosal lymphoid response will be the primary immune response following oral immunization is unknown at present we are not certain which pathway the lactobacillus vaccine will provoke against tgev infection our study is the first to analyse immunity in response to oral immunization and tgev infectionthe l casei atcc 39392 strain used in this study was deposited in atcc and is a plasmid-free strain grown in manrogosasharpe mrs medium sigma at 37 c without shaking the recombinant l casei pg612-20mt6d was generated in previous study jiang et al 2014 chloramphenicol cm and kanamycin sigma were each used at a final concentration of 10 gml tgev was previously isolated and purified in our laboratory swine testicle st cells were cultured in dulbeccos modified eagles medium dmem gibco supplemented with 10  foetal bovine serum fbs gibco at 37 c with 5  co2 the virus stocks were clarified by centrifugation at 800g for 10 min to remove cell debris titrated using the cytopathic effect assay and then stored in aliquots at 80 c until neededtgev-seronegative crossbreed large white piglets were obtained from a local breeding farm after birth the piglets were housed separately in specialized cages that were maintained in sterile stainless steel isolators five pigletsisolator and fed commercial sterile milk and water four groups n  5 each of piglets were orally dosed with 1010 cfu of pg612-20mt6d in 1 ml of pbs or pbs alone jiang et al 2014 this formulation was used to immunize piglets via an intragastric route in a different immunization protocol the first group was immunized with pg612-20mt6d in 1 ml for priming the second group was immunized with pg612-20mt6d in 2 ml for priming the third group was immunized with pg612-20mt6d in 2 ml for 48 consecutive hours the forth group was immunized with pg612-20mt6d in 1 ml for 48 consecutive hours the control group was immunized with pbs the piglets were handled and maintained under strict ethical conditions according to international recommendations for animal welfareseven days after immunization serum samples were prepared from collected blood samples the intestinal mucus was collected by rectal swab and subsequently homogenized for 30 min in 400 l of sterile pbs ph 74 containing 001 moll edta-na2 and then incubated for 12 h at 4 c clear extracts of all samples were collected by centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min and stored at 80 c with protease inhibitors for subsequent analysisenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa plates were coated for 18 and 12 h at 4 c with full tgev and the vp4 protein respectively which were previously isolated and purified in our laboratory cultured st cells were used as a negative antigen control after the wells were blocked for 12 h at 4 c with pbs containing 5  skim milk the plates were washed three times with pbs  tween 20 01  pbst mucus and serum diluted 150 samples were added to the wells in triplicate and incubated for 1 h at 37 c afterwards the plates were washed three times with pbst and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-pig igg or iga antibody invitrogen was added to each well 15000 and incubated for an additional 1 h at 37 c after another round of washing colour development was accomplished using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride as a substrate and the absorbance was measured at 490 nmnaive purified spleen t cells 5  105 cellsml were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates and stimulated with 10 g ml1 of plate-bound anti-cd4pe antibody abcam in complete rpmi 1640 medium single-cell suspensions were stimulated in culture with ionomycin 2 g ml1 in the presence of monensin 2 m for 46 h of culture the cells were surface labelled and then fixed permeabilized and intracellularly labelled with ifn- and il-4 antibodies as previously described moore-connors et al 2013 zhou et al 2009 for th1 and th2 differentiation the cells were stimulated in the presence of 10 ng ml1 anti-ifn fitc and 10 ng ml1 anti-il-4 fitc abcam antibodies the cells were labelled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidylester cfse according to a previous protocol jiang et al 2014 the data were acquired by gating on the cd4 cell population with a facscalibur cytometer the sequential loss of cfse fluorescence was used to measure cell division and proliferationgroups were housed in the same facility but separated by room and ventilation system pigs in each room were confined by pens on a solid floor that was rinsed daily fed a balanced diet ad libitum based on weight and provided free access to water tgev-challenged pigs received a 5 ml dose of 1  105 plaque-forming units pfuml via oral-gastric gavage on 0 days post-inoculation dpi pigs in the control group were administered volume-matched virus-free cell culture media the control immunized and no challenge group pigs were randomly selected for necropsy on the fourth dayto assess histological changes in the intestinal tissues both the intestine and other major organs were examined at necropsy after 48 h of fixation in 10  neutral buffered formalin tissue sections were trimmed processed and embedded in paraffin sectioned stained with haematoxylin and eosin he and then examined for pathological changes by light microscopy using a model microscope olympus tokyo japanreal-time rt-pcr qrt-pcr was employed to determine the amount of tgev and cytokine gene products isgs in rectal swab samples and the intestinal tissues using a cfx96tm real-time pcr detection system bio-rad total rna was extracted from faecal samples and splenic and intestinal tissues using viral rna extraction and total rna extraction kits intron according to the manufacturers instructions the extracted rna was subjected to real-time qrt-pcr using a one-step sybr qrt-pcr reagent kit takara shiga japan following reverse-transcription of the viral rna at 45 c for 20 min the resulting cdnas were used for real-time pcr amplification a standard curve was generated by plotting threshold values against serially diluted plasmid dna encoding the fragment of the tgev spike protein lee et al 2011 all determinations were performed using data from wells evaluated in duplicate to ensure reproducibility the copy number of the experimental samples was determined by interpolating the threshold cycle values using the standard curve real-time quantitative pcr was utilized to quantify the products of interest trl-2 4 9 il-4 il-17 ifn- and tgf- relative to the quantity of messenger rna mrna in the total rna isolated from the splenic and intestinal tissues dirisala et al 2013 kiros et al 2011 the specific primers are listed in table 1 the livak method ct method was used to calculate the fold change compared to the -actin gene control gene expression data were expressed relative to unimmunized and uninfected piglets
to phenotype immune cells in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes single-cell suspensions were isolated and labelled with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to determine the cell type and the frequency of ifn- and il-4-producing th1 and th2 cells single-cell suspensions were stimulated in culture with ionomycin 2 g ml1 in the presence of monensin 2 m for 46 h the cells were surface labelled to detect cd4 and then fixed permeabilized and intracellularly labelled with ifn- and il-4 antibodies as previously described moore-connors et al 2013 zhou et al 2009comparison of the piglets iga and igg titres was conducted by a paired t test the th cell cytokine expression and faecal pedv rna shedding titres among litters were compared using one way analysis of variance anova followed by duncans multiple range testthe mucosal immune response of the piglets was evaluated by measuring the iga response in diluted intestinal lavage fluid post-intragastric immunization as shown in fig 1a the newborn piglets that received 2 ml of recombinant lactobacillus pg612-20mt6d had the highest mucosal iga levels after immunization the iga levels at 48 h in the piglets that received 4 ml were slightly lower than the newborn piglets that received 2 ml throughout the process the vaccine doses also provoked systemic immunity based on the serum analysis and elicited specific igg responses from the immunized piglets fig 1b newborn piglets that received 2 ml of the vaccine also had the highest specific igg level the specific igg titre reached as high as 11600 finally the antibody kinetics in the serum and intestinal lavage samples from the animals showed that the specific antibody igg and iga levels were increased on the seventh and eighth days and the titre was decreased during the last week without immunization
to analyse the effect of recombinant lactobacillus pg 612-20mt6d on t helper cells we evaluated t helper cell polarization throughout the process we utilized the model of immunization described here as shown in fig 2 the immune response balance mediated by th1 and th2 was broken in favour of th1-mediated immunity
the pg612-20mt6dl casei group exhibited 80  protection within 4 days of challenge with tgev pg612-20mt6dl casei fig 3 in contrast the control group piglets immunized with pbs all died after tgev challenge all piglets that diedwere killed were emaciated and had yellow faeces coating the skin and hair in some piglets the intestinal lumens were filled with large amounts approximately 5070 ml of yellowish foamy fluid in other piglets the walls of the small intestine were transparent and thin and the intestinal lumens were empty no significant gross lesions were observed in other major organs lung kidney liver and heart
formalin-fixed intestinal tissue sections from piglets treated with different treatment modalities were blindly analysed for histopathological changes associated with tgev infection according to the histopathological analysis the small intestine samples from the three groups positive negative and immunized groups showed obvious differences as indicated in fig 4 different degrees of pathological changes were detected after infection especially in the positive group where serious damage was observed the representative pathological changes included intestinal villi hyperaemia atrophy and destruction in the pbs infection group the jejunum villi were severe atrophied and destroyed and the ilea exhibited severe lymphocyte proliferation in the lamina propria the recombinant lactobacillus group showed jejuna with intact villi but low-grade hyperaemia and lymphocyte proliferation and the ilea exhibited lymphocyte proliferation in the lamina propria both the pbs and vaccine groups had severe inflammatory responses the negative control piglets that were not infected showed normal histology
piglets inoculated with virulent tgev shed the virus for 12 h followed by profuse diarrhoea that led the piglets to the verge of death 14 days after inoculation the tgev load shed in the diarrhoea was 32  105 copies at the 12th hour peaked at 172  106 copies at the 48th hour and then decreased until death in the pbs group fig 5 the recombinant lactobacillus vaccine group pg612-20mt6d exhibited the same trend the tgev copy number was 105 at the 12th hour and the copies reached a peak at the 48th hour the copy numbers were similar and followed the same trend after reaching the peak however the copy numbers in the pg612-20mt6d group were significantly lower than in the pbs group
next we investigated the generation of lactobacillus vaccine-induced regulatory cells after infection in piglets as shown in fig 6 there was a marked increase in the production of il-4 in cd4 t cells the th1 immune response induced by the vaccine was seriously broken in favour of th2-mediated systemic and mucosal immunity post-infection the systemic th2 immune response was higher than the mucosal th2-mediated immune response after tgev infection the body activated more th2 to protect itself in response to the infection
as shown in fig 7 toll-like receptor tlr expression was detected in the splenic lymphocytes sl and mesenteric lymph node cells ml in the piglets in the pbs and vaccine groups tlr-2 was higher in the vaccine group than in the pbs group in contrast there were no significant differences between tlr-4 and tlr-9 however the three tlrs exhibited the same trends in the mesenteric lymph node cells compared with the pbs and lactobacillus vaccine tgev infection induced tlr expression and especially enhanced tlr-2 and tlr-4 expression but the expression levels in the lactobacillus vaccine group were significantly lower than the levels in the pbs group cytokine expression in the splenic lymphocytes and mesenteric lymph node cells was also analysed and compared in our study the ifn- il-4 and il-17 levels in the splenic lymphocytes from the lactobacillus vaccine group showed marked changes whereas no significant difference was observed in the level of tgf- tgev infection stimulated cytokine expression in the pbs group including ifn- and il-4 the vaccine group did not express a notably higher level of ifn- and il-4 compared with the pbs group the tgf- expression level in the mesenteric lymph node cells was lower in the vaccine group than in the pbs group the same trend was observed with ifn- and il-4 the vaccine group provoked higher il-17 expression than the pbs group following tgev infection the il-17 expression levels in both the splenic lymphocytes and the mesenteric lymph node cells had the same trend in the pbs and lactobacillus vaccine groups
probiotics are well known to have additive effects on human health in terms of improving the gut microflora and modulating immune responses villena et al 2006 studies have also reported that probiotic feeding results in an increased spleen mass followed by higher levels of total serum proteins increased globulin levels and enhanced production of secretory iga dock et al 2004 in humans lactobacilli colonize the distal small bowel and the large intestine different probiotic bacteria possess various mechanisms including adhesins andor coaggregation factors which aid in adhesion and colonization friedrich 2013 during this period immunization with recombinant lactobacillus is crucially important on the effects of immunization such as the timing of the first immunization in the protocol and the dose from these results we show that the immune response in response to the first priming immunization dose is better than the response to the second immunization because the priming dose is better at initiating adhesion and colonization in the piglet interestingly the mucins are large glycoproteins that are the major organic components of mucus the mucin protein content of the mucus is 20  whereas the carbohydrates comprise 70 to 80  by weight intestinal mucin has been shown to inhibit the replication of rotavirus in vitro chen et al 1993 superti et al 1993 additionally a high dose of lactobacillus adversely affects the immunization there is some evidence of diarrhoea after a double dose of the lactobacillus vaccine but from this result we find that the two-dose immunization is still the best immunization plan the reason for the diarrhoea after immunization is the overdose of lactobacillus which is a type of microbe that causes a disturbance in the intestinal microbial flora for short time many enteric pathogens must first adhere to the intestinal epithelial cells to initiate intestinal disease limiting access of the pathogens to intestinal epithelial cells is one strategy to prevent disease that has been investigated previously for example the competitive inhibition of bacterial adherence by mimicry of receptors on the apical surface of enterocytes using oral administration of sialylated glycoproteins has been shown to protect newborn calves from the enterotoxigenic e coli strain k99 mouricout et al 1990 lactobacillus must colonize the gut soon after birth therefore the vaccine could play a role in non-specific immunity probiotic strains with a high adherence capacity have been demonstrated to enhance the immunoglobulin a response to rotavirus kaila et al 1992in this study we observed a significant increase in the anti-tgev iga titre in the intestinal tract of piglets administered recombinant l casei furthermore we showed that the diarrhoea state of piglets administered l casei was significantly lower than that of piglets administered saline in the murine model of ifv infection the virus moves from the upper respiratory tract to the lower respiratory tract hori et al 2001 hrv-vaccinated and lactobacillus acidophilus-fed pigs had a significantly higher magnitude of hrv-specific iga and igg antibody-secreting cell responses in the ileum and serum igg antibody and virus neutralizing antibody titres compared to hrv-vaccinated pigs without l acidophilus colonization zhang et al 2008 our immunization stimulated the same systemic specific igg titres the specific antibody response neutralized the challenged tgev and the load of tgev in the diarrhoea was significantly decreased the mucosal immune response formed the first barrier function to neutralize tgev in large scale swine farm surveillance lower piglet birth weight and higher within-litter variability in birth weight were factors associated with higher losses from birth to weaning yuan et al 2015 during tgev infection it is likely that the stronger piglets obtained more iga than their non-immunized counterparts and thus were more likely to survive until the intestinal villi regenerated and immunity developed during the histopathological analysis some damage was observed in the small intestine for instance the villus wall of the control groups was thin and almost transparent probably due to atrophy lymphocyte proliferation in the intestinal lamina propria was also found in some piglets administered an oral dose of recombinant lactobacillus indicating that recombinant lactobacillus induced a mucosal immune responses in the piglets taken together our data show the tremendous potential for recombinant lactobacillus to enable rapid and effective treatment for tgev infection with intestinal tropism in pigletswe evaluated the specific t cell immune responses induced by the recombinant l casei vaccine compared with the pbs control group in the piglets we demonstrated that l casei significantly enhanced the immunogenicity of the tgev vaccine as indicated by the significantly higher magnitude of specific ifn--producing cd4 t cell responses there has reported that mice fed recombinant l casei with the adjuvant mdp and tuftsin have significantly higher th1 and th17 production than control group mice jiang et al 2014 these results were the same and indicated that l casei had a strong potentiating effect on both the cellular and humoral immunity induced by the oral l casei vaccine similarly a previous study showed that oral intake of l fermentum cect5716 significantly enhanced serum th1 type cytokine production and influenza-specific iga antibody responses to an intramuscular influenza vaccine in adults olivares et al 2007the mesenteric lymph nodes were primarily used to analyse tgev infection and the immunoprotection provided by the lactobacillus vaccine in terms of mucosal immunization and infection ifn- induction by tgev results from interactions between an outer membrane domain of el and the pbmc membrane charley and laude 1988 however these authors did not study the expression of il-4 by pbmcs the expression of ifn- was higher than il-4 in the immunized group and the th1th2 balance was broken in our study after immunization with recombinant lactobacillus ifn- played a major role in the mucosal immune response however after tgev infection the systemic and local immune responses shifted from th1 to th2 the systemic humoral immune response was stronger than the cellular immune response after tgev infection this is the first study to demonstrate that tgev infection polarized the immune response to th2 immunity and that recombinant lactobacillus could weaken tgev infection in the form of th2 immunity from these results we found that the immunization did not polarize th2 immunity more seriously compared to the pbs control group the protein-based sars coronavirus vaccine boost induced similar levels of th1 and neutralizing antibody responses that protected vaccinated mice from subsequent sars-cov challenges but induced stronger th2 and ctl responses zheng et al 2008 the uv-inactivated sars coronavirus vaccine retained its immunogenicity and promoted th2-type immune responses tsunetsugu-yokota et al 2007 the activation of th2 responses such as il-10 stimulate b cell proliferation which can produce specific and non-specific anti-infection antibodies grodeland et al 2015 similarly both t and b cells have functions following lactobacillus vaccination the production of il-9 by th2 cells results in the proliferation of mast cell growth and il-13 stimulates epithelial cell growth tukler henriksson et al 2015 the proliferation of epithelial cells is crucial for tgev infection the th2 response could also stimulate the production of mucus by epithelial cells zhang et al 2015il-17 cells play an essential role in mhv-induced immunopathology and ifn- is important for maintaining the immune balance between th1 and th17 responses during acute viral infection yang et al 2011 however the th1th2 balance in the negative control group was different than the balance in the immunized group tgev affects both systemic and local cellular immunity without immunization il17 has been reported to have both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects lafdil et al 2009 nagata et al 2008 our results showed that the immunized piglets provoked il-17 expression form both the systematic and mucosal immune responses after tgev infection compared with the mucosal immune response il-17 expression in the mesenteric lymph nodes was markedly lower than the expression in the spleen cells however il-17 expression in the pbs group was lower than the expression level in the immunized groups indicating that the lactobacillus vaccine group activated il-17 expression during tgev infection swine-origin influenza a virus-infected patients exhibited rapid lymphopenia t cell activation and a preferential loss of the th17 subset during the early stage of acute infection jiang et al 2010 which was consistent with the first reports that swine-origin virus inhibited th17 proliferation after infection our study also found the same phenomenon after coronavirus infection in swine compared with the immunized group the most important finding was that the oral recombinant lactobacillus vaccine stimulated th17 cell proliferation the proliferation was involved in cytokine and chemokine production neutrophil recruitment promotion of t cell priming and antibody production dirisala et al 2013 th17 responses are protective against lethal influenza virus infection in il-10-deficient mice mckinstry et al 2009 in contrast a deleterious role of il-17 has been proposed to contribute to the acute lung injury associated with il-17-mediated neutrophil recruitment during influenza virus infection crowe et al 2009 there were significant changes in the il-4 and ifn- expression levels in the mesenteric lymph node cells compared with the pbs group moreover il-4 expression was higher than ifn- expression in the spleen cells the expression of il-4 and ifn- indicated that the recombinant lactobacillus effectively inhibited inflammation after tgev infectionin this study we also evaluated tlr-2 tlr-4 and tlr-9 expression in piglets immunized with recombinant l casei and then challenged with tgev previously tlr expression in pigs has been studied only at the mrna level in lymphocytes using real-time pcr because antibodies against porcine tlrs are not currently available tgev infection did not induce tlr-2 tlr-4 and tlr-9 expression in the spleen cells however tlr expression was significantly different in the mesenteric lymph node cells compared with the pbs and lactobacillus vaccine groups tlr expression was extremely high in the pbs group compared with the other groups the cytokine and tlr expression levels in the splenic lymphocytes are indicators of systemic immunity whereas the expression in the mesenteric lymph node cells was associated with the local and mucosal immune responses the expression levels of all tlrs in mesenteric lymph node cells were higher in the pbs group than the vaccine group suggesting that the lactobacillus vaccine effectively inhibited tlr expression the recombinant lactobacillus groups exhibited jejuna and ilea with lymphocyte proliferation in the lamina propria transmissible gastroenteritis tge coronavirus infection resulted in antibody production from primed mesenteric lymph node cells following an in vitro boost with viral antigen berthon et al 1990 as an intestinal infectious disease tgev would attack the intestinal tissue and local immune system exposure of pigs to tgev or prcv results in distinct disease patterns related to differences in tissue tropism saif 1996 however the increased frequencies of tlr-2 and tlr-9 expression in pigs may simply be due to the significantly higher counts of l casei or mdp and tuftsin which may translate to an increased magnitude of tlr agonists available to stimulate the host mucosal immune system it is likely that the higher lab count in the lab plus hrv group played a more pertinent role in the significant increases in tlr2 and tlr9 expression wen et al 2009 taken together tgev immune protection was primarily dependent on the mucosal immune response systemic immunity did not play a key role after tgev infection interestingly il-17 expression in the vaccine group was significant higher than il-17 expression in the pbs group challenged with tgev and th17 played an anti-inflammatory role in mucosal immunity il-17 also stimulated intestinal epithelial cell differentiation and growthin conclusion our study suggests that the recombinant lactobacillus vaccine provokes specific mucosal and systemic immune responses to protect piglets from infection iga played a dominant role in the mucosal immune response after tgev challenge therefore the histopathology and rna copy numbers directly demonstrated that the lactobacillus vaccine was effective for tgev infection the protective efficacy was significantly higher which would have great value in practice moreover although the recombinant lactobacillus vaccine-induced th1 immunity the immune balance was broken by tgev infection thus the immunized piglets initiated a th2 immune response against tgev infection taken together we showed that il-17 signalling was vital for lactobacillus vaccine immunized piglets infected with tgev the lactobacillus vaccine also inhibited tlr expression which indicated that most of virus was neutralized because the tlrs were not activated by the virusas of 28 april 2020 worldwide there were more than 29 million confirmed cases of covid-19 with a mortality of about 203000 in the usa there were more than 968000 confirmed cases of covid-19 and more than 54000 deaths 3 the complete clinical manifestation is not clear yet as the reported symptoms range from mild-to-severe and may result in the mortality just indicated 4 fever cough myalgia or fatigue pneumonia and complicated dyspnea are the most commonly reported symptoms headache diarrhea hemoptysis runny nose and phlegm-producing cough are less commonly reported 4 patients with mild symptoms were reported to recover after 1 week while severe cases were reported to experience progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage from the virus which may lead to death 4 cases resulting in death were primarily middle-aged and elderly patients with pre-existing diseases chronic respiratory disease cancer tumor surgery cirrhosis hypertension coronary heart disease diabetes and parkinsons disease 4 risk factors include being elderly having poor immune function having chronic co-morbidities long-term usage of immunosuppressive agents and having a prior history of surgery before admission 4 case definition guidelines mention the following symptoms fever decrease in lymphocytes and white blood cells new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography and no improvement in symptoms after 3 days of antibiotics treatment 4 our understanding of co-morbidities and risk factors is evolving as clinical data emerges a recent study in the journal of the american medical association considered the characteristics clinical presentation and outcomes of patients hospitalized with covid-19 in the usa and found that of 5700 patients hospitalized with covid-19 in the new york city area the most common co-morbidities were hypertension obesity and diabetes among patients who were discharged or died n  2634 142 were treated in the intensive care unit 122 received invasive mechanical ventilation 32 were treated with kidney replacement therapy and 21 died 5additionally heart damage neurologic symptoms kidney damage and blood clots have been observed in covid-19 patients 6 one review found about 40 of seriously ill covid-19 patients in china experienced arrhythmias and 20 experienced other cardiac injuries a separate study of 416 hospitalized covid-19 patients in china found that 19 showed signs of heart damage and those patients were more likely to die 7 according to the study 51 of patients with heart damage died compared with 45 of patients who showed no signs of cardiac injury 7 a group of chinese doctors in another study published found that more than a third of 214 hospitalized covid-19 patients in wuhan had neurologic symptoms the most common of which were dizziness headaches impaired consciousness loss of taste and smell and skeletal-muscle injuries 8 more serious but less commonly reported symptoms included seizures and stroke according to the study 8 the findings have prompted doctors to begin performing simple neurological exams on covid-19 patients 6 also early data showed 1430 of icu covid-19 patients in new york and wuhan lost kidney function and later required dialysis 6 similarly a study found that nine of 26 people who died of covid-19 in wuhan had acute kidney injuries and seven had units of the new coronavirus in their kidneys 9 the new coronavirus also appears to produce blood clots that can travel from patients veins to their lungs causing a pulmonary embolism and other organs 6 chinese researchers in one report said they found small blood clots in about 70 of the patients who died of covid-19 and were included in the study in comparison the researchers found similar blood clots in fewer than one in 100 patients who survived the disease 6 in a separate peer-reviewed study of 81 patients in wuhan researchers wrote that 20 patients experienced pulmonary embolism and eight died from the condition 10 clinicians and researchers have yet to determine whether the new coronavirus is directly attacking those organs or whether the injuries are caused by the patients immune responses to infection 6 additionally there is variation in recovery in patients and evidence of long-term persistence of the virus that may be etiology of lung inflammation and pneumonitis and instances of hypoxia patients may be predisposed to cancer as a result of the organ damage the virus is associated withas shown in figure 1 sars-cov-2 covs are enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses with a nucleocapsid for addressing pathogenetic mechanisms of sars-cov-2 its viral structure and genome must be considered 2 in covs the genomic structure is organized in a ssrna of approximately 30 kb in length  the largest known rna viruses  and with a 5-cap structure and 3-poly-a tail figure 2 2 the virus goes from producing its rna to the creation of the of polyprotein 1a1ab pp1app1ab in the host 2 figure 3 shows how the viral replication-transcription complex is the product of the transcription apparatus which is housed in double-membrane vesicles formed from subgenomic rnas 2 open reading frames serve as templates for the production of the subgenomic mrnas in between these open reading frames transcription termination occurs at transcription regulatory sequences 2 at least six open reading frames are present including a frameshift able to block host innate immune response the viral envelope a structural protein confers viral pathogenicity since it promotes viral assembly and release however many of these features eg those of nonstructural protein 2 and 11 have not yet been described 2the spike glycoproteins of cov are composed of two subunits s1 and s2 the s2 protein is highly conserved and contains a fusion peptide a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain 2 the s subunits consists of homotrimers that compose the spikes on the viral surface which can transduce through host receptors thus it could be a target for antiviral anti-s2 compounds on the contrary the spike receptor-binding domain presents only a 40 amino acid identity with other sars-covs 2 other structural elements on which research must necessarily focus are the orf3b that has no homology with that of sars-covs and a secreted protein encoded by orf8 which is structurally different from those of sars-covmutations and strain recognitions can be determined from the sars-cov-2 gene sequences that were recently published a spike mutation which may have occurred in late 2019 triggered jumping to humans in particular sars-cov-2 gene sequence was compared with that of sars-cov they analyzed the transmembrane helical segments in the orf1ab encoded 2 nsp2 and nsp3 and found that position 723 presents a serine instead of a glycine residue while the position 1010 is occupied by proline instead of isoleucine 2 the matter of viral mutations is key for explaining potential disease relapsesthe current understanding of how a dysregulated immune response that causes lung immunopathology would lead to deleterious clinical manifestations after pathogenic hcov infections was reported in prior studies as early as 2017 channappanavar and perlman declared that recent identification of sars-like coronaviruses in bats and mers-cov in domesticated camels makes it likely that these viruses will continue to cross species barriers and cause additional outbreaks in human populations 11 these highly pathogenic hcovs cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in humans with a large fraction of patients developing short period of moderate clinical illness and a small but a substantial number of patients experiencing severe disease characterized by acute lung inflammation and acute respiratory disease 11there are certain inflammatory responses that may be conducive to cancer ifn- or inflammatory monocyte-macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines sensitized t cells to undergo apoptosis further impeding virus clearance 11 the loss of tir-domain-containing adapter-inducing ifn- trif an adapter molecule for tlr-3 and tlr-4 signaling resulted in a distinct inflammatory signature characterized by neutrophil and other inflammatory cell infiltration 11 a dysregulated immune response to sars-cov in trif-deficient mice was associated with aberrant antiviral ifn ifn- and ifn- pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine il-6 tnf ifn- and monocyte chemoattractant ccl5 and interferon-stimulated gene rsad2 ifit1 and cxcl10 responses another possible indicator of cancer risk 11multiple structural and nonstructural proteins of sars-cov antagonize interferon responses 5 very early after infection hcov reach high titers and sequester multiple proteins that inhibit the interferon response suggesting that immune response delay or evasion may be the result of early antagonism of the interferon 11 a dysfunctionally regulated inflammatory response and t-cell apoptotic sensitization is also further orchestrated by the delayed interferon signaling 11some consequences of cytokine storm and immunopathology are epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis and vascular leakage suboptimal t-cell response in other words cov-specific t cells are crucial for virus clearance and limit further damage to the host additionally t-cell responses also dampen overactive innate immune responses 11 exuberant inflammatory responses caused by pathogenic hcov diminish the t-cell response in the case of sars cov infection via tnf-mediated t-cell apoptosis thus resulting in uncontrolled inflammatory response accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages and altered tissue homeostasis and acute respiratory distress syndrome 11figure 4 demonstrates the enormous immune response against the novel coronavirus 12 the innate immune response and adaptive immunity have distinct responses to coronaviruses infection 12 the sars-cov-2 cov infects macrophages and then macrophages present cov antigens to t cells and this process leads to t-cell activation and differentiation including the production of cytokines associated with the different t-cell subsets ie t helper cells followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification 12 the continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on natural killer cells and cd8 t-cell activation and cd8 t cells produce very effective mediators to clear cov 6the attachment of cov to dpp4r on the host cell through s protein leads to the appearance of genomic rna in the cytoplasm an immune response to dsrna that results can be partially generated during cov replication tlr-3 sensitized by dsrna leads to cascades of signaling pathways irfs and nf-b activation respectively which are activated to produce type i interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines 12 the production of type i interferons is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells sometimes accessory proteins of cov can interfere with tlr-3 signaling and bind the dsrna of cov during replication to prevent tlr-3 activation and evade the immune response 12tlr-4 might recognize s protein and lead to the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the myd88-dependent signaling pathway viruscell interactions lead to the strong production of immune mediators 6 the secretion of large quantities of chemokines and cytokines il-1 il-6 il-8 il-21 tnf- and mcp-1 is promoted in infected cells in response to cov infection these chemokines and cytokines in turn recruit lymphocytes and leukocytes to the site of infection 12the host innate immune system detects viral infections by using prrs to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps at present the known prrs mainly include tlr rig-i-like receptor nod-like receptor c-type lectin-like receptors and free-molecule receptors in the cytoplasm such as cgas ifi16 sting and dai 12pamps recognized by tlrs include lipids lipoproteins proteins and nucleic acids of the bacterial viral parasite and fungal origins 12 the recognition of pamps by tlrs also occurs in cell membranes endosomes lysosomes and endocyte-lysosomes and other locations in cells 12 different tlrs can induce different biological responses via subsequent activation of varied adapter proteins such as myd88 tirap trip and tram but these adapter proteins all share the tir structure 12viral infection plays a key role in signaling factor activation that may have relevance for the initiation of cancer myd88 is the first identified tir family member which acts as an adapter protein it mainly activates the transcription factors nf-b and mapks pathways to induce inflammatory factors expression 12 additionally after a tlr is activated by the corresponding pamp myd88 recruits the receptor-related kinases irak4 iraki irak2 and irak-m irak4 plays an important role in activating nf-b and mapks downstream of myd88 irak interacts with traf6 which causes its k-63 ubiquitination and facilitates nemo ubiquitination to activate nf-b which may have implications for aberrant cell growth trif-dependent pathways activate irf3 and nf-b the function of tram and tirap is to recruit trif molecules to the tlr4 receptor and myd88 to the tlr2 and tlr4 receptors promoting cellular growth 12other signaling pathways are activated depletion of cd4 t cells is associated with reduced pulmonary recruitment of lymphocytes and neutralizing antibody and cytokine production resulting in a strong immune-mediated interstitial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of sars-cov from lungs 12 additionally t helper cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines via the nf-b signaling pathway il-17 cytokines recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the site of infection with inflammation and activate other downstream cytokine and chemokine cascades such as il-1 il-6 il-8 il-21 tnf- and mcp-1 12there may be a distinct association between novel coronavirus infection and the onset of cancer through the activation of the mapk and jakstat signaling pathways and the nf-b transcription factor the mapk signaling pathway activated upon covid-19 infection is involved in the tumorigenesis of a number of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma adrenocortical cancer endometrial cancer colorectal cancer and pituitary adenomas the rasmapk pathway is activated in 50100 of human hepatocellular carcinomas and is correlated with a poor prognosis 13 the mapk signaling pathway is also implicated in pituitary adenomas and because of the important roles of mapk signaling pathways in tumorigenesis the use of the mapk signaling pathways as therapeutic targets has continuously been considered as a promising strategy for pituitary adenoma therapy 14 in the context of the role of two of the mapk signaling pathways erks 12 and p38 data suggest that mek-mapk-erk signaling has a role in adrenocortical tumorigenesis that could be potentially used as a diagnostic marker for malignancy and targeted treatment in adrenocortical carcinoma 15 cholesterol in the form of ldl enhances intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer progression via activation of reactive oxygen species ros and signaling pathways including the mapk pathway 16 and the estrogen receptor- activates mapk signaling pathway to promote the development of endometrial cancer 17 the oncologic sequelae of covid-19 may include these cancers upon viral activation of the mapk signaling pathway these tumorigenic pathways may play a role in cancer initiation and progression in covid-19 infectionthe jakstat signaling pathway is also activated by type i interferon synthesis promoted by irf3 and irf7 activation this has been through prrs that recognize viral rna the activation jakstat signaling pathway has shown to be involved in tumorigenesis including t-cell lymphoma lung cancer and breast cancer gene expression profiling has implicated several intracellular signaling cascades including the jakstat pathway in the pathogenesis of particular subtypes of lymphoma 18 jakstat signaling pathways are mutationally activated in many extranodal t-cell lymphomas such as natural killert-cell and hepatosplenic t-cell lymphomas 19 since the jakstat pathway is considered to be a central player in inflammation-mediated tumorigenesis the implication of jakstat signaling and the therapeutic potential of jak12 inhibition was investigated in k-ras-driven lung adenocarcinoma and data showed that jak1 and jak2 are activated in human lung adenocarcinoma and that increased activation of jakstat signaling correlated with disease progression and k-ras activity in human lung adenocarcinoma 20 dysregulated jakstat signaling has been implicated in breast cancer metastasis which is associated with high relapse risks which may be mediated through gram1b 21nf-b and trif-dependent pathways are also activated and irf3 and ifn- are activated in turn 12 transcription factors irf3 and nf-b induce the gene expression of type i interferon through their activation by adaptor protein trif of tlrs tlrs classify these types of signaling pathways induced by viral infection the tlr signaling pathways are classified as the myd88-dependent pathway which functions to activate immune inflammatory factors and the trif-dependent pathway which then in turn functions to activate the type i interferons and inflammatory factors 12 nf-b-driven gene products include cytokineschemokines growth factors anti-apoptotic factors angiogenesis regulators and metalloproteinases and drive oncogenesis for instance many of the genes transcribed by nf-b promote gastric carcinogenesis since it has been shown that chemotherapy-caused cellular stress could elicit activation of the survival factor nf-b which leads to acquisition of chemoresistance the nf-b system is recommended for therapeutic targeting 22 prosaposin a neurotrophic factor promotes the proliferation and tumorigenesis of glioma through tlr4-mediated nf-b signaling pathways 23dendritic cells dcs also respond to the virus and their differentiation from precursor cells to mature cells may be inhibited as is the case with hiv-1 if their maturation is blocked by perhaps the lack of gm-csf il-4 and tnf- the adaptive immune response which plays a key role in the cancer-immunity cycle may be inhibited figure 5 dcs are the major antigen-presenting cells in the organism and contribute both types of immunity by activating t cells and b cells immature dcs have strong migration ability and mature dcs can effectively activate t cells in the central link of start-up regulation and maintenance of immune responses 6 thus if the maturation process of dcs is blocked it directly affects the initiation of subsequent adaptive immune responses that may need to be mobilized in attacking cancerother types of viruses have ostensible effects on adaptive immunity in the case of hiv-1 dc precursor cells cannot differentiate into dcs if transfected with hiv-1 nef protein in the presence of the inducers indicating that nef blocks the differentiation of dc precursor cells into mature dcs 12 additionally both the core protein and ns3 protein of hcv inhibits the expression of cd1a cd1b and dc-sign molecules on human peripheral blood mononuclear precursor cells which play an important role in the development of peripheral blood mononuclear precursor cells to dcs 12 in addition hiv-1 attenuates the mhc i on the surface of dcs thereby reducing the ability of dcs to present the viral antigens hiv-1 infection enhances the expression of dc-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrity dc-sign thus inhibiting cc chemokine receptor 7 and mhc-ii which are important receptors of dc homing 12 these results indicate that virus infection interferes with the differentiation and function of dcs hinders the subsequent adaptive immune response mediated by dcs and makes the virus evade the adaptive immune response of the host successfully 6 if these dc events are occurring cancer may co-opt normal cellular function and evade immune responses in a viral infection such as covid-19a cytokine storm an excessive immune reaction in the host also results from viral mechanisms that results in extensive tissue damage mediated by il-produced by activated leukocytes b lymphocyte differentiation cell growth stimulation and pathogenesis of some types for cancer may result these effects are linked to the function of structural and nonstructural proteins of the virus 2 cytokine release syndrome an immune-related adverse effect of chimeric antigen receptor t-cell therapies is also implicated in the potential emergence of cancer additionally as tissue damage envelopes the bodys physiological functioning and cellular resources are increasingly devoted to compensating for it cancer may emerge as a risk factor lung tissue damage a prevalent and major consequence of infection may be particularly at risk for developing into lung cancer and patients who experience these symptoms may need to be monitored for these sequelaein the cancer-immunity cycle figure 5 the cancer presents antigens which antigen-presenting cells present to mhc to activate cytotoxic cd8 t cells to ultimately destroy cancer cells in a cyclic process 24 in cancer the cancer-immunity cycle is dysfunctional with the accumulation of inhibitors of t-cell response and promoters of cancer cell growth in sars-cov infection cytotoxic t cells play a significant role and combat the pathogen by killing viral-infected cells and promoting the production of virus-specific antibodies by activating t-dependent b cells the inflammation observed in the pulmonary environment upon viral infection is due to this large role played by cd8 t cells which lead to immune injury immunosuppression a risk factor for novel coronavirus may emerge conversely as a risk for cancer in the context of viral infectionfrom an understanding of the cancer-immunity cycle are there are any elements of novel coronavirus infection that would make the cycle vulnerable to cancer at any point and prevent the generation of immunity to cancer the presence of checkpoint inhibitors to immune responses such as cytotoxic t-lymphocyte associated protein-4 programmed death-1 and programmed death-ligand-1 may inure the development of cancer with viral infection in a depleted t-cell environment postinfection the broad t-cell response to cancer may be undermined this inflammatory response concomitant with immune cell depletion whether temporary or not may lead to oncologic sequelae if accompanied by a superimposed mutagenic andor carcinogenic event potentially occurring in a time-adjacent manner figure 6 displays the tumor microenvironment in the context of breast cancer and illustrates major inflammation and cytokine release marks of viral infection which may predispose to cancerthe implications for novel coronavirus infection on genomic variability are unknown at this point if the virus through its replicative 26 and recombination capabilities 27 leads to genetic alterations that may predispose to cancer another risk factor may be revealedthe administration of antiviral agents and other proposed treatments such as the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine may induce drug resistance to cancer therapies such as targeted agents and immunotherapies even further the status of targeted therapies may be jeopardized by the infection of the virus since many personalized agents target growth factors that are possibly affected by viral transduction however this remains to be investigatedit is generally known that viruses can cause cancer by integration of the genomes into host cell chromosomes and the expression of oncoproteins while both of these mechanisms are not implicated in sars-cov-2 these are not exclusive mechanisms the turning on of oncogenic signaling pathways and the acute inflammatory response that results upon coronavirus infection can be hypothesized as being cancer inducing or leading to the risk of developing cancer especially if the patient has a superimposed mutagenic or carcinogenic event occurring concomitantly even if the virus does not cause a chronic infection like viruses such as hcv hcv and ebv additionally there exist limited resources and research as a result of the pandemic that may damage the prognosis of cancer patients novel coronavirus can destroy t cells but unlike hiv does not lead to persistent infection of t cells data suggest however that there is a general depletion of t cells in the covid-19 infection environment and this may affect the healthy progression of the cancer-immunity cycle also there exist gaps in current knowledge on the novel coronavirus impact on the immune system during co-infection by other viruses such as hcv hiv and ebv finally the overwhelming organ dysfunction that novel coronaviruses results in some cases should be further investigated and as possibly having an association with cancer these should remain areas of research for future studyas the population infected with the novel coronavirus grows and the infection spreads its clinical sequelae may pose an issue of concern for physicians and oncologists in particular future studies should focus on the predisposition of these recovering patients for cancer and if these patients need to be monitored for the disease it is the cumulative effect of many distinguishable aspects of coronavirus infection that leads to the increased predisposition to cancer which then warrants closer follow-up in the future the organ damage inflammatory response and signaling pathways activation that occur upon viral infection may sum to significantly increase patients predisposition to cancer and this may be compounded by a superimposed mutagenic or carcinogenic event the oncology field may evolve by investigating the potential tumor microenvironment in the context of sars-cov-2 infection and if the virus can be considered an etiological agent in the development of cancer clinical sequelae may involve physicians needing to refer covid-19 cases to oncologists for the confirmation of cancer either benign and malignant cases the caveat must be mentioned however that knowledge surrounding coronavirus is constantly being updated and this review must be interpreted in light of any recently updated knowledgemany parameters likely contribute to the etiology of the covid-19 disease the number of viral particles ie viral load and the mode of infection might explain why health care workers are at a higher risk differences in the genome of the virus strains or the genome of the host ie genetic makeup of the patients might account for some of the variation observed across countries and populations at the individual level in addition to the aforementioned factors a persons immune system status is also an important predictor of the disease outcome which can be shaped by the individuals age sex as well as the existence of co-morbiditiescovid-19 shows differences in terms of which populations are vulnerable when compared to previous pandemics pregnant women were at increased risk during the h1n1 pandemic in 2009 1 whereas the h1n1 pandemic of 1918 known as spanish flu particularly affected younger individuals 15- to 34-year-olds 2 while covid-19 appears to have a milder effect on these populations so far 3 increasing age of an individual clearly stands out as an important predictor of vulnerability for covid-19 according to data from china the covid-19 death rate is 36 for individuals in their 60s 8 for those in their 70s 15 for individuals older than 80 yet  05 for individuals in their 40s httpswwwworldometersinfocoronaviruscoronavirus-age-sex-demographics such an age discrepancy is also found in other countries most notably in italy case fatality rate for individuals in their 70s and 80s was reported as 25 and 31 respectively httpswwwepicentroissitcoronavirus and the average age of patients dying from covid-19 was 79 based on 19996 deaths on april 16th many factors can accelerate an individuals biological age including diet exercise lifestyle choices smoking and co-morbidities diabetes obesity 4 therefore increasing age biological and chronological likely predispose individuals to severe covid-19 outcomesour immune system is composed of two distinct arms with different functions adaptive and innate immunity our team 5 and other investigators 613 have documented that with aging both arms of our immune systems go through changes in cellular composition and in function innate immunity is the first line of defense against dangerous invaders such as sars-cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 the innate immune system acts through its ability to capture and inactivate pathogens and to launch inflammation typically inflammatory responses are acute they last for a short time and lead to a rapid accumulation of immune cells and proteins at the site of injury to remove the invader and start the healing process when acute responses are insufficient inflammatory responses can prolong thereby affecting numerous cellular components aging has been linked with such chronic activation of innate immunity associated with low-grade and systemic body-wide increases in inflammation coined inflamm-aging that can be detrimental for the body 8 14 15 and also conserved across tissues and organisms 16 in other words a biological response that is beneficial in a healthy immune system in youth can become a potential liability in older age 17adaptive immune cells are mobilized when the innate immune system is insufficient to defeat a threat whereas innate immunity acts quickly to recognize microbes by their general features adaptive immune cells b and t cells can eliminate a threat with precision by specifically recognizing foreign substances associated with a certain threat for example a short protein fragment - an antigen - unique to sars-cov-2 after successfully clearing a threatinfection the body maintains a reserve of memory cells which remember how to recognize the threat and clear it quickly in case of future invasions the delicate co-operation and balance between innate and adaptive immune cells are critical to orchestrate an effective immune response at any age with increasing age this balance is disrupted in addition to chronic activation of innate immunity adaptive immune functions decline with age 8 18 19 these declines affect the adaptive immune systems ability i to recognize novel threats due to a loss in the number of cells that can be educated to recognize novel threats ie nave cells and ii to mount strong responses due to the accumulation of over-stimulated and dysfunctional exhausted immune cells recent data suggest that with aging some adaptive cells also change their functionality and gain innate-like functions 20 preliminary data from covid-19 patients in wuhan suggest that disease severity was associated with reduced numbers of t cells nave and memory helper t cells regulatory t cells in the blood n  44 27 severe 17 non-severe 21 in alignment with the global patterns severe cases were older than non-severe cases median age 61 versus 53 and included more men than women 54 men n  452 286 severe 166 non-severe 21older age has been associated to increased risk for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 22 n  201 84 with ards in covid-19 patients which are the most severe cases that require icu admission and oxygen therapy 23 n  41 13 requiring icu severe cases have also been associated with increased levels of blood pro-inflammatory cytokines 2124 two of the pro-inflammatory proteins that were elevated in the blood of severe cases 21 have been associated with low physical performance among older adults il-6 c-reactive protein crp 15 and are considered as biomarkers of inflamm-aging serum concentrations of these molecules have also been linked to obesity and visceral adiposity 25 26 furthermore systemic inflammation has been proposed as a risk factor for multiple diseases 14 further research is needed to establish whether the baseline levels of these proteins in the blood can predict disease severity for covid-19 clinical trials are ongoing to assess the efficacy of reducing systemic inflammation using anti-inflammatory drugs for severe covid-19 patients including humanized monoclonal antibodies that bind and block the interleukin-6 receptor il-6r tocilizumab and sarilumab fig 1
data from a small cohort suggest that in severe cases pro-inflammatory innate immune cells expand in the lung n  6 patients 3 of which severe n  8 healthy controls whereas t cells expand in milder cases 27 as expected patients with severe disease were older than those with milder disease median age 63 versus 36 this stark difference in the mechanisms of response to the virus between older and young patients is consistent with age-related changes in the immune system chronic activation of innate immunity and functional declines in adaptive immunity together these age-related changes in the immune system deteriorate an individuals health and might impair responses to sars-cov-2 in older adultsin addition to an individuals age biological sex is an important determinant of covid-19 disease severity in china across all age groups the death rate among confirmed cases is 28 for women and 47 for men httpswwwworldometersinfocoronaviruscoronavirus-age-sex-demographics in italy although half of confirmed cases are men men account for 65 of all deaths as of april 16th httpswwwepicentroissitcoronavirus even in countries that reported fewer infected men than infected women such as spain 49 and switzerland 47 men account for 63 and 62 of deaths respectively based on mid-april data statistics httpglobalhealth5050orgcovid19 this pattern is generally consistent around the world including in the usa httpswwwnytimescom20200407healthcoronavirus-new-york-menhtml on average for each woman killed by covid-19 15 to 2 men succumb to the virusit has long been known that men and women differ in terms of risk and severity for diseases involving the immune system 28 women are disproportionately affected by auto-immune disorders whereas men are more susceptible to infectious diseases 29 both in terms of their intensity the severity of the disease in an individual and prevalence the number of infected people in a population 30 although epidemiological data for covid-19 cases are still missing for many countries among the countries that have a high number of infections and have reported such information the sex differences are striking httpglobalhealth5050orgcovid19 in worst cases the difference is two-fold between men and women in terms of death rate why is covid-19 more dangerous for men especially for older menthe reasons for sex differences in covid-19 are likely multifactorial and include genetics lifestyle differences co-morbidities and hormones 28 29 for example in china men smoke at much higher rates than women smoking rates have been associated with increased activity of ace2 31 - the receptor protein that is expressed on the surface of human cells and is used as a door by the sars-cov-2 virus interestingly this gene is located on the x chromosome however it is unclear whether the sex- and age-related changes in ace2 activity is biological 32 or is attributable to confounding factors eg cigarette smoking 31 furthermore although it has been speculated that sex differences in china might stem from differences in cigarette smoking rates between men and women data on this are inconclusive thus far 33 men also have a greater incidence of chronic illnesses such as ischemic heart disease that can impact ones ability to fight and survive the covid-19 infectionx chromosome contains the largest number of immune-related genes in the whole genome 34 including genes that are involved in innate eg pattern recognition receptors tlr7 and tlr8 that are highly expressed on monocytes and adaptive immune responses eg chemokine receptor cxcr3 that is highly expressed on effector t cells it is suggested that x chromosome is partially responsible for the hyper-responsiveness of the female immune system  hence the increased incidences of auto-immune diseases in women  by contributing to the breakdown of self tolerance ie immune system tolerating cellsmolecules from self 35 women xx genotype carry twice as many x-linked genes  1000 genes compared to men xy genotype expression levels of x-linked genes are balanced between sexes via a process called x chromosome inactivation xci which transcriptionally inactivates one copy of the x chromosome xci is established during embryonic development and mostly maintained throughout lifespan 36 although xci is generally uniform across tissues a recent study conducted from 449 individuals in 29 tissues showed that there are tissue- and individual-specific heterogeneity in xci patterns 32 the role of this heterogeneity in human health particularly in covid-19 is not known yet furthermore some genes  particularly the ones that have y chromosome homologues  can escape xci known as escapees hence these genes can be expressed from two copies maternal and paternal escapee genes might also be contributing to diseases for example single-cell analyses of women blood-derived immune cells uncovered that the tlr7 gene is expressed from both maternal and paternal copies in primary b cells monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells 37 furthermore this bi-allelic expression correlated with the increased gene and protein expression of this molecule in women which can even be detected from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs tlr dosage is considered as a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus sle 38 therefore the increased expression of tlr7 due to xci escaping might contribute to higher incidences of sle 90 of sle patients are women in women as well as similar skews observed in other auto-immune diseases although reports in this area are limited aging might also affect the xci patterns and contribute to age-related increases in certain gene expression programs and susceptibility to certain diseases in older women 39 a future research challenge is to dissect the role of x-linked genes in covid-19 infections and to understand whether their role is affected with age or with the presence of confounding diseases and conditions eg obesityin addition to aforementioned lifestyle co-morbidity and genetic differences the immune systems of men and women exhibit striking differences especially as individuals age which might also contribute to the sex dimorphism in covid-19 cases our recent work uncovered how aging affects womens and mens immune systems differently 40 in terms of both the extent and the timing of age-related changes we studied blood-derived immune cells from 172 healthy men and women with ages ranging from 22 to 93 who were carefully screened to exclude confounding diseases medications and frailty using genomic and functional assays we uncovered aging-related changes in the number of immune cells as well as functional differences of these cells by analyzing their transcriptome and epigenome maps among aging-related changes shared between sexes we observed a decline in adaptive immunity particularly t cells as well as an activation of innate immunity although both men and women exhibited these changes they were significantly greater in magnitude in men especially in terms of the activation of innate immunity and inflammation even when the subjects were otherwise healthy and clinically comparable in terms of age bmi and ethnicity 40 in alignment with these genomic findings serum protein level data from a separate study showed that levels of pro-inflammatory il6 and il1ra were higher in older men 65 compared to older women n  267 used for re-analyses 500fg project 41 furthermore serum levels of these two proteins increased with age more significantly in men compared to women 40 these data suggest men experience a stronger inflamm-aging syndrome than women further studies are needed to understand whether increased systemic inflammation in older men could be the foundation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine storms that characterize severe overreactions to sars-cov-2 virus a phenomenon more frequently observed in men than women 21 based on a recent report from wuhan china pregnant women infected with covid-19 were mostly asymptomatic 92 109 out of 118 3 interestingly the majority of the severe cases among pregnant women 6 out of 9 developed after the delivery possibly due to the toleranceanti-inflammatory mechanism pregnant women develop to tolerate the baby during pregnancy 42 together these observations suggest that the systemic inflammation levels can be predictive of covid-19 disease severity anti-inflammatory drug treatments such as anti-il-6 monoclonal antibodies are already in clinical trials 24 which might benefit individuals with high levels of systemic inflammation including older adults  especially older men  and obese individuals fig 1 efficacy of other anti-inflammatory treatments particularly the ones that are developed to protect older adults geroprotective 43 might be considered in the future for protecting individuals against severe covid-19 infectionswe also uncovered striking sex differences in how the b cell compartment age 40 b cells are adaptive immune cells which upon activation differentiate into plasma cells and produce antibodies these antibodies are found in the bloodstream and at the surface of mucosae where they act as an early barrier against infectious agents blood b cells numbers and percentages were lower in older men 65 both in our cohort recruited in connecticut cell percentages n  130 and separate cohorts from france cell percentages and numbers n  892 44 and from japan cell numbers n  356 45 suggesting that some of these sex-differences are conserved across populations reduced b cell numbers in older men might result in reduced antibody production that might impair an individuals ability to fight viruses and other pathogens in alignment with this covid-19 patients with severe symptoms had three times fewer b cells in their blood than asymptomatic patients 109 vs 373 cells per microliter of blood 46 similar declining trends were observed in a smaller cohort albeit not reaching to statistical significance levels n  44 21 in a pilot study of 5 critically ill covid-19 patients the administration of plasma from recovered patients that contains antibodies were able to neutralize sars-cov-2 virus significantly and improved the patients clinical status 47 larger antibody-based treatment studies are currently ongoing fig 1 antibody based treatment strategies may compensate for the b cell deficit of older men however a safety concern is a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement when non-neutralizing antiviral antibodies facilitate entry into host cells thereby increasing the viral infectivity this phenomenon is observed in vitro and has been found to occur in humans infected with dengue virus or vaccinated with an early respiratory syncytial virus rsv vaccine 48 this has also been observed with anti-spike antibodies causing acute lung injury during acute sars-cov infection 49we also observed accelerated age-related t cell function declines in men compared to women 40 which was also reported in the japanese cohort n  356 45 for example nave t cell frequencies decreased with age particularly in cd8 t cells in both sexes however women had more nave t cells compared to men in both young and older subjects which was also observed in other studies 50 women have been shown to have elevated thymic function compared to men at all ages 51 which might potentially explain sex-differences in nave t cells lymphopenia having reduced numbers of lymphocytes in the blood has been reported in severe cases of covid-19 in multiple studies 21 23 52 53 including drastic declines in cd4 and cd8 t cells as well as nk and b cells together these data suggest that sars-cov-2 might impair antiviral immunity significantly and this impairment might have more severe consequences for older adults several anti-viral drugs are in clinical trials for covid-19 including remdesivir that was originally developed for ebola patients the us food and drug administration fda recently issued an emergency use authorization of remdesivir for severe covid-19 casesfinally by employing statistical algorithms to model temporal trends in genomics data generated from blood samples we showed that the timing of age-related changes in the immune system differ between men and women although we noted a gradual decline in the immune system in both men and women accruing for most of their adult life these changes accelerated drastically at two time points in life the first acceleration point occurs in both sexes at around 40 years of age in the context of covid-19 this is the age when a doubling in the death rate was reported from 02 to 04 in china httpswwwworldometersinfocoronaviruscoronavirus-age-sex-demographics our previous work has discovered that this middle-aged decline in the immune system occurs in mice also including a drop in production of adaptive immune cells and bias in hematopoietic stem cell hsc differentiation toward over-production of innate immune cells 54 supporting that research using model organisms can help us to understand causative mechanisms for such genomic changes a second and more dramatic acceleration occurs later in life and exhibits a marked sex difference being more pronounced and occurring approximately 5 years earlier in men compared to women earlymid-60s in men versus late-60s in women interestingly this difference between men and women parallels the 5-year gap between sexes in terms of the expected lifespan in the us the period of accelerated immune changes in the 60s roughly coincides with the uptick in the lethality of covid-19 reported in china and italy these temporal changes reflect declines in adaptive immunity and increases in innate immunity for both sexes however the magnitude of changes were stronger in men a finding in alignment with the sex bias in cytokine storms and the mortality of covid-19 cases data from italy  one of the few countries that report detailed information on sex  also support a gap between sexes in terms of experiencing the lethal effects of covid-19 infections where the median age of women who have died from covid-19 is 82 versus 78 for men httpswwwepicentroissitcoronavirus data and analyses on the timing of immune system changes with age might inform us on when to start interventions and treatments for older adults little is currently known as to whether hsc lineage bias diverges between sexes as they age understanding the mechanisms by which and extent to which hsc lineage bias may be distinct between men and women with aging and determining if this is a root cause of immune changes between men and women will be an important area of investigationsex hormones eg testosterone and oestrogen play diverse roles in immune responses 55 some of which are due to the direct interactions between sex hormones and immune cells immune cells can express receptors for sex hormones suggesting that these cells can directly respond to changing hormone levels in our body for example estrogen receptors er and er are expressed in a diverse array of immune cells t b natural killer cells macrophages dcs neutrophils furthermore the effect of sex hormones on immune cell functions are proposed to be dose-dependent 55 hence age or menstrual-cycle dependent changes in the sex hormone levels might affect the interaction between sex hormones and immune cells surprisingly our comparisons of men and women pbmcs at different ages 40 showed that immune profiles between sexes diverge as age increases even though the hormone levels decrease with age these findings suggest that sex hormones might play roles in balancing immune responses in men and women and compensate for other inherent differences due to genetics it is also worth noting that the effect of sex hormones is not independent of the sex chromosomes for example the androgen receptor ar that is activated by the binding of androgenic hormones eg testosterone is coded on the x chromosome future studies are needed to explore to what extent sex hormones or lack thereof  contribute to disease severity in covid-19 or other relevant pathologic conditions eg systemic inflammationwith aging changes in our hematopoietic blood stem cell pool which can be thought of as the root of the immune system contribute to the functional decline in both our innate and adaptive immune systems hematopoietic stem cells hscs accumulate somatic mutations with aging increasing the chance that one or more hscs in the pool will accrue a mutation that confers a competitive fitness advantage over other hscs this is frequently observed in older individuals where outgrowth of a mutated hsc and its immune cell progeny is termed clonal hematopoiesis in initial reports using exome sequencing to detect clonal hematopoiesis this condition was detectable in  1 of individuals under age 40 increasing in frequency in each decade of life up to an incidence of 1020 of individuals in their 70s or older 5658 in addition to the increased prevalence in aging there are other similarities between populations susceptible to clonal hematopoiesis and covid-19 morbidity clonal hematopoiesis is more commonly observed in older men 57 increasing evidence suggests that cardiovascular comorbidities are common in patients with covid-19 and such patients are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality 59 the risk of cardiovascular disease more than doubles in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis 57 60 which is as great or greater than well-described risk factors such low-density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol level and blood pressure mouse models of common clonal hematopoiesis mutations have established that this link is causative causing increased size of atherosclerotic lesions and leading to worsening heart function 6063 although large population-level epidemiological studies directly linking clonal hematopoiesis to covid-19 outcomes are currently lacking our understanding of immune system changes caused by clonal hematopoiesis mutations may help to inform the design of studies to determine causality how might clonal hematopoiesis in aged populations increase their risk of death from covid-19 infectionour work 64 and that from other investigators 6469 have shown that the most common mutations found in clonal hematopoiesis not only result in a competitive fitness advantage in hscs but also result in biased differentiation toward innate immune cells at the expense of adaptive immune cells and propensity for transformation to blood cancers within the innate immune system clonal hematopoiesis mutations can increase levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 il-1 and il-8 and inflammatory responses in macrophages and mast cells 6062 70 71 elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines sustained over-production of innate immune cells and reduced production of adaptive immune cells as a consequence of clonal hematopoiesis might be contributing to poor covid-19 outcomes in older adultssystems immunology is an inter-disciplinary field that generates and integrates diverse genomics and phenotypic data to drive a systems-level understanding of immune functions and immune disorders 72 recent advances in single cell technologies provide opportunities to study gene and protein expression as well as epigenetic patterns at single cell resolution 73 74 80 systems-level studies some of which by taking advantage of these single cell technologies have already been impactful in diverse immune-related conditions including but not limited to age-related decline in immune functions 5 14 40 75 and vaccine responsiveness 76 auto-immune diseases 77 78 and cancer 79 80 generation of such datasets from human immune cells 81 in the context of covid-19 and proper integration of these data using advanced computational techniques 73 will be instrumental in answering some of the open questions related to the current health crisis particularly systems-level approaches can be effective in i assessing risk at the individual level and dissecting how different factors contribute to this risk age sex bmi and ii understanding genomic or cellular predictors of responsiveness to potential therapies furthermore integrating these single cell genomic technologies with genotypes of individuals can bring further resolution related to the role genetics play in disease risk and in selecting appropriate therapies tailored for individual patients 82 83emerging data collected from covid-19 patients together with our findings from healthy donors drive home a critical point an improved understanding of sex-specific and age-dependent immune characteristics will lead to more informed and ultimately more effective clinical decisions profiling an individuals blood-derived immune cells is easily accessible and a relatively cheap way to assess health and disease risk at the individual level recent advances in genomics have led to powerful tools to study the human immune system down to the single cell level resolution what we can learn from a small amount of blood sample when combined with these technologies is unprecedented in detail furthermore advances in computing methods eg deep learning algorithms provide us with a unique opportunity to analyze and interpret these data to assess health and disease risk in an increasingly personalized and precise manner while we currently find ourselves in a moment of uncertainty and desperation we rest certain that the future of medicine is bright given these technological advances that can be harnessed to better understand and cure diseases including covid-19 that set a new research agenda for many scientists 84vaccination against viral infections has saved millions of lives by protecting many individuals from diseases such as measles rubella mumps and polio however there is a growing need not only to develop improved vaccines against such acute infections but also to generate therapeutic vaccines which can stimulate specific immune responses to persistent viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus or the human hepatitis c virus 1 2 likewise novel approaches for vaccination against tumors which counteract the immunosuppression associated with cancer are needed 3 there is compelling evidence that cd8 cytotoxic t cells are crucial players in the protective immune response against viral infections and tumors 4 novel vaccine approaches should thus be rigorously evaluated for their ability to maximally expand antigen-specific cd8 t cells to induce their optimal differentiation into effector cd8 t cells and to elicit long-lasting protective memory 4a major bottleneck in the development of new and effective vaccines is the delivery of antigens to dendritic cells dcs 5 6 which sample the antigen transport immunogenic components to secondary lymphoid organs and initiate and maintain t and b cell responses the excellent capacity of dcs to prime protective antiviral t cell responses has been shown in vivo 79 likewise several preclinical studies demonstrated that efficient antitumor immunity can be induced using adoptive transfer of dcs 1012 although individualized adoptive transfer of antigen-loaded dcs is feasible and to a certain extent efficient in clinical applications to humans 13 off-the-shelf vaccines that permit targeted delivery of antigens to dcs in vivo have become a major focus in vaccine development consequently the description of cell surface molecules that for example exhibit a rather specific expression by dcs has fueled the development of antibody-based targeting strategies 1416 these protein-based vaccines generate cd4 t cell and b cell responses against a range of different antigens however antigen coupling to antibodies is a major limitation for the induction of cd8 t cell responses which are strictly dependent on cross-presentation 5 17 in contrast viral vectors encoding immunogenic antigens can deliver their genetic cargo directly into dcs thus generating antigenic peptides in infected cells and allowing for efficient loading of major histocompatibility complex mhc class i molecules among the currently most exploited virus systems that facilitate antigen delivery to dcs are adenoviral 18 19 lentiviral 20 arenaviral 21 and alphaviral 22 23 systems however major impediments of these vectors are frequent off-target transduction resulting in antigen presentation by parenchymal cells outside secondary lymphoid organs and limited cloning capacity for the insertion of multiple or large antigens for example the strong tropism of adenoviral vectors for hepatocytes with 95 of the genetic material being deposited in the liver leads to generation of functionally impaired cd8 t cells 24 25 major efforts are thus required to engineer adenoviral vectors with improved specificity for the relevant antigen-presenting cells 12 19 likewise lentiviral vectors preferentially infect cells other than dcs and redirection of their target cell tropism is warranted 26 an additional potential impediment for the use of dna-based viral vectors in clinics is their potential to integrate genomic material into the host genome 27coronaviral vectors display a number of features that clearly overcome these limitations first replication of these positive-stranded rna viruses is restricted to the cytoplasm without a dna intermediary making insertion of viral sequences into the host cell genome unlikely second there is accumulating knowledge on how to attenuate coronaviruses in order to provide biosafe vectors 28 29 third coronavirus genomes with sizes of 27 to 31 kb represent the largest autonomously replicating rnas known to date and thus offer a cloning capacity of more than 6 kb fourth the unique transcription process generates 6 to 8 subgenomic mrnas encoding the four canonical structural proteins and various numbers of accessory proteins which can be replaced to encode multiple heterologous proteins 30 finally and certainly most intriguing cell surface receptors of human and murine coronaviruses are expressed on human and murine dcs respectively 31 32the present study describes the generation and evaluation of rationally designed coronavirus-based vectors that efficiently target antigens and immunostimulatory molecules to dcs we show that murine-coronavirus-based vectors can deliver multiple antigens and immunostimulatory cytokines almost exclusively to cd11c dcs within secondary lymphoid organs immunization with only low numbers of particles elicited potent cd8 t cell responses that provided long-lasting protection against viral challenge moreover single application of these novel viral vectors generated prophylactic and therapeutic immunity against metastatic melanoma induction of cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctl directed against the human melan-a mel-a antigen in hla-a2-transgenic mice and efficient human-dc-mediated stimulation of mel-a-specific ctl through mel-a-recombinant human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e indicates that coronavirus-mediated gene transfer to dcs represents a versatile approach for murine and human immunization against both viral infection and cancerto assess immunogenicity and to ensure maximal safety of coronavirus-based multigene vaccine vectors we have rationally designed a series of prototype vectors based on the mouse hepatitis virus strain a59 mhv-a59 fig 1a with regard to safety we introduced three basic modifications to obtain replication-competent but attenuated and propagation-deficient mhv-based vectors first we deleted all mhv accessory genes ns2 he gene4 gene5a a strategy that attenuates mhv in the natural host 29 and provides space for the introduction of heterologous genes second we removed 99 nucleotides within the replicase gene-encoded sequence of nonstructural protein 1 nsp1 because this deletion has been shown to greatly reduce mhv pathogenicity while retaining immunogenicity 28 finally we deleted structural gene e to restrict proper particle formation 33 indeed although replication of wild-type mhv to maximal titers occurred around day 5 postinfection in vivo replication of mhv vectors could not be detected not shown consequently there was also no mhv vector replication detectable in livers or brains not shown the high safety profile of mhv-based vectors is further illustrated by the fact that the health status of c57bl6 b6 or different immunodeficient mice was not affected even if the vectors were applied at high doses see fig s1 in the supplemental materialin order to test the coronavirus-based vaccine concept and to develop a vaccine that provides strong ctl responses in terms of both magnitude and longevity we used the ctl epitope gp33-41 the region from residues 33 to 41 derived from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv glycoprotein and the mel-a26-35 analog peptide derived from the human melan-amelanoma antigen recognized by t cells 1 mart1 protein fig 1a the ctl epitopes were cloned as fusion proteins with the enhanced green fluorescent protein egfp 34 35 and the corresponding genes designated gp-egfp and egfpmel-a were cloned between the mhv vector-borne spike and membrane genes since appropriate stimulation of dcs is critical for the generation of efficient t cell responses 36 and hence an indispensable component of rationally designed vaccines we inserted the gene encoding the murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf between the mhv vector-borne replicase and spike genes fig 1a to propagate the mhv-based viral vectors to high titers we produced a packaging cell line based on murine 17clone1 cells that express the mhv envelope e protein under the control of the tet-off system fig 1b this strategy enabled us to restore efficient vector particle formation and propagation in order to obtain vector stocks of 106ml fig 1cto assess mhv vector growth kinetics on cells that do not express the e protein we transduced l929 cells bone marrow-derived cd11c dcs or peritoneal macrophages with the mhv vectors and compared growth kinetics to that of wild-type mhv-a59 in accordance with reports on e gene-deficient mhv-a59 37 the growth of the mhv-based vector was greatly impaired in l929 cells fig 1d most importantly however mhv vector transduction did not result in particle release in peritoneal macrophages and dcs demonstrating that the lack of the e protein prevents mhv propagation in primary cells fig 1d mhv vectors elicited significant egfp expression in transduced l929 cells and peritoneal macrophages fig 1e and in cd11c dcs fig 1f notably vector-mediated gm-csf expression resulted in dc activation and maturation as shown by upregulation of cd86 and cd40 on cd11c cells fig 1g the rapid production of gm-csf in l929 cells peritoneal macrophages and dcs following exposure to the cytokine-encoding vectors fig s2 shows that mhv vectors can be used to simultaneously express antigens and immunostimulatory cytokines in target cellsto further determine the cellular tropism of mhv-based vectors we transduced splenocytes from c57bl6 b6 mice with mhv-gmgp in vitro and analyzed egfp expression by flow cytometry neither cd4 nor cd8 t cells were susceptible to mhv-gmgp transduction not shown whereas antigen-presenting cells such as b cells cd19 macrophages f480 or cd11b and dcs cd11c displayed green fluorescence indicative of mhv vector-mediated egfp expression see fig s3a in the supplemental material in order to evaluate whether targeting of dcs and macrophages is also achievable in vivo we injected intravenously iv 106 pfu of mhv-gp or mhv-gmgp into b6 mice and analyzed egfp expression of splenocytes by flow cytometry egfp expression was detectable mainly in cd11c cd11b dcs and cd11c cd8 dcs fig 2a and b and see fig s3b in the supplemental material finally we assessed the effects of mhv vector-mediated gm-csf expression on dc stimulation and activation in vivo slightly elevated gm-csf levels in spleens could be observed following application of the mhv-gmgp vector fig s4a whereas gm-csf levels in serum remained below the limit of detection not shown concomitant immunization with mhv-gp and mhv-gmmel-a vectors revealed that the supply of gm-csf in trans ie via the mhv-gmmel-a vector was not sufficient to achieve the maximal activation of gp34-specific cd8 t cells only when gm-csf was encoded by the same vector that expressed the gp-egfp protein mhv-gmgp was the maximal immune response induced fig s4b furthermore mhv-gmgp-induced gm-csf expression did not alter the cellular composition in spleens see fig s5 in the supplemental material these results support the notion that vector-encoded gm-csf acts locally in the microenvironment of transduced dcs however in vivo transduction with both mhv-gp and mhv-gmgp mediated dc maturation with upregulation of cd86 and cd40 fig 2c notably application of mhv-gp vectors led to a less efficient transduction of dcs in vivo which lasted only for roughly 18 h fig 2a suggesting that gm-csf supplied by mhv vectors fosters dc survival and to a lesser extent dc maturation and thereby potentiates their antigen presentation functioninfection with lcmv is characterized by a vigorous expansion of antiviral ctl and persistence of protective memory ctl 38 which are directed against several epitopes two different epitopes are present in the gp33-41 region of the lcmv gp that was used in two of our constructs the h2-db-binding gp33-41 39 and the h2-kb-binding gp34-41 40 on day 7 after lcmv infection significant numbers of cd8 t cells could be detected by mhc tetramer analysis and intracellular cytokine secretion ics assay fig 3a it is important to note that the gp33 ics records both gp33- and gp34-specific cd8 t cells it appears that the processing of the gp-egfp transgene in the mhv-gp and mhv-gmgp vectors permitted the preferential generation of gp34-specific cd8 t cells to a magnitude comparable to that seen during acute lcmv infection fig 3a the gm-csf-encoding mhv vector proved to be highly efficient in the induction of antiviral ctl even at rather low doses of 103 and 104 pfu fig 3b since the intermediate dose of 105 pfu of mhv-gmgp led to optimal induction of gp34-specific ctl we used this dose to assess whether application via different routes would influence the induction of transgene-specific ctl as shown in fig 3c all routes of immunization elicited robust cd8 t cell responses with intraperitoneal ip subcutaneous sc intramuscular im and iv injection being the most efficient means of application both mhv-gp- and mhv-gmgp-induced cd8 t cells displayed full effector function because gp34 peptide-loaded target cells were rapidly eliminated in immunized hosts see fig s6a in the supplemental material mhv vector-induced cd8 t cell responses were detectable for more than 65 days after immunization fig 3d and most importantly could be restimulated in vivo by immunization with the same vector fig 3eprotection against lcmv challenge requires high levels of appropriately activated cd8 t cells 38 in order to assess the efficacy of mhv vector-based immunization for protection against viral challenge b6 mice were immunized with graded doses of the mhv-gp or mhv-gmgp vector and challenged 7 days later with lcmv comparable to the high level of cd8 t cell induction fig 3 complete protection was observed in mice after immunization with a dose of 105 pfu fig 4a remarkably as few as 103 pfu of mhv-gmgp still led to a 3-log reduction of lcmv titers in spleens on day 4 postchallenge fig 4a protection against lcmv was long-lasting because mice were still protected after more than 2 months following immunization with 105 pfu mhv-gmgp via the iv fig 4b sc or im route see fig s6b in the supplemental material moreover the mhv-gmgp vaccine elicited complete protection against ip challenge with lcmv gp recombinant vaccinia virus vv fig 4c likewise immunization with mhv-gp provided substantial protection against this heterologous viral infection fig 4c it is important to indicate that the mhv-based vaccine even when gm-csf was encoded by the vector provided specific protection because replication of the unrelated recombinant vaccinia virus expressing vesicular stomatitis virus vsv indiana glycoprotein vv-indg was not affected fig 4c taken together these results revealed that the mhv-based vector system is highly efficient in generating protective antiviral immunity and that the incorporation of gm-csf into the vaccine significantly augmented its protective capacityin order to evaluate whether mhv vector-based vaccination elicits prophylactic and therapeutic tumor immunity we resorted to a rapidly growing b16 melanoma model which provides compatibility with the lcmv gp system through expression of a gp33 minigene b16f10-gp cells 41 iv injection of 5  105 b16f10-gp or parental b16f10 cells in control b6 mice resulted in metastatic growth of tumor cells in lungs fig 5a immunization with either 105 pfu mhv-gp or 105 pfu mhv-gmgp completely blocked the growth of b16f10-gp tumor cells whereas metastasis formation of the parental b16f10 cells was not affected fig 5a application of graded doses of mhv-gp or mhv-gmgp revealed the high efficacy of this vaccination approach in the prophylactic setting ie 104 mhv-gp or only 103 pfu mhv-gmgp were sufficient to prevent the growth of the melanoma cells fig 5b a long-lasting memory response that provided significant protection against b16f10-gp challenge had been generated following mhv-gmgp immunization fig 5c moreover the potent cd8 t cell response elicited through mhv-gmgp immunization mediated therapeutic tumor immunity fig 5d ie the tumor burden in lungs of b6 mice was significantly reduced even when the vaccine was applied after the tumors had started to form metastatic nodules indicating that cd8 t cell responses elicited by the novel mhv vectors can exert forceful antitumor activityto further substantiate the finding that mhv vectors can induce potent and relevant antitumor cd8 t cell responses we employed the human hla-a2-restricted melan-amart1 system in which immune responses against the mel-a26-35 analog peptide can be monitored in hla-a21-transgenic a2dr1 mice 42 a2dr1 mice were immunized iv with either 105 pfu mhvmel-a or 105 pfu mhv-gmmel-a and mel-a-specific cd8 t cell responses were recorded using tetramer analysis and ics as shown in fig 6a both vectors elicited substantial cd8 t cell responses time course experiments following iv application of mhv-gmmel-a revealed a strong global expansion of cd8 t cells nearly 10-fold and a massive expansion of mel-a-specific cd8 t cells with 2  106 cells per spleen being tetramer positive and 6  106 cells per spleen secreting gamma interferon ifn- fig 6b the mel-a-specific cd8 t cell population showed a typical contraction after day 7 and a stable memory population had been established by day 28 postimmunization fig 6b during the acute phase following mhv-gmgp immunization 90 of the mel-a-specific cd8 t cells had downregulated cd62l fig 6c as expected memory cd8 t cells reacquired cd62l expression indicating establishment of a central memory cd8 t cell population overall these results underline that the coronavirus-based vaccination approach particularly in combination with the immunostimulatory cytokine gm-csf provides efficient means for the induction of cd8 t cell responses against a human tumor antigenhuman coronavirus-based vectors permit specific transfer of multiple genes to dcs because the receptor of hcov-229e human aminopeptidase n hapn or cd13 43 is expressed on human dcs 31 furthermore we have demonstrated previously that hcov-229e-based vectors can transduce immature and mature human dcs with reporter genes such as the firefly luciferase gene 30 here we assessed whether hcov-229e-mediated delivery of the mel-a26-35 analog peptide to hla-a2 human dcs would specifically stimulate human mel-a-specific cd8 t cells to this end we generated two recombinant human coronaviruses designated hcovmel-a and hcovgp-egfp through replacement of hcov-229e accessory gene 4 with the gene for the egfpmel-a26-35 or gp33-egfp fusion protein respectively fig 7a as shown in fig 7b egfp expression was readily detectable in both human immature and mature dcs after hcovmel-a infection time course analysis of human mature dcs infected with hcovmel-a or hcovgp-egfp revealed that high levels of egfp expression can be reached as early as 9 h postinfection see fig s7 in the supplemental material finally mature dcs infected with hcovmel-a or hcovgp-egfp were employed to stimulate mel-a26-35-specific human t cells as shown in fig 7c we observed efficient stimulation of the tumor-specific t cells by hcovmel-a indicating that hcov-229e with its pronounced tropism for human cd13-expressing dcs represents a particularly promising tool for genetically delivering antigens to human antigen-presenting cellsthis study describes a novel vaccine approach that facilitates delivery of viral or tumor antigens to dcs in vivo concomitant immunostimulationhere via the cytokine gm-csfwas achieved through targeted transduction by the same viral vector single immunization with only 104 to 105 mhv-based particles was sufficient to elicit i vigorous expansion and optimal differentiation of cd8 t cells ii protective and long-lasting antiviral immunity and iii prophylactic and therapeutic tumor immunity moreover highly efficient antigen delivery to human dcs with recombinant hcov-229e and specific stimulation of human cd8 t cells revealed that this approach is exceptionally well suited for translation into human vaccine studiestargeting of antigen to dcs in vivo can be achieved by several means 5 the use of viral vectors appears to be the superior strategy for eliciting innate activation of the immune system and optimal induction of cd8 t cells 24 however many virus vector systems are still limited in their ability to induce broad and long-lasting immune responses for example recombinant adenoviruses have been studied intensively as vaccine candidates mainly because they can be produced to high titers nevertheless high doses of recombinant adenovirus vectors have to be applied to induce an immune response most probably because they target antigens mainly to nonlymphoid organs such as the liver 25 44 in contrast to viral vectors based on dna viruses 45 positive-stranded rna virus-based vectors that replicate in the cytoplasm are considered safe vectors the safety is well documented for vectors based on widely used vaccine strains such as poliovirus 46 or virus-like particles vlps that contain replicon rnas devoid of structural genes 47 it should be noted that application of the mhv-based vectors described in this study was always well tolerated and did not result in any sign of disease or adverse side effect irrespectively of dosage and route of mhv-based vector application even in immunodeficient mouse strains finally it is noteworthy that although some rna virus-based vectors are able to target dcs 21 their cloning capacity is in sharp contrast to that of coronavirus-based vectors generally restricted and the expression of multiple antigens andor immunostimulatory cytokines is limitedthe novel coronavirus-based vaccine platform described here displayed a high immunogenicity it is very likely that it is the pronounced tropism of the mhv-based vectors for dcs and macrophages within secondary lymphoid organs that guarantees efficient activation of primary cd8 t cell responses in vivo imaging studies have shown that cd169 cd11c dcs at the subcapsular sinus of lymph nodes efficiently present viral antigen to nave t cells 48 likewise cd169 macrophages at the same location are able to collect viral antigen from the lymph and present antigen to follicular b cells 49 moreover a recent study from our laboratory has revealed that type i ifn-mediated protection of dcs and macrophages from cytopathic effects of mhv infection is essential to buy time for mounting a protective cd8 t cell response 50 it remains to be resolved which factorsbesides the presence of the mhv receptor on dcs 32confers the preferential infection of the relevant antigen-presenting cells within secondary lymphoid organs for further adaptation of the coronavirus-based vectors to the human system some of the essential parameters have been clarified ie the receptor of hcov-229e is expressed mainly on monocytes and dcs within secondary lymphoid organs 31 and recombinant hcov-229e efficiently targets human dcs irrespective of their maturation status it is important to add that hcov-229e is one of at least four human coronaviruses that are transmitted via mucosal surfaces and are associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections common cold furthermore the low pathogenic potential of hcov-229e is corroborated by the fact that hcov-229e was passaged in volunteers in the 1960s without any serious side effects these features together with the pronounced dc-targeting capabilities demonstrated in this report should encourage the development of coronavirus-based vectors for human usea second major advantage of the coronavirus-based vaccination strategy is the large cloning capacity of the vectors which offers the possibility of incorporating immunostimulatory cytokines gm-csf-encoding mhv vectors led to strong production of this cytokine in both macrophages and dcs in vitro interestingly gm-csf expression in vivo appeared to be largely restricted to locally transduced cells as no gross differences in gm-csf levels in spleen or serum were observed after mhv-gmgp vector immunization it is most likely that gm-csf-induced changes within the microenvironment of transduced macrophages and dcs are decisive for the optimal induction of effector and memory cd8 t cell responses indeed it is the optimally stimulated expression of costimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells together with sufficient innate immune stimulation that determines the primary expansion and the maintenance of antiviral cd8 t cells 51 accordingly such non-tcr signals signals 2 and 3 are considered key components of rationally designed vaccines 4 the lack of such optimally composed stimuli in a vector-based vaccine most likely requires very elaborate prime-boost immunization regimes as was recently shown for a combined adenovirusmva vaccination approach 52 andor substantially increased vector doses to achieve efficacy as for example in vaccination with the latest versions of dc-adapted lentivirus vectors where application of 5  107 to 10  107 particles was required to achieve significant expansion of ovalbumin-specific cd8 t cells in mice 53in conclusion we provide here a versatile vaccine platform based on coronaviruses that achieved the efficient generation of protective immunity shown as

data were analyzed with the nonpaired student t test under the assumption that the values followed a gaussian distribution a p value of 005 was considered significantsince the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov-2 or covid-19 coronavirus started in china in december 2019 there is increasing evidence that those with existing comorbidities older age or a compromised immune system are at higher risk of developing severe and even fatal respiratory diseases 1 cancer and transplant patients are also considered to be in this risk group 2 3 especially as they may be treated with immune-suppressive or immune-stimulating drugsthe current review focuses on the effects of immune-suppressive or immune-stimulating drugs on the host immunity against covid-19 here we report a short introduction to each drug followed by a summary of the results from the identified studies for each relative drugwe hypothesise that the drugs selected will likely be categorised into one of two groups 1 those that may be harmful for patients and put them at risk of increased morbiditymortality associated with covid-19 infection and 2 those that may be used to treat the immunopathology associated with severe persistent viral infection the clinical impact of this review is thus twofold it aims to identify which drugs clinicians should be thinking about taking patients off to protect them from increased harm from covid-19 and also which drugs could be potentially beneficial in the fight against the diseasethis review covers the information available today as the covid-19 pandemic progresses there is an opportunity and responsibility to collect prospective data using established randomised controlled trial involving drugs of interest and cohort-based translational studies

coronavirus was one of the most common viral pathogens identified in paediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy second to human rhinovirus 4 viral co-detection was frequent in patients with cancer and acute respiratory infectionsa brain biopsy was hcov-oc43-positive by metagenomic next-generation sequencing in the case of a 1-year-old child with pre-b acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 5a case of a young woman with stage iiia breast cancer from 1999 reported that diagnosis of coronavirus following treatment for cancer using a high-dose chemotherapy regimen and autologous bone marrow and stem cell transplantation the electron microscopy revealed coronavirus pneumonia 6 coronavirus should be potentially considered in the differential diagnoses of respiratory failure in patients who have undergone high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantationin addition some further observations have been made in relation to specific treatments
although hiv protease inhibitors such as lopinavir has been suggested as a low-micromolar inhibitor of mers-cov the different mechanistic classes that hiv and coronavirus fall under meant that there was low affinity for coronavirus strains compared to hiv 7the following compounds have been shown to be active in vitro against the sars-cov virus tnf-converting enzyme inhibitor tapi-2 ifn- bd

coronavirus 9carbohydrate-binding agents cba may be able to block enveloped viruses other than hiv in their entry process and coronaviruses and influenza viruses are other examples of enveloped viruses that may be highly susceptible to the antiviral action of cbas 10the genome of sars-cov encodes five major proteins the spike protein s the envelope protein e the membrane glycoprotein m and the nucleocapsid protein n m and e may help host cells to induce the production of protective ifn- to fight against the virus bananin 1-3-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl-289-trioxaadamantane-357-triol acts as zinc zn2 chelator and is therefore of interest to target and inhibit immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv-1 zinc

encapsidation targets of bnp and b6ra has shown to be present also in sars-associated coronavirus making them possible therapeutic candidates 11coronavirus strains were one of the most common viral pathogens identified in paediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy patients with pre-b acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and breast cancer who have undergone chemotherapy have reported cases of coronavirus infection cytotoxic therapies used in cancer chemotherapy such as 6mp and 6tg have shown to be specific inhibitors for sars coronavirus in in vitro studies however further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to confirm this especially in covid-19 currently there is no scientific evidence of the interaction between methotrexate and covid-19a total of 58 studies were identified from the search terms of which 13 were deemed suitable for inclusion supplementary table 2 our search did not identify any strong evidence for or against the use of ibuprofen for treatment of covid-19 specifically one study did however link sars-cov to the downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace2 which is upregulated by ibuprofen 12 the authors of this study were investigating the link between the severity of covid-19 symptoms in patients with asthma and hypertensionthe only other study to investigate a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug was one which looked at indomethacin 13 this study suggested that indomethacin exhibited potent antiviral activity against canine coronavirus dramatically inhibiting virus replication and protecting the host cell from virus-induced damage this activity was also observed against human sars-cov at a concentration dose of 1 mgkgin general there appeared to be a few positive results for the use of corticosteroids in viral infections such as sars-cov 14-19 corticosteroids were widely used during the sars-cov outbreak due to their known ability to modulate a variety of involved cytokines including il-1 il-6 il-8 il-12 and tnf 14 16 various studies in humans noted that corticosteroids appeared effective in reducing immunopathological damage but concerns centred around the promotion of viral rebound and association with adverse events including acute respiratory distress syndrome 14 one laboratory study which treated porcine respiratory coronavirus infected pigs with dexamethasone suggested that one or two doses of the corticosteroid in the acute phase of infection may effectively alleviate early pro-inflammatory response but prolonged administration may play a role in enhancing viral replication 18 a separate chinese study which separated sars-cov patients into 4 treatment groups identified early high-dose steroids in combination with a quinolone as producing the best patient outcomes 19 nevertheless one review stated that the who does not currently recommend corticosteroids in other viral diseases such as dengue as the glucocorticoid-mediated stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis can also drive lymphocytopenia or it may promote exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses that eventually cause a worsening of the pathogenic condition 20the current literature does not give conclusive evidence for or against the use of nsaids in the treatment of covid-19 patients though there appears to be some evidence that corticosteroids may be beneficial in the treatment of sars-cov however it is important to note this is not specific to covid-19a total of three studies were identified of which two were deemed suitable for inclusion supplementary table 3 the first study was a research letter that suggested that tnfa has been implicated in the severe immune-based pulmonary injury caused by sars coronavirus suggesting that tnfa inhibitors could be a potential treatment for the acute respiratory disease syndrome caused by coronavirus 21the second study utilised 22 piglets to assess the efficacy of an anti-tnfatherapy for endotoxin respiratory diseases and observed that tnfa blockade was not associated with decrease in disease severity 22currently there is no evidence indicating that tnfa blockade is harmful to patients in the context of covid-19a total of 108 studies were identified from the second search strategy 23 were suitable for inclusion supplementary table 4 the first search strategy found no hitsit has been suggested that the pathogenesis of sars-cov is mediated by disproportional immune responses and the ability of the virus to circumvent innate immunity the covid-19 infection has also been observed to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine generation and secretion of cytokines such as il-6 which dysregulates the local inflammatory responses that have been suggested as partially responsible for the devastating acute respiratory distress syndromemoreover it has been observed that covid-19 induces high levels of il-6 for at least 2 weeks after disease onset children presented lower levels of cytokine production il-6 has been suggested as a potential prognostic marker of covid-19 disease severity different molecules related with the il6 pathway have been suggested as potential therapeutic targets such as adam-17 sars-cov ssrna dusp1 and p38 mapkcurrently there is no scientific evidence of the beneficial impact of il-6 inhibitors in the modulation of the covid-19 infection further understanding of the role of il-6 reduction will be forthcoming as the pandemic progresses and further clinical data becomes available in vitro treatment with glycopyrronium formoterol and budesonide exerted additive inhibitory effects on viral titers and cytokine production human nasal and tracheal epithelial cellsfifteen studies were yielded from the search of which 4 were deemed suitable for inclusion supplementary table 5baricitinib olumiant is a jak inhibitor that was approved by the european medicines agency in february 2017 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults with an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 44 one study suggested the use of baricitinib to reduce the viral entry and inflammation caused by 2019-ncov most viruses enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis ace2 a cell-surface protein expressed on cells in the kidney blood vessels heart and alveola type 2 at2 cells in the pulmonary epithelia may be the receptor that 2019-ncov uses to infect lung cells the authors of richardson et al 45 suggest that by inhibiting adaptor associated protein kinase 1 aak1 receptor that promotes endocytosis involved in ace2 baricitinib may reduce both the viral entry and the inflammation in 2019-ncov patientsinositol-requiring transmembrane kinaseendoribonuclease 1 ire1 is an endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor that leads to increased expression of negative regulators of jak-stat suppressor of cytokine signalling socs-1 and socs-3 46 therefore ire1 may be a novel target against coronavirus infection requiring further explorationtylophorine-based compounds are isolated from plants and exert potent anti-coronaviral activities against sars-cov and mers-cov 47 nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells nf-b activation is a common pro-inflammatory response of host cells to viral infection following in vitro analysis yang et al 48 suggests the use of a combination therapy for sars-cov or mers-cov wherein a tylophorine compound known to target transmissible gastroenteritis virus and a jak2 inhibitor synergise to block the alternative dominant nf-b activation mediated by jak2 therefore the combination treatment for the inhibition of coronavirus per se eg viral genome replication and blocking cellular nf-b activation by coronaviruses is a promising approach for the development of anti-coronaviralscurrent studies suggest that although there are potential targets in the jak-stat pathway that can be manipulated in the treatment for coronaviruses they are all in early stages and require further in vitro and in vivo studies to confirm their therapeutic effectsa total of 37 studies were identified from the search of which 9 were deemed suitable for inclusion supplementary table 6 many of the studies were in vitro studies and repeatedly demonstrated increased il-1 levels in patients infected with a coronavirus one study investigated the levels of various inflammatory cytokines in 29 covid-19 patients in china and compared the levels between general severe and critically ill groups 49 the authors reported no significant differences in il-1b levels between the three groups of patients another study involving 20 consecutive sars patients admitted to a hong kong hospital identified significantly elevated levels of il-1 within the first 12 7 and 5 days following onset of infection 17 those patients with more severe disease were treated with pulsed methylprednisolone and il-1 levels returned to normal after 7 days the seven patients with less severe disease did not receive any dosage of corticosteroids and their cytokine levels returned to normal range levels over the same 7-day time perioda further chinese study also identified reduced levels of il-1 following administration of corticosteroids- suggesting inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 may be a beneficial treatment strategy for treatment of sars 50 a third study which measured serum cytokine levels in four patient groups including controls patients with sars patients with severe sars and convalescent sars patients suggested that longer term treatment over a period of 7-10 days with low-dose steroids can alter serum cytokine levels including il-1 38one rat model showed promising results for an il-1 receptor antagonist which reduced the chemokine expression in infected animals 51 however this result cannot be generalised for humans unfortunately one study in which the authors state the demonstrate for the first time that inflammation by coronavirus may be inhibited by anti-inflammatory cytokines belonging to the il-1 family was only available as an abstract 52 therefore further evidence or information to back this claim up is not availableoverall this review demonstrated that although it is evident that il-1 is elevated in patients infected with a coronavirus there is not at present evidence for an established role for il-1 blockers in the treatment of covid-19 in humans the literature did however suggest a potential role for low-dose corticosteroids to reduce levels of pro-inflammatory markers such as il-1 which are elevated as part of the immune response and may have a role in the severe lung damage associated with human coronavirusesalmost all of the studies investigated mpa as a potential therapy for mers-cov due to its anti-viral properties six of the 13 selected studies were in vitro studies two were in vivo one was a clinical example and four were reviews therefore there was some overlapping of results supplementary table 7in general the in vitro studies looked positive with mpa targeting the papain like proteases of both mers-cov and sars-cov 53 54 the studies found that mpa showed strong inhibition of the virus with a very low ic50 55-57mpa can been used in combination with interferon-beta ifn-b one study which applied this regime in marmosets exhibiting a severe disease resembling human mers reported high viral loads with more severe or even fatal disease 28 the authors of this study state that mpa is likely to cause more harm than benefit to mers patientsaccording to the review by mo and fisher 58 mpa monotherapy had not been tested in a clinical setting for the treatment of mers-cov al ghamdi et al 59 presented an example where eight patients were treated with mpa for mers-cov seven in combination with ifn- all eight of these patients survived however the review by mo and fisher stated that this group of patients had lower acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii scores compared with others in the cohort who received a variety of antiviral agents including ribavirin and ifn-a steroids and antibiotics therefore the results must be interpreted with cautionwhilst the in vitro studies showed promising results for mpa against mers the in vivo studies suggest that its use is likely to cause more harm than benefit and hence is not likely to be useful against coronavirus infections the clinical studies are too small to confirm or deny any beneficial use for mers-cov patientsa total of 18 studies were identified from the search terms of which three were deemed suitable for inclusion supplementary table 8overall the literature appeared to suggest a potential role for tacrolimus in the treatment of human coronaviruses in a case study of two renal transplant recipients who tested positive for mers cov a patient who was being treated with an immunosuppressive regimen of tacrolimus underwent full recovery whilst the other patient who was not on this treatment regimen succumbed to the infection 60 the patient who eventually made a full recovery was also treated with antibacterial therapy and a reduced dose of mycophenolate mofetil and it is therefore not possible to conclude that patient recovery due to tacrolimusthe two other included studies were both laboratory studies involving cell line culture the first investigated pathways of coronavirus viral replication as potential antiviral therapeutic targets 61 genome-wide sars-cov yeast-two-hybrid interaction screen with human cdna libraries identified fk506-binding proteins as interaction partners of sars-cov non-structural protein 1 subsequently the authors investigated whether tacrolimus inhibits viral replication of human coronaviruses verofm cells infected with sars-cov and other human coronaviruses were treated with fk506 results showed that fk506 effectively inhibited viral replication of sars-cov hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e at non-toxic low-micromolar concentrations with a reduction in viral titers to undetectable levels the second study further confirmed this inhibition using novel non-immunosuppressive derivatives of fk506 in the context of hcov-nl63 at low-micromolar non-cytotoxic concentrations in cell culture 62overall the small amount of literature available suggests a potential role of fk506 tacrolimus as a potent antiviral in the treatment of human coronaviruses it is important to note however that covid-19 is a novel disease and may have different aetiology and mechanistic action compared to existing strains and to date this immunosuppressive drug and its derivatives has not been tested in humans further study is warranted both in the clinical setting and laboratoryno studies were identified for inclusionno studies were identified for inclusionthe rapidly progressing sars-cov-2 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making about the treatment of critically unwell patients with the novel viral infection in parallel doctors across multiple specialties are making clinical decisions about the appropriate continuation of treatments for patients with chronic illnesses requiring immune-suppressive medication this systematic review looks to provide guidance from the current available literatureas the covid-19 pandemic progresses collective effort to capture data from prospective trials is required sponsors of randomized controlled trials recruiting patients randomized to receive immune modulatory drugs that may be affected by covid-19 should collect data about the disease outcomes and consider interim analysis of potential advantages and disadvantages associated with using one of these medicationslow-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus therapy may have beneficial impacts on the course of sars-cov-2 this observation requires further validation the mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies there is no definitive evidence that specific cytotoxic drugs low-dose methotrexate for auto-immune disease nsaids jak kinase inhibitors or anti-tnfa biological agents are contraindicated there is evidence that il-6 peak levels are associated with severity of pulmonary complications ongoing studies of blockade of the il-6 pathway are rational and will hopefully inform practice as the pandemic progresseswe would like to thank our various funders guys and st thomas charity cancer research uk c45074a26553 and the cruk kings health partner centrethe authors have no conflicts of interest to declarecovid-19 is an infection of a new coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 1 2 that emerged in china in late 2019 in the wuhan region and led to a rapid spread worldwide that has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 and now there are more than 4 million cases reportedthe sars-cov2 virus belongs to the coronavirus family a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus 3 in vitro experiments on spike proteins of the virus hypothesized affinity with the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 ace2 4 5 this acts as the gateway to the virus which subsequently distributes through the circulatory stream and triggers a systemic response with hyperinflammation that has been compared to several inflammatory diseases 6 several studies in chinese populations showed that the main predictors of poor prognosis are increased levels of il6 and fibrinogen and systemic inflammation which contributes to mortality 7different studies try to investigate how blocking inflammation can help the treatment of this pathology 8 researchers focused their attention on effector mechanisms however it is important to try to understand the role of the triggers and of innate immunity which acting as a first defense barrier against microorganisms determines the activation of the immune response in some subjects this response seems to be aberrant causing immune-mediated damage in patients even more harmful than the viral damage itself understanding how these mechanisms act may in the future help us to create further approaches for the treatment of this diseasetoll-like receptors tlr are proteins involved in the development and activation of innate immunity it is a family of 11 transmembrane receptor proteins that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps 9 coronavirus seems to trigger a significant cytokine release in the body primarily il-6 and all the other proteins of the acute phase that leads to activation of the immune response 10 the first mechanism of defense of human body from infections is innate immunity in particular the virus is recognized by specific tlr several studies on sars-cov and mers showed the role of tlr3 in the development of a protective response against coronaviruses 11 tlr3 is highly expressed on dendritic cells placenta and pancreas and its activation trough trif tir-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon- pathway determines the activation of irf3 interferon regulatory factor 3 and nf-kb 12 13 fig1in mouse models totura et al demonstrate increasing levels of transcription of tlr3 after coronavirus infections already in the 2nd day post-infection this determines activation of downstream molecules such as trif which determines the activation of transcription factors such as irf3 and nf-kb associated with increased production of type i interferons ifn alpha and beta inflammatory cytokines il-6 tnf and ifn-gamma 11 despite the role in the production of inflammatory cytokines knock-out mice for tlr3 do not have reduced expression of il6 ifn beta tnf and inflammatory cytokines so several pathways linked to tlr signaling can contribute to the production of cytokines which convey downstream on the same inflammatory cascade with consequent amplification 1215on the other side neutralization of adaptor proteins leads to different results the main adaptor proteins involved in tlr pathways in coronavirus infection are trif and myd-88 myeloid differentiation primary response 88 trif is associated with tlr 3 and determines the activation of ifr3 and nk-kb while myd-88 interacts with tlr4 and several proteins involved in il1 function such as irak12 and interleukin 1 il1 receptortrif knock-out mice showed reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the first 2 days after coronavirus infection with a subsequent increase in ifn beta production followed by a marked increase in inflammatory cytokines on day 4 while myd-88 knock-out mice have reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 11the role of tlr 4 also seems to be interesting usually this receptor appears pivotal for the response to the lps of gram-negative bacteria and similar to tlr3 it is associated with activation of transcription factors such as nf-kb and irf3 with an amplification effect of the inflammatory cascade of tlr3 16 17 zhou investigated acute lung damage mediated by respiratory viruses in mouse models these studies showed that laboratory animals infected with sars h1n1 and other lung viruses had pulmonary damage characterized by production of oxidized phospholipids these phospholipids cause the activation of tlr4 similar to bacterial lps which determines activation of myd88 and trif with consequent overproduction of inflammatory cytokines of which il6 represents one of the main determinants of lung damage il6 mice had reduced inflammatory infiltrate and reduced lung damage compared with controls 18these observations together with the evidence of increased il6 levels in patients with covid-19 led to hypothesize on important pathogenic role of il6 consequently blocking il6 modulating levels of this cytokine may represent a possible treatment in severe patients 19 20 tocilizumab tcz a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that has an antagonistic effect on the il-6 receptor used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis could play a key role in the treatment of seriously ill patients with covid-19 21 the first pilot study for the use of tocilizumab enrolled in china 21 patients with severe coronavirus pneumonia this study showed that tocilizumab treatment improved body temperature arterial oxygen saturation spo2 reduced c-rp c-reactive protein and reduced oxygen demand 21these preliminary results led to further development of clinical trials on the use of tocilizumab and sarilumab another il6 inhibitor for the treatment of covid-19 these preliminary encouraging data seem promising as may lead to development of therapeutic strategies for the most severe formsother tlrs such as tlr7 and 8 showed implication in coronavirus response normally tlr7 recognizes single-stranded rna in endosomes and recognizes rna of viruses such as coronaviruses hiv and hcv tlr7 is highly expressed in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdcs and b cells although low levels of this receptor are observed in epithelial cells keratinocytes and hepatocytes tlr7 binds ssrna and activates the myd88 pathway with consequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk cascade nf-kb and other pathways this activation increases expression of tnf-alfa il1beta il-6 il12 and ifn-alfatlr8 is expressed in myeloid cells and low levels in pdcs and similar to tlr7 localizes in endosomes rna degradation in endosomes causes his binding with tlr8 with consequent conformational change and activation of myd88 with a downstream pathway similar to tlr7 2225studies on sars-cov another virus of the same family demonstrate how some regions of the viral genome were associated in bioinformatic models with an immunostimulant activity of tnf-a il-6 and il-12 production through tlr7 and 8 almost 2-fold higher than other single-strand rna viruses 26 all these elements together with the interlinking of the different mechanisms of innate immunity lead to an overactivation of the inflammatory response that makes coronavirus induced-pneumonia an immune-mediated diseasethe complement system is a group of proteins present in the bloodstream in a form of inactive precursors involved in mechanisms of protection from bacteria and viruses the complement system acts through three different pathways the classic pathway the alternative pathway and the lectin pathway to activate different elements of the immune system 27the complement system appears to play an important role in coronaviruses infections several studies on other coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers demonstrate that the complement system is not directly involved in the clearance of the viruses as c3 mice do not have different viral levels compared to normal mice however there are more attenuated forms of lung damagein the lungs of mice with a disease similar to sars complement deposits were abundant with inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes neutrophils macrophages and dendritic cells in c3 mice there were no differences in the lymphocytic infiltrate but there were marked differences in neutrophils and macrophages that infiltrate with inflammatory phenotype which were clearly reduced this suggests that their presence could be related to local activation of the complement 28 29 these findings seem important since in several coronavirus-mediated forms of sars neutrophils and macrophages play a pathogenetic role in alveolar damage as their localization correlates with the most damaged sites of lung tissue while lymphocytes appear crucial in post-infectious recovery as t-cells are involved in sars-cov clearance and higher survival in mice and men 30 31recent preliminary data highlight the importance of complement system in patients with covid-19 32 a small study showed the presence of placental complement deposits in 5 cases of pregnant patients with covid-19 with histological evidence of avascular villi and thrombosis in fetal vessels associated with complement deposits 33for these reasons the use of complement system inhibitors for the treatment of covid-19 has started the first drug used was eculizumab a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits cleavage to c5a and c5b involved in the generation of membrane attack complex this structure as a result of the activation of the complement system creates transmembrane channels that disrupt cell membranes and lead to cell disruption and death 27 the inhibition of this pathway through eculizumab is a current target for the treatment of various hematological diseases 34first data on the use of eculizumab in covid-19 come from a case series of 4 patients after treatment all patients clinically improved within the first 48 h with a reduction of inflammatory markers both esr and c-rp 35in addition to eculizumab amy-101 a small-sized peptidic c3 inhibitor was used to treat covid-19 pneumonia in a single case this drug is under development for hematological diseases and not yet approved 36 after administration patient clinical conditions rapidly improved after 48 h while leukocytosis and lymphopenia improved more slowly these laboratory markers were associated with improvement of respiratory performance and reduction of oxygen demand 37the commitment of immune cells such as macrophages looks important the first studies on autopsies in patients with covid-19 revealed an extensive immune infiltrate consisting mainly of macrophages and monocytes associated with neutrophils eosinophils and cd4 lymphocytes 38the role of macrophages can be inferred from the immune response observed in other coronavirus infection sars-cov has an accessory protein open read frame 8 orf-8 39 this protein determines the activation of intracellular stress mechanisms lysosomal damage and activation of autophagy specifically at a macrophage level orf-8 causes intracellular aggregates that interact with nlrp3 also called cryopyrin a structural protein of the inflammasome determining its activation 40 the inflammasome is a multiprotein complex part of the innate immune system responsible for the activation of inflammatory response inflammasome activation recruits pro-caspase-1 a proteolytic enzyme that cleaves pro-inflammatory cytokines such as pro-il-1  and pro-il18 thus activating them this leads to a particular form of programmed cell death which is called pyroptosis in which the cell following recognition of intracellular pathogens undergoes programmed cell death associated with discharge of inflammatory cytokines chemokines and subsequent chemotaxis of inflammatory cells in particular the release of il18 stimulates the production of ifn gamma which determines the development of th1 polarization contributing to the development of adaptive immunity 4146 it is plausible that it occurs similarly in sars-cov-2 infection since studies on sars-cov-2 genome prove that there is a high analogy with the sars-cov orf-8 region so we may suppose that macrophage activation of the inflammasome plays an important role determining the important inflammatory response observed in patients with more severe forms of infection 47 48 interleukin 1 release by macrophage through the inflammasome contributes to the cytokine storm responsible for the most aggressive forms of covid-19 with symptoms of hyperactivation of the immune system similar to secondary forms of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh infection 49 the pathogenetic role of il1 could lead to important therapeutic implications acting on the inflammatory signaling pathway induced by the inflammasome anakinra a recombinant il-1 receptor antagonist could block the cytokine storm similarly to various secondary hlh conditions 50 several case reports evaluated the effectiveness of anakinra in refractory forms of covid-19 pneumonia in a case series of 9 patients treated with subcutaneous anakinra there was only one case of failure while the other 8 had improvement in clinical conditions and reduction of oxygen flow and blood inflammation markers 51 nowadays there are already 13 clinical trials registered on clinicaltrialsgov investigating the efficacy of the inhibitor of il-1-ra anakinra alone or compared with other drugs 52the complete blood count during covid-19 infection is frequently performed and an increase in neutrophils with lymphopenia is observed however the pathogenetic role of this cell population in lung disease level is still unclear 1 from an anatomopathological point of view some case series of patients who died from covid-19 show a marked infiltration of neutrophils in patients lungs 28however data about the pathogenic role of neutrophils can derive from in vivo and in vitro infections from other forms of coronaviruses in mice lung hemorrhagic lesions follow the same distribution of the inflammatory infiltrate by polymorphonuclear cells pmn they also contribute to the healing process through clearance of the virus and production of growth factors involved in healing and re-epithelialization of damaged regions 29 according to channappanavar et al 53 viral infection leading to the expression of viral proteins and local damage at the epithelial cells leads to the pmn cells infiltration pmn cells contribute to local production of cytokines and chemokines in particular the interaction of pmn cells with lung cells amplifies this effect in vitro work demonstrated that pmn cells when they are linked with type i epithelial alveolar cells at1 infected with coronaviruses had an increased expression of mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines il-18 il-1a il-1b and tnf-a cxc chemokines cxcl-1 cxcl-2 ip-10 and cxcl-11 and cc chemokines ccl- 2 ccl-4 ccl-7 ccl-9 ccl-12 and ccl-22 54 so their role would appear dichotomous on the one hand neutrophils can play as actors in the early recruitment of inflammation cells on the other they can contribute to tissue damage when their action does not appear to be adequately counterbalanced 55interferons ifn are a family of signaling proteins involved in innate and adaptive immune responses with an important role in the inhibition of viral replication through different effector proteins 56 57 there are three types of interferons type i interferon   type ii interferon  and type iii interferon  although all three are likely to be involved in protection from coronavirus infection type i ifn is the most studied in this area and his role appears predominant especially in the early stages of the infection 58 the production of type i ifn is enhanced by viral rnas trough two cytosolic proteins rig-1 retinoic acid-inducible gene i and mda5 melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 the recognition of viral rna by these cytosolic receptors leads to the activation of irf3 and determines the initiation of the transcription of type i if thus contributing to resolution of the infection 59the importance of interferon in coronavirus infections was observed in healthy volunteers higgins et al 60 in the 1980s highlighted in a study on 83 healthy volunteers that intranasal administration of recombinant ifn was associated with a protective effect against coronavirus infections in particular it was observed that in the ifn treated group both the severity of the symptoms and the nasal viral load were significantly lower showing a marked protective effect against respiratory coronavirusthe various members of the coronavirus family can inhibit ifn production in different ways sars-cov-2 have several proteins including nsp1 nsp3 nsp16 orf3b orf6 and m and n proteins similar to proteins of other coronaviruses which act on type i ifn pathway either by inhibiting transcription or by acting on effector mechanisms 58 6163 in particular the ability to inhibit the ifn signal varies between different family members more aggressive family members such as mers-cov and sars-cov have a more marked inhibition of interferon activity while human coronavirus hku1 responsible for mild flu infection has mild ifn inhibition thus contributing to the hypothesis of how ifn attenuates viral replication and consequently reduces pathogenicity 64as a demonstration of the importance of the ifn trouillet assant and colleagues evaluated type i ifn immunoprofiling in covid-19 in 26 critically ill patients they observed a peak in ifn 2 production after 810 days of symptoms onset a small group of patients had suppressed ifn-i production in particular patients with no ifn- production presented poorer outcome and longer intensive care unit stay 65this observation has led to different clinical trials comparing the use of ifn in covid-19 disease of these trials one already completed the enrollment phase an investigation into beneficial effects of interferon beta 1a compared to interferon beta 1b and the base therapeutic regiment in moderate to severe covid-19 a randomized clinical trial clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04343768 and others are still enrolling clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04320238 nct04350671 nct04343976 nct04254874 66 also protective role of ifn is explored in a clinical trial nct04320238 developed to evaluate the effect of intranasal administration of ifn -1b alone or in combination with thymosin- subcutaneous in doctors at high risk of infection 6668slowly we are increasing our knowledge on covid-19 however further studies are still needed to understand its pathophysiological and epidemiological aspects many notions that we have come from in vitro experiments or from other coronaviruses 47 48 currently there is still a lack of elements that allow us to predict adequately between the asymptomatic forms and the systemic form with severe lung damage the hyperactivation of the immune system contributes significantly to the lung and systemic damage that can lead to patients death 62 63 innate immunity acting as the first element of defense can represent together with other mechanisms a promising target for the treatment of patients or at least to better understand the pathogenesis of the diseasecoronaviruses belong to the coronaviridae family of the subfamily coronavirinae the viruses of this family have a broad range of animal hosts and zoonotic transfer between species is common within the coronavirinae subfamily there are four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus 1 2 coronaviruses are non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses whose rna is covered by the solar corona-shaped envelope from which they acquired their name they are characterized by having the largest genome among all rna viruses with an average size of 30 kb 3 two-thirds of the coronaviral genome encodes non-structural proteins responsible for the virus replication including rna-dependent rna polymerase proteases and helicase the 3 end of the genome encodes four main structural proteins of the coronavirus particles which are the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins 4coronaviruses have a long history of infecting humans hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 are the prevalent human coronaviruses which are estimated to have been circulating in the human population for centuries 4 these viruses cause mild upper respiratory infection or in other words common cold symptoms 5 on the other hand three members of the betacoronavirus genus were zoonotically transferred to humans from other mammalian species in the past two decades and caused major epidemics with high mortality rates severe acute respiratory syndrome sars caused by sars-cov started in guangdong province of china in 2002 and affected 8096 people worldwide resulting in 774 deaths 10 mortality rate httpswwwcdcgovsarsaboutfaqhtml middle east respiratory syndrome mers caused by mers-cov started in saudi arabia in 2012 and affected 2506 people causing 862 deaths worldwide with a 35 mortality rate httpswwwwhointcsrdon31-january-2020-mers-united-arab-emiratesen in december 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 caused an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in wuhan city in china which quickly spread throughout the world and grew into a global pandemic affecting hundreds of thousands of people as of march 2020 notably although sars-cov-2 is characterized by higher contagiousness in comparison with sars-cov and mers-cov it causes a much lower mortality rate 23 from the epidemic in china in jan-feb 2020 6 all three viruses can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome ards the most acute and fatal stage of the disease characterized by wide-spread inflammation in the lungs resulting from the aberrant immune response to the viral infection 79therefore in this review we discuss three coronaviruses sars-cov mers-cov and sars cov-2 from an immunological point of view we describe their structure and protein composition mechanisms of entering host cells and mechanisms to evade innate immune responses comparing their hosts invading mechanisms and inflammatory responses will help us understand more about coronaviruses aid in solving the global sars-cov-2 epidemic happening now and find out possible effective treatments to deal with the public health crises caused by coronaviruses in the futureas was demonstrated by cryoelectron tomography and cryoelectron microscopy coronavirus virions are of spherical shape with diameters of approximately 65125 nm 10 the club-shaped spikes on the surface of the virion are the most prominent feature of coronaviruses these spikes confer them a solar corona-like appearance from which the name coronavirus is derived the nucleocapsids are helically symmetrical and are packed by the envelope of the virion 5 coronavirus particles contain four main structural proteins namely the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteinscoronavirus s protein is a large multifunctional class i viral transmembrane protein whose size varies from 1160 amino acids in infectious bronchitis virus ibv in poultry to 1400 amino acids in feline coronavirus fcov 11 it is a trimer located on the virion surface giving the virion a crown-like appearance as for its function it mediates the entry of the infectious virion particles into the cells by making attachments between virion particles and host cell membranes through interaction with various host cellular receptors 12 furthermore it plays an important role in tissue tropism and the determination of host range 13 in addition s protein is capable of inducing host immune response 13 s proteins in all coronaviruses can be divided into two domains s1 and s2 11 s1 functions as the receptor-binding domain rbd while s2 acts as a membrane fusion subunit the s1 domain can be further divided into two subdomains named the n-terminal domain ntd and the c-terminal domain ctd both of these subdomains act as the receptor-binding domains interacting efficiently with various host receptors 13 the s1 ctd contains the receptor-binding motif rbmthe m protein is the most abundant structural protein of the coronavirus virion it is a small 2530 kda protein with three transmembrane domains that is responsible for maintaining the shape of the virion 14 the amino acid sequences of the m protein are diverse in different coronaviruses however the structural similarity is maintained overall 15 it has a short n-terminal glycosylated domain outside the virion and a much larger c-terminal domain inside the virion that extends 68 nm into the viral particle 16 most m proteins are co-translationally inserted into the er membrane without a signal sequence the viral scaffold is maintained by interactions between m proteins recent studies suggest that the m protein exists as a dimer in the virion and may adopt two different conformations allowing it to promote membrane curvature as well as bind to the nucleocapsid 14the e protein is the smallest structural protein 812 kda within the virion it plays a multifunctional role in the pathogenesis assembly and release of the virus the virulence of the virus is also related to the e protein 17 the e proteins from different coronaviruses are highly diverse in their amino acid sequences but are characterized by a common structure 18 there are three domains in the e protein short hydrophilic amino-terminal domain large hydrophobic transmembrane domain and c terminal domain 19 the deletion of the e protein-encoding gene results in slower amplification of the virus but the protein does not seem to be essential for the replication of sars-cov 20 besides its role in assembly and release of the virus the e protein still has other functions for instance the ion channel activity compared to sars-cov the sars-cov-2 2019-ncov e protein reveals a similar amino acid constitution without any substitution 21the n protein is the only structural protein present in the nucleocapsid it is composed of three highly conserved and separate domains an n-terminal domain ntd rna-binding domain or a linker region lkr and a c-terminal domain ctd 22 the ntd binds to the 3 end of the viral rna and is highly divergent from virus to virus 23 the lkr region also called sr serine and arginine domain is charged because of its serine and arginine-rich sequence 24 it has been reported to interact directly with rna in vitro and play a part in cell signaling 25 26 the n protein has two rna substrates that have already been identified the transcriptional regulatory sequence trs 25 and the genomic packaging signal 27 in addition it can also act as a viral suppressor of rna silencing in mammalian cells 28 n protein is also heavily phosphorylated 29 so that it can change its conformation to enhance the affinity for viral vs non-viral rna n protein also binds nsp3 24 30 and the m protein 31 these proteins may interact to help tether the viral genome packagingthe hemagglutinin-esterase he is a structural protein present in a subset of betacoronavirus the protein acts as a hemagglutinin which binds sialic acids of surface glycoproteins it also contains acetylesterase activity 32 these activities are thought to enhance the cell entry mediated by the s protein and virus spread through the mucosa 33sars-cov virus particles are spherical with an average diameter of 78 nm the virus contains a helical nucleocapsid surrounded by an envelope 34 covered with rod-shaped long envelope particles of about 20 nm in length with typical coronal features the structure of sars-cov is similar to that of other coronaviruses the gene sequence is 5 end replicase rep spike s envelope e membrane m nucleocapsid n 3 end there are short untranslated regions at both ends the sequences of the other five non-structural proteins may be distributed between orf s and n 35the sars-cov genome contains a total of 11 orfs and encodes 23 mature proteins 36 among them two major orfs orf1a and orf1b account for about two-thirds of the genome size and encode two important polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins are proteolytically cleaved to produce non-structural proteins the most important of which are rna-dependent rna polymerase and atpase helicase only several nucleotides are different among different viruses 37the genome of mers-cov consists of genes encoding the replicase and structural proteins spike-envelope-membrane-nucleocapsid-poly a3 similar to other coronaviruses the virus has 10 orfs and encodes 16 putative non-structural proteins involved in the viral transcription and replication process 38 39basically the structure of sars-cov-2 shares all the typical characteristics with other coronaviruses several recent studies considering the structure of sars-cov-2 were all focused on the s protein wrapp et al 40 reported a structure at 35  resolution of sars-cov-2 s protein yan et al 41 reported the complex structure of b0at1 an amino acid transporter protein with human host cell binding receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which provided important insights into the molecular basis of coronavirus infection lan et al 42 reported a crystal structure of sars-cov-2 s proteins receptor binding domain rbd region bound to ace2 the viral architecture of sars-cov-2 with post-fusion spike was observed by cyro-em which showed the image of disassociated spikes 43similar to other coronaviruses sars-cov enters cells through endocytosis and membrane fusion and its host receptor is ace2 35 44 sars-cov enters into target cells and can be inhibited by polyanionic compounds suggesting that the sars-cov envelope protein may be positively charged at the same time sars-cov needs to be in the acidified endosome to produce effective infection indicating that its effect is ph-dependent 45 viral rna is replicated in the unique bottle-shaped bilayer membrane compartments 46 several studies have found that sars-cov infection can cause ultrastructural changes in vivo and in cultured cells including the formation of double-membrane vesicles and nucleocapsid inclusions and particles in the cytoplasm 34mers-cov has been reported as being able to infect and kill not only alveolar epithelial cells but also t cells 47 mers-cov enters host cells by binding to a dpp4 receptor expressed in the kidney and other organs 48 and uses proteases of the host to enter lung cells furin activates the s protein on the viral envelope mediating the membrane fusion and virus entry into host cells 49 like sars-cov mers-cov can overcome the hosts natural immune response produce high virus titers and induce cytokine imbalance 38 50sars-cov-2 is mainly considered to infect respiratory epithelial cells but a recent study confirmed that it can also infect t lymphocytes 51 spleens and lymph nodes 52 there are already some solid studies that confirm that ace2 serves as the receptor for the entry of sars-cov-2 analysis of the receptor binding motif rbm a portion of the receptor binding domain rbd that makes contact with ace2 53 revealed that most amino acid residues essential for ace2 binding by sars-cov were conserved in sars-cov-2 hoffmann et al blocked ace2 in vero cells and found that both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection was dramatically inhibited and that serine protease tmprss2 played an important role in sars-cov-2s infection 54 the difference of the host cells among sarscov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 is summarized in figure 1angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is an essential component of the renin-angiotensin system 55 it was shown to bind to the s protein of sars-cov in 2003 by mass spectrometry 56 and was also confirmed to be a receptor of sars-cov-2 required to enter human cells 57 xu et al 58 drafted the currently available worlds largest human kidney cell atlas with 42589 cells and identified 19 clusters through unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis ace2 and tmprss genes were significantly co-expressed in podocytes and proximal convoluted tubules as potential host cells targeted by sars-cov-2 comparative analysis showed that ace2 expression in kidney cells was no less than that in the lung esophagus small intestine and colon suggesting that the kidney may be an important target organ for sars-cov-2as for the susceptibility of different population groups to sars-cov-2 chen et al 59 showed that the expression of ace2 in asians was similar to that in other races and was also not related to sex surprisingly ace2 was shown to be significantly upregulated after virus infection including sars-cov and sars-cov-2 60 according to the public data analysis the level of ace2 expression in adipose tissue was higher than that in lung tissue which was indicative of the possibility that adipose tissue was also a potential target of sars-cov-2 61human coronaviruses can be divided into two groups by their pathogenicity whereas low pathogenic coronaviruses hcov-oc43 hcov-229e hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 cause mild cold-like respiratory illness the highly pathogenic sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 cause immunopathological events that result in fatal pneumonia the invasion of such coronaviruses is associated with severe immune responses which may eventually lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards the innate immune system constitutes the primary line of defense against the invading viruses the pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps represented by the viral rna or dsrna formed during viral replication are recognized by intracellular sensors such as rig-i and mda5 after recognition the downstream signaling cascade results in activation of nf-b and irf3 transcriptional activity 62 this leads to the expression of type i interferon ifn and pro-inflammatory cytokines which constitute the defense line against the virus infection at an early stage 63sars-cov and mers-cov have evolved a number of strategies to suppress type i ifn response during their invasion sars-cov can interfere with the downstream signaling of the rna sensors including mavs and traf36 directly or indirectly 64 as for mers-cov it can downregulate interferon-stimulated genes isg by activating repressive histone modification as its strategy 64as part of the adaptive immunity t cells also play important roles in the primary defense line against coronaviruses there are many t cell epitopes identified to induce an ifn--specific t cell response or cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl response studies have found that epitopes in the s protein 64 65 and the n protein of coronaviruses 66 67 can induce antibody responses in both mice models or patients igm and igg produced by b lymphocytes are formed after the infection of coronaviruses 68 69 the induction of igm is an early and transient response to neoantigens which is later replaced by the induction of igg to play the role as the predominant and long-term antibody igg is characterized by a longer half-life and lower molecular weight which gives it the ability to provide long-lasting protection and effective tissue penetration 68the combined induction of antibodies and virus-specific t cells provides optimal protective immunity following the infection a strong humoral immune response with a high titer of neutralization antibodies targeting the sars-cov s protein that show a protective effect are found in the serum of most patients in addition cd4 t cells targeting n protein and hla-a2 restricted cd8 t cells targeting s protein were observed in sars patients 7072 however the dramatic loss of cd4 t cells in 90100 of patients and cd8 t cells in 8090 of patients was observed in the acute phase of sars patients 73 the delayed adaptive immune response resulted in prolonged virus clearance and correlated with the severity of the sars disease 74 one possible reason for the decreased number of t cells is that after infecting alveolar epithelial cells sars-cov encodes multiple structural and non-structural proteins that antagonize innate ifn response 7578 the delayed ifn response orchestrates infiltration of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages imms and elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines 79 imm-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines such as type i inf 80 may sensitize t cells to undergo apoptosis through bim 81 or bcl-xl 82-mediated intrinsic pathway by e protein thus consequently impeding the viral clearance 79 depletion of imms or neutralization of pro-inflammatory cytokines was shown to protect mice from lethal sars-cov infection 79 another possible explanation of the reduction of virus-specific t cells is the alteration in antigen presenting cell apc function and impaired dendritic cell dc migration resulting in the reduced priming of t cells 83 84 this mechanism was supported by animal studies using sars-cov-ma15 the mouse-adapted strain of sars-cov inefficient activation of respiratory dcs by sars-cov-ma15 attributed to poor virus-specific cd4 and cd8 t cells responses 84 moreover the age-dependent reduction in the magnitude of t cell response may also explain the higher susceptibility to sars-cov with advanced age 85 consistently depletion of cd4 t cells delayed sars-cov urbani strain clearance and enhanced pneumonitis 86 in contrast transfer of sars-cov-specific cd4 and cd8 t cells resulted in rapid virus clearance and amelioration of the disease 87 mechanistically the pattern recognition receptors such as myd88 88 and trif 89 are required for protection against sars-cov infectionin addition to the humoral response a 3-year follow-up study of 176 sars patients showed that the level of igm peaked at 1 month after symptoms onset and igg peaked at 24 months 90 patients with a longer illness period showed a lower neutralizing antibody response compared to patients with a shorter illness duration 91 it was reported that vaccine-elicited neutralizing monoclonal antibody mab targeting the s protein of sars-cov facilitates viral entry into host cells and enhances viral infectivity 92 this phenomenon is the so called antibody-dependent enhancement ade 69 which is regarded as a great burden for vaccine developmentthe immune response mechanism triggered by mers-cov has still not been fully studied it is known that the s protein of mers-cov can upregulate the levels of the repressors of the tlr signaling pathways such as of il-1r-associated kinase irak-m and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ppary irak-m and ppary negatively regulate irf7 which normally induces the expression of ifn-alpha and ifn-beta 93 if these negative regulators can maintain their persistence in the long-term the clearance of mers-cov infections will be impairedcomparatively less is known about the fate of t cells in mers-cov infection and little information is known about the recognized epitopes 72 similar to sars-cov mers-cov-specific cd8 t cells are also important for clearing the virus 94 though both sars-cov and mers-cov infects monocyte-macrophages dcs and activated t cells only mers-cov was able to replicate in the infected immune cells which consequently resulted in aberrant induction of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and dcs 95 96 and of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathway in t cells 47 such active replication of mers-cov in these immune cells may underlie the comparatively higher fatality rate of mers diseaseas for humoral immunity antibody response to mers-cov is typically detected on the second and third week after the onset of infection but the longevity of the antibodies seemed to be correlated to the severity of disease in patients who had pneumonia caused by mers-cov the antibodies were still detectable 13 months after infection 97 however in patients after mild or subclinical infection of mers-cov mers antibodies were detected at low levels 98 similar to sars-cov mab that has a strong binding affinity to the spike protein of mers-cov also facilitates ade viral entry into host cells 99according to case reports the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 includes immunological responses of both innate and adaptive immunity systemscompared to normal patients patients requiring icu admission had higher concentrations of gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf these cytokines may help to judge the condition of patients 100secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh which is mostly triggered by virus infection in adults is a condition in which the body makes too many activated immune cells macrophages and lymphocytes httpsprimaryimmuneorgdiseasehemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis-hlh the cytokine profile of shlh is associated with the severity of covid-19 which is characterized by increased interleukin il-2 il-7 gcsf ip10 cxcl10 mcf1 ccl2 mip1a ccl3 and tnf- 100 101 therefore it is possible that this phenomenon happens in covid-19 patients the current explanation for the shlh phenomenon is that the body has experienced a cytokine storm caused by excessive immunity however the details of immune and inflammatory response to sars-cov-2 infection are still under scrutinysimilar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 also targeted pneumocytes both types i and ii and alveolar macrophages 102 consistently pathological examination of patients who were infected by sars-cov-2 revealed the infiltration of plasma cells and macrophages and a high density of macrophages and foam cells in the alveolar cavities 103 however compared with sars-cov sars-cov-2 did not significantly induce types i ii or iii interferons in the infected human lung tissues 102 as cytokine storm may be the main cause for the severity of the coronavirus infection these findings support the relevant severity of sars-cov and sars-cov-2as for adaptive immunity it is known that the low levels of cd4 and cd8 t cells are related to the mortality of sars-cov-2 patients 104 105 the up-regulation of apoptosis and autophagy in pbmc of sars-cov-2 patients 106 suggested that similar to how mers can directly infect t cells and induce apoptosis 47 sars-cov-2 may cause lymphocytopenia through inducing t-cell apoptosis or autophagic cell death it was supported by a recent report showing that sars-cov-2 could infect t cells through receptor-dependent or s protein-mediated membrane fusion 51as for the antibody response it was reported that in 23 patients with covid-19 the viral load peaked during the first week and then began to fall both igg and igm antibodies which targeted the nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor began to rise around 10 days after symptom onset and the seroconversion of most patients happened within the first 3 weeks 107 another study among 173 patients reported that the seroconversion rate of ab igm and igg was 931 827 and 647 respectively and the median seroconversion time for ab igm and igg were day 11 day 12 and day 14 after onset respectively 108 whether ade can happen in sars-cov-2 infection is still not confirmed but as humans have already experienced a sars-cov epidemic and several other coronavirus infection such as 229e 109 according to former studies of sars-cov 92 it is possible that ade can also happen in the infection of sars-cov-2 110the recent outbreak of the sars-cov-2 infection has caused a worldwide crisis in the epidemiology and medical systems since sars-cov-2 was confirmed to share the same host receptor ace2 with sars-cov the strategies used to tackle sars-cov are under investigation for treating sars-cov-2 infection however despite both attacking lungs and using the same host receptor to enter target cells the three coronaviruses causing three serious pneumonia epidemics are different in the range of infected cell types and their effects on infected cellssars-cov is mainly replicated in respiratory epithelial cells though it can also infect a variety of immune cells such as monocytes macrophages dendritic cells and activated t cells 111114 mers-cov in contrast not only infects the immune cells and epithelial cells but is also able to replicate in the former cells and lyse them which may be one of the reasons for the high mortality of mers 47 96 115 the details of the infection and lytic replication mechanisms of sars-cov-2 in host cells are currently unclear table 1 however diarrhea liver and kidney damage and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis have been reported in patients with sars-cov-2 indicating that the host cell range of the virus may be wider than currently recognized 100following the invasion of a pathogen the host triggers a serious response from the immune system sars-cov does not directly lyse and kill t cells but indirectly induces t cell apoptosis 82 mers-cov which is a more severe and aggressive virus directly targets t cells and undergoes lytic replication thus directly causing their death 47 therefore mers-cov has a direct impact on the immune system sars-cov-2 is reported to infect t lymphocytes 51 but we still dont know how this affects the immune system in particular figure 2 a severe reduction of immune cells was observed in patients infected with sars-cov-2 but whether this phenomenon is directly caused by the virus or indirectly caused by dysregulated cytokine production by immune cells has yet to be determined 100 direct viral effects require treatment strategies that target viral replication indirect viral effects through dysregulated cytokine production by residential macrophagesdendritic cells or antigen presentation by apcs can now be treated by immune therapy approaches understanding the behavior of sars-cov-2 in the host cells of the human body and its effect on the immune system may provide important tips for combating the diseasethere have already been some studies showing that other tissues and organs may also be the target of sars-cov-2 further reminding us to focus on other organs besides lungs such as the kidneys spleen and lymph nodes 52 116 this may give us some hints for the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in some severe covid-19 cases 117 moreover research on the expression pattern of ace2 in different population groups and races indicates that there is no sex or race bias in susceptibility to sars-cov-2 118it is still unclear whether reinfection with sars-cov-2 can occur in recovered patients there has been some news about reoccurring covid-19 cases httpswwwscmpcomnewschinasocietyarticle3065091coronavirus-recovered-patient-dies-china-reports-139-new-cases but as they are not formal case reports it is not certain whether these patients had fully recovered from covid-19 before the symptoms relapse in a study on rhesus macaques re-exposed to sars-cov-2 after disappearance of symptoms and positive antibody response to primary infection no evidence of reinfection was found 119 also how long the antibodies will remain in recovered patients is still unclear since the vaccine against covid-19 has still not been developed the recommendations of the cdc which advises people to wear cloth face masks and keep a 6-foot distance from others should be the best way to prevent reinfection httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncovprevent-getting-sickdiy-cloth-face-coveringshtmlto deepen the research on coronavirus humans must learn enough lessons from this pandemic in the wave of globalization and scientific and technological progress infectious diseases have become more prone to spreading which has made it harder for humans to deal with them how to understand the infectious biomolecular mechanism and immune pathological environment in the future will be a more important proposition for us than ever before according to chinas response to the epidemic it did not take long to identify what the pathogen was but the imperfect public health emergency system is the main reason for the spread of the epidemic therefore in addition to developing drugs vaccines and updating treatment plans scholars should also call on governments to strengthen the construction and improvement of social public health emergency systems to prevent similar pandemics from happening agains-hc and p-cc designed constructed and organized this work and reviewed article yl m-lw c-sc y-py and ay collected all references and wrote up the manuscript w-yl y-hl y-tl and y-jc prepared the study materials and organized figures and tablethe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestthe innate immune response to viral infections includes cellmediated effector mechanisms such as natural killer nk activity and soluble effectors among which type i interferons ifn play a major role ifns are a group of cytokines initially identified by their ability to induce resistance to viral infection

 but also currently recognized as proinflammatory molecules and potent modulators of both innate and adaptative immune responses

9
 in the course of an experimental influenza infection of pigs type i ifn is present in the bronchoalveolar secretions together with tumor necrosis factor tnf and interleukins il1 and il6
10
 the ifn response starts within 12 h post inoculation pi and lasts for several days peak cytokine titers occur within 1824 h pi and they are correlated with the peak of virus replication clinical signs and infiltration of neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids in addition the level of lung proinflammatory cytokines is correlated with the intensity of clinical signs thus prior vaccination of pigs against influenza strongly reduced the production of infectious virus and cytokines in the lungs upon challenge which was associated with clinical protection
11
 ifn producing leukocytes have been detected in the bronchiolar epithelium of infected pigs at the peak of virus replication by immunohistochemistry the ifnproducing cells were found at very low numbers and in close contact with influenza virus infected cells
12
 an early type i ifn production was also characterized in coronavirus infected pigs including at mucosal sites within 24 h after an experimental respiratory coronavirus infection prcv in pigs type i ifn started to be produced in the lung secretions for more than 4 days in the absence of significant levels of other proinflammatory cytokines tnf and il1 at the same time there were few if any clinical signs and lung neutrophil infiltration was much less prominent than during a swine influenza infection which suggests that lung type i ifn in itself is not involved in proinflammatory and harmful effects
13
 the coronavirus tgev experimental infection in newborn piglets is also characterized by a high and early ifn production in intestinal secretions and in several other organs
14

 this coronavirus experimental infection model has generated original data pertaining to mechanisms of ifn induction by viral glycoproteins thus only one viral external glycoprotein gm was shown to play a major ifn inducing role
16
 
17
 accordingly viruslike particles made of only two tgev proteins m and e and devoid of viral genome were as effective as native virus to induce ifn production by porcine leukocytes
18
 the ifn producing cells referred to as natural interferon producing cells nipc
19
 were recently identified as plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdc in both humansmice
20
 
21
 and pigs
22
 pdc are lowdensity cells negative for cd11c and lineage markers cd3 cd19 cd56 and cd14 but positive for mhcii cd4 and cd123
23
 in the course of coronavirus induced in vivo ifn production in pigs nipc were detected in spleen and secondary lymphoid organs and shared several phenotypic features with pdc
14
 
24
 regarding mucosal innate responses ifnproducing cells were investigated in situ by immunohistochemical staining of duodenum jejunum ileum mesenteric lymph node popliteal lymph node and spleen cryosections collected from tgevinfected piglets at the time of highest ifn production this showed that the vast majority of ifn producing cells were located in the small intestine inside lamina propria and surrounding peyers patches and accumulated in the mesenteric lymph nodes
14
 it was therefore concluded that most if not all circulating ifn in tgevinfected piglets originates from gut and mesenteric lymph node these intestinal ifnproducing cells are in contact with but distinct from tgevantigen positive cells and express mhcii therefore resembling potential intestinal porcine pdc nevertheless the frequency of intestinal nipc is very low compared to ordinary dc that are extremely numerous sometimes filling the whole lamina propria of a villus
25
 one can wonder about their function at such site their small number makes them unlikely to be a major antigenpresenting dc subset on the other hand even a rare intestinal nipc in mesenteric lymph node will flood the t cell area with ifn which is very likely to influence the outcome of the immune response contrary to their murine counterpart but in common with humans porcine nipcpdc are the only dc subset able to bind bacterialviral components via tlr9 tlr7 or yet unknown receptors
26
 mucosal porcine nipcpdc could therefore be preferential targets for using natural ligands of tlr9 bacterial and viral dna or cpgodn
27
 as immunomodulators and ifn inducers given the potent ifn mediated antiviral and immunomodulatory effects
7
 the use of ifn or ifn inducers may prove an efficient strategy
28
 for a better control of influenza virus and coronavirus infections in pigs besides type i ifn other antiviral innate immune mechanisms include nk cell activity and both influenza virus and coronavirus were shown to activate porcine nk activity
29

antiviral adaptative immune mechanisms involve neutralizing antibody ab including secretory iga at mucosal surfaces and cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctl because influenza virus and coronaviruses target mucosal surfaces adaptative immune responses have to be specifically characterized at mucosal sites thus nasal and pulmonary antibody responses were analyzed in influenza virus infected or vaccinated pigs showing shortlived igg but more durable iga local ab responses
30
 
31
 which resulted in protection to virus challenge
32
 interestingly primary influenza virus infection in pigs induced local antigenspecific lymphoproliferative responses
33
 and a longlived increase of lung cd8 t cells which could play a role in the broadspectrum immune protection to heterotypic virus strains
34
 pigs infected by a prcv showed virusspecific igg absecreting cells and lymphoproliferative responses in the bronchial lymph nodes with low ab responses in the gut whereas the tgev induced more iga absecreting cells in gut tissues and t cell responses in mesenteric lymph nodes which illustrates the importance of the route of antigen or vaccine administration for inducing local immune effector mechanisms
35
 
36

these results show that specific antiviral effector mechanisms including igg and iga ab production lymphoproliferative responses and cd8 t cell presumably ctl recruitment are induced at mucosal sites of virus replication following infection andor vaccination with either influenza virus or coronavirus in the pig respiratory tract local immunity is more appropriate for controlling virus spreading and airborne transmission from animals to animals and from animal reservoirs to human targetsin conclusion pigs are valuable animal models for evaluating the respiratory mucosal immune parameters and the preventive or therapeutic strategies that are important for controlling the spreading of zoonotic viral respiratory infectionscoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an acute respiratory infection disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars coronavirus 2 or sars-cov-2 that was first identified in december 2019 in wuhan hubei china the incidence of covid-19 has grown dramatically in china and the virus has rapidly spread to more than 200 countries of the world since the late february 2020 on 28 feb 2020 world health organization raised the global covid-19 risk to highest level covid-19 outbreak has become a potential threat to the global public health the impact of economic burden imposed by covid-19 is substantial and considerable in medical resources quarantine measures restriction of trade disruption of production loss of job deteriorated finance etc indeed this pandemic highlights the need for effective therapeutics for sars-cov-2 infections that can improve patients clinical conditions although mountains of novel findings on covid-19 are accumulating the pathogenesis of covid-19 remains to be fully elucidated for development of better intervention strategies in this review we will give a general overview of the existing studies on the epidemiology virology clinical presentation pathophysiology diagnosis and treatment of sars-cov-2 infectioncovid-19 cases were firstly reported in wuhan city hubei province china in september 2019 from then on cases have been distributed globally except for antarctica by june 12th 2020 more than 75 00000 confirmed cases of covid-19 have been reported approximately 3500000 cases were cured and more than 421000 infected people were died with global death-to-cases ratio 561 updated cases throughout the world can be found in the following websites httpscoronavirusjhuedumaphtml

httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reportsestimation of the incubation period and viral shedding duration is helpful to assess the risk of transmission make measures of isolation and quarantine and provide rational antiviral interventions for treating patients based on the current epidemiological investigations the incubation period of covid-19 is about 1-14 days with a median time of 3-7 days and can be up to 24 days in a tiny minority of cases from exposure to symptoms onset 1 2 3 viral shedding may begin 2-3 days before the presence of the first symptom 4 median duration of viral shedding has found to be 200 days and the longest duration could be up to 37 days in survivors while the viral rna in non-survivors could be detected until death 5 in the cases of severe covid-19 patients the median duration of viral shedding has shown to be 310 days from illness onsetnovel coronavirus is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplet aerosol direct or indirect contact several studies have provided epidemiological evidences that human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus in family hospitals and even across cities were occurred 6 7 8 guan et al found that patterns of human-to-human transmission included familial aggregation 6 asymptomatic virus carrier 9 and the three-phase outbreak 10 which were in accordance with other findings the super-spreaders may occur in this pandemic 1 prominently infected persons without symptoms during the incubation period could be sources of infection suggesting the asymptomatic transmission of sars-cov-2 911 12 13 14 15 the rapid and uncontrollable spread of this virus may ascribe to the silent transmission by some patients with atypical symptomsmore and more evidences have proved that this virus can spread through multiple routes as well to et al detected the self-collected saliva a non-invasive specimen by one-step real-time rt-qpcr assay targeting the s protein 6 they obtained the positive results that were consistent with those detected through nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens which may be due to the infection of epithelial cells in saliva gland ducts or the secretions from nasopharynx and lung in the saliva therefore virus in saliva may allow transmission via speaking or coughing 16zhang et al firstly reported the presence of viral nucleotide in anal swabs and blood during the later stage of infection the level of viral rna was higher in anal swab than in blood suggesting the possibility of multiple routes transmission of virus including oral-fecal or body fluid route17 studies of xiao et al have shown that the viral rna tested in feces was positive even in gastrointestinal tracts was negative 18 another two findings emphasized that the diarrhea as onset symptom should not be ignored and the fecal-oral transmission route should be taken seriously 1920 chen et al analyzed the viral rna levels in pharyngeal swab blood and the anal swab by real-time pcr the concentrations of viral rna in blood and anal swabs were positively correlated with the severity of covid-19 since the spike protein of novel coronavirus interacts with the host ace2 receptor for viral attachment and entry to establish infection the presence of viral rna in digestive tract in which ace2 is abundantly expressed confirmed the viral replication in extrapulmonary sites early detection of viral rna in the blood and digestive tract may be helpful in predicting the progression of covid-19 21a clinician who wore an n95 mask but not safety goggles was infected with sars-cov-2 while working with covid-19 patients in wuhan suggesting the potential transmission through mucous membranes in the eyes 22 despite no detectable viral rna was in the conjunctival swabs samples from infected patients reported in the further studies 23 deng et al have confirmed that sars-cov-2 could be transmitted through ocular conjunctival route in a rhesus macaques model cautioning us the necessity of eye protection to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 24chen et al reported potential vertical transmission in nine pregnant women with laboratory confirmed covid-19 infection when the newborns were delivered by caesarean section amniotic fluid cord blood throat swabs from newborns and breastmilk were collected for testing and all of them were negative for the novel coronavirus currently there is no conclusive evidence supporting that women with covid-19 in the late trimester of pregnancy could cause intrauterine infection due to vertical transmission however this investigation is restricted to the small number of cases and the pregnant women in the third trimester 2526 it should be noted that infants and pregnant women remain susceptible to covid-19 infection special care should be taken to prevent neonatal infections from mothers with covid-19overall the above studies warn the virus transmission through multiple routes including respiratory tract alimentary tract nasolacrimal system oral-fecal and body fluid route and that the potential maternal-fetal vertical transmission should not be ignored the properties of viral shedding before symptoms appear and via multiple routes indicate the strong infectiousness of sars-cov-2 and pose a huge challenge in controlling the spread of diseasesars-cov-2 belongs to the family coronaviruses and subgenus sarbecovirus beta-cov lineage b and is a new strain virus distinct from severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 shows more than 85 identity to a bat sars-like cov bat-sl-covzc45 mg7729331 27 its genome is a positive-sense single-stranded rna of about 30 kb with structured untranslated region utr on the 5-end poly a on the 3-end and 11 open reading frames encoding 27 proteins the gene order is as follows 5 utr nt 1-265-replicase orf1ab nt 266-21555-spike nt 21563-25384-orf3a nt

proteins orf3a orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 orf10  28 29 30 31 currently more than 40000 sars-cov-2 genomes publicly available httpswwwgisaidorg
httpsbigdbigaccnncovreleasegenome  represent the genomic diversity of the virus in the world though all sequenced sars-cov-2 genomes share more than 99 similarity it has been found that there are at least two hypervariable genomic hotspots one is a silent mutation in the orf1ab the other one is an amino acid polymorphism serineleucine in orf8 which is predicted to induce structural disorder of the protein in the c-terminal portion 30 149 mutations were identified in 103 sars-cov-2 genome sequences and through population genetic analyses investigators uncovered two major types of sars-cov-2 in circulation l and s type based on two tightly linked snps at position 8782 and 28144 the s type 30 is the ancestral version while l type 70 is derived from s type although l type is more prevalent and more aggressive in the outbreak based upon the evolution of novel coronavirus there may be great distinctions in transmissibility pathogenicity and virulence between s and l type 32 forster et al analyzed 160 complete sars-cov-2 genomes by phylogenetic network and found three central variants named a b and c the genome of type a is the most closely related to the bat coronavirus which is supposed to be the root of the outbreak type a is mainly found in united states and australia type b is distinguished from type a by two mutations t8782c and c28144 t and is prevalent in wuhan and east asia it seems that type b is resistant outside ease asia populations since type b is not intended to spread outside east asia without further mutated type c is derived from type b by the mutation g26144 t and mainly found in europeans and also found in singapore hong kong taiwan and south korea but absent in mainland china 33in addition to the viral mutations mentioned above the human genetic variation may partly contribute to the geographical variations in the prevalence and mortality of covid-19 pandemicdelanghe et al have investigated the role of the di polymorphism in intron 16 of hosts angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 ace1 in the epidemiology of covid-19 infections prevalence and mortality data of the covid-19 infections from european african mediterranean middle east and asian countries were included in the study they found that the frequency of ace1 d-allele was negatively correlated with prevalence of covid-19 suggesting the confounded role of ace1 di polymorphism in the circulation of sars-cov-2 and the outcome of the infection 34 35 36 37 while complement component 3 c3 polymorphism a central component of the innate immune system has been found to be a principal component of gene frequencies among european populations and a crucial determinant for covid-19 prevalence and mortality 37 dais paper suggested infected patients carrying a allele of abo blood group type especially those with cardiovascular diseases in particular hypertension tend to develop severe covid-19 38 sars-cov-2 virion particles are enveloped roughly spherical or moderately polymorphic with diameter ranging from 80-160 nm 39 sars-cov-2 has four structural proteins including spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins necessary for virion particle formation and four highly conserved nonstructural proteins including papain-like protease plpro nsp3 3cl-protease 3clpro nsp5 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp nsp12 and helicase nsp 13 40 that are needed for viral rna replication 4142 the n protein forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with viral rna the s protein is responsible for virus entry to the host cell by binding to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the width of the s protein is about 7 nm and the length is about 23 nm 39 s protein has unique insertion of four amino acids prra which is a furin-like or tmprss2 cleavage site 4344 s protein can be cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits when the s1 subunit is dissociated s2 undergoes a conformational change extending itself from a compressed form to a nail shape s1 is the receptor binding domain that helps the virus attach to the surface of the host cell then the cellular proteases prime the s protein and cleave it at specific site thereby promoting the s2 mediated fusion process of virus with host cell membrane the incorporation of prra resulting in the cleavage of s protein and triggering fusion distinguished from other beta-coronaviruses may greatly affect the regulation of the pathogenicity and transmissibility of sars-cov-2 4546understanding how sars-cov-2 hijacks the host cells during infection is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies a global collaboration have identified 332 high-confidence interactions between sars-cov-2 proteins and human proteins these protein interactions participate in several complexes and biological processes including dna replication epigenetic and gene expression regulators vesicle trafficking lipid modification rna processing and regulation ubiquitin ligases signaling nuclear transport machinery cytoskeleton mitochondria and extracellular matrix around 40 of these interacting proteins were bound up with endomembrane compartments or vesicle trafficking pathways the sars-cov-2 main protease nsp5 may affect the transport of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria some viral proteins also showed interaction with natural immune signaling proteins involved in ifn pathway nf-b pathway etc which may take part in cytokine storm 69 compounds were found to target these protein interactions including fda approved drugs compounds in clinical trials and preclinical compounds based on screening assays two broad sets of drugs and compounds mrna translation inhibitors and sigma1 and sigma2 receptor modulators were showed to exert antiviral activity 47the clinical manifestations of covid-19 range from asymptomatic infection to flu-like illness such as fever cough dry cough and fatigue to pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome and even multi-organ failures with high morbidity and mortality the clinical diversity of non-specific signs and symptoms is poorly understood and seems to be correlated to the age underlying comorbidities and immunity status of the individualwang et al reported 138 hospitalized cases of 2019-ncov infected pneumonia in which most patients had fever fatigue dry cough lymphopenia prolonged prothrombin time and higher level of lactate dehydrogenase 14 specifically abnormal coagulation features including higher d-dimer and fibrin degradation product levels longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are significantly associated with poor prognosis 48 chest ct scans in the lungs of all patients showed ground glass opacity or bilateral patchy shadows 14 but a larger scale of research on 1099 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces throughout china showed that a certain amount of patients did not have fever or abnormalities on chest ct making the diagnosis more complicating 1 severe patients who received intensive care unit icu care were more likely to have two or more underlying comorbidities that usually associated with poor clinical outcomes hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes were the most common comorbidities while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd was less common other comorbidities include pharyngeal pain dizziness abdominal pain dyspnea anorexia cerebrovascular diseases hepatitis b infections chronic kidney diseases and malignancy and complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome 47 arrhythmia and shock 1449the fact that sars-cov could attack the nervous system was confirmed by the viral genome sequence detected in the infected patients cerebrospinal fluid in the findings of mao et al more than 30 patients showed the neurological manifestations including central nervous system symptoms headache dizziness disturbance of consciousness epilepsy etc peripheral nervous system symptoms decreased taste decreased smell decreased appetite neuralgi etc and skeletal muscle injury the neurological symptoms were more frequent in severe patients than in non-severe patients it is worth noting that the first symptoms of some patients occurred in the nervous system such as facial paralysis hallucinations etc the virus circulation in the blood and crossing the blood-brain barrier as well as the highly expression levels of ace2 in vascular endothelial cells of nervous system and in smooth muscle cells of skeletal muscle may contribute to the viral infection in nervous system 50 on march 4 a 56-year-old covid-19 patient in china was firstly reported to present with viral encephalitis httpswwwcaixinglobalcom2020-03-06new-research-sparks-debate-over-whether-coronavirus-can-infect-the-nervous-system-101524986html though this is a rare case in terms of clinical treatment it provides some important indications when the central nervous system is infected cerebral edema or even hernia may occur which is life-threatening it is necessary to monitor the neurological indicators to avoid the death since the primary damage of sars-cov-2 infection is mainly in the lungs whether viral infection leading to pathological damage in other tissues and organs is primary or secondary remains to be further investigatedlaboratory abnormalities provide some vital implications that may serve as predictors for severity of disease older age higher sequential organ failure assessment score and levels of d-dimer greater than 1 gml were three potential risk factors related to poor prognosis as reported by zhou et al 5 white blood cells count neutrophil count and levels of d-dimer creatine kinase and creatine were higher in icu patients compared to non-icu patients 14 liu et al found that the viral load of sars-cov-2 from patients respiratory tracts was positively correlated to the lung disease severity albumin percentage of lymphocytes and neutrophils lactate dehydrogenase and c-reactive protein were highly associated to the acute lung injury and may be useful to predict the disease severity notably the angiotensin ii levels in the plasma of the infected patients were markedly higher than that in healthy persons and strongly related to viral load and pulmonary injury suggesting the potential treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers for covid-19 51ones own immunity serves as a powerful defense against pathogens imbalance of immune function occurs if the immune system of the individual to the infection is less active or hyperactive than normalduring the sars-cov-2 infection the induced responses are two phased fig 1
 in the viral response phase virus infected cells activate an innate immune response recruiting neutrophils macrophages and monocytes to clear the virus the specific immune response priming the adaptive t and b cell subsequently is required to promote in most cases of incubation and mild to moderate stages normally this process is able to resolve the infection however in some cases virus can inhibit the inherent immunity and thus evade the acquired immune response this imbalance of immune function occurs resulting in propagation of virus and damage of tissues xu et al reported that the counts of peripheral cd4 and cd8 t cells of a patient with severe immune injury caused by covid-19 were reduced but their status was hyperactivated 52 zhang et al reported a couple cases and found that the levels of immune cells cd3 cd4 cd8 cd19 and cd1656 were declined during the onset period of infection cd19 and cd1656 cells the cytotoxic natural killer cells exerting antiviral activity were increased when the patients condition obtained improvement suggesting the predictor role of cd19 and cd1656 as progression of infection 53in the host inflammatory response phase damaged cells caused by sars-cov-2 infection in the lungs induce inflammation that is mainly regulated by pro-inflammatory macrophages and granulocytes hyperactive immune response of the individual to the infection may trigger a cytokine storm resulting in life-threatening widespread pulmonary inflammation huang et al reported that cytokine storm was closely related to the disease severity in sars-cov-2 infection initial concentrations of il1b il1ra il7 il8 il9 il10 basic fgf gcsf gmcsf ifn ip10 mcp1 mip1a mip1b pdgf tnf and vegf in plasma were higher in infected patients than in healthy persons among the infected patients levels of il2 il7 il10 gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf in plasma were higher in icu patients as compared to non-icu patients 54 however the questions that remains unanswered are how does the body perceive the virus and release cytokines why and how higher levels of cytokines cause the deterioration of clinical conditions and even mortality which cytokines and their pathways can be potential therapeutic targets in response to viral infections the host needs to effectively mobilize the immune system to clear virus and avoid the cytokine storm triggered by over activation our understanding of virus-induced cytokine storms and the balance between immune system and virus is still limited to address these problems we still have a long way to gocurrently nucleic acid testing kits are commercial available and still the gold standard to confirm the presence of the sars-cov-2 chus group has established two one-step quantitative reverse transcription-pcr assays primers binding to the orf1b and n genes of subgenus sarbecoviruses respectively were used to amplify the viral genome but these developed assays couldnt distinguish sars-cov sars-cov-2 and other sarbecoviruses further sequence analyses of amplicons that are positive in rt-pcr results are required to confirm the species 55 shirato et al have developed two nested rt-pcr assays with primers bounding to the orf1 and s protein and two real-time rt-pcr assays with primers binding to the sequence encoding n protein successfully detecting 25 sars-cov-2 positive infected patients in japan 56 corman et al have designed a workflow for diagnosis of novel coronavirus without the virus isolates available making use of the genetically similarity to 2003 sars-cov and synthetic nucleic acid technology they have developed three rt-pcr assays as follows primers binding to e gene can detect bat-associated sars-related coronaviruses specific probe hybridizing to rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp was used to make a distinction between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the rt-pcr assay designed to amplify the region of n gene was less sensitive so that it was not further validated 57normally the throat and nasal swab in the upper respiratory tract of the patients are sampled for nucleic acid testing which is fast and convenient for physicians to operate and causes no trauma to the patients nonetheless novel coronavirus mainly infects the lower respiratory tract and the viral load in the upper respiratory tract may not be high enough for detection resulting in false negatives 58 in addition given the viral replicative activity is influenced by the host immune system it is possible that one has clinical symptoms but the quantity of virus is not sufficient for detection leading to the occurrence of false negative results as well whats more the progression and severity of pneumonia cannot be concluded based on the real-time rt pcr results infected patients with false negative rna results bring enormous challenges for medical workers to provide appropriate treatment and take isolation measures in time diagnosing the confirmed covid-19 cases merely by nucleic acid testing is obviously not accurate enoughthe most common manifestations of chest ct in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia are ground glass opactities and patchy consolidation in bilateral lungs according to the distributions and types of lesions chest ct manifestations can be divided into three stages at the early stage only a single ground-glass opacity or irregular solid nodules of varying sizes can be seen as the infection progresses ground-glass opactities with a rounded morphology reticulation or crazy paving pattern and patchy parenchyma or mixed consolidation distributed in the middle and peripheral area of bilateral lungs may present nodules involving multiple lobes are increased and enlarged a few patients may have small pleural effusions when the disease progresses to a critical stage more extensive pulmonary consolidation and ground-glass opactities diffuse pulmonary lesions increased density of bilateral lungs and even white lung may appear pleural effusions lymphadenopathy and an air bronchogram sign may present in a small number of patients 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 a clinical trial involving in using ct scores to predict the mortality of patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia have been completed nct04284046it is not surprising that patients have false negative results in nucleic acid testing but the ct images show some features of novel coronavirus infection 65 therefore in the latest edition of chinas diagnosis and treatment guidelines for new coronavirus pneumonia chest ct scan is one of the clinical diagnosis standards of suspected cases and the nucleic acid testing kit is then used to make a clinical diagnosis of confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infectionnot as nucleic acid testing or chest ct images that can detect acute infection antibody tests detects the person ever infected especially those with asymptomatic infection igg and igm antibodies in serum of sars-cov-2 infected patients arise simultaneously or sequentially within around 1 to 3 weeks after illness onset 66 n and different forms of s protein are the major antigens for detecting the antibodies induced by sars-cov-2 infection different types of assays for antibody testing can be applied to assess different aspects of immunological response and function of antibodies induced by virus infectionzhao et al have developed a serology elisa kit using cho cell expressing fully glycosylated full length sars-cov-2 s1 protein for surveillance of the infection at the early stage glycosylation of s1 protein is important to facilitate the protein folding properly and increase the proteins affinity to the receptor ensuring the great sensitivity and high specificity of the elisa kit 67 padoan et al have developed a chemiluminescence immunoassay using maglumitm 2000 plus for simultaneously detecting sars-cov-2 iggigm in sera using this system serum tubes with a gel separator can be the primary samples for direct viral inactivation which is safe for the operators they measured the kinetics of immunoglobulin time and showed the rapid increase of igm and igg on 6-7 days since the symptom onset 68 perera et al have developed an elisa assay using recombinant receptor-binding domain of the s protein for screening the sars-cov-2 infection and plaque reduction neutralization tests using live virus for confirming the induced protective immunity this strategy could be used to evaluate infection attack rates in the population and estimate the severity of illness and herd immunity 69 nie et al have developed a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay using a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudovirus production system for determining neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 full-length spike protein of sars-cov-2 was pseudotyped in the virus mimicking the viral attachment and entry during infectious process this assay is much safe and can be performed in bsl-2 laboratories 70except for the methods mentioned above other diagnosis methods are expected to increase the detection rates of infection a clinical trial on evaluation of rapid diagnostic kit detecting igmigg for novel coronavirus pneumonia is ongoing in china chictr2000029870 crispr-cas system applied as a diagnostic tool is characterized by fast speed highly specificity and sensitivity hou et al have developed a rapid diagnostic assay based on crispr-cas13a with a near single-copy sensitivity for sars-cov-2 detection 71 zhang et al have published a detailed protocol using the crispr-based sherlock system for detection of covid-19 without pcr amplification the results can be read out in less than an hour httpswwwbroadinstituteorgfilespublicationsspecialcovid1920detection20updated pdflamb et al have developed a rapid diagnostic test for covid-19 virus using revers transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp that can be applied to rapidly detect the virus in serum urine saliva oropharyngeal swabs and nasopharyngeal swabs in 30 minutes 72 yu et al have established an isothermal lamp based system coupled with a ph indicator allowing the colorimetric detection for covid-19 coronavirus ilaco this ilaco is rather sensitive that can detect as low as 10 copies of the targeted orf1ab gene in 15-40 minutes compared to rt-pcr these two approaches are more rapid accurate and can be conducted with limited facilities 73remdesivir as a nucleotide analogue inhibiting rna-dependent rna polymerase has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activities against rna viruses including sars-cov mers-cov and ebola virus 4074 xiaos group firstly found that remdesivir and chloroquine are potently effective against sars-cov-2 infection with rather low ec50 value and high selective index in vitro 75 notably intravenously administration of remdesivir after development of pneumonia remarkably improved clinical condition reported in the first case of novel coronavirus infection in the united states 76 though this could not be definitely ascribed to the effect of the drug currently clinical trials are ongoing evaluating the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild moderate nct04252664 and severe nct04257656 covid-19 up to now several results of clinical trials on the efficacy of remdesivir for covid-19 have published beigel et al have reported a multicenter trial enrolling 1063 patients that conducted in 60 sites and 13 subsites globally 77 in the remdesivir treated group the time to recovery was significantly shorter compared to the placebo nct04280705 gilead sciences company reported the improved clinical outcomes of the patients with severe covid-19 treated with remdesivir in a compassionate-use program no new safety signal was observed during the therapy 78 in contrast in a multicenter trial conducted at ten hospitals in hubei china use of remdesivir in severe covid-19 patients was not statistically significantly correlated to improve the time to clinical improvement mortality or time to eliminate virus 79 the opposite clinical outcomes resulting from various studies may mainly ascribe to different clinical parameters setting outcome measures and eligibility criteria for enrollment larger sample sizes and more rigorous clinical trial designs are required to further confirm the potency of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 infectionarbidol is licensed in russia and china mainly for treatment of influenza infection and other respiratory viral infections 80 it is both a direct-acting antiviral and host-targeting agent with broad-spectrum activity interacting with membrane and viral or cellular proteins exerting inhibition ability involved in viral entry viral fusion replication assembly budding and stimulation of host immune responses 81 in february 2020 li lanjuan a famous chinese epidemiologist claimed that arbidol and darunavir in preliminary tests could inhibit the replication of new coronavirus in vitro she proposed using arbidol and darunavir for treating pneumonia patients suffering from sars-cov-2 infection prominently novel coronavirus infected patients in wuhan and shanghai receiving arbidol showed significant signs of improvement in pneumonia 5382 phase iv clinical trials involving arbidolarbidol hydrochloride alone or in combination with interferon atomization oseltamivir or lopinavirritonavir for treatment of sars-cov-2 viral pneumonia are under investigation nct04255017 nct04260594 nct04254874lopinavirritonavir is a fixed dose combination medication approved by fda acting as a potent protease inhibitor for hiv-1 infection 83 lopinavirritonavir are potential candidates for sars-cov and mers-cov infection 8485 molecular dynamics simulations studies have showed that lopinavirritonavir could bind to the active site of sars-cov 3clpro 86 an open clinical trial conducted in hong kong during the sars-cov outbreak in 2003 revealed that patients treated with lopinavirritonavir had a lower viral load and were associated with better clinical outcomes and fewer adverse effect 84 lopinavirritonavir combined with recombinant interferon beta-1b is also being investigated for treatment of mers-cov infection nct02845843 87 since the protein sequence of main protease of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are closely related with 96 identity it is possible that lopinavirritonavir can be applied to novel coronavirus infection however a clinical trial conducted in hospitalized adult patients with severe covid-19 in china showed no benefit with lopinavirritonavir treatment over standard care chictr2000029308 88 whether combination of lopinavirritonavir with other antivirals would have improvement of clinical outcomes remains to be further determinedchloroquine a fda-approved drug for anti-malarial and autoimmune disease 89 is also known as a potent antiviral of sars-cov infection in vitro for interrupting the glycosylation of cell surface receptor ace2 90 chloroquine also showed inhibitory effect on the replication of mers-cov in vitro 91 recently chloroquine were tested against sars-cov-2 with ec90 at low micromolar concentration and may restrict the viral entry and post entry processes in vitro 75 chloroquine is an immunomodulation agent that may enhance its antiviral activity as well in light of the safety and potent efficacy clinical study testing chloroquine against pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 is being conducting nct04261517 preliminary results from the multicenter clinical trials conducted in china have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate effectively inhibited the progression of pneumonia eliminated the virus and shortened the duration of diseases without any severe adverse effects 9293 however data of an open label randomized controlled trial conducted in china chictr2000029868 enrolling patients with mild to moderate covid-19 and two observational studies involving a large number of consecutive hospitalized patients with covid-19 in new york city did not support the use of hydroxychloroquine because it was not associated with either a significantly higher or lower risk of intubation or death or lower in-hospital mortality 94 95 96 in the absence of evidence of therapeutic effects we particularly need to understand whether the drugs safety risks are worth takingace2 an important regulatory component in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas not only mediates virus infection but also directly participates in the progression of acute lung injury that highly correlated with the high mortality 97 sars-cov-2 infection has been shown to significantly reduce the expression of ace2 in lung resulting in aggravated acute lung injury conversely overexpression of ace2 in the knockdown mice model of acute respiratory distress syndrome offered some protection suggesting the potential therapeutic effect of rhace2 in sars-cov-2 infection 98 on the one hand elevated expression of ace2 may increase the risk of viral infection on the other hand higher expression of ace2 may have a protective effect against acute lung injury so far the exact role of ace2 expression remains unknown and the impacts on susceptibility of sars-cov-2 and prognosis of patients need more basic and clinical studies for further confirmation nct04287686except for ace2 as a receptor of host cells for sars-cov-2 attachment and entry it is reported that cd147 which expresses in many human cell types including epithelial cells endothelial cells and leukocytes also facilities the invasion of sars-cov-2 via binding to spike protein 99 blocking the interaction between spike protein of sars-cov-2 and cd147 via anti-cd147 humanized antibody was proved to be able to inhibit the replication of sars-cov-2 in vitro offering a novel target for antiviral therapy nct04275245 100methylprednisolone is a corticosteroids medication for inhibiting the immunity and reducing inflammation 101 new coronavirus infected patients are complicated by acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome which are partly caused by host overactive immune responses 102 corticosteroids can decrease inflammation of the lungs but also suppress the immune response and increase viral replication treatments of sars and mers-cov infected patients with corticosteroids showed that inflammation persisted after clearance of virus no sufficient evidence supported that sars-cov-2 infected patients would benefit from corticosteroids and contrarily they may suffer from this therapy 103104 two trials are recruiting critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory failure caused by novel coronavirus infection to test the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone nct04263402 nct04244591 however corticosteroids should be used with caution for treating novel coronavirus while considering the possible benefits the risk of complications including psychosis diabetes avascular necrosis must be balanced againstimmunoglobulin therapy is to use a mixture of normal human immunoglobulins for improving the immunity which is especially effective for acute infections this passive immunity through immunoglobulin injection can be acquired immediately but the duration is short 105 intravenous immunoglobulin suggested for treating severe and critically ill covid-19 patients was proved to improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis 82 whereas sars-cov-2 is a novel virus and almost no antibodies are present in the healthy populations intravenous immunoglobulin acting as a non-specific immune enhancer on mild or common patients may only have limited efficacyafter virus infects the body many different antibodies against viral proteins can be produced in the body but most antibodies do not actually have an antiviral effect except for those that recognize proteins on the surface of the virus particles 106 during the outbreak of sars-cov infected patients treated with convalescent plasma carrying sars-cov-specific antibodies from cured patients have been suggested to yield clinical benefits with reduced viral load and lower mortality rate 107 the underlying mechanism for the protective effect of convalescent plasma seems to be that the neutralizing antibodies produced in previously infected patients can directly bind to the spike protein on the virus particles to prevent them from entering the cells 108 in addition to the neutralizing antibodies other surface antibodies can bind to the virus and mediate the phagocytosis of the virus by macrophages and further hydrolyze the viral nucleic acids and proteins however virus can also evolve a set of strategies to escape the degradation through macrophages and replicate to form new ones worse still the viral replication in macrophages may promote the release of excess pro-inflammatory factors leading to cytokine storms which is the major cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure 109at present several clinical trials are ongoing testing the efficacy and safety of the anti-sars-cov-2 inactivated convalescent plasma eg nct04292340 and the immunoglobulin from patients who recovered from sars-cov-2 pneumonia nct04264858 on the treatment of patients with acute severe sars-cov-2 pneumonia though the use of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin may be a new strategy especially effective for the treatment of sars-cov-2 pneumonia the potential risks of promotion of cytokine storms and transfusion-transmitted infection should be taken seriouslyvirus attacking the respiratory system and immune system causes the damage of immunological function with lymphocytopenia decreased cd8 and cd4 t cell count that associated with severe sars-cov-2 pneumonia 145154103 the host fights against the viral infection through virus-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes reversion of t cell exhaustion is helpful to promote the antiviral immunity pd-1 blocking antibody is one of the anticancer drugs that prevents the interaction between pd-l1 on the tumor cells and pd-1 on the t cells blocking the interaction of these cell surface proteins can modulate the immunological tolerance of tumors thus preventing the cancer cells from evading the surveillance of immune system 110 diao et al reported that the expression levels of t cell exhaustion marker pd-1 from covid-19 patients were much higher as compared to healthy controls 111 therefore blocking pd-1 to prevent t cell exhaustion resulting in activation of antiviral immune responses may be a novel therapeutic strategy for covid-19 however before applying the pd-1 blocking antibody for treatment of lymphocytopenia induced by sars-cov-2 infection nct04268537 the correlation between pd-1 and t cell function should be measured to predict the response rate and the adverse effects such as cytokine-release syndromes and pneumonitispatients infected with sars-cov-2 admitted to the intensive care unit had cytokine storms with increased secretion of il2 il7 il10 gscf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf associated with severe illness including acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure 102 mesenchymal stem cells mscs can be an immunomodulatory agent inhibiting the secretion of cytokines suppressing the overactive immune responses and decreasing the inflammation mscs are safe and seldom induce rejection reactions to human body due to the inherently poor immunogenicity properties 112 regenerative potential of mscs is helpful to repair the alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells leading to reduction of lung damage113 owing to the immunoregulation anti-inflammation damaged tissue repair and regeneration properties mscs-based treatments have been applied to a variety of refractory diseases and are expected to have a critical role in novel coronavirus-induced severe pneumonia nct04293692 nct04288102 nct04252118 nct04273646 nct04269525mscs-derived exosomes contain abundant biologically active substances such as signaling lipids growth factors cytokines and rna recent studies have revealed that exosomes are also important mediators for cell-cell communication via paracrine or endocrine manner 114 mscs-derived exosomes have similar biological functions as mesenchymal stem cells for example repairing and regeneration of tissues suppression of inflammatory response and regulation of immunity115 mscs-derived exosomes have been applied to the treatment of various lung diseases including pulmonary fibrosis pulmonary arterial hypertension lung cancer bronchopulmonary dysplasia and acute respiratory distress syndrome 116 studies have demonstrated that mscs-derived exosomes could significantly reduce lung pathologic damage and increase the survival rate of mice with pulmonary fibrosis 117 compared to mscs-based therapy its derived exosomes as cell-free therapy is much safer and easier to pass through the physical barriers due to their nano size 118 suggesting a broad application prospect in a variety of diseases especially the pulmonary diseases nct04276987tcms have a long history of medical use and are frequently used for the prevention and treatment of infection diseases in china based on tcm therapy concept of multiple compounds-multiple targets-multiple effects a tcm prescription often contains multiple herbs working together to battle a disease within these mixture components some work directly on the viral targets involving the life cycle including attachment entry transcription of viral mrna replication of viral genome translation of viral protein and the assembly maturation and release of progeny virus particles119 to infect the host efficiently viruses have evolved a series of strategies to escape the hosts innate and adaptive immune responses against viral infection on the other hand to fight against the virus the host may release excessive or uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokines that correlated to tissue damage or organ failure 102 except working as direct-acting antivirals most of the molecules in tcm are immunomodulators that could block the viral immune evasion or enhance the host antiviral immune responses while the others may contribute to reducing the toxicity or enhancing the bioavailability 119 despite not often being recognized as a real medicine tcms actually have exhibited excellent anti-sars-cov-2 efficacy during the outbreak of covid-19 as evidenced by the high recovery rate and low mortality rate of confirmed cases taking tcm in china 82120 xiyanping is a licensed tcm injection in china used in the treatment of bronchitis tonsillitis bacterial dysentery it mainly contains active compounds extracted from andrographis paniculata chuan xin lian 121 in the 7th edition of the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for the covid-19 issued by chinese health authorities xiyanping injection is recommended for treating severe and critically ill patients with bacterial co-infection attributed to its antiviral anti-inflammatory antibacterial and immune regulation activities in addition to the significant antiviral efficacy what calls for special attention is that the indication dosage and solvents of tcm injection should be used rationally to reduce the occurrence of side effects 122strategies to develop vaccine for covid-19 are mainly focused on the spike protein of sars-cov-2 which is crucial for virus entry zhu et al have reported a first-in-human clinical trial of a replication defective adenovirus type-5 ad-5 vectored covid-19 vaccine expressing the full-length spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 nct04313127 this vaccine was showed to be tolerated and the adverse reactions were transient and self-limiting vaccination could induce humoral and t-cell responses rapidly but partly diminished in some participants by reason of pre-existing anti-ad5 immunity 123 mckay et al have developed a self-amplifying rna encoding pre-fusion stabilized spike protein of sars-cov-2 encapsulated within a lipid nanoparticle as a vaccine immunizations of self-amplifying rna lipid nanoparticle have been shown to induce large amount of sars-cov-2 specific lgg antibodies robust cellular responses and secretion of pluripotent cytokines in mice vaccination was also found to be capable of potently neutralizing a pseudotyped hiv virus expressing the spike protein unlike messenger rna based vaccine nct04283461 self-amplifying rna is able to encode any antigen of interest and only requires a minimum dose more importantly not as plasmid dna requiring electroporation this lipid nanoparticle-formulated vaccine is more convenient to use because it can be injected directly with a syringe and needle 124 smith et al have reported the preclinical development of a synthetic dna-based covid-19 vaccine encoding sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein and an n-terminal ige leader for enhancing the expression and immunogenicity immunization of mice and guinea pigs could promote durable production of functional antibodies that strongly neutralize the pseudovirus and live virus and block the ace2 binding to spike protein of sars-cov-2 specific antibodies of anti-sars-cov-2 were found to mainly distribute in the lungs after immunization sars-cov-2 s protein-specific t cell responses were also stimulated in immunized mice 125except for targeting s protein sars-cov-2 inactivated vaccine nct04383574 nct04352608 nct04412538 and sars-cov-2 rna vaccine nct04368728 are also being investigated in the clinical trials whats more repurposing other vaccines such as bcg vaccine nct04384549 nct04348370 and mmr vaccine nct04357028 may be a potential alternative strategy for treating covid-19 for the outbreak that likely to stage a come back in the future clinical trials of sars-cov-2 vaccines have been launched in many countries around the world but it still takes time until the safe and effective vaccine against covid-19 is availableace2 not only expresses in the lung tissue but also distributes in the intestinal epithelium 126 apart from invading the hosts lung tissues sars-cov-2 also interferes with the absorption of nutrients in the human body by binding to ace2 of the intestinal epithelium causing gastrointestinal discomfort 14 the intestinal flora can regulate various lung diseases through the intestinal-lung axis with immunomodulatory effect including viral pneumonia asthma tuberculosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease maintaining the normal communication of intestinal-pulmonary axis is helpful to alleviate lung disease 127128 intestinal malnutrition often occurs in patients with covid-19 and sometimes develops to secondary bacterial infections and antibiotic-related diarrhea suggesting the crucial connection between intestinal tract and respiratory tract washed microbiota transplantation as a rescue therapy for critically ill patients with diarrhea may have important clinical benefits nct04251767vitamin c a kind of antioxidant is essential for tissue repair and immune system function 129 vitamin c can prevent oxidative damage induced by virus infection and improve the immunity of patients with pneumonia it has been reported that enterovirusrhinovirus infection can cause devastating acute lung injury high dose of intravenous vitamin c could attenuate the acute respiratory distress syndrome and relieve lung damage produced by enterovirusrhinovirus infection down-regulation of reactive oxygen nitrogen species and pro-inflammatory genes by vitamin c may contribute to these curative effect 130131 nevertheless the role of vitamin c as monotherapy in the recovered patients is still uncertain before vitamin c can be applied as a therapy the side effects of high dosage such as nausea indigestion abdominal cramps and diarrhea owing to the unabsorbed vitamin c in the intestine should be considered since the leading causes of death of sars-cov-2 infected patients are associated with acute respiratory distress and multiple organ failure further investigations and larger trials should be performed to uncover the underlying mechanism and evaluate the exact efficacy of vitamin cthe strong infectivity of sars-cov-2 highlights the need of early intervention with effective treatment although abundant clinical trials are registered and underway since the outbreak of covid-19 the exact pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 has not been elucidated clearly yet along with no approved drug or vaccine for either sars-cov or mers-cov as a reference raising a significant challenge for specific and effective anti-sars-cov-2 drug development1 sars-cov-2 infections currently have spread to more than 200 countries across 6 continents and is posing a profound threat to the global public health and economy proper managements to decrease the prevalence rate of covid-19 patients have become more urgent with the expanding geographic distribution unfortunately control measures available to prevent sars-cov-2 infection are very limited owing to the strong infectivity of the virus and the pattern of person-to-person transmission2 currently there is no vaccine or specific antivirals available for covid-19 though mountains of novel findings on covid-19 are accumulating it is clear that there are still fundamental gaps in our knowledge a better understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of covid-19 will help us to develop effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of the disease there is still a long way to go to curb and combat this novel coronavirusnoneon december 31 2019 chinese authorities in wuhan announced a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology most of which included patients who reported exposure to wuhans huanan seafood wholesale market emergence of another pathogenic zoonotic hcov was suspected and on january 9 2020 the chinese center for diseases control reported that a novel coronavirus was the causative agent shortly thereafter the genomic sequences of several isolates became publicly available on february 10 2020 the who named the disease caused by the new coronavirus covid-19 and the new virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 genomic analyses indicated that sars-cov-2 shares genomic similarities with sars-cov within the receptor-binding motif that directly contacts the human receptor ace2 this has important implications for vaccine design and for predicting pandemic potential human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 has now been established and the situation with sars-cov-2 is evolving rapidly with the numbers of verified cases growing into the thousands accordingly the world health organization who has declared covid-19 a global pandemicanother recently emerged coronavirus the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov was first isolated in 2012 in saudi arabia 1 as of january 31st 2020 the world health organization who has been notified of 2513 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with mers-cov that include 864 related deaths with a fatality rate of 344 2 cases have arisen in 27 countries globally including a severe outbreak in the republic of korea in 2015 34 mers-cov is still endemic in the middle east most particularly in saudi arabia where more than 80 of cases have occurred no efficacious drugs or vaccines are currently approved for human use 25 the who included mers-cov on the list of priority blueprint diseases for which there is an urgent need for accelerated research and development of a safe and efficacious vaccine 56for both these coronaviruses the spike s protein is crucial for viral transmission and infection and determines the tropism of the virus and host cell entry sars-cov-2 binds the ace2 receptor as mers-s binds to the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 via the receptor-binding domain rbd in the n-terminal surface subunit s1 and then employs its c-terminal transmembrane subunit s2 to fuse with the host cell membrane 7 8 9 10 11 due to this vital functional property and established antigenicity the s protein is an important target for vaccine development our previous studies have shown that adenoviral vaccine candidates expressing sars-cov-s1 and mers-s1 subunits induced more efficacious antibody-mediated neutralizing activity than full-length s1 suggesting the subunit immunogen as an ideal vaccine candidate 12 the native s proteins exist as a trimeric form on the surface of the virus however when its ectodomain or s1 is expressed as a recombinant protein in eukaryotic systems the protein exists predominantly in a monomeric form 1314 here to make trimeric recombinant codon optimized subunit proteins mimicking the native viral structures we have fused the mers-cov-s1 and sars-cov-2-s1 segments to a 27-amino acid sequence called the foldon domain which is a natural trimerization domain derived from the c terminus of bacteriophage t4 fibritin 1516 inclusion of a foldon trimerization domain promotes a trimeric structure and has been shown to increase the immunogenicity of several viral antigens including influenza virus hemagglutinin hiv-1 glycoprotein and sars-cov s1s-ectodomain supporting the importance of mimicking native viral trimeric structures 141718 further recent work has shown that a recombinant trimeric receptor-binding domain rbd of mers-cov made by fusing rbd with foldon domain rbd-fd elicits potent rbd-specific neutralizing antibodies and protects hdpp4 transgenic mice from viral infection 19 to potentially improve the immunogenicity of these vaccines we also constructed s1 subunits with integrated toll-like receptor tlr agonist sequences specifically rs09 and flagellin c rs09 is a synthetic form of an lps mimic 7-mer peptide which binds to tlr4 and induces nuclear localization of the transcription factor nf-b resulting in transcription of inflammatory cytokines and secretion of chemokines 20 flagellin is a highly conserved natural bacterial ligand that binds to tlr5 to activate tlr5 expressing dendritic cells neutrophils lung epithelial cells and pneumonocytes augmenting immunogenicity in several vaccine models 21 22 23the skin is an ideal target for immunization it contains a rich population of antigen presenting and immune accessory cells capable of inducing a proinflammatory microenvironment favoring the induction of potent and durable adaptive immunity 2425 of several emerging skin-targeted drug delivery methods dissolving mnas have emerged as a minimally-invasive intracutaneous approach 2628 mnas used here are developed from mechanically strong water-soluble polymers to physically breach the outermost layer of skin stratum corneum and then rapidly dissolve in the underlying viable epidermis and dermis to deliver cargos to skin microenvironments 2729importantly mna delivery results in high concentrations of vaccine components in the local skin microenvironment thereby contributing to a dose-sparing effect that could decrease the required vaccine doses for efficacious immunization and substantially reduce both cost and toxicity 2730 31 32 although the stability of each vaccine candidate in mnas needs to be validated at different temperatures for varying storage periods the available literature indicates that mna-embedded vaccines have the potential to remain stable for an extended period of time without expensive cold chain requirements 3334 further previous animal and clinical studies suggest that mnas could provide a safe and well-tolerated delivery platform for efficacious immunization strategies 35 36 37 38 39here we demonstrate the rapid development of mna sars-cov-2 s1 subunit vaccines and their promising immunogenicity in mice developed using our evolving experience with mers-cov vaccines and mnas first we evaluate the immunogenicity of trimeric form of mers-s1 subunit vaccines delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection or intracutaneously by mnas driven by the promising immunogenicity of mna-mers-s1 vaccines and the urgent need to respond to the recent coronavirus pandemic covid-19 we rapidly within 4 weeks of the identification of the sars-cov-2 s1 sequence designed and produced mna sars-cov-2 s1 vaccines and tested their immunogenicity in mice we describe the rapid development of mna embedded sars-cov-2-s1 subunit vaccines using clinically-applicable mna production methods by relying on our experience with clinical trials utilizing mna delivery clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct02192021 taken together our results support the development of mna delivered

described 12 mouse sera were obtained from the retro-orbital plexus every two weeks for six weeks and tested for their ability to neutralize mers-cov emc isolate briefly virus 200 pfu was premixed 11 with serial dilutions of sera from animal groups prior to inoculation onto vero cells and viral infection was monitored by the occurrence of a cytopathic effect at 72 h post-infection virus neutralization titers vnts were determined as the highest serum dilutions that showed full protection against the cytopathic effect of mers-covstatistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism san diego ca data were analyzed by one-way anova followed by tukeys post-hoc testing differences were considered significant if p  005to construct the recombinant trimeric mers-s1 proteins codon-optimized mers-s1 was fused to the t4 fibritin foldon trimerization domain two additional variants were engineered by integrating the tlr4 agonist peptide rs09 or salmonella typhimurium flagellin c flic fragment at the c-terminal of the foldon moreover all three antigens were designed with a 6-histidine tag and a tobacco etch virus tev protease cleavage sequence at the carboxy terminus to allow for metal chelating affinity purification and to facilitate downstream large-scale purification compatible with clinical manufacturing fig 1
a a shuttle vector padmers-s1f was generated and a replication-defective adenovirus 5 designated as ad5mers-s1f was produced by loxp homologous recombination to use as a positive control to determine whether mers-s1f mers-s1frs09 and mers-s1fflic would form trimeric structures the serum-free supernatants from a549 cells infected with each adenovirus were characterized by sds-page and western blot analysis three recombinant proteins designed with a 6-histidine tag at the carboxy-terminal ends were recognized by a monoclonal anti-6his antibody at the expected glycosylated monomer molecular weights of about 130 kda 135 kda and 200 kda under the denaturing reduced with -me conditions the higher molecular-weight bands dimers or trimers were evident under the denatured non-reduced without -me condition and were 2 or 3 times that of the reduced proteins monomer as expected fig 1b 4546 after being boiled in the sample buffer the proteins still migrated to the position of the trimer indicating the remarkable stability of these proteins these results demonstrate that recombinant mers-s1 formed a trimeric conformation in the presence of the fd trimerization motif in addition to delete the six-histidine tag the purified recombinant proteins were treated with actev protease life technology followed by affinity chromatography on a nickel chelating resin to remove the six-histidine tags and poly-histidine tagged protease from the cleavage reaction the cleaved native recombinant proteins were collected from the flow-through fraction and used as coating antigens followed by detection with mouse serum three purified recombinant proteins were detected using serum from mice immunized with ad5mers-s1 p005 one-way anova followed by tukeys post-hoc testing prepared in our laboratory previously 12 while no specific antibody binding activity was detected in the serum of pre-immunized nave mice or from control mice inoculated with ad5 fig 1c elisa data revealed that the three recombinant mers-s1 proteins had strong reactivity with mers-s1-specific antibodieswe next determined whether these recombinant subunit vaccines could elicit antigen-specific immune responses in vivo balbc mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 25 g of mers-s1f 25 g of mers-s1frs09 40 g of mers-s1fflic or 25 g of mers-s1f plus 20 g of the mpla adjuvant to deliver the same molar ratio of immunogen or pbs as a negative control on day 0 the experimental schedule is shown in fig 2
a two weeks after immunization we obtained sera and examined binding to membrane-bound mers-s by measuring the reactivity against 293 cells transfected with padmers-s or pad using flow cytometry as shown in fig 2b in the presence of mpla adjuvant rmers-s1f induced a strong membrane-bound mers-s-specific igg antibody response p005 one-way anova followed by tukeys post-hoc testing while no significant antibody response was detectable in the mouse sera of rmers-s1f rmers-s1frs09 and rmers-s1fflic when compared with pbs-immunized mouse sera on the other hand in the absence of the adjuvant sequence mna intracutaneous delivery of mers-s1f mers-s1frs09 or mers-s1fflic at the same molar ratio elicited potent igg antibody responses p005 one-way anova followed by tukeys post-hoc testing that were significantly stronger than those seen in sc immunized mice with mpla adjuvant p005 one-way anova followed by tukeys post-hoc testing indicating the potential of mnas as an effective recombinant coronavirus vaccine delivery platform fig 2b mice immunized with ad5mers-s1 as a positive control developed significantly higher levels of igg antibody against cell membrane-bound mers-s as compared to negligible igg levels in control mice inoculated with pbs antibodies were not detected bound to cells transfected with pad without the immunogen insert data not shown these data indicate that mers-s1f protein with mpla adjuvant and mna delivered rmers-s1f rmers-s1frs09 and rmers-s1fflic induced strong antibody response to membrane-bound mers-s two weeks after a single immunizationto investigate the immunogenicity of trimeric mers-s1f proteins at two and four weeks after a boosting immunization sera were obtained from all mice and screened for mers-s1 specific antibodies by elisa as shown in fig 3
a following sc vaccination only ad5mers-s1 elicited a mers-s1-specific igg antibody response p005 one-way anova followed by tukeys post-hoc testing at week 2 while no antibody response was detectable in the mouse sera of rmers-s1f rmers-s1frs09 and rmers-s1fflic vaccinated mice when compared with pbs-immunized mouse sera however 2 weeks after boosting antigen-specific igg was detected in the sera of all sc immunized mice although the antibody titers were generally low as an exception to this sc delivered mers-s1frs09 induced a relatively strong mers-s1-specific igg antibody response p005 one-way anova followed by tukeys post-hoc testing at weeks 4 and 6 importantly mice immunized with each of the vaccine variants by mna delivery demonstrated significantly higher levels of antigen-specific igg p 005 one-way anova followed by tukeys post-hoc testing as compared to mice immunized with pbs and there was with no significant differences between the mna vaccine variants fig 3bto further demonstrate the immunogenicity of mers-cov subunit vaccines mouse sera were also tested for their ability to neutralize mers-cov emc isolate as shown in fig 3c there were no detectable mers-cov-neutralizing antibodies in the sera of mice immunized sc with mers-s1f- mers-s1frs09- or mers-s1fflic at week 4 however at week 6 sera of animals immunized with rmers-s1frs09 rmers-s1fflic or rmers-s1f  mpla had significant and comparable levels of virus neutralizing activity with geometric mean neutralizing titers of 104 508 and 168 respectively these titers were 54 26 and 88 fold higher than that of sera from the mice immunized with mers-s1f only vnt mean 192 most importantly as shown in fig 3d at week 6 all groups of mna immunized mice developed significant levels of neutralizing antibodies p 005 one-way anova followed by tukeys post-hoc testing animals immunized with mna-rmers-s1frs09 mna-rmers-s1fflic and ad5mers-s1 had geometric mean neutralizing titers of 960 832 and 3328 respectively as expected no neutralizing activity was detected in the sera of mice immunized with pbs these results suggest that mna delivery of these candidate subunit vaccines generates strong antibody-mediated neutralizing activity that approaches that induced by live adenovector immunization and exceeds that observed by sc delivery even when a potent exogenous adjuvant is added to the sc vaccine the promising immunogenicity of mna mers-cov vaccines without chemical adjuvants makes them an ideal candidate for future clinical studiesto evaluate the persistence of mers-s1-specific immunity mouse sera was collected at weeks 23 and 55 after immunization and evaluated for the presence of mers-s1-specific igg by elisa all animal groups immunized sc with recombinant subunit vaccine demonstrated the same or more levels of mers-s1 igg specific antibodies at the later time points as those observed at week 6 surprisingly mice immunized sc with rmers-s1frs09 had significantly higher levels of igg p 005 one-way anova followed by tukeys post-hoc testing at week 23 compared with those observed at week 6 fig 4
a and this was sustained through 55 weeks importantly mna delivered vaccines demonstrated generally increasing statistically significant levels of mers-s1-specific antibody through the 23- and 55-week time points fig 4b no significant difference was observed in the mice immunized with pbs or ad5mers-s1 at any time point evaluated these results indicate that mna-delivered subunit vaccines induce potent and long-lasting mers-s1 specific antibody responses and mna delivery is a viable approach for the clinical development of subunit vaccines against emerging infectious diseases such as covid-19based on these mers-s1 vaccine results and the urgency of the public health threat by covid-19 we focused our efforts on the development of sars-cov-2-s1 and sars-cov-2-s1frs09 subunit vaccines shown in fig 5
a the size and trimerization product of the vaccine was confirmed by western blot fig 5b the aggregation in fig 5b could be attributed to the trimerization of the s1s segments ntd ctd1 and cdt2 domains or the ability of the histidine tag to oligomerize the tagged proteins 47 48 49 we used mnas to vaccinate mice with sars-cov-2-s1 and sars-cov-2-s1frs09 subunit vaccines sera was collected prior to immunization week 0 and at weeks 1 2 3 and 4 and evaluated for the presence of sars-cov-2-s1 specific antibodies by elisa as previously described as shown in fig 5c significantly high p 005 one-way anova followed by tukeys post-hoc testing sars-cov-2 igg responses were detected as early as week 2 for all subunit vaccines as compared to control groups the inclusion of the rs09 ligand in the trimer subunit resulted in a negligible effect on sars-cov-2 specific igg titers further in our preliminary study the immunogenicity of gamma irradiation sterilized mna vaccines was comparable to that of unirradiated mna vaccines data not shown thereby supporting the feasibility of gamma irradiation as a terminal sterilization approach for our clinical mna-sars-cov-2 subunit vaccinesrelying on our experience with mers-cov and sars-cov vaccines and our experience with clinical production and human applications of mnas we developed standard operating procedures sops for the rapid development of clinic grade mna sars-cov-2 subunit vaccines our production strategy and the related timeline is outlined in table 1
 first we designed optimized and cloned the s1 subunits beginning when the sequence became publicly available subsequently we produced s1 subunit proteins purified them and then fabricated dissolvable mnas integrating the protein subunits for pre-clinical testing in the animal model next we vaccinated mice with mna-rsars-cov-2 vaccines and began analysis of antibody responses induced in immunized animals these preclinical studies were initiated within 4 weeks of the sars-cov-2 spike sequence becoming publicly available in parallel to enable future regulatory approval and rapid clinical testing we employed good manufacturing processes gmp using a certified master cell bank mcb to scale s1 subunit protein production purification and validation and incorporated the subunits into dissolvable mnas or syringes using processes developed through our clinical production and quality control of mnas clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct02192021 this was followed by 1 gamma irradiation to assure sterilization of the vaccine loaded mnas and syringes that will be used as control groups in our clinical trials and 2 analysis of established release criteria the latter of which is now ongoing and will be used for an application for ind approval that will enable a safety focused phase i clinical trialhere we present the rapid design and translational development of mna sars-cov-2 vaccines capable of generating potent antigen-specific antibody responses by capitalizing on our substantial experience with coronavirus vaccines and mna delivery platformsfirst we describe the design and production of trimeric recombinant subunit vaccines against mers-cov-s1 with and without integrated immunostimulatory tlr ligand sequences we tested the immunogenicity of these vaccine variants delivered either by traditional subcutaneous needle injection or using mnas to more specifically target vaccine components to the immune fertile skin microenvironment we found that mna delivery of mers-cov-s1 vaccines induced stronger humoral responses than traditional needle injections regardless of the inclusion of tlr ligand binding sequences fig 3ab on the other hand integration of the rs09 tlr4 binding sequence in the subunit trimer resulted in relatively stronger antibody responses than those without rs09 when vaccines were delivered by subcutaneous injection fig 3a interestingly the inclusion of the flagellin tlr5 binding sequence had no effect on the immunogenicity of the sc delivered vaccines fig 3b importantly significant neutralizing activity was observed in vaccinated animals at week 6 consistent with previous igg results the presence of rs09 in the subunit trimer improved the neutralization function of antibodies from sc immunized mice and this was the only immunogen that resulted in significant neutralization notably mna delivery was more effective in eliciting neutralizing antibodies for all vaccines all mna vaccines generated higher levels of neutralizing antibody even beyond those induced by an sc delivered mpla adjuvanted vaccine and similar to those seen following the delivery of the rmers-s1f construct via recombinant adenoviral vector though levels of neutralizing antibody were elevated in mice immunized with trimers including either rs09 or flagellin these increases were not statistically significant when compared to the mna vaccine alone fig 3cd thus though the contributions of the integrated tlr ligands to the strong immune responses induced by mna vaccines appear to be minimal they provide promising benefit for sc vaccine administration and their potential for contribution to immunogenicity in humans has yet to be determined importantly we and others have shown effective protection against mers-cov challenge in hdpp4-expressing mice at comparable or lower neutralizing titers in previous passive immunotherapy studies with mers-cov-specific antibodies or neutralizing sera obtained from mers-cov immune humans or animals 50 51 52 53 furthermore we have previously demonstrated that antibodies directed against s1 domain of the spike protein as detected in our study by elisa exert neutralizing activity against live coronaviruses 54based on our results with mers-cov-s1 vaccines we focused our efforts to develop mna sars-cov-2 vaccines using the described approach within three weeks of publication of the sars-cov-2- spike glycoprotein sequence we produced both rsars-cov-s1 and rsars-cov-s1frs09 immunogens and fabricated dissolvable mnas incorporating these vaccines in quantities sufficient for pre-clinical testing mna delivery of either rsars-cov-2-s1 or rsars-cov-2-s1frs09 induced substantial and statistically significant increases in antigen-specific antibodies responses as soon as week 2 compared to pre-immunization and week 1 responses the inclusion of rs09 did not have a significant effect on antibody titer at the 2 3 or 4-week time points furthermore the immunogenicity of mna vaccines was maintained after gamma irradiation sterilization suggesting a viable method to assure sterility of our mna vaccines for clinical applications the significant antibody titers we observed at the early time points before boosting strongly supports the feasibility of our mna-sars-cov-2 vaccines particularly in the context of similar results obtained with the analogous mers-cov-s1 constructs under the same conditionsneutralization assays are important to ensure antibody function however at this early timepoint we do not have access to validated assays for neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 further at the time of submission of this manuscript we are just over four weeks post-immunization and based on our mers-cov studies the reliable detection of neutralizing sars-cov-2 antibodies may require at least six weeks post immunization we speculate that this delay in the neutralizing response is likely a result of the time needed for affinity maturation of the sars-cov-2 neutralizing igg antibodies however we believe that mna-sars-cov-2 vaccines will very likely induce neutralizing immunity as suggested by the vigorous early antibody responses and commonalities between both the vaccines and the viruses accordingly even though it is still early to predict whether humans immunized with these vaccine candidates will have similar responses and be protected from sars-cov-2 or mers-cov infections our studies demonstrate that development production and initial animal testing of clinically translatable mna vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2 and other emerging infections can be rapidly accomplished studies directly assessing important correlates of human efficacy would provide additional support for efficacy in humans in this regard it will be important to determine whether antibodies from mna-sars-cov-2 immunized animals will neutralize virus infectivity further the demonstration of protection from infection in animal challenge models such as the hace2 transgenic mouse model would be informative we plan to do these studies when these models are developed and validated finally we note that the immunogenicity differences between mna coronavirus vaccines and coronavirus vaccines delivered by traditional needle injection that we observe will need to be evaluated in clinical trials to establish the clinical advantages of mna deliverymicroneedle array mediated immunization has several mechanistic differences from traditional intramuscular or subcutaneous needle injections which could explain the variations in the magnitude and kinetics of the ensuing responses 55 56 57 58 59 the skin is immunologically reactive and contains a high density of antigen presenting and immune-accessory cells with innate immune function including keratinocytes mast cells and innate lymphocytes 2560 61 62 redundant skin immunoregulatory circuits can respond to a wide variety of damage or infection related signals to rapidly orchestrate an innate immune response 62 63 64 further mnas deliver vaccine components to a defined 3d space within the skin microenvironment which results in very high vaccine concentrations with relatively low dose antigen delivery mna delivery of antigens to targeted skin microenvironments results in prolonged exposure of skin resident antigen presenting cells and other innate immune cells to the skin delivered components 65 moreover transient mechanical stress from microneedle insertion can induce a natural local innate immune response which can serve as a physical adjuvant to enhance antigen-specific adaptive immunity 57 mna delivery of lower doses to a localized 3d space improves safety by reducing systemic exposure 27 further mna delivery has the potential to accelerate the process of vaccine production and to significantly reduce cost by considerably reducing the required vaccine doses 58 the stability studies with our mna sars-cov-2 vaccines are currently in progress however there is evidence in the literature that vaccine components including proteins are typically stabilized by integration into the mna polymer matrix and retain their conformational structures as evidenced by maintenance of antibody binding function 2966 or retained immunogenicity of recombinant adenovirus vaccines for at least a month at 25 c 67 thus mna vaccines offer the potential to eliminate the substantial costs associated with the cold chain necessary for current vaccines 3468 finally the mnas described here are designed to be applied without the need for an applicator or any specialized equipment supporting the potential for self-administration as such these features provide several important advantages that support the future development of mna vaccines for global protection from rapidly emerging infectious diseasestaken together our studies demonstrate the speed at which vaccines against emerging infections can be designed and produced using the recent advances in recombinant dna technology combining emerging biotechnology methods with bioengineering advances in vaccine delivery strategies it may now be possible to rapidly produce clinically-translatable vaccines against novel pathogens for human testing and subsequent global distribution in time to significantly impact the spread of diseasecovid19 caused by the sars-2 coronavirus sars cov2 has emerged as the third major lower respiratory tract coronavirus infection in the 21st century after severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers the hallmark of each of these infections is a viral pneumonia accompanied by host inflammation leading to pulmonary edema and a syndrome that resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 1 new information has highlighted a critical role for host th17 inflammatory responses in the pathogenesis of covid19 pneumonia and edema 2 this includes the release of key cytokines including il-17 and gm-csf 2 and other elements of exacerbating viral immnopathogenesis through downregulating treg cells promoting neutrophil migration but simultaneously inducing th2 responses 2 3 importantly il-17 can also induce pulmonary eosinophilic responses and allergic disease in part by promoting eosinophil production from the bone marrow and recruitment and extravasation into the lungs 4 5 6th17 cells differentiate in part through the actions of il-6 7 and il-6 has been shown to have an important role in the lung pathology associated with sars infection 8 there is additional evidence to suggest the sars n protein is a potent inducer of il-6 responses and may mediate coronavirus lung pathology 9although confirmatory studies have yet to be performed il-6 induced by the presence of coronaviruses in the lung appears to promote in susceptible hosts th17 responses that may lead to severe lung pathology that includes eosinophilia these findings potentially provide a rational basis for evaluating anti-il-6 monoclonal antibodies as new therapies for covid19 10 in addition il-8 production is also generated under th17-polarizing conditions 11beyond direct virus-induced pathology immune enhancement associated with eosinophilic infiltration and immunopathology is a potential safety concern linked to first-generation vaccines to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 12 a similar phenomenon may have derailed early efforts to develop an inactivated whole virus human vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus rsv13the mechanisms of immune enhancement from sars vaccinations are still not well understood in some cases they have been postulated as a component of antibody-dependent enhancement ade seen in several other human viral infections such as dengue fever 14 while others differentiate eosinophilic immunopathology from ade a key element of eosinophilic immunopathology is the appearance of inflammatory infiltrates comprised of mononuclear cells especially eosinophils in histopathologic sections of the lungs or livers of vaccinated experimental animals following live virus challenge the prominence of lung eosinophils has led some investigators to conclude that immune enhancement occurs through th2-type immunity 15 indeed an unpublished and unreferenced scientific consensus document from the cepi alliance cepinet has argued against the use of alum and other adjuvants that might promote th2 responseshowever some of the published literature argues against the primary role of th2 cells in directly promoting immune enhancement 16 for example alum actually diminishes immune enhancement in laboratory animals vaccinated against the sars coronavirus using either inactivated virus or virus-like particle vaccines 17 18 we have made a similar observation with a recombinant protein receptor binding domain vaccine 19moreover immune enhancement occurs primarily following the use of virus-vectored vaccines especially using vaccinia constructs expressing coronavirus antigens 20 21 22 23 24 in at least one study mice exhibiting immune enhancement following sars virus challenge were noted to upregulate their th1 cytokines and downregulate their anti-inflammatory cytokines such as il-10 despite exhibiting eosinophilic infiltrates 24 although another study concluded lack of adequate th1 induction was responsible 25aside from mixed th1 and th2 responses could th17 responses also explain coronavirus-vaccine immune enhancement fig 1
 while vaccinia and other vectored vaccines induce substantial immune enhancement in both the lungs and liver of experimental animals 20 21 22 23 24 which in some cases have been linked to viral expression of the n protein 15 none of these studies specifically examined th17 responses however it is notable that immune enhancement is linked to both il-6 and il-8 production 22 24 each a prominent cytokine associated with th17 as well as many other types of immune responsesas highlighted above the presence of eosinophilic immunopathology can be linked to th17 responses 4 5 6 while commonly thought of as the product of th2 responses numerous studies confirm that tissue eosinophilia can also fall under the control of th17 responses il-17 and th17 induction promote eosinophilic activation and infiltration 15 and eosinophil extravasation from the bone marrow into the lungs 4 moreover eosinophilia has been shown to be sustained by th17 cells 26 27despite these concerns notwithstanding the fact that covid-19 involves severe pulmonary dysfunction there remains the unknown contribution of cytokine storm enhanced th17 responses or pulmonary eosinophilia to end-stage mortality 28 indeed evidence increasingly suggests that severe morbidity and mortality as seen during covid-19 may have far more to do with heart dysfunction than pulmonary failure 29 30 severe heart failure could in fact be the main cause of respiratory and other organ system failure in severe life-threatening disease in this respect heart failure from myocarditis and cardiomyopathy has also been linked to il-17 producing t cells and il-17-promoting cytokines 31more research is needed into the underlying mechanisms of eosinophilic immunopathology associated with coronavirus vaccines and the relevance of this observation to clinical outcomes however the potential role of th17 responses has a number of implications in terms of the production and clinical development of covid-19 vaccines these include adjuvant selection and vaccine dose and route implicating th17 also can also inform on the selection of the safest vaccine strategy among the virus-vectored and nucleic acid-based platforms as well as recombinant protein subunit vaccines such decisions will be validated in the coming months as several vaccines for covid-19 enter the clinical pipeline and undergo extensive evaluation for both efficacy and safety in addition to the possibility of th17 and eosinophil-dependent immunopathology future covid-19 vaccine studies might focus on the cardioprotective effects of

that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cfr 96 al hajjar memish  mcintosh 2013 the virulence of these human infections is undeniably linked to immune evasion mechanisms viruses have learned how to manipulate host immune control mechanisms our knowledge of viral gene functions could lead to new antiviral strategies and the ability to exploit viral functions as tools in medicine alcami  koszinowski 2000 here we provide an overview of the different mechanisms that merscov use to evade host immune responsesthe immune system is canonically divided into two major branches innate and adaptive immunity the innate response elicited by an invading pathogen involves the rapid recognition of general molecular patterns by nonimmune cells or cells of the innate immune system such as monocytes or macrophages dendritic cells and natural killer cells nicholson 2016 hence the first barrier to overcome for successful viral infection is the rapid innate immune response of the host which are involved in several effector mechanisms including complement cascade type i interferons ifns inflammatory cytokine nk cell immunity apoptosis autophagy and tolllike receptors tlrs pathway when the innate immune system confronts a pathogen it becomes activated and prepares the adaptive arm of the immune system to respond appropriately takeuchi  akira 2009the adaptive immune system consists of two branches the humoral immune response arm production of antibodies by b cells and the cellular immune response arm activities carried out by cytotoxic cd4 and cd8 t cells both typically require antigen presentation in conjunction with major histocompatibility complex mhc and a costimulatory signal for full activation lee lee chaudhary gill  jung 2010 there are three possible outcomes of viral infection early clearance of the pathogen either directly or by phagocytosis overwhelming infection with failure to control persistent infection where a balance between the pathogen and the host is achieved simmons willberg  paul 2001viruses use diverse mechanisms to avoid and antagonize the immune response of their hosts these mechanisms include enable the virus to avoid recognition by the humoral immune response interfere with the functioning of the cellular immune response and interfere with immune effector functions vossen westerhout sderbergnauclr  wiertz 2002m proteins from merscov have three highly similar conserved nterminal transmembrane domains named tm1 tm2 and tm3 that localized predominantly to the golgi complex and is required for virion assembly and a cterminal region neuman et al 2011 y yang et al 2013 using chimeric and truncation mutants the nterminal transmembrane domains of the merscov m protein were found to be sufficient for its inhibitory effect on

niemeyer et al 2013 siu et al 2014 merscov 4a protein has a suppression effect on the pactinduced activation of rigi and mda5 however this doublestranded rnabinding protein has no effect on the activity of downstream effectors such as rigi mda5 mavs tbk1 and irf3 siu yeung et al 2014protein 4a is 109 aa long and contains an rnabinding domain comprising 72 aa the rnabinding domain of 4a binds dsrna and does not allow it to bind to the rnabinding domain of rigi thereby inhibiting the antiviral signaling pathway thus the virus blocks the innate immune response and continues infecting cells the two key residues involved in the binding of rna to the rnabinding domain in 4a are k63 and k67 siu yeung et al 2014orf4a is the most potent antagonist because can inhibit multiple levels of the

wildtype virus where the majority of dsrna has been accompanied by replication complexes figure 3 shows the merscov escape from the dsrna sensorsin infection of merscov t cells play critical roles in controlling the pathogenesis j zhao et al 2014 furthermore t cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells human lymphoid tissues and the spleen of common marmosets were highly susceptible to merscov merscov induces substantial apoptosis in the infected t cells that involve the activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic caspasedependent apoptosis pathways resulting in high pathogenicity of the virus chu et al 2015 zhou chu chan  yuen 2015merscov can directly infect and replicate productively in macrophages and dendritic cells which results in their malfunction and failure to present

al 1993 the induction of these chemokines may inevitably aggravate the lymphopenia in patients with mers zhou et al 2015the relationship between a virus and its host is a complicated affair a myriad of factors from the virus and host are involved in viral infection and consequential pathogenesis the pathogenesis of human merscov infection remains poorly understood multiple antagonistic mechanisms are developed by merscov to evade the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and to attenuate the host defense there is an urgent need for developing the most effective mers therapy more research findings on the pathogenesis and immune evasion mechanisms of merscov may help to improve the treatment and control of mers reliable vaccines have not yet been developed but antivirals inhibiting virus replication such as mycophenolic acid cyclosporine a ifn ifn or ribavirin are available the attenuated viruses generated might prove useful in vaccine development reverse genetics system is a tool to study the molecular biology of the virus understanding novel gene functions highthroughput screening of antiviral drugs and to develop attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates using this system a collection of merscov deletion mutants has been generated if deletion of genes that causing the virus to escape from the immune system presented growth kinetics similar to those of the wildtype virus indicating which is helpful to prevent merscov infectionthe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interestaround the end of 2002 an outbreak of a previously unknown severe acute respiratory syndrome sars started in south east china and hong kong accelerated by air travel the disease rapidly spread to several parts of the world and displayed pandemic potential sars-coronavirus sars-cov was identified as the causative agent of this zoonotic infection drosten et al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003 kuiken et al 2003 peiris et al 2003 which resulted in 8000 laboratory-confirmed cases and 774 associated deaths worldwide who 2004 although in terms of death toll not comparable to influenza hiv or hcv the 2003 sars-cov outbreak caused worldwide public concern and seriously affected the global economy estimated losses 30100 billion keogh-brown and smith 2008 sars-cov initially causes lower respiratory tract disease which can lead to a progressive and potentially lethal atypical pneumonia with clinical symptoms that include fever malaise lymphopenia and in some cases also diarrhea two years after the outbreak horseshoe bats were identified as the likely reservoir of the sars virus whereas civet cats probably have served as intermediate host during the zoonotic transfer to humans lau et al 2005 li et al 2005b adaptation to the human host required a small number of mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the sars-cov spike s protein which mediates cell binding and entry li et al 2005c see chap 2 there is increasing evidence that sars-like coronaviruses continue to circulate in bats and that these may have the potential to readily cross the species barrier and emerge as human pathogens ge et al 2013 menachery et al 2015 such zoonotic scenarios therefore remain a serious public health concernalmost a decade after the sars-cov outbreak the next zoonotic coronavirus emerged middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov de groot et al 2013 the virus was first isolated in june 2012 from a 60-year-old saudi arabian male who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multiple organ failure including renal failure zaki et al 2012 van boheemen et al 2012 also mers-cov can cause a lower respiratory tract infection with symptoms that include coughing and high fever by the end of 2016 more than 1850 laboratory-confirmed mers-cov cases had been recorded with a mortality rate of about 35 who 2016 mers-cov is assumed to be transmitted to humans from camels and serological studies in the latter animals revealed that they have harbored mers-cov or mers-cov-like viruses for decades muller et al 2014besides the zoonotic sars- and mers-covs the coronavirus family includes four established human coronaviruses hcovs of which hcov-oc43 and -229e have already been known since the 1960s these two viruses cause mild respiratory disease and after rhinoviruses are a leading cause of common colds 1030 of the cases van der hoek 2007 mcintosh et al 1967 hamre and procknow 1966 more recently following intensified screening for coronaviruses two additional hcovs were discovered hcov-nl63 van der hoek et al 2004 and hcov-hku1 woo et al 2005 interestingly recent findings suggest that also hcov-nl63 -229e and -oc43 originate from zoonotic transfer from bats huynh et al 2012 corman et al 2016 vijgen et al 2006 corman et al 2015 coronaviruses also cause a range of infectious diseases in animal species some with serious economical consequences for the livestock industry this is illustrated by the recent emergence of a novel variant of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus which is closely related to a strain that caused a large outbreak in china in 2010 killing almost one million piglets for a recent review see lin et al 2016the economic impact of coronavirus infections the past and likely future emergence of pathogenic zoonotic coronaviruses and the lack of effective antiviral strategies have made it painfully clear that our preparedness to treat or prevent coronavirus infections are very limited this highlights the importance of advancing our knowledge on the replication of these viruses and their interactions with the hostcoronaviruses are positive-stranded rna rna viruses with for this kind of viruses exceptionally large genomes of 30 kb they have a polycistronic genome organization and employ a unique transcription mechanism to generate a nested set of subgenomic sg mrnas these are used to express the open reading frames orfs located downstream of the replicase orfs 1a and 1b see fig 1a which encode structural and accessory proteins the sg mrnas are 3 co-terminal but they also contain a common 5 leader sequence the leader and body segments of the sg rnas are joined during discontinuous negative strand rna synthesis which produces a subgenome-length template for each of the sg mrnas sawicki and sawicki 1995 for a recent review see sola et al 2015
following entry and uncoating the coronavirus replicative cycle see fig 1a starts with the translation of the 5-proximal orfs of the viral genome orf1a and orf1b which results in the synthesis of two large replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab synthesis of pp1ab a c-terminally extended form of pp1a involves a -1 ribosomal frameshift rfs into orf1b occurring near the 3 end of orf1a this regulatory mechanism is thought to have evolved to downregulate expression levels of orf1b-encoded proteins compared to orf1a-encoded nonstructural proteins nsps brierley and dos ramos 2006 brierley et al 1989 ultimately 15 or 16 mature replicase proteins are released from pp1a and pp1ab due to proteolytic cleavages performed by two or three orf1a-encoded proteases nsp3 contains one or two papain-like protease domains pl1pro and pl2pro or plpro for sars-cov and infectious bronchitis virus that process the nsp1-4 part of the replicase polyproteins the remaining cleavage sites are processed by the viral main protease that resides in nsp5 a chymotrypsin-like enzyme also known as 3c-like protease snijder et al 2016 a schematic overview of the proteolytic processing and domain structure of the sars-cov replicase is presented in fig 1b the replicase proteins contain a variety of enzymatic activities and functions that are required for viral rna synthesis and capping perlman and netland 2009 snijder et al 2016 such as the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp nsp12 a helicase nsp13 rna cap-modifying methyltransferases nsp14 and nsp16 and an exoribonuclease nsp14 together with recruited host cell proteins the coronavirus nsps form membrane-associated replication and transcription complexes rtcs van hemert et al 2008 which localize to a network of virus-induced membrane structures in the perinuclear region of the infected cell knoops et al 2008 gosert et al 2002 van der meer et al 1999 brockway et al 2003 stertz et al 2007 ulasli et al 2010 many of the nsps appear to have multiple functions in the synthesis or processing of viral rna or in virushost interactions aiming to create an optimal environment for coronavirus replication for example by facilitating viral entry gene expression rna synthesis or virus release moreover to further enhance viral replication host gene expression and antiviral defenses are targeted in several ways coronavirushost interactions also play a decisive role in viral pathogenesis and the ultimate outcome of infectiondue to the exceptional size of their rna genome and proteome and the resulting complexity of the interactions with the host our knowledge of host factors involved in coronavirus replication is still in an early stage compared to what is known for some other rna virus groups in this review we will summarize our current understanding of coronavirushost interactions at the level of the infected cell with special attention for the assembly and function of the viral rna-synthesizing machinery and the evasion of cellular innate immune responsesentry into the target cell constitutes the first critical step in the coronavirus replication cycle the major determinant for this step is the efficient binding of the coronavirus s glycoprotein to a protein-receptor on the cell surface the coronavirus s protein is a type 1 glycoprotein that consists of s1 and s2 subunits and is present on the virion surface as a trimer li 2016 hulswit et al 2016 the s1 region is involved in receptor binding and contains n- and c-terminal domains s1-ntd and s1-ctd respectively walls et al 2016 that may both act as receptor-binding domain rbd with the major determinants of cell tropism residing in s1-ctd the elongated s2 regions form the stalk of the spike trimer and are mainly involved in triggering the fusion of the viral envelope and target cell membranes for recent reviews on coronavirus entry and spike protein organization see li 2016 hulswit et al 2016the s1-ntd is mainly involved in facilitating virus binding and entry by interacting with glycans on the host cell surface based on the crystal structure of the betacoronavirus s1-ntd and the sequence conservation among the s1-ntds of other coronaviruses all coronavirus s1-ntds are thought to share a galectin fold that mediates binding to sialic acids like n-glycolylneuraminic acid neu5gc n-acetylneuraminic acid neu5ac andor 5-n-acetyl-9-o-acetylneuraminic acid neu59ac2 see li 2016 and references herein an exception is the murine hepatitis virus mhv s1-ntd which binds the n-terminal d1 domain of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 ceacam1 a type-i membrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily walls et al 2016 williams et al 1991to mediate entry into host cells the s1-ctd of most known members of the alphacoronavirus genus interacts with aminopeptidase n apn for an overview and references see table 1 however the alphacoronavirus hcov-nl63 uses a different type-i membrane glycoprotein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 wu et al 2009 which contains a large n-terminal ectodomain composed of two alpha-helical lobes the same molecule ace2 has been identified as a receptor for the zoonotic betacoronavirus sars-cov li et al 2003 the betacoronaviruses mers-cov and bat coronavirus hku4 use yet another cellular peptidase for virus entry dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 yang et al 2014 raj et al 2013 the mers-cov s protein has a higher affinity for human dpp4 while the hku4 s protein binds more strongly to bat dpp4 yang et al 2014 chemical peptidase inhibitors do not affect virus entry indicating that sars-cov and mers-cov receptor usage and entry are independent of the receptors peptidase activity and merely depend on binding to these particular host receptors li et al 2005c raj et al 2013
besides the receptors discussed above also extracellular cell surface-associated andor lysosomal proteases play a role in coronavirus entry by activating the fusion activity of the s protein for a recent review see li 2016 for sars-cov fusion of the viral and cellular membrane is triggered upon cleavage of the s protein by the cell surface-associated transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 glowacka et al 2011 the same protease is important for cleavage and activation of the hcov-229e and mers-cov s protein shirato et al 2013 bertram et al 2013 after endocytosis the sars-cov s protein is cleaved by the lysosomal proteases cathepsin l and cathepsin p in early endosomes leading to fusion of the virus envelop with the endosome membranes and release of the viral rna into the cytosol of the infected cell huang et al 2006a b simmons et al 2005 mers-cov entry occurs by a similar mechanism shirato et al 2013 burkard et al 2014 although inhibition of the cellular protease furin abolished the entry of mers-cov but not sars-cov indicating that furin-mediated cleavage is pivotal for efficient mers-cov entry burkard et al 2014 follis et al 2006 on the other hand mhv strain a59 was shown to fuse with late endosomes and to depend on their low ph for s protein cleavage burkard et al 2014 therefore it has been proposed that coronavirus fusion with endosomes depends on the use of a furin cleavage site just upstream of the fusion peptide burkard et al 2014 however why some coronaviruses fuse with early endosomes and others with late endosomes and whether these events play a role in host tropism and pathogenicity is still not completely understood burkard et al 2014 the complexity of s protein cleavage is further highlighted by a recent paper by park et al which clearly showed that mers-cov entry depends on furin-mediated cleavage in virus-producing cells subsequently cleaved mers-cov s proteins could be processed by proteases on recipient cells and virions could enter the cells via early endosomes or even by fusing with the plasma membrane mers-cov virions that contain uncleaved s proteins may rather fuse with late endosomes park et al 2016the interaction of the coronavirus s glycoprotein with its cell surface receptor is a key determinant for host tropism in the case of sars-cov only a few mutations n479l and t487s in the s proteins rbd sufficed to dramatically increase the affinity for human ace2 li 2008 likewise the mers-cov s protein contains two mutations compared to the bat coronavirus hku4 s protein which can bind the human dpp4 receptor but cannot mediate viral entry due to lack of activation by human proteases the two mutations in the mers-cov s protein s746r and n762a enable cleavage by the human proteases and thus viral entry into human cells and may have contributed to the zoonotic transfer of mers-cov yang et al 2015several lineage a betacoronaviruses also carry a hemagglutinin-esterase he protein on their surface he proteins contain a lectin-binding domain that mediates binding to o-acetylated sialic acids while also possessing sialate-o-acetylesterase receptor-destroying enzyme activity targeting these same glycans on the cell surface the receptor-destroying enzyme activity is thought to prevent attachment to non-permissive cells while the he protein also facilitates entry into target cells after binding to the main entry receptor zeng et al 2008 langereis et al 2010 bakkers et al 2016all viruses depend on the host cells translation machinery for the production of their proteins and infectious progeny moreover protein synthesis is also pivotal for the host cells response to infection by mounting an antiviral innate immune response hence it is not surprising that many rna viruses modulate host protein synthesis in order to limit the translation of cellular mrnas and favor the synthesis of viral proteins reviewed in walsh and mohr 2011 fung et al 2016 in eukaryotic cells translation is initiated by formation of the heterotrimeric eif2 complex which is composed of the regulatory -subunit the trna-binding -subunit and a gtp-binding -subunit the eif2 complex is responsible for loading of the 40s subunit with met-trnai after mrna binding this 43s complex serves as a scaffold for the recruitment of several additional proteins including eif3 to the capped 5 end of the mrna subsequently the cap-binding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4f eif4f joins this pre-initiation complex 48s complex which then scans the mrna in the 5 to 3 direction to localize a translation initiation codon at this point the 60s ribosomal subunit joins and protein synthesis starts reviewed in jackson et al 2010 polyadenine-binding protein pabp which binds to the polya-tail of mrnas is also involved in stimulating protein synthesisthe eif2 complex can be inactivated by phosphorylation of its alpha subunit eif2 by one of four mammalian kinases in response to various external triggers these kinases are eif2 kinase 4 also known as gcn2 heme-regulated inhibitor hri pkr-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase perk which is activated upon induction of er stress and double-stranded ds rna-activated protein kinase pkrsince several stages of the coronavirus replication cycle are closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum er er stress is thought to occur during coronavirus infection indeed expression of several coronavirus proteins including the heavily glycosylated s protein was shown to induce er stress which was also observed in coronavirus-infected cells chan et al 2006 and reviewed in fung et al 2016 consequently the unfolded protein response upr is induced which alleviates the problems by inhibiting translation by perk-induced phosphorylation of eif2 stimulating protein folding and eventually triggering apoptosis compared to for example hepatitis c virus see review by chan 2014 many details of how coronaviruses control the upr remain unknown but they generally seem to manipulate perk activity to control the level of translation reviewed by fung et al 2016pkr is a serinethreonine protein kinase that is activated by the presence of dsrna a hallmark of rna virus infection pkr is a key player in the innate immune response to rna virus infection as it upregulates antiviral gene expression including the production of interferons ifns coronaviruses have evolved various strategies to counteract pkr-mediated signaling in order to prevent the translational shut-off due to eif2 phosphorylation for example infectious bronchitis virus ibv appears to weakly antagonize pkr by blocking its activation as well as inducing the expression of growth arrest and dna-damage-inducible 34 protein gadd34 leading to reduced eif2 phosphorylation in ibv-infected cells wang et al 2009 upon mhv infection sustained eif2 phosphorylation and repression of gadd34 expression leads to translational repression of cellular mrnas which may be beneficial for mhv infection bechill et al 2008 recently the mers-cov orf4a protein was shown to counteract the pkr-induced formation of stress granules probably by binding viral dsrna to shield it from detection by pkr thereby preventing translational inhibition rabouw et al 2016 also transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev has been reported to modulate host cell translation in this case through its protein 7 which promotes eif2 dephosphorylation through an interaction with protein phosphatase 1 pp1 a key regulator of the hosts antiviral response cruz et al 2011 the s proteins of both sars-cov and ibv were found to physically interact with eif3f to modulate host translation including the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin il 6 and 8 at a later stage of infection xiao et al 2008 therefore this interaction may play an important regulatory role in coronavirus pathogenesisbesides modulating eif2 phosphorylation coronaviruses have other ways of manipulating the translation machinery importantly the nsp1 proteins of both alpha- and betacoronaviruses were identified as inhibitors of multiple steps of translation initiation lokugamage et al 2012 2015 sars-cov nsp1 does so by inhibiting 48s initiation complex formation and interfering with its conversion into the 80s initiation complex lokugamage et al 2012 in addition the multifunctional sars-cov nsp1 is able to directly bind the 40s ribosomal subunit to inhibit its function in translation kamitani et al 2009 moreover this complex of nsp1 and the 40s subunit induces cleavage of cellular mrnas to suppress host cell translation to an even larger extent kamitani et al 2006 mers-cov nsp1 seems to act differently by selectively inhibiting the translation of mrnas produced in the nucleus while leaving the translation of the cytosolically made viral mrnas unaffected lokugamage et al 2015 the difference with sars-cov nsp1 is further highlighted by the observation that mers-cov nsp1 does not bind to the 40s ribosomal subunit lokugamage et al 2015taken together several coronavirus studies have highlighted how modulation of host protein synthesis through differentoften parallelmechanisms can have a profound effect on the cell in this manner viral translation modulators may contribute importantly to coronavirus pathogenicityas outlined in chap 1 a common characteristic of rna viruses is that their rna synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm and is associated with virus-induced structures derived from cellular endomembranes reviewed in romero-brey and bartenschlager 2016 reid et al 2015 van der hoeven et al 2016 this is an intriguing kind of virushost interaction and the architecture of these replication organelles has now been studied in detail for quite a number of viruses nevertheless their exact functions have remained largely obscure in general two types of rna virus-induced membrane structures have been recognized recently reviewed by van der hoeven et al 2016 the first type is characterized by single-membrane spherules invaginations with a negative curvature formed in the membranes of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum er peroxisomes or endosomes with the source of the membrane depending on the virus under study the viral replication machinery is located within these spherules and rna products are exported through a channel that connects the spherules interior and the cytosol so that they can engage in translation or particle assembly flaviviruses and alphaviruses are examples of virus families inducing the formation of this type of replication organelles reviewed in den boon and ahlquist 2010the second type of replication structures which includes those found in coronavirus-infected cells is dominated by double-membrane vesicles dmvs often accompanied by other structures such as tubules zippered er andor convoluted membranes together forming a reticulovesicular network in the cytosol knoops et al 2008 maier et al 2013 ulasli et al 2010 hagemeijer et al 2012 gosert et al 2002 fig 1c picornaviruses arteriviruses and flaviviruses like hepatitis c virus hcv induce similar structures reviewed in van der schaar et al 2016 van der hoeven et al 2016 paul et al 2014 respectively it is generally thought that viral nsps that have transmembrane regions or are otherwise anchored to membranes drive the formation of these structures in the case of coronaviruses nsp3 nsp4 and nsp6 have been implicated in this process angelini et al 2013 hagemeijer et al 2012in terms of host factors and pathways involved in the formation of coronavirus replication organelles a variety of hypotheses and data sets have been put forward much of this data is still under debate though making it quite difficult to formulate a consensus theory the involvement of er membranes seems to be generally accepted and is supported by the presence of ribosomes and er markers such as sec61 and protein disulphide isomerase pdi on the surface of or inside virus-induced double-membrane structures and the fact that the outer membrane of coronavirus-induced dmvs can be continuous with er cisternae hagemeijer et al 2014 knoops et al 2008 2010 snijder et al 2006 in accordance with this link to the er studies by de haan and co-workers oostra et al 2007 verheije et al 2008 suggested that the secretory pathway including coatomer protein cop-dependent processes and associated factors such as gbf-1 plays an important role in replication however no co-localization was observed between nsp4 a marker for the coronavirus-induced membrane structures and secretory pathway markers these observations are in agreement with the results of our own sirna screen for host factors influencing sars-cov replication which identified copb2 or -cop a subunit of the coatomer protein complex as a strong proviral or dependency factor de wilde et al 2015 depletion of copb1 and gbf1 which are part of this same machinery also severely affected sars-cov replication confirming that the integrity of the secretory pathway is important for replication de wilde et al 2015 knoops et al 2010 several reports have described the importance of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases pi4ks in rna virus replication which was first discovered through sirna screens searching for cellular factors important for picornavirus and hepatitis c virus replication reiss et al 2011 hsu et al 2010 berger et al 2009 these kinases seem to be recruited to the sites of membrane modification and stimulate the production of pi4p lipids which together supports the formation andor functionality of viral replication structures the underlying mechanism is not exactly clear yet and several hypotheses have been put forward reviewed in altan-bonnet and balla 2012 also for sars-cov replication one of the pi4k isoforms pi4kiiibeta was shown to be important yang et al 2012 although it seems to play a role in entry rather than later steps of the replication cycle however in our kinome-based sirna screen pi4ks were not identified as cellular factors involved in sars-cov replication de wilde et al 2015 although sirna screens are known to yield false-negative resultsa long-standing hypothesis regarding coronavirus-induced double-membrane structures is the possible involvement of the autophagy pathway which derives from the fact that autophagosomes also have double membranes some reports suggested that coronaviruses hijack the autophagy machinery for dmv biogenesis in support of their replication de haan and reggiori 2008 prentice et al 2004 maier and britton 2012 however another study showed that the essential autophagy factor atg5 is not required at all for coronavirus replication in primary cells zhao et al 2007 molinari and co-workers then proposed that so-called edemosomes are being hijacked for the formation of coronavirus membrane structures reggiori et al 2010 these edemosomes are defined as single-membrane vesicles that pinch off from the er to remove erad regulators like edem1 and os-9 when this is needed to tune the erad machinery cali et al 2008 the process seems a deviation from the autophagy pathway with the edemosomes accumulating lc3-i a form that is inactive in the canonical autophagy pathway reggiori and co-workers claimed that coronaviruses hijack these vesicles to form their reticulovesicular network and this hypothesis was later extended to arteriviruses monastyrska et al 2013 however several questions have remained unanswered and other published data appear to be at odds with the edemosome hypothesis for example it has remained entirely unclear how the small single-membrane edemosome vesicles would be converted into the elaborate network of much larger dmvs convoluted membranes cm and other structures that are typical of coronavirus-infected cells furthermore edemosomes have been characterized as alternative transport vesicles that explicitly are not associated with cop-coats and are independent of the canonical secretory pathway whichas reggiori and co-workers arguedmay explain why secretory pathway markers do not localize to replication membranes reggiori et al 2010 nonetheless the integrity of the secretory pathway and the function of cop components clearly influences coronavirus replication verheije et al 2008 oostra et al 2007 knoops et al 2010 de wilde et al 2015all in all although a variety of studies addressed the possible host pathways and factors involved in the formation and function of the replication-associated membrane structures our understanding of coronavirus replication organelle biogenesis is still far from complete possibly the expansion of our basic knowledge regarding relevant cellular processes such as membrane trafficking and autophagy may provide more clues on the molecular mechanisms underlying these interesting interactions of coronaviruses with their host cellsthe 5- and 3-proximal regions of coronavirus rnas contain key regulatory elements for their rna synthesis for a recent review see yang and leibowitz 2015 although in general the precise role of host factors interacting with these signals is poorly understood rna-binding proteins have been identified as frequently used enhancers of coronaviral rna synthesis table 2 both termini of the coronavirus genome fold into higher-order rna structures which presumably stabilize the molecule and are also involved in inter- and intramolecular interactions that facilitate viral replication brian and baric 2005 viral and cellular proteins can bind to these structures to drive or modulate translation replication and subgenomic rna synthesis
the cellular protein polypyrimidine tract-binding protein ptb or heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein protein hnrnp i was found to bind the 5 leader sequence of the tgev galan et al 2009 and mhv genome li et al 1999 choi et al 2002 in the case of mhv ptb was found to bind a 5-proximal pentanucleotide ucuaa repeat and to be critical for rna synthesis hnrnp q or syncrip also binds the 5-proximal part of the mhv genome and its knockdown reduced mhv rna synthesis and virus replication the case for a specific role in rna synthesis was strengthened by the observation that neither overexpression nor downregulation affected translation of mhv rna choi et al 2004 zinc finger cchc-type and rna-binding motif 1 madp1 was shown to bind the 5 end of the sars-cov and ibv genome tan et al 2012 in analogy to syncrip silencing of mapd1 reduced ibv replication by interfering with viral rna synthesis showing that mapd1 plays a proviral role in the coronavirus cycle tan et al 2012in addition to proteins that bind the 5 utr of the coronavirus rna many rna-binding proteins have been identified that interact with the 3 utr andor polya-tail although the role of these proteins is poorly understood first mitochondrial aconitase stabilized by a complex of heat-shock protein hsp 40 hsp60 and mitochondrial hsp70 binds the 3-terminal 42 nucleotides of the mhv 3 utr just upstream the polya tail nanda et al 2004 nanda and leibowitz 2001 the protein p100 coactivator was found to bind the tgev 3 utr andor polya tail galan et al 2009 and the pabps interact with the tgev bcov and ibv genome to promote its efficient replication spagnolo and hogue 2000 galan et al 2009 emmott et al 2013 it has been proposed that binding of pabps to the viral rna ensures efficient translation and mrna stability enjuanes 2005 in addition by using an rna-affinity purification and mass spectrometry approach galan et al 2009 identified several hnrnps that bind the 3-terminal 500 nucleotides of the tgev genome several of these are presumed rna-binding proteins for other coronaviruses and were proposed to play a role in viral rna synthesis table 2 however the exact function and relevance of hnrnps and other rna-binding proteins in coronavirus replication is still not fully understood the majority of rna-binding proteins were identified in co-immunoprecipitation studies that made use of in vitro transcribed rna and the importance of many of these factors has not been tested in the context of virus replication for example hnrnp a1 was reported to have affinity for the complement of the mhv leader sequence and the trs that regulates mrna7 synthesis li et al 1997 zhang and lai 1995 interestingly however shen and masters shen and masters 2001 showed that mhv replicates equally well in hnrnp a1 cb3 cells and parental cb3 cells which lack and express hnrnp a1 respectively this strongly suggests that hnrnp a1 itself is not pivotal for mhv replication on the other hand lai and co-workers showed that multiple hnrnps can bind to the same viral rna and postulated that hnrnps may be able to functionally substitute each other in mhv infection shi et al 2003 these apparent contradictions also highlight the technical complexity of dissecting the precise role of rna-binding proteins in coronavirus replicationon a different level rna-binding proteins were investigated as potential modulators of the efficiency of the coronavirus orf1a1b frameshift event during replicase gene translation for example annexin a2 binds the ibv slippery sequence on which ribosomes are repositioned and engage in expression of orf1b host proteins may also affect the activity of the viral rtc indirectly using an in vitro assay the rna-synthesizing activity of semi-purified sars-cov rtcs was shown to depend on an as yet unidentified cytosolic host factor which is not directly associated with the viral rtc van hemert et al 2008cells generally respond to a virus infection by mounting an innate antiviral response to limit the spread of the infection and aid in inducing an adaptive immune response that will eventually clear the virus many viruses have evolved strategies to suppress andor evade these innate immune responses which can dramatically influence the course of the infection including pathogenesis and persistence in the host in the case of rna viruses the innate immune system is often triggered by the dsrna and 5-triphosphate-bearing rna molecules that arise as replication intermediates in the cytosol these molecules are foreign to the cell and can be recognized by the intracellular sensors of the rig-i-like receptor rlr family such as retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 rig-i and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 mda-5 which are expressed in almost all cells reviewed in wilkins and gale 2010 bruns and horvath 2014 for recognition of coronavirus rnas mda-5 seems the most important cytosolic sensor zust et al 2011 zalinger et al 2015 kindler and thiel 2014 although in some cell types rig-i also seems to play a role li et al 2010 also the toll-like receptors which are expressed on the cell surface or reside in the endosomes of immune cells can recognize viral nucleic acids or proteins tlr3 plays a role in the recognition of coronaviruses totura et al 2015 mazaleuskaya et al 2012 and also tlr4 was shown to be relevant during mhv infection in mice khanolkar et al 2009 recently it was shown that the sars-cov m protein is recognized via a tlr-like pathway that is independent of the canonical traf3-mediated signaling pathway wang and liu 2016 activation of one or more of these sensors generally leads to the activation of the transcription factors ifn-regulatory factor 3 and 7 irf3 irf7 and nf-b these stimulate the expression and excretion of type-i ifn and pro-inflammatory cytokines which in turn activate the jak-stat signaling cascade that induces the expression of a myriad of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes isgs this ultimately results in an antiviral state of the infected cell as well as neighboring cells isgs were shown to target virtually all steps of the viral cycle in order to restrict viral replication schoggins and rice 2011 the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases mapks play a role in the induction of inflammatory cytokines il-6 and il-8 and were linked to countering coronavirus infections through several studies reviewed in mizutani 2007 ibv has evolved a strategy to counteract il-6 and il-8 expression by inducing the expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 1 dusp1 a negative regulator of p38 mapk although it has remained unclear which viral proteins is responsible liao et al 2011 innate immune and inflammatory signaling pathways are extensively regulated in order to prevent adverse effects of their over-stimulation apart from phosphorylation and other regulatory mechanisms the system is controlled by ubiquitination at numerous points in the signal transduction cascade for example rig-i tank-binding kinase 1 tbk1 and tnf receptor-associated factor 3 traf3 were shown to be activated by lys63-linked ubiquitination jiang and chen 2012the importance of the innate immune system in the context of coronavirus infections can be illustrated in at least three ways first in severe cases of sars the pathology was associated with aberrant or hyper-activation of innate immune signaling this resulted in the aberrant production of interferons and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 il-8 cxcl-10 and tnf-alpha in the lungs reviewed in totura and baric 2012 interestingly a systems biology study that evaluated the transcriptome after infection of cultured cells with two different human mers-cov isolates mers-cov eng 1 vs sa 1 suggested that viral sequence differences relate to variations in innate immune evasion which may in turn result in different immune responses these differences may link to differential stat3 activation leading to activation or inhibition of eg ifn nf-b and irf7 selinger et al 2014 second as described in chap 4 coronaviruses employ elaborate mechanisms to shield the viral replication machinery from the innate immune sensors in the cytosol third besides the presumed shielding of viral pamps by the replication organelles coronaviruses seem to encode numerous gene products that actively counteract or help to circumvent innate immune responses reviewed in totura and baric 2012 kindler and thiel 2014 vijay and perlman 2016to illustrate the multitude of activities coronaviruses employ to actively suppress innate immunity and the diversity of viral gene products involved some examples are discussed below first besides inhibiting cellular mrna translation see paragraph above sars-cov nsp1 was shown to block ifn signaling by reducing the amount of phosphorylated stat1 p-stat1 in infected cells wathelet et al 2007 also nsp1 proteins of other alpha- and betacoronaviruses were shown to inhibit type-i ifn signaling mostly through the host-shut-off activity of this n-terminal subunit of the coronavirus replicase polyprotein reviewed in narayanan et al 2015 further downstream in the pp1a polyprotein the papain-like protease 2 domain pl2pro of many coronaviruses and the tgev pl1pro domain which reside in nsp3 exhibit deubiquitination dub activity in biochemical experiments reviewed in mielech et al 2014 this dub activity may remove ubiquitin from innate immune signaling factors to suppress the induction of an antiviral state and indeed was shown to reduce ifn signaling in biochemical experiments using pl2pro overexpression for several coronaviruses including sars-cov matthews et al 2014a li et al 2016 and mers-cov chen et al 2007 clementz et al 2010 bailey-elkin et al 2014 similarly experiments suggested that mhv pl2pro deubiquitinates and binds tbk1 as well as irf3 zheng et al 2008 wang et al 2011 for the distantly related arterivirus eav infection with a mutant lacking a similar papain-like protease-driven dub activity resulted in an increased innate immune response after infection indicating that the viral dub activity indeed has a function in suppression of innate immune response during infection van kasteren et al 2013 adjacent to the pl2pro domain some coronaviruses contain a domain originally coined sars-cov unique domain sud the two domains together were recently also implicated in innate immune suppression by binding and stimulating a cellular ubiquitin e3 ligase rchy1 resulting in augmented degradation of p53 ma-lauer et al 2016 the main protease nsp5 of pedv was shown to cleave nemo an important innate immune regulator protein wang et al 2015 when independently expressed coronavirus nsp6 which is probably one of the most hydrophobic proteins encoded in the genome seems to induce andor influence autophagy however the relevance of this observation for virus-infected cells and possible links to innate immune responses against coronaviruses remain to be investigated cottam et al 2014 cottam et al 2011 a conserved domain in the coronavirus nsp16 directs 2-o methylation of the viral rna thereby preventing its recognition by mda5 menachery et al 2014 zust et al 2011besides conserved replicase subunits also several of the less-conserved products of downstream open reading frames ie the so-called accessory proteins have innate immunity suppressing features in fact these proteins may have been acquired by different coronavirus lineages for this purpose since they are generally dispensable for replication in cell culture the phosphodiesterase ns2 encoded by orf2a in mhv and related viruses antagonizes rnase l activation and this was show to be important for replication in natural host cells zhao et al 2012 li and weiss 2016 observations supporting a role in blocking ifn production andor signaling were also made for the orf3b and orf6 proteins of sars-cov kopecky-bromberg et al 2007 and the orf3b proteins of other sars-like coronaviruses zhou et al 2012 also the proteins encoded by mers-cov orfs 4a 4b and 5 siu et al 2014 yang et al 2013 niemeyer et al 2013 matthews et al 2014b all seem to block ifn signaling although many of the initial reports were based only on overexpression experiments which should be interpreted with caution recently however more insight into the mechanisms by which some of these viral proteins suppress antiviral responses was obtained like mhv ns2 see above the mers-cov orf4b protein and its homologs from other betacoronaviruses were shown to have phosphodiesterase activity they can block activation of the rnase l-mediated innate immune response during infection by degrading 25-oligoadenylate which is the activator of rnase l thornbrough et al 2016 additionally mers-cov orf4a prevents activation of the pkr-stress granule route by binding dsrna in the context of an infection rabouw et al 2016 the sars-cov orf6 protein was shown to block p-stat1 import into the nucleus by interacting with the nuclear pore and this block was suggested to reduce innate immune responses and the expression of genes that affect virus-induced pathogenesis frieman et al 2007 kopecky-bromberg et al 2007 huang et al 2015a interestingly mers-cov along with the other coronaviruses not belonging to the sars-cov cluster lacks an orf6 homolog and since mers-cov is also more sensitive to treatment with type-i interferons it was hypothesized that this couldin partbe explained by this difference de wilde et al 2013b also the coronaviral structural proteins seem to possess innate immunity-modulating activities although also here most studies involved overexpression experiments the sars-cov and mers-cov m proteins bind traf3 to prevent its binding to tbk1 and eventually to prevent nuclear translocation of this complex which blocks irf3-mediated signaling siu et al 2009 lui et al 2016 overexpression experiments showed a negative impact of the sars-cov n protein on the early stages of innate immune signaling frieman et al 2009 kopecky-bromberg et al 2007 lu et al 2011 mhv n protein also seems to counteract type-i ifn signaling and could do this in the context of a recombinant vaccinia virus infection ye et al 2007 purified sars-cov spike s protein stimulates inflammatory and other innate responses possibly through tlr2 activation dosch et al 2009 finally the sars-cov e protein is a viroporin and influences inflammatory processes by boosting the activity of the nlrp3 inflammasome leading to il-1beta overproduction and development of immunopathology in the host nieto-torres et al 2015the cell cycle is a series of highly regulated events that leads to cell division the process can be divided into four distinct phases g1 s g2 and m cell cycle regulation is critical for cell survival as well as the prevention of uncontrolled cell division the molecular mechanisms that control the cell cycle are ordered directional and controlled by cyclin-dependent protein kinases cdks cell cycle progression requires activation of different cdks by eg cyclin regulatory subunits to reach the stage of dna replication cdkcyclin complexes phosphorylate and thereby activate or inactivate their target proteins to coordinate progression towards the next phase of the cell cycle nigg 1995like many other viruses reviewed in bagga and bouchard 2014 coronaviruses have been shown to extensively manipulate and arrest cell cycle progression to benefit from the physiological state of cells arrested in that specific phase for example ibv-infected cells were shown to go into cell cycle arrest in the s phase by activating the cellular dna damage response xu et al 2011 this is beneficial to virus replication since factors that are normally needed for dna replication and are upregulated in the s phase can now be recruited to the cytoplasm by the virus for example ddx1 a cellular rna helicase of the dexdh family interacts with coronavirus nsp14 xu et al 2010 and was reported to be hijacked by coronaviruses to enhance their replication ddx1 also interacts with the ibv n protein emmott et al 2013 and facilitates in complex with the phosphorylated form of the mhv-jhm n protein the balanced synthesis of sg mrnas and the genomic rna wu et al 2014bhardwaj et al have shown that coronavirus nsp15 interacts with and inhibits retinoblastoma protein prb a tumor suppressor protein this results in the enhanced expression of genes that are normally repressed by prb and in an increased proportion of cells entering the s phase of the cell cycle bhardwaj et al 2012 similar effects have been observed in mhv-infected cells which showed decreased hyperphosphorylation of prb an event that is necessary for the progression from g1 to s phase chen and makino 2004 chen et al 2004 yuan and colleagues showed that overexpression of the sars-cov 3a protein also leads to g1 arrest and inhibition of cell proliferation yuan et al 2007the cyclin-dependent kinase 6 cdk6 is downregulated upon mhv infection and seems to play a role in a virus-induced cell cycle arrest in the g0g1 phase that promotes virus replication chen and makino 2004 similar observations have been made for sars-cov with overexpression of the n protein limiting cell cycle progression by reducing cdk4 and cdk6 kinase activity surjit et al 2006 cdk6 is a kinase involved in cell cycle progression from g1 to s phase jimenez-guardeno et al 2014 and depletion of cdk6 results in g1 phase cell cycle arrest a host kinome-directed sirna screen confirmed the antiviral role of cdk6 in sars-cov infection as replication was enhanced in cells depleted for cdk6 de wilde et al 2015several coronaviruses induce activation of p53 to mediate cell cycle arrest in the s or g2m phase for example tgev n protein activates p53 which leads to accumulation of cell cycle-related kinases like cdc-2 and cyclin b1 synchronisation of cells in the s or g2m phase favors tgev rna and virus production ding et al 2013 2014 and ibv replication dove et al 2006 for mhv nsp1 a similar mechanism has been proposed nsp1 activates p53 leading to increased p21 and decreased cdk2-cyclin e levels this ultimately leads to hyperphosphorylation of prb and g1 cell cycle arrest chen et al 2004 in contrast sars-cov infection leads to reduction of p53 expression levels to counteract the inhibitory effect of p53 its expression is reduced by a mechanism that involves stabilization of the e3 ligase rchy1 by sars-cov nsp3 rchy1 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 however the exact role of this mechanism in cell cycle regulation viral replication andor pathogenesis remains unclear ma-lauer et al 2016 nevertheless in cells that lack p53 expression sars-cov replication was significantly enhanced ma-lauer et al 2016 degradation of p53 by the sars-cov or hcov-nl63 pl2pro is another mechanism to counteract the antiviral effect of p53 the deubiquitinating activity of pl2pro promotes the degradation of p53 thereby lowering the p53-mediated antiviral immune response yuan et al 2015in conclusion coronaviruses appear to favor a specific stage in the cell cycle for their replication this stage can differ per coronavirus and may even differ per cell type a wide variety of coronavirus proteins have been implicated in inducing cell cycle arrest but it must be noted that many studies involved overexpression of individual viral proteins and therefore should be interpreted with caution since their expression levels are likely different than during virus infection when expressed outside the context of virus replication these proteins may also behave differently eg due to lack of viral interaction partners andor localize differently eg in the absence of virus-induced membrane structures which might lead to less meaningful observationscyclosporin a csa is a well-known immunosuppressant that binds to cellular cyclophilins cyps yielding a cyp-csa complex that inhibits calcineurin activity this in turn prevents dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated t cells nf-at from the cytosol into the nucleus which prevents the transcription of immune genes such as il-2 reviewed in tanaka et al 2013 davis et al 2010 barik 2006 thus far 17 cyps have been identified of which nine are targeted by csa cyps are also known as peptidylprolyl isomerases ppiases and many of them have chaperone and foldase activities barik 2006 davis et al 2010 that facilitate protein folding cyps are involved in various signaling pathways reviewed in barik 2006 apoptosis schinzel et al 2005 and rna splicing teigelkamp et al 1998 horowitz et al 2002cyclophilins and in particular the cytosolic cypa and the er-associated cypb have been implicated in the replicative cycle of many rna viruses as essential host components reviewed in baugh and gallay 2012 for example i cyps are essential in the remodeling of cellular membranes into hcv replication organelles ii cypa aids in hcv polyprotein processing iii hiv-1 capsids are stabilized by low levels of cypa to ensure entrance into the nucleus before the virion could be destabilized in the cytosol hopkins and gallay 2015 and references herein the use of csa analogs like alisporivir paeshuyse et al 2006 that lack the immunosuppressive properties of the parental compound has been explored in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic hcv infection again illustrating the prominent role of cyps in hcv replication and the druggability of cyps flisiak et al 2012along the same lines the inhibition of coronavirus replication by cyp inhibitors like csa and alisporivir suggested important roles for cyps in cell culture infection models low-micromolar concentrations of csa or alisporivir inhibit a variety of coronaviruses including sars-cov hcov-229e mhv hcov-nl63 and fcov pfefferle et al 2011 de wilde et al 2011 tanaka et al 2012 carbajo-lozoya et al 2012 de wilde et al 2017 the mitochondrial cypd is part of the mitochondrial permeabilization transition pore and involved in caspase-independent apoptosis induced by porcine epidemic diarrea virus pedv and hcov-nl63 favreau et al 2012 kim and lee 2014 an event that is inhibited by csa however most studies on the presumed role of cyps in coronavirus replication have focused on cypa initially cypa was identified as an interaction partner of the sars-cov n protein luo et al 2004 and by mass spectrometry it was also detected in purified sars-cov virions neuman et al 2008 yeast two-hybrid experiments identified multiple cyps cypa cypb cyph and cypg and related ppiases fk506-binding protein 1a and 1b as potential binding partners of sars-cov nsp1 pfefferle et al 2011 in addition in caco-2 or huh7 cells shrna-mediated knockdown of cypa expression to less than 3 of the normal levels was reported to near-completely block hcov-nl63 replication and reduce hcov-229e replication by 1 log carbajo-lozoya et al 2014 von brunn et al 2015 recently by using ppia or ppib knockout rather than knockdown cells it was shown that fcov depends on both cypa and cypb expression 95 reduction in fcov-infected cypa or cypb-ko cells ppiase-deficient mutants expressed in cells that also contained endogenous cypa and cypb marginally reduced fcov infection two- to fivefold reduction in fcov rna compared to cells that express wt cypa or wt cypb only tanaka et al 2016 furthermore the work of von brunn and colleagues suggested that hcov-229e replication was reduced by various cypa single-nucleotide polymorphisms that affect the proteins stability and function von brunn et al 2015 although these results suggested a role for cypa in coronavirus replication the sirna-mediated depletion of cypa and cypb did not affect the replication of sars-cov de wilde et al 2011 despite the fact that the same knockdown did affect the replication of the distantly related arterivirus eav de wilde et al 2013a the differences reported using either knockout or knockdown of cypa with different efficiencies 100 97 and 75 for cypa knockout cells and cypa shrna- or sirna-mediated knockdown respectively suggest that low cypa expression levels may suffice to support efficient coronavirus replication and that the near-complete depletion of cypa may be needed to inhibit virus replicationthe major role of cyps in cellular signaling is in the nf-at signaling pathway pfefferle et al described that sars-cov activates the nf-at signaling pathway pfefferle et al 2011 and the replication of various coronaviruses including sars-cov hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 is inhibited by the drug fk-506 whichlike csaalso blocks nf-at signaling carbajo-lozoya et al 2012 feline coronavirus replication seemed not to depend on a functional nf-at signaling pathway since it was blocked by csa concentrations that did not affect nf-at signaling in fcwf-4 cells tanaka et al 2012in conclusion further studies are needed to dissect the precise role of cyps in coronavirus replication with special attention for the remaining levels of cypa expression and the relevance of nf-at signaling following coronavirus infection such experiments should include the production and use of knockout cells for one or multiple cyps or other members of this protein family although cyp inhibitors have been shown to be potent anti-coronavirus drugs in cell culture a first attempt to validate this effect for alisporivir in a sars-cov animal model was unsuccessful de wilde et al 2017 therefore although cyp inhibitors may help to understand the role of host factors in coronavirus replication they are at this moment less promising as host-directed therapeutics for the treatment of coronavirus infectionsthe application of systems biology approaches in virology has provided a wealth of information on the role of individual proteins and cellular pathways in the replication of rna viruses this relatively young interdisciplinary field focuses on the complexity of the virushost interactions that occur within the cell or even the whole organism the aim is to provide an unbiased perspective by applying techniques like transcriptomics metabolomics proteomics and functional genomics to the infected system as a wholefor coronaviruses one of the first systematic studies into the role of host factors concerned an oligonucleotide microarray-based transcriptomic analysis of sars-cov-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells which revealed the upregulation of the expression of various cytokines including il-8 and il-17 and the activation of macrophages and the coagulation pathway ng et al 2004 a microarray analysis of lung autopsy tissue samples provided more insight into the pathogenesis of and host response to sars-cov infection in particular the inflammatory and cytokine responses involved baas et al 2006 mhv-jhm infected cultures of central nervous system cells showed 126 differentially expressed transcripts the majority of which were related to intracellular regulation of innate immunity eg nf-b signaling and genes involved in ifn signaling rempel et al 2005 microarray analysis of mhv-a59-infected l cells provided insight into transcriptional changes during infection including those related to chemokine production rna and protein metabolism and apoptosis versteeg et al 2006 subsequently a genome-wide microarray analysis of mhv-infected lr7 cells revealed the downregulation of a large number of mrnas including many encoding proteins involved in translation implying that the host translational shut-off that occurs in mhv-infected cells is due to a stress response and concomitant mrna decay raaben et al 2007 there is not necessarily a direct correlation between changes in mrna levels and protein abundance in the cell therefore microarray data should be interpreted with caution and need to be validated with follow-up experiments including the direct analysis of changes in cellular protein levelsanother approach to obtain more insight into coronavirushost interactions is to systematically map the cellular interactome of individual coronavirus proteins a yeast two-hybrid y2h screen of this type identified subunits btf3 and atf5 of the rna polymerase complex and a subunit of cytochrome oxidase ii nadh 4l as interaction partners of sars-cov nsp10 li et al 2005a the authors suggested the latter interaction to contribute to the sars-cov-induced cytopathic effect but the interaction and its relevance for virus-induced cell death still awaits confirmation in the context of sars-cov-infected cells as the rather artificial y2h system is known to frequently yield false-positive hits indeed another y2h study with the sars-cov helicase nsp13 demonstrated that out of the seven primary hits only one ddx5 could be validated by independent methods as a true interactor of the helicase nsp13 chen et al 2009 the functional significance of the interaction between nsp13 and the multifunctional cellular helicase ddx5 and whether the interaction is direct or mediated through rna remains to be determined using a similar y2h screening approach xu and colleagues found that ddx1 bound to sars-cov and ibv nsp14 an interaction that enhanced ibv replication the presence of one or more cellular helicases in the viral rtc supports their importance in virus replication indeed a later study reported that ddx1 regulated by the gsk-3-mediated phosphorylation of the n protein is involved in the regulation of sg mrna synthesis wu et al 2014 a very comprehensive systematic analysis of the sars-cov-host interactome was performed by pfefferle et al using a high-throughput genome-wide y2h screen with all 14 sars-cov orfs and fragments thereof pfefferle et al 2011 network analysis revealed particularly striking interactions between nsp1 and the members of the immunophilin family including cypa see chap 8 furthermore the cellular e3 ubiquitin ligase rchy1 was shown to interact with the sars-cov nsp3 sud domain and might be involved in the downregulation of the antiviral factor p53 ma-lauer et al 2016stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture silac is a mass spectrometry-based proteomics technique to determine differences in protein abundance between samples from two different experimental conditions eg comparing virus-infected with uninfected cells the first silac-based quantitative proteomics study of infected cells demonstrated the upregulation of nf-b and ap-1 dependent pathways during ibv infection emmott et al 2010 a combination of silac on 293t cells that express the ibv n protein pull-down and mass spectrometry was used to map the cellular interactome of the ibv n protein leading to the identification of 142 cellular proteins as potential binding partners emmott et al 2013 many of these proteins are interacting with rna eg ribosomal and nucleolar proteins helicases and hnrnps emmott et al 2013 and therefore likely bind the ibv n protein indirectly nevertheless detailed validation and mechanistic follow-up studies confirmed the functional importance of several of the identified binding partners for ibv replication emmott et al 2013the baric laboratory used a systems genetics approach using the collaborative cross mouse panel to gain insight into the host loci that affect the outcome of sars-cov infection gralinski et al 2015 this studyamong other findingsidentified the ubiquitin e3 ligase trim55 as an important determinant of disease severity through its role in vascular cuffing and inflammation a study by selinger et al 2014 documented differences in immune and inflammatory responses in mers patients which may codetermine the outcome of the infection and likely result from both differences in host response genetic make-up and mers-cov strain-specific properties to better understand the molecular basis of the different immune and inflammatory responses to two different mers-cov isolates a comparative transcriptome analysis was done on human airway cells infected with mers-cov strains sa1 and eng1 selinger et al 2014 this study suggested that differences in genome replication andor proteins involved in innate immune evasion plpro and orf4a were responsible for different transcriptional responses resulting in the differential activation of the stat3 pathway which is likely involved in lung inflammation and cellular repair these effects are mainly seen during later stages of infection and with the mers-cov eng1 strain triggering a more rapid host response than the sa1 straina silac-based quantitative proteomics study that compared the proteome of sars-cov replicon-expressing bhk-21 cells with that of control cells identified 43 host proteins whose expression was upregulated and 31 that were downregulated zhang et al 2010 bag3 a multifunctional regulator of many cellular processes was identified as one of the upregulated proteins and knockdown studies revealed that bag3 is important for efficient replication of sars-cov and a number of other viruses in addition many proteins involved in translation and the signaling proteins cdc42 and rhoa were shown to be downregulated as discussed in more detail in sect 3 zhang et al 2010 a silac-based quantitative proteomics study of golgi-enriched subcellular fractions revealed that upon mhv infection several proteins of the secretory pathway were depleted while ribosomal proteins were found to be enriched vogels et al 2011 sirna-mediated knockdown of three of the depleted proteins c11orf59 glg1 and sec22b increased replication or release of infectious progeny while overexpression of these proteins had the opposite effect this study highlighted the importance of the secretory pathway in coronavirus replicationa role for secretory pathway proteins was also confirmed by a proteomic analysis of purified sars-cov virions which identified besides several viral proteins including nsp2 nsp3 and nsp5 172 host proteins in virions neuman et al 2008 several proteins from the copi pathway were identified which is in line with the site of virion biogenesis ergic the role if any of most of the identified host proteins in sars-cov replication or virion biogenesis remains to be elucidatedprotein kinases are key regulators in signal transduction control a wide variety of cellular processes and have been shown to play important roles in the replicative cycle of many rna viruses a kinome-wide sirna screen identified a variety of host cell kinases that influence sars-cov replication including 40 proviral proteins that promote efficient replication de wilde et al 2015 among these proteins involved in the metabolism of complex lipids and the early secretory pathway copi-coated vesicles were found to play an important role the antiviral effect of pkr was confirmed in this study and cdk6 was identified as a novel antiviral factor a relatively large number of antiviral hits 90 of 778 factors 12 of all factors tested was identified for sars-cov compared to human kinome-directed screens performed with other viruses supekova et al 2008 lupberger et al 2011 moser et al 2010 this might indicate that compared to other viruses sars-cov replication is more extensively influenced by cellular factors multiple of these factors could be linked to cellular immune responses like interleukin il signaling which il-6 and -8 was also implicated in controlling coronavirus infection and coronavirus-induced inflammation in other studies zhang et al 2007 baas et al 2006 also several proteins from the p38 mapk pathway were identified which had also been implicated in coronavirus replication earlier and regulates il-6- il-8- and il-10-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling chang et al 2004 zhang et al 2007 song et al 2013 the interaction between coronaviruses and the innate immune response was already discussed in more detail in chap 6 a similar genome-wide sirna screen identified host proteins important for the replication of ibv wong et al 2015 including 83 proviral proteins 30 of which could be mapped to networks that interact with viral proteins many of the identified proteins are involved in rna bindingprocessing membrane trafficking and ubiquitin conjugation the importance of the secretory pathway that was demonstrated by de wilde et al 2015 was in line with an earlier study that demonstrated that mhv replication was sensitive to brefeldin a treatment and dependent on gbf1-mediated arf1 activation which appear to be involved in rtc formation verheije et al 2008 similar results were also obtained for ibv wong et al 2015 and this study also identified an early role in ibv infection for the valosin-containing protein vcp which may be involved in the maturation of virus-loaded endosomes vcp is also important for the early stages of hcov-229e replication wong et al 2015 an rnai screen of the druggable genome identified several endocytosis-related proteins that are required for efficient infection of hela cells with mhv burkard et al 2014 subsequent validation and mechanistic studies demonstrated thatas discussed aboveclathrin-mediated endocytosis and trafficking to lysosomes are crucial for mhv fusion and entry which required the activity of lysosomal proteases this is different for mers-cov which contains a furin cleavage site upstream of the fusion peptide in the spike protein and therefore requires furin activity but not lysosomal proteases burkard et al 2014rnai screens have revolutionized functional genetics but major concerns are the possibility of false-positive hits due to off-target effects including downregulation of multiple transcripts stimulation of the immune response or saturation of the rnai machinery leading to a block in processing of essential cellular mirnas reviewed in jackson and linsley 2010 insufficient knockdown of host factors can lead to false-negative results therefore hits from sirna screens need to be thoroughly validated preferably using an independent technical approach they should be considered as a mere starting point for further analysis rather than providing a definitive list of host factors involved in virus replication technological advancements and novel screening approaches eg those based on crisprcas9-mediated genome editing or haploid genetic screens shalem et al 2014 carette et al 2009 will likely lead to the more reliable identification of host factors important for coronavirus replicationinsight into coronavirus-host interactions obtained eg using systematic screening approaches does not only yield valuable information on the molecular details of the replicative cycle and pathogenesis but can also be a starting point for the development of antiviral strategies virus binding and entry are the first steps of the replication cycle that can be targeted with inhibitors several well-known inhibitors of endosomal acidification like ammonium chloride and the fda-approved anti-malaria drug chloroquine have been shown to block entry of coronaviruses takano et al 2013 keyaerts et al 2009 krzystyniak and dupuy 1984 payne et al 1990 kono et al 2008 including sars-cov and mers-cov keyaerts et al 2004 de wilde et al 2014 in addition peptides have been developed that block fusion by interfering with the interaction between the hr1 and hr2 domains of the s protein preventing the formation of a fusogenic complex or blocking s protein oligomerisation reviewed in du et al 2009interferon ifn was shown to trigger the innate immune response in coronavirus-infected cells leading to transcription of many isgs that have a role in controlling infection schoggins and rice 2011 treatment with type-i ifns inhibits coronavirus replication in cell culture garlinghouse et al 1984 taguchi and siddell 1985 haagmans et al 2004 paragas et al 2005 zheng et al 2004 de wilde et al 2013b and for example protected type-i pneumocytes against sars-cov infection in macaques haagmans et al 2004 despite the potency of ifn as an antiviral agent its side effects like fatigue malaise apathy and cognitive changes dusheiko 1997 emphasize the need for developing ifn-free therapeutic strategies besides inhibitors directed at viral enzymes kim et al 2016 such therapeutic strategies could also involve host-directed approaches based on the knowledge obtained on coronavirushost interactions the host-directed approach might lower the chance of development of antiviral resistance and could yield a broad-spectrum therapeutic strategy to treat infections with currently problematic coronaviruses and new variants that will undoubtedly emerge in the futureunlike other organs the central nervous system cns does not have a traditional lymphatic system or native lymphocytes thus a viral invasion of the cns requires signaling from the cnss innate immune system in order to recruit inflammatory cells from the circulation this signaling typically involves the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the circulation the identity of these cns immune cells that are capable of signaling the immune system is not entirely clear microglial cells are cns immune cells nelson et al 2002 but astrocytes may also have immune functions in the cns farina et al 2007 astrocytes the most abundant cells in the cns are heterogeneous and multifunctional and were recently discovered to be part of the glial lymphatic system glymphatic of the cns jessen et al 2015 negi and das 2018 astrocytes are divided into subgroups based on morphology and function seidman et al 1997 ffrench-constant and raff 1986 but which subtype of astrocytes forms the glymphatic system and induces cns innate immune functions is unknowna murine tissue culture model system of a cns infection that invokes an immune reaction was used to identify the cns glymphatic and innate immune cells and to test their ability to induce pro-inflammatory signaling because of their potential immune functions microglia and clonal populations of three subtypes of astrocytes type i ii and iii were infected with two murine coronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus strain a59 mhv- a59 is a neurotropic virus that with intracerebral or intranasal injection causes encephalitis followed by an inflammatory demyelinating disease in mice similar to the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis lavi et al 1984a lavi et al 1984b lavi et al 1988 lavi et al 1999 for comparison similar cells were infected with another closely related strain of coronavirus mhv-2 that lacks the ability to cause encephalitis or inflammatory demyelination in mouse brains despite infection of the same cells in vitro das sarma et al 2001bin order to correlate functional activities of astrocytes and microglia with their anatomical structure in the brain we used immunohistochemically stained random sections of human brain to illustrate a proposed structure of the glymphatic innate immune system of the cnsplaque-purified mhv-a59 and mhv-2 were propagated and titrated on murine l2 cells in dmem with 10 fbs stock viruses had titers of 107108 pfuml for viral growth curves l2 cell cultures were

cells were plated on 100 mm plates and cultured at 37 c with 5 co2 when the cells reached approximately 80 confluence they were infected by mhv-a59 or mhv-2 moi  2 for 24 h for each viral infection mock-infected cells with virus-free medium were included as controlsimmunofluorescence procedures were performed as previously described suzumura et al 1986 astrocyte cultures were placed on coverslips pretreated with 001 poly-l-lysine solution sigma in 12-well plates at a concentration of 100000 cells per well the cell cultures were infected with mhvs moi  2 or sham-infected virus free medium and incubated for 24 h cells were rinsed with pbs and fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde in pbs at 4 c for 1 h after rinsing 3 times in pbs for 5 min intervals cells were permeabilized for 10 min with

agilent technologies company santa clara ca the gfap product is a 6f2 clone used at 1500 dilution and the cd68 product is a kp1 clone used in 14000 dilution sections were incubated with antibodies and a brown chromogen and counterstained with hematoxylin by conventional immunohistochemical automated proceduresthe human brain sections were derived from cortical areas of non-diseased adult human brains that were stained for trainee teaching material of the anatomy and morphology of brain cells the sections presented here are representative sections of multiple sections that showed similar finding in both genders and different age groups the sections are anonymous and cannot be traced to specific individuals sections were derived from brains obtained at autopsy and comported with ethical protocols of the hospitalthe clonal astrocytic cell cultures analyzed by immunofluorescence with gfap antibodies showed the following features type i astrocytes were cells with both thick and thin processes moderate amount of cytoplasm and occasional foot processes type ii astrocytes were cells with small amount of cytoplasm only thin and long processes and without foot processes type iii astrocytes were flat with abundant cytoplasm and no processes fig 1
 the morphology of the cells was consistent with the previously described morphology of the original cell cultures alliot and pessac 1984infection of type i and type ii astrocytes with mhv-a59 and mhv-2 was productive and reached titers of 45 log10pfuml infection with both viruses of type iii astrocytes was negative microglial cells were infected with both mhv-a59 and mhv-2 and reached a level of 34 log10pfumlfollowing infection with mhv-a59 upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines was seen in type i astrocytes fig 2a but not in type ii fig 2b or type iii astrocytes fig 2c there was no upregulation of cytokine induction in mhv-2 infection compared to sham-infected cultures in all three astrocytic cultures the significant upregulated interleukin cytokines in mhv-a59 infection of type i astrocytes were il1alpha and beta il7 il13 il15 il16 il17 il17beta il18 there was no significant upregulation of il3 il4 il5 il6 il9 il10 il11 il12 and il20all interferons alpha beta and gamma and some of the molecules in the tnf family were upregulated in response to mhv-a59 infection but not following mhv-2 infection in type i astrocytes there was no upregulation of interferons and tnf family molecules in type ii and iii astrocytes following infections with mhv-a59 or mhv-2 data not shownfollowing mhv-a59 infection of microglia the main interleukin upregulated was il6 while all interferons and members of the tnf molecules cytokines were upregulated compared to sham infection none of the cytokines were upregulated following mhv-2 infection of microglia fig 3
the results in murine tissue culture cells suggested that two types of cells microglia and a subtype of astrocytes participate in immune functions this indicates that both murine and human brains have an anatomical structure designed to provide these immune functions the ideal site for these functions is a structure composed by cell types that have direct relationship with endothelial cells thus forming the perivascular glymphatic system we therefore investigated whether in human brain perivascular astrocytes have the morphology of type i astrocytes and whether microglial cells also send processes to a perivascular location and participate in the brain glymphatic system we selected random images of human brain sections stained with antibodies that identify glial and microglial cells gfap and cd68 respectively these sections representing the same pattern of anatomical findings in any human brain were used to present anatomical structures that exist in all human brains we identified small caliber and capillary blood vessels completely surrounded by gfap astrocytic foot processes also intermittent processes of cd68 positive microglial cells were identified in the perivascular space cells of the perivascular distribution expressed morphological features of type i astrocytes but not type ii or iii fig 4
this study investigated immune mediated aspects of the pathogenesis of an experimental model of coronaviruses the coronavirus genus of viruses belongs to the coronaviridae family of the nidovirales order that produce a variety of hepatic enteric and neurologic diseases in animals and upper respiratory and enteric diseases in humans cavanagh 1997 lai and cavanagh 1997 lavi et al 1999 lavi and weiss 1989 in 2003 a virulent coronavirus infection caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars followed by middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers peiris et al 2003 in 2019 a new human coronavirus emerged named sars cov-2 causing the pandemic of covid-19 both the original sars virus and sars cov-2 induce cytokine release mainly il-6 contributing to a cytokine storm that exacerbates viral pathogenesis resulting in a high mortality rate cheung et al 2005 channappanavar and perlman 2017 mehta et al 2020 the understanding of the pathogenesis of human coronaviruses is greatly enhanced by studies of experimental animal models of coronavirusesmhv-a59 is a member of the coronavirus genus that with intracerebral or intranasal exposure in mice produces a bi-phasic disease with acute hepatitis meningitis and encephalitis followed by chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease while the acute phase of the disease is associated with direct viral replication and antigen expression in the brain and liver the chronic immune-mediated demyelinating disease is associated with rare rna persistence in the brain without evidence of direct viral replication or antigen expression demyelination was found to be molecularly controlled by a region in the s1 portion of the spike glycoprotein gene of mhv-a59 downstream from the receptor binding domain based on mutational analysis and the finding that a single point mutation asparagine to serine in position 345 of s gene abolished demyelination completely das sarma et al 2000 das sarma et al 2001a fu et al 2004 fu and lavi 2005 mhv-2 in comparison is a hepatotropic virus causing hepatitis and mild meningitis without encephalitis even when inoculated intracerebrally neurovirulence and the ability of mhv to cause encephalitis is directly related to its ability to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines both in vivo and in vitro li et al 2004 the present investigation determined that infection with the encephalitic strain mhv-a59 produced a pro-inflammatory cytokine reaction of the innate immune system mediated by microglia and type i astrocytes this is in contrast to the non-encephalitic strain mhv-2 which did not produce a cytokine response it is therefore concluded that a cytokine response determines the ability of the virus to cause encephalitisupregulated cytokines in type i astrocytes following mhv-a59 infection were il1 alpha and beta il2 il15 il13 il17 all three interferons and tnf all of these cytokines are known to be pro-inflammatory and some have known innate immune functions including maintenance of the blood brain barrier integrity in general the cytokine response in type i astrocytes was consistent with a th1and th17 response role in pro-inflammation and autoimmunity the cytokine response profile in microglia was primarily involving il-6 interferons and tnf il-6 in its initial response is also pro-inflammatory although it can also serve at later stages of infection as inducer of il-10 and anti-inflammatory reaction thus the profiles of the cytokine response in both cell types were complementary and aimed at inducing a pro-inflammatory reaction that would enable a cellular inflammatory reaction to enter the cns and be directed against the invading virus the lack of induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as il-4 and il-10 due to coronavirus infection may explain the enhanced inflammatory response that occurs during a cytokine stormthe finding of a cytokine response originating in type i astrocytes and microglia suggests that these two cell types form an anatomic structure responsible for the innate immune response in the cns it is well known that astrocytic foot processes surround brain capillaries and during development induce endothelial cells to form tight junctions which are the basis for the blood brain barrier the immune reaction in the brain originates in a perivascular structure known as the glymphatic system because of its similarity to the systemic lymphatic system the morphology of the cultured type i astrocytes appears to be identical to the morphology of human perivascular astrocytes that send their foot processes to the blood vessels the morphology of these perivascular astrocytes is clearly different from the cultured type ii or type iii in addition we found immunohistochemical evidence in human tissue that microglia also send processes that are in close proximity to endothelial cells likely participating with astrocytes type i in the perivascular structure the combination of the morphological study with the function of cytokine production suggests that type i astrocytes and microglia form the perivascular glymphatic system that is involved in an innate immune reaction by the secretion of cytokines following a neurotropic encephalitic viral infection a graphic illustration of the perivascular role of type i astrocytes and microglia in the blood brain barrier and glymphatic system is shown in fig 5
the experimental murine coronavirus mhv-a59 and the pandemic human coronavirus sars cov-2 have multiple similarities infection with both murine and human coronaviruses induce a proinflammatory cytokine reaction most notably involving il-6 inhalation of mhv-a59 causes limbic encephalitis lavi et al 1988 and anosmia loss of smell and taste is common in covid-19 suggesting involvement of the olfactory nerves with both viral infections central nervous system infection is seen with both murine and human coronaviruses acute and subacute neurologic manifestations of covid-19 include change in mental status amnesia delirium encephalitis stroke and a gbs like illness asadi-pooya and simani 2020 toscano et al 2020 cerebrovascular disease occurs in about 5 of patients with covid-19 including in those younger than 50 years old strokes involve both large and small vessels in arterial and venous circulations in multiple vascular territories the pathophysiology of the varied cerebrovascular symptomatology is presumed to be due to cytokine upregulation coagulopathy and endothelial cell dysfunction oxley et al 2020 bevrouti et al 2020 the rna viral persistence in patients with covid-19 wang et al 2020 was similar to rare rna persistence described in mhv-a59 infection lavi et al 1984a due to differences in organ affinity covid-19 had rna persistence in the gastrointestinal tract while mhv-a59 persistence was in the brain infection with the coronavirus mhv-a59 is a murine model for the cns demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis infection with the coronavirus sars cov-2 is recently recognized and its long-term neurological consequences if any are as yet unknown long term monitoring of patients who survived covid-19 is needed to determine if there are any remote neurological effects of the sars cov-2 infectioninfection of type i astrocytes and microglia with the murine coronavirus mhv-a59 results in a proinflammatory cytokine mediated encephalitis type i astrocytes and microglia form the perivascular glymphatic system the site of the cns innate immune system the pathogenesis of this murine coronavirus infection mirrors that of covid-19 similarities between murine infection with mhv-a59 and human infection with sars cov-2 include their affinity for the olfactory system their spread into the brain causing neurologic symptoms their high virulence their pathogenic dependence on cytokine induction and the persistence of their viral rna in infected organsthe authors participated in the project design creation of data interpretation of the results and in the writing and reviewing the manuscript funding for this project was not provided by external sourcesthe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest in the publication of this workwith such an avalanche of reported cases of covid-19 coronavirus disease-19 from all across the globe the family of coronavirus has pretty nearly brought the entire human race under its feet since late december 2019 khan et al 2020 corona loosely meaning halo or crown in latin refers to the structure seen by the capsid and rna coronavirus was actually termed during the imaging of the viral family coronaviridae due to the circular shape of the virus itself li 2016 covid-19 is caused by the novel strain of coronavirus named as sars-cov-2 due to its homology with sars infection and has been declared as a pandemic by the who world health organization on march 2020 world health organization 2020 this novel strain of cov debuted into the human host causing severe pneumonia and respiratory disorders wang et al 2020 sars-cov-2 has managed to rattle the host immune system very successfully reports suggest that analogous to its predecessor sars-cov who belongs to the same genera and family the origin of sars-cov-2 has also been reported to be from the species of bats li et al 2020 this strain of coronavirus is highly contagious which is the root cause of covid-19 being spread rapidly and causing higher number of casualties ever since the first case has been reportedcoronaviruses covs are a group of viruses that belong to the family coronaviridae infecting humans along with other species not every covs and are respiratory illness causing viruses the first encounter with the cov was seen in 1960s which was named as hcov-oc43 and hcovs 229e drosten et al 2003 until late december 2019 six such groups of covs were being known hcov-oc43 hcov-hku1 hcov-229e sars-cov hcov-nl63 and mers-cov are among them covs are categorized under four genera alpha covs hcov-nl63 hcov-229 beta covs hcov-oc43 sars-cov hcov-hku1 and mers-cov gamma covs and delta covs fehr and perlman 2015coronaviruses uses a very spiky-shaped protein s protein to infect a cell by binding to the membrane of the cell covid-19 sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share a receptor-binding unit whose domain structure is similar suggesting that covid-19 sars-cov-2 uses ace2 receptor in humans for infection yan et al 2020 the spike protein binds to this ace2 receptor on the host cell surface and gets pinched inside the host cell studies has been conducted which shows the role of an enzyme furin present in the host cells plays a crucial role in sars-cov-2 entry and can be a distinguishing feature defining the severity of sars-cov-2 since it is absent in sars-cov walls et al 2020 this enzyme activates sars-cov-2 whereas the sars-cov and mers-cov during entrance into the host cell do not encounter this activated site since furin is expressed in various human organs such as the lungs small intestine and liver the infection in human has been seen to be very vigorous and can be predicted to be potentially infecting multiple human organs this site could possibly affect the transmission as well as the stability of the virusas an antiviral mechanism antigen presenting cells apc are involve in the presentation of viral antigenic peptides in complexed with mhc major histocompatibility complex class i and class ii molecules to cd8 and cd4 t cells the selection of peptides and presentation technique of the host leads to a better understanding of cellular immunity and vaccine advancement during any viral infection dcs dendritic cells play a very important role as an apc dcs are a linkage between innate and adaptive immunity studies deciphering the mechanism of antigen presentation during sars-cov-2 infection is not studied well therefore the mechanism of antigen presentation can be understood based on the available data of predecessor strain infection sars-cov  mers-cov due to its analogy chen et al 2010 because dcs are found in the respiratory tract and react back whenever there is an inflammation response dcs are found to be a potential candidate in antigen presentation during sars infection and also in understanding the immunopathology of sars lau et al 2012during sars infection the upregulation of few chemokines such as ip-10 and mp1 is seen very significantly also few of the antiviral cytokines are found to be low in expression such as ifn-alpha ifn-beta and ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha and il-6 are found to be at moderate upregulation kuri and weber 2010 modulation of toll-like receptors from tlr-1 to tlr-10 was seen to be at the same level hence no modulation but chemokine receptors such as ccr5 ccr3 and ccr1 are found to be at significant level of upregulation law et al 2009 when similar type of study is conducted in patients infected with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov it has been observed that this virus infects dcs very prolifically by inducing higher expression of ifn-gamma and even cytokines and chemokine related with ifn-gamma are found to be at a higher level altogether antigen presentation in case of mers-cov-infected dendritic cells is seen to be significantly higher than in sars-cov-infected dendritic cellsin case of sars-cov the antigen presentation is done most importantly by mhc-i followed by mhc-ii wieczorek et al 2017 studies were done in human macrophages during sars-cov infection indicating an interesting observation that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infects human macrophages due to antibody enhancement ade mediated by igg however macrophages infected with sars-cov did not show productive viral replication yip et al 2014 mhc class ii and i are further analyzed for epitope mapping which is one of the key steps towards vaccine development and which is studied intensively in case of sars-cov-2 infection sarkar et al 2020 post mhc-i analysis it was observed that the protein sequence of covid-19 is introduced by alleles of hla-c rather than hla-a and hla-b prompetchara et al 2020 alleles of hla are studied in case of sars-cov infection and have been categorized into protection alleles hla-cw1502 hla-dr0301 and hla-a0201 and susceptible alleles hla-b0703 hla-cw0801 hla-dr b11202 and hla-b4601 wang et al 2011 in case of mers-cov infection molecules of mhc class ii hla-dqb1020 and hla-drb11101 are related with the susceptibility to infection fast and chen 2020 hajeer et al 2016 while analyzing the viral genome of covid-19 for epitope prediction around 405 t cell epitopes have been determined which exhibits effective affinity towards mhc class i and ii in addition two potent neutralizing epitopes b cell epitope based on spike s protein were found fast and chen 2020humoral immune response is an antibody-mediated immune response t helper cells assist b cells to differentiate into plasma cells which in return produces antibodies abs specific to a viral antigen ag in order to limit infection an antibody which is of neutralizing nature is efficient in fully blocking the virus from entering into host cells and hence plays a very intense protective role at a later stage of infection and also prevents relapse of infection in the future in case of sars-cov in order to enhance the humoral immune response both b and t cell epitopes are being studied extensively and mapped for their structural as well as the envelope protein s n m e channappanavar et al 2014 during the infection of sars-cov-2 it is studied and known that ace2 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the receptor present in the host cells and hence the site b cell epitope site wherein the ab-binding site is located is a critical feature to be studied for a valuable insight yu et al 2007 it has been observed that sars-cov and 2019-ncov spike proteins are similar in their major structural and t cell epitope kumar et al 2020in order to produce neutralizing abs both the proteins need to have b cell epitopes as their receptor binding domains rbd a very efficient t cell response has been found to be in relation with the production of higher neutralizing antibodies t cell epitopes do not require a specific location in contrast to b cell epitopes hence it is located anywhere in viral protein the helper t cell plays a role in isotype switching also and in case of sars-cov the antibody profile of this virus produces igm and igg and at a later phase sero-conversion has been observed which is mediated by the helper t cells li et al 2008 igm disappears at the end of week 12 whereas igg has been found to last for a longer time pointing out to the probability of igg being a potent protector ab during the infection li et al 2003 current evidence strongly indicates that th1 type response is key to the successful control of sars-cov and mers-cov and probably true for sars-cov-2 as well yong et al 2019cellular immune response is a mechanism of adaptive immunity cellular immunity in contrast to the humoral immune response can be seen inside the infected cells which is mediated by t-lymphocytes helper t cells direct the overall adaptive immune response while cytotoxic t cells play a vital role in clearance and killing of viral infected cells for any effective vaccine advancement cellular immunity provided by t cells is very much essential as shown by the mouse model experiment on mers-cov and sars-cov yong et al 2019 wherein their reports suggested that the lack of t cells resulted in no viral clearance in infected mice hence explaining the importance of t cells in viral infection lee et al 2012referring back to the case of infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus it is reported that cd4 tnf il-2 and ifn and cd8 tnf ifn memory t cells could persist in sars-cov-recovered patient for 4 years and can function by proliferating t cell producing ifn-gamma and by dth response kuri and weber 2010 when investigated 14 out of 23 sars-recovered patients post 6 years of infection it was reported that distinct t cell memory responded to the s library of peptide of sars-cov channappanavar et al 2014 similar findings of distinct cd8 t cells were seen during the case of mers-cov clearance in a mouse model too coleman et al 2016 hence this information can be useful in case of sars-cov-2 as well however in case of sars-cov-2 recent reports suggest that the pbmcs of sars-cov-2 infected individuals have shown efficient reduction in the cd8 and cd4 t cell counts which may results in compromised t memory cell generation and persistence in sars-cov-2 survivorscytokine storm syndrome is when there is a fatal blow up of cytokines due to over-reaction by the human bodys immune system in response to an intruder the lancet has published a report on cytokine storm syndrome as being one of the causes of covid-19 severity coleman et al 2016 this report is backed up by the data on one of the major factors of death due to sars-cov-2 infection which is acute respiratory distress syndrome ards ards has a significant relation with cytokine storm syndrome because during ards the immune effector cells have been shown to release huge amounts of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines which result in a fatal unconfined or uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response yao et al 2020 previous pandemics caused by coronaviruses such as mers-cov and sars-cov have also shown such a massive release of chemokines and cytokines in case of sars-cov ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 cxcl8 cxcl9 cxcl10 etc and il-12 il-18 il-6 il-1beta il-33 ifn-alpha ifn-gamma tnf- alpha  tgf-beta in case of mers-cov the elevation was seen in the levels of cytokines-ifn- il-6 and chemokine such as cxcl-10 ccl-5 and cxcl-8 zheng et al 2020ards due to cytokine storm triggers a damaging attack to the body by the immune system causing failure of multiple organs subsequently and leads to death as reported in the case of sars-cov-2 outbreak which was the same as the cases of sars-cov and mers-cov infection reported previously lately drugs targeting il-18 il-1 il-6 and interferon-gamma have been found effective in treating cytokine storm syndrome in other viral infections for the treatment and therefore may be used for the treatment of the covid-19 patients for reducing the severity cameron et al 2007 however one of such drugs falling under the same category which blocks il-6 has been reported to be efficient in a few cases of covid-19 in china mehta et al 2020human covs are the one of the most pathogenic viral infections that develops various immune evasion strategies studies have come up with reports supporting the fact that the family of covs are significantly able to suppress human immune responses by evading the immune detection mode smartly kikkert 2020 this immune evasion property might explain longer incubation period which is of 211 days moderately if not completely immune evasion helps them to efficiently dodge the detection by cellular prrs of host immune response at the initial phase of infection the three recent covs such as sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 share the same component of immune evasion method since all of them belong to the same genera betacoronavirus the strategy of how these covs evades and regulates human immune responses has been a highly talked studied and evaluated topic for a very long time several studies have been carried out on sars-cov and mers-cov which can also be referred in the case of sars-cov-2 during sars-cov infection the isolation of viral dsrna takes place inside the double membrane vesicles dmvs which is the probable shield of viral pamps from detection by cytosolic prrsin order to exist and expand inside a host with inbuilt strong antiviral ifn immune responses covs have been seen to employ different levels of strategies fig 51 against the innate immune responses especially type i ifn responses starting with the ifn signaling induction of ifn or antiviral action of isg products channappanavar et al 2016 in any viral infection interferons play the role of a very potent cytokine in order to control the infection this suggests that covs play its smart game by interfering with the core system of ifn or it can also do so by destroying the key regulators
to understand this strategy briefly both the covs sars-cov and mers-cov seem to be less generous regarding inducing ifn into most of the cell types this less or delayed induction of ifn activates the proinflammatory cytokines and macrophages into the lungs and hence results in leakage of vascular vessels and also impairs the adaptive immune responses channappanavar et al 2016 exceptional cell type wherein the ifn induction is at a relatively higher level is pdcs which have shown to be expressing increased levels of interferon alpha or beta ifn-alpha  -beta in case of disease caused by both mers-cov and sars-cov this occurs through tlr7 hence tlr-like pathway could be a candidate for more core studies in case of sars-cov totura et al 2015 in case of mers-cov the protein which inhibits ifn induction is seen to be orf4a which interacts with dsrna and the cofactor of rlr pactfrom ifn docking to isgf3 stat1stat2irf9 complex mediated upregulation of isgs sars-cov and mers-cov act by interfering with the signal transduction chain with the help of several proteins orf3a protein and orf6 protein are reported to decrease the ifnar levels by proteolytic degradation and ubiquitination and by disrupting stat1 nuclear import respectively kopecky-bromberg et al 2007 frieman et al 2007 the orf4a protein also inhibits ifn induction and hence moderates the isg expression the immune evasion strategy also evades adaptive immune responses during infection with sars-cov and mers-cov wherein t cell activation is diminished by downregulating antigen presentation by mhc i and ii moleculesthe emergence and outbreak caused by sars-cov-2 is determined by the disruption of the host immune system by the virus the virus strain has been observed to disturb the immune system by evasion of the immune response when a person is infected it is on the safer side to predict that coronaviruses having the biggest rna genome so far do not depend upon sole harmfulness factors however they utilize a few layers of hostile to ifn procedures such as factors which include the type of virus the titer of virus and the load of virus else they would not have the strategy to exist and even expand or mutate to a newer territory with strong antiviral ifn reactions host with just their genetic blueprint made available so far it has become difficult for all research groups to identify the potential molecular targets of the virus immunopathology studies of disease caused by sars-cov-2 are still being investigated globally however with reference to the studies done so far on its predecessor infection it can be concluded that few of the mechanisms which explain the severity of the disease caused by sars-cov-2 is the enzyme furin which is found at its activation site and the mechanism of cytokine storm and immune evasionthe authors are grateful to the vice chancellor king georges medical university kgmu lucknow india for encouraging this work the authors have no other relevant affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript apart from those disclosedviral interactions with the innate immune system play a central role in determining the outcome of infection early control of viral replication by type i interferons ifn complement proteins and other innate immune mediators limit viral spread within the host during the early phases of the disease katze et al 2002 the early innate response also plays an important role in shaping the downstream adaptive immune response however an overactive innate immune response can also result in immune pathology and subsequent tissue damage reviewed in garcia-sastre and biron 2006 within the last decade it is clear that many viruses encode specific gene products that antagonize both the innate and acquired arms of the immune response andrejeva et al 2004 basler et al 2000 cruz et al 2006 gale et al 1997 meylan et al 2005 parisien et al 2001 park et al 2003 symons et al 1995 xiang et al 2002 ye et al 2007 therefore a detailed knowledge of how specific viruses interact with the host innate immune system is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating virulence pathogenesis and disease outcomescoronavirus interactions with the adaptive immune system have been studied in great detail however surprisingly little is known about how these viruses interact with the innate immune system la bonnardiere and laude 1983 although early studies indicated that mutations in the m glycoprotein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev modulated type i ifn responses suggesting that coronaviruses may encode a novel set of gene functions that interface with the host innate immune response little effort focused on unraveling the details of coronavirus innate immune interactions charley and laude 1988 la bonnardiere and laude 1983 early experiments showed that variants of mouse hepatitis virus mhv are differentially susceptible to ifn this may contribute to different pathogenic outcomes however little additional experimentation was performed taguchi and siddell 1985 the sars coronavirus sars-cov epidemic of 2003 rekindled a high level of interest in how coronaviruses interact with the host and whether interactions with the host innate immune system are important in both the control of viral infection or if these interactions lead to virus-induced diseasein this article we will discuss two components of the innate immune response that are clearly important for sars-cov induced disease 1 interactions with macrophages mp and dendritic cells dc which shape the early innate and adaptive immune responses within the lung while also potentially contributing to virus-induced immune pathology and 2 the type i ifn system an essential component of the early innate response to viral infections that appears to be blocked or evaded by sars-cov and other coronavirusesdendritic cells and macrophages are first line components of the innate immune network dcs which can be grouped into plasmacytoid pdc and myeloid types mdc play important roles in driving both innate and adaptive immune responses to viral pathogens akira and hemmi 2003 ito et al 2005 nakano et al 2001 pdcs rapidly respond to viruses or their derivatives to produce large amounts of type i ifn which can induce direct antiviral responses and also modulate other components of the innate and adaptive immune response such as natural killer cells and cd8 t cells colonna et al 2004 diebold et al 2003 cella et al 1999 siegal et al 1999 though less robust than pdcs mdcs can also secrete large amounts of type i ifn laiosa et al 2006 however mdcs also play a major role in stimulating acquired immune responses through their capacity as antigen presenting cells and producers of a wide array of immuno-modulatory cytokines laiosa et al 2006 mps are potent producers of type i ifns and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that induce antiviral protection while also potentially contributing to immune pathology associated with viral infections diamond et al 2003 analysis of the impact of dcs and mps on sars-cov infection will be discussed belowsince its discovery 50 years ago by isaacs and lindemann the ifn system has come to be recognized as a crucial frontline defense against viral infection isaacs and lindenmann 1957 ifns mediate direct antiviral effects that limit viral replication by activatingup-regulating several well defined antiviral effectors including pkr and rnasel while also modulating other aspects of the innate and adaptive immune responses through the induction of a wide array of ifn inducible genes isgs stark et al 1998 takaoka and yanai 2006 the number of pathogens that neutralize ifn or other key components of the ifn system illustrate that this system is essential for the control of a diverse array of viruses and bacteria perhaps the clearest indicator of how important this pathway is to antiviral defense is the sheer number of ifn avoidanceantagonism strategies that viruses have evolved these viral ifn evasion strategies can be roughly segregated into three categories 1 avoidance where the virus shields itself or its byproducts from recognition by the host cell sensors that activate the ifn system cardenas et al 2006 2 suppression of ifn induction where the virus actively inhibits the host cell sensor machinery or its downstream signaling molecules to prevent the initiation of ifn transcription cardenas et al 2006 hiscott et al 2006a hiscott et al 2006b lin et al 2006 li et al 2005a li et al 2005b meylan et al 2005 or 3 suppression of ifn signaling where viral gene products block signaling events at or downstream of the type i ifn receptor complex to prevent activation of an antiviral state within the infected cell or the enhancement of the ifn response by activating late type i ifn genes parisien et al 2001 rodriguez et al 2002 this raises the question of how coronaviruses which include human sars-cov nl63 oc43 and 229e and animal mhv infectious bronchitis virus ibv tgev etc strains interact with the type i ifn system of these viruses only 229e has been shown to induce ifn in infected cells in culture while viruses such as sars-cov and mhv fail to induce type i ifn responses in cell culture however the mechanism for how coronaviruses evade the innate immune system is largely unexploredthere are two major pathways through which cells sense invading viruses and activate the ifn pathway reviewed in sen 2001 toll like receptors tlrs which include tlr3 tlr7 tlr8 and tlr9 can detect viruses in endosomal compartments as they enter cells while cytoplasmic card domain containing rna helicases rig-i and mda5 sense viral rna in the cytoplasm both pathways are based on sensor interactions with pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps such as double stranded rna which is a byproduct of viral replication or structured single stranded rnas associated with incoming viral genomes being common targets the tlr and cytoplasmic ifn induction pathways do utilize different adaptor proteins to mediate signaling with the tlr dependent pathways utilizing trif andor myd88 and the cytoplasmic induction pathway utilizing the mitochondrial adaptor protein mavsips-1visacardif fig 1
 downstream of the differing adapters both pathways share many common signaling molecules and transcription factors with both pathways ultimately activating irf-3 nfb and ap-1 to initiate type i ifn gene transcription each of these pathways will be discussed further with respect to its potential role in coronavirus infection table 1
the human impact of the sars-cov epidemic in 2003 led to an intensive research effort to understand the pathogenesis of sars-cov induced disease much of this effort focused on interactions between the virus and immune response within the lung this effort will be broken down into patient studies which are informative but by their very nature complex studies in animal models and cell culture based analysis of viral interactions with primary cells or cell lines which provide greater experimental control at the cost of potentially oversimplifying the systemseveral groups analyzed the serum of sars-cov infected patients to determine which classes of cytokines were up-regulated during infection jiang et al 2005 yu et al 2005 zhang et al found that il-6 was up-regulated in serum while il-8 and tgf-beta were decreased in sars patients they also found that ifn il-4 and il-10 were increased only in convalescent sars patients zhang et al 2004 reghunathan et al found that ip-10 was induced in sars-cov infected patients and there was a correlation between high ip-10 levels and poor patient outcome reghunathan et al 2005 the authors also found that il-6 il-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were highly induced in super-infected patients with high levels indicative of a high risk of death additionally microarray-based analysis of rna derived from pbmcs from 10 sars-cov infected patients demonstrated that the cells were highly activated and expressing high levels of inflammatory cytokines however no ifn or  induction was detected in these patients though these studies provide valuable information on the kinetics and type of host cytokine response that occurs in infected humans during sars-cov infection drawing general conclusions from these studies is difficult due to differences in both the timing of study the patient population analyzed and the types of assays used to evaluate cytokine responsesseveral experiments were performed on lung tissue from fatal sars cases most reports used only a single or a few patients with different times of death whether it was from acute disease or a secondary infection trying to compare their study to a control patient chen et al identified carbon containing mps while to et al found only infection of epithelial cells by in situ and immunofluorescence chen and hsiao 2004 another publication by chow et al identifies lung pneumocytes but not mps as the site of virus replication while yet another identifies a different lymphocyte population as the main replication target chow et al 2004 each of these differs in the type and length of time of infection of tissues used the fixation technique for tissue preservation the type of probe and the technique used to identify viral proteins and rna a recent paper by nicholls et al attempts to combine a large set of patient samples using immunohistochemistry in situ hybridization and rt-pcr to build a comprehensive picture of the infection cycle nicholls et al 2006 they also comment on how false positive or negatives can arise for several reasons including 1 not all lung tissue is homogenous so using tissue from one part of the lung versus another can critically change your interpretation 2 different probes and techniques have varying levels of sensitivity depending on the age of the tissue and how it was handled 3 the age of the individual will alter the immune response and clearance time of infection 4 the overall immune status of the individual at the time of infection immuno-compromised versus healthy would impact on both the overall levels of viral replication and the subsequent host inflammatory response to the virus and 5 the timeframe from initial symptoms to death may differ significantly between individuals with individuals that rapidly progress showing higher levels of virus at the time of death while individuals that succumb to infection after an extended period may have little virus present and die due to secondary causes based on their analysis of this large set of patient samples nicholls et al concluded that alveolar epithelium and mps are the primary targets of sars-cov in the lung they also suggest that pneumocytes may be the initial site of infection but that mps take up virions and disseminate the virus within the lungs interestingly in the 25 patients they tested that died within 2 weeks of symptoms no virus was detected by in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry even in tissues with clear damage this suggests that viral replication may not be directly responsible for death in these individuals raising the possibility that virus-induced immune pathology may contribute to sars-cov induced disease in fact since high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines correlate with poor sars-cov outcome reghunathan et al 2005 zhang et al 2004 it is possible that sars-cov infection of mps or other potent producers of pro-inflammatory cytokines without high levels of viral replication may ultimately lead to virus-induced immune pathology within the lungs of patients with poor disease outcomesgiven their role in maintaining homeostasis within the lungs as well as their ability to mount robust innate immune responses it is important to consider the role of mps and dcs during sars-cov infection several conflicting reports of sars-cov replication and ifn induction in mps and dcs have been published over the last few years early reports showed that sars-cov did not replicate efficiently in purified monocytes and mps yilla et al 2005 the infection however was donor dependent with 100 infection in some donors and less than 5 infection efficiency in others this study also showed that there was a correlation between the donor cells that produced high amounts of ifn in response to sars-cov also being less permissive for productive infection however this is not the case for all their donors with some producing high levels of ifn and being infected while other produce low levels of ifn and were not infected castilletti et al also found ifn and  induced from pbmcs infected with sars-cov with the most robust responses occurring when the pbmcs were exposed to fixed sars-cov infected vero cells castilletti et al 2005 these results suggest that pbmcs are poorly permissive for sars-cov and the authors propose that pbmcs may be able to detect viral glycoproteins on the surface of cells and that this may be a mechanism for the apparent immuno-pathology seen in sars patients lungs results from spiegel et al also demonstrated that both live and uv inactivated sars-cov could induce type i ifn responses and cellular maturation in dc cultures spiegel et al 2006 suggesting that productive viral replication is not required to active anti-viral andor pro-inflammatory responses in these cellssimilarly law et al find no replication in their isolated dcs but did find a different cytokine induction profile law et al 2005 the authors infected dcs with sars-cov and analyzed the effects on cell surface markers and maturation by electron microscopy virions are seen inside both immature and mature dcs and small amounts of negative strand rna were detectable in those cells suggesting that some level of viral gene expression was occurring however the level of rna decreased over the course of several days indicating that there was no productive replication these studies found no evidence of apoptosis or antiviral cytokines such as ifn   and il-12 however they did find significant up-regulation of ip-10 mip1 rantes and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 the differences in cytokine profiles between the castilleti and law studies may reflect infection of different cell types however both groups suggest that the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory chemokines may recruit monocytic cells to sites of infection and be a major cause of lung pathology in patientsseveral other groups have also evaluated whether mps andor dcs are targets of sars-cov infection and whether this infection leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokine responses that might contribute to virus-induced immune pathology within the lung tseng et al characterized the effect of sars-cov infection on human mps and dcs tseng et al 2005 they find that neither cell is permissive to sars-cov replication which is consistent with the results described above as well as studies by ziegler et al 2005 in the studies by tseng et al the mps and dcs were phenotypically altered after sars-cov exposure they found no increase of cell death but exposure increases the production of il-6 and il-12 upon exposure to a suboptimal dose of lipopolysaccharide lps indicating that sars primes the cells to respond to tlr ligands but did not directly activate the cells they also demonstrated that sars-cov decreased the phagocytic activity of mps to fitc-dextran while at the same time increasing the ability of dcs to stimulate nave t cellsoverall these studies suggest that neither mps nor dcs are highly permissive for sars-cov replication while some groups did not see sars-cov associated inflammatory cytokine induction in mps or dcs the overall consensus from this work is that sars-cov infection can lead to either the direct activation or the priming of pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in these cell types which may ultimately contribute to the development of virus-induced immune pathology within the lungs the effect of viral infection on the induction of antiviral type i ifn responses in these cell types is less clear cut since type i ifn induction has been observed by some groups and not others this difference may reflect sensitivity differences in their assays the cell types that are being evaluated or even genetic differences in their donor cohorts therefore further work is needed to determine whether or not sars-cov is an activator of antiviral responses in these cellstype i ifn induction has been observed in some studies of sars-cov infected mps and dcs castilletti et al 2005 these cell types are capable of mounting type i ifn responses in the absence of active viral replication it is unclear whether cells that are productively infected with sars-cov can mount type i ifn responses and by extension whether sars-cov actively blocks type i ifn induction or signaling yen et al 2006 the cell line used for most virus growth experiments and protein analysis is veroe6 which lacks a functional ifn gene other cell lines have been used to identify the ifn pathways induced during sars-cov infection such as ma104 and caco2 cells which are highly permissive for infection 90 infected yields 107
 pfuml and 293 cells which are semi-permissive at best 510 infected yields of 1045
 pfuml several laboratories have been using these cell lines to identify which if any cytokines and chemokines are induced during infectionwe have analyzed the type i ifn response in several cell lines to investigate whether ifn was induced by sars-cov infection we transfected 293t cells with a plasmid containing the ifn promoter followed by luciferase we found that ifn promoter activity was not induced during the course of an infection from as early as 6 h to 48 h post infection fig 2
 during this time frame sendai virus sev infected cells induced large amounts of ifn promoter activity we also tested whether ma104 cells african green monkey kidney cells that have an intact ifn system secrete ifn when infected with sars-cov we find no type i ifn to be secreted from either urbani infected or tor2 infected cells fig 3
 as a control piv infected ma104 cells produced large amounts of type i ifn over the course of the infectioncinatl jr et al compared intestinal cell lines caco2 and cl-14 for their cytokine profile via microarray analysis cinatl et al 2004 they find the sars-cov replicates to very high titer 108
 tcid50ml and infected cells show cytopathic effect cpe commensurate with virus titer microarray analysis was performed on cells at a single 24 h time point post infection they find no change in ifn and  but an up-regulation of cxc chemokines oas2 and mx interestingly there was no difference in the double stranded rna activated protein kinase pkr il-18 and mp migration inhibitory factor mif are down-regulated they extend this correlation to data seen in some patient samples where they find an up-regulation of ip-10 and il-8 spiegel et al also used caco2 as well as 293 cells to characterize the innate immune response to sars infection comparing the effects of virus on permissive caco2 and less permissive cells 293t cells spiegel et al 2006 although sars-cov infection did not induce ifns antiviral genes or il-6 ip-10 and il-8 were induced in the permissive caco2 cells but not 293 cells they conclude that early virus growth is probably able to expand rapidly while suppressing anti-viral genes but still secreting ip-10 and il-8 to recruit immune cellstang et al used a human hepatoma cell line huh7 for comparative infection of the coronaviruses sars and 229e tang et al 2005 using an moi of 100 tcid50 units gene expression profiles were compared at 2 and 4 h post infection very early times in the lifecycle of sars-cov at these early timepoints il-8 expression levels were increased while neither ip-10 nor ifn were significantly up-regulated importantly huh7 cells have been shown to be deficient in some antiviral responses which are in conflict with these findings lanford et al 2003 this likely suggests that huh7 cells are defective for the double stranded rna sensing response consisting of rigi and mda5 which would hamper the useful interpretation of these resultsin contrast to the results obtained in the studies by tang speigel and cinatl which suggest that sars-cov is a poor inducer of type i ifn responses in productively infected cells okabayashi okabayashi et al 2006 found that sars-cov infection of caco2 cells led to high levels of ifn l irf-7 oas isg20 and mx transcripts at 12 days post infection using real-time pcr they also reported significant inductions of il-8 il-6 socs3 and tlrs 4 7 and 9 transcripts the discrepancy between these different studies might reflect differences in timing assay sensitivity or even different passage histories of the cell types in question however with the exception of the results from okabayashi most reports argue that sars-cov is a poor inducer of type i ifn in productively infected cells we cannot reproduce the results reported by okabayashi et al as sars-cov infection in caco2 and 293 cells did not induce expression of ifn ifn nfb or p56 fig 4
 however in infected cultures we also reproduce the noted induction of ip-10 in both cell lines supporting reports by speigel et al at this time the preponderance of data argue that sars-cov infection does not induce type i ifns following productive infection in cell culturesars-cov generally does not induce type i ifn in productively infected cells in culture which suggests that the virus either suppresses or avoids the induction of type i ifn in light of these possibilities we will discuss the coronavirus replication cycle and then identify several specific stages where the virus or its derivatives might activate the type i ifn system since specific interactions between coronaviruses and the type i ifn system are poorly understood much of this discussion will be based on known mechanisms employed by other virusesthe sars-cov is a single-stranded positive polarity enveloped virus the genome is approximately 297 kb long and is associated with the nucleocapsid n protein forming a ribonucleoprotein rnp helical n the rnp is surrounded by a lipid envelope derived from internal cellular membranes of the host cell the envelope possesses three major envelope proteins the s glycoprotein responsible for the receptor recognition and fusion and the small envelope protein e and the m glycoprotein which are involved in viral budding and release marra et al 2003 rota et al 2003 fig 5
 minor virion components include orf7a orf7b orf6 and orf3a but these are not essential huang et al 2006 huang et al 2007 schaecher et al 2007 shen et al 2005 the replicase orf 1a and orf 1b encode critical functions for virus replication and likely encode important virulence determinants eckerle et al 2006 sperry et al 2005during the coronavirus life cycle fig 6
 there are several steps where cellular proteins could detect viral components weiss and navas-martin 2005 coronavirus entry is thought to be a three stage process including binding of s glycoprotein to the angiotensin i converting enzyme ace2 protein cleavage by cathepsin l and activation of a fusion peptide in s2 that mediates entry via fusion through endocytic compartments simmons et al 2005 fusion which for sars happens in an endosomal type structure after cathepsin l cleaves the viral s glycoprotein viral rna which is tightly bound by the n is released into the cytoplasm of the cell following viral genome release into the cytosol the genome is translated into the viral replicase proteins orf1a and 1b these polyproteins are then cleaved by two proteases a papain like protease plp and the main protease mpro into the individual proteins necessary for replication the incoming genomic rna then serves as a template for the synthesis of full length and subgenomic length negative strand rnas that serves as template for mrna synthesis subgenomic rna synthesis occurs from discontinuous transcription that joins leader rna sequences encoded at the 5 end of the genome to the body sequences of each subgenomic rna the model of transcription attenuation argues that the replicase binds to the 3 end of the genomic rna transcribes incomplete negative strands that terminate in highly conserved transcription regulatory sequences trs defined by the sequence acgaac dissociates and re-associates with the full length template near the 5 end of the genome to prime transcription of subgenomic negative strand rnas containing anti-leader rna sequences the eight different subgenomic negative strands serve as template for the synthesis of like sized subgenomic mrna brian and baric 2005 replicase structural and accessory proteins are produced during this phase of replication at which time the structural proteins m and e localize to the golgi apparatus and transverse to a ergolgi intermediate compartment ergic where budding occurs also during this phase accessory proteins are produced that localize throughout the cellduring virus production replicase proteins have been shown to localize to double membrane vesicles in the cell that are induced during viral replication in both mhv and sars-cov brockway et al 2003 goldsmith et al 2004 gosert et al 2002 snijder et al 2006 van der meer et al 1999 the membranes of which are the site of replication and viral assembly how the structural e m and s proteins re-localize to these structures is unknown it has recently been shown that sars-cov e and m proteins do not re-localize to the double membrane structures while for mhv they do snijder et al 2006 whether this difference is cell specific virus specific or experimentally specific is unknown also whether the replicase proteins are functioning on the inside of the vesicles or in the cytoplasm is unclearonce assembly occurs the virus is secreted using the secretory apparatus of the cell however whether coronaviruses pass through the golgi stacks or use specialized vesicular routes is unknown once at the cell membrane the vesicles carrying the virions fuse with the cell surface and release mature virus into the extracellular spaceduring the replication of coronaviruses many sentinel sites in the cells antiviral machinery are potentially impacted yet with the exception of 229e the majority of coronaviruses that have been evaluated fail to induce type i ifn responses pitkaranta and hovi 1993 though the specific mechanisms underlying this immune evasion are not well understood some potential mechanisms will be discussed belowduring entry the fusion of the virion either at the membrane or in a vacuole releases genomic rna into the cytoplasm endosome associated tlrs such as tlr3 or tlr7 may detect sars-cov genomic rna during entry alternatively the cytoplasmic rna sensors rig-i and mda5 might detect the rna as it enters into the cytoplasm however a specific role for tlrs or rig-imda5 in detecting coronaviruses has not been reported yet several virus families encode products that antagonize signaling at this level kash et al 2006 zhou et al 2005 coronaviruses may also encode proteins which block the viral rna signaling and sensing pathways although specific mechanisms have not been elucidated it is possible that the viral genome is sequestered perhaps by the viral n protein in such a way that the viral rna is shielded from host sensor proteins other viral proteins such as ns1 of influenza and vp35 of ebola virus have been shown to block type i ifn induction by interfering with the ability of host sensor proteins irf-3 stat1 rigi mda5 to detect incoming virus hartman et al 2004 kash et al 2006for many coronaviruses there is no known mechanism of how they evade the host innate immune system it is hypothesized that it is by either 1 actively producing ifn antagonist proteins 2 using their own replicase proteins to modify host proteins or by 3 the formation of double membrane vesicles and compartmentalizing replication and perhaps other coronavirus rnas the use of double membrane vesicles could hide the rnas produced by protecting them from the rna sensing machinery there may also be a role for n in shielding the viral rnas from the dsrna and ssrna sensing pathways many of these possibilities are being actively investigatedin addition to simply avoiding the activation of type i ifn responses by either masking the viral rna or sequestering the viral replication complexes into specialized compartments it is possible that sars-cov or other coronaviruses actively inhibit type i ifn induction or signaling speigel et al demonstrated that sars-cov infection failed to activate ifn promoter activity but that irf-3 was translocated to the nucleus in sars-cov infected cells spiegel et al 2005 however sars-cov infection interfered with irf-3 hyper-phosphorylation dimer formation and interactions with its essential co-factor chromatin binding protein cbp the role for a specific viral gene or genes in mediating this antagonism has not been described and needs to be evaluated in further detailto investigate this concept further two recent papers have shown that mhv and sars do not block the irf-3 signaling pathway in infected cells zhou et al demonstrated that although mhv does not induce nuclear translocation of irf-3 or ifn gene induction it does not block these pathways either zhou and perlman 2007 subsequent treatment of cells with poly-ic or sendai virus post infection allows for proper nuclear import of irf-3 and induction of ifn mrna they also show that rigi mda5 and tlr3 are also not inhibited by mhv infection similar results were shown by versteed et al for mhv and sars-cov versteeg et al 2007 they also show that mhv does not induce irf-3 nuclear translocation and ifn gene induction but that each of these is activated when cells are treated with poly-ic or sendai virus in addition they show that sars acts the same way in culture it does not induce the ifn sensing pathway but does not block the pathways either each hypothesizes that there may protection via compartmentalization of the replication complexes and replication rna in the cell that protects it from being sensed by the anti-viral machinery versteeg et al also proposes that since the 5 end of sars rna is capped it is protected from recognition by rigi since it was recently shown that rigi specifically binds to free phosphates at the 5 end of the rna hornung et al 2006 pichlmair et al 2006 this may be another level of protection sars-cov uses to block its sensing from the cellular anti-viral machinerywe have shown similar data for sars infections in vitro we find that sars infection does not induce ifn or nfb gene induction however they do not block those pathways either fig 7a and b promoters of ifn and nfb were assayed for their ability to drive luciferase expression after infection by sars wild-type sars infection of cells does not activate the induction of the either of the promoters however each could be activated post infection by poly-ic data not shown exogenous ifn data not shown or sendai virus fig 7a and b similar to zhou et al and versteed et al we created recombinant sars viruses deleted for each of the sars accessory orfs orf3a 3b 3ab 3ab6 6 7a 7b 8b and 9b we hypothesized a sars-cov accessory orf may be mediating the ifn sensing block in vivo however we find that similar to wildtype sars-cov all the deletions fail to induce any of the promoters analyzed above all of the deletions also allowed for induction post infection by sendai virus and poly-ic of the ifn nfb and p56 promoters assayed our data combined with zhou et al and versteeg et al lead us to hypothesize that there is a mechanism by which mhv and sars-cov evade detection of by innate immune system by 1 sequestering the viral genome on membranous replication complexes 2 capping viral rna to evade detection by one arm of the dsrna sensing machinery and 3 potentially actively inhibiting the innate immune system by the function of virally encoded proteins one caveat to this work is that sars-cov could be inhibiting ifn signaling pathways that are detrimental to its own replication and survival but not inhibiting different pathways inducible by sev and poly-ic in vivo experiments where putative viral antagonists are debilitated or where replication complexes are retargeted to new sites eg autophagy mutants that do not produce double membrane vescicles may provide insight into which of these hypotheses are most likelyrecent work by kopecky-bromberg et al has identified three sars proteins orf3b orf6 and the n protein that interact with the different elements of the ifn sensing machinery and may add another layer of protection from the innate immune system kopecky-bromberg et al 2007 when expressed in 293 cells from a plasmid each viral orf not only blocked expression from an ifn and irf-3 promoter reporter plasmid but also blocked irf-3 phosphorylation n expression blocked nfb promoter induction while orf3b and 6 did not demonstrating an interesting difference in their ifn blocking mechanism one other distinction between the three genes is that all three blocked expression from an isre promoter reporter construct when the cells were stimulated with sendai virus but only 3b and 6 blocked induction of the isre reporter when the cells were treated with ifn shown in fig 8a orf6 expressed in 293 cells blocked induction of an isre promoter expressing luciferase in response to ifn treatment these data suggested a direct block of the ifn amplification side of the innate immune pathway from the ifn receptor to stat1 nuclear translocation to induction of stat1 transcribed genes assayed by the isre promoter construct orf6 expression does not effect stat1 phosphorylation but orf6 blocked nuclear localization of stat1 after the cells were treated with ifn fig 8b and c this data shows that each of the 3 genes blocks ifn sensing and signaling in a different way enabling a reduction in the anti-viral induction pathways from several different pathwaysa report from cervantes-barragan et al may also connect the differences seen in cell lines versus in vivo experiments cervantes-barragan et al 2007 they have found that there is a rapid induction of type i ifns upon mhv infection of pdcs compared to cdcs that coincided with a block in virus replication they also show that sars-cov reacts similarly as mhv to different types of dcs cdc versus pdc they identify a potential mediator of the ifn induction as well they find that tlr7 seems to be key to the rapid induction seen in pdcs since tlr7 pdcs could produce ifn in response to cpg dna and not mhv this result shows that tlr7 is not needed for cpg dna induced ifn induction but the lack of tlr7 inhibited the induction of ifn by mhv tlr7 may be sensing the mhv virion or replication products to activate the ifn response in cellsmany issues remain unanswered concerning how coronaviruses evade the immune response during infection with the technology of reverse genetic systems for mhv sars-cov hcv 229e and tgev specific mutations can be made in the viruses to assess individual proteins role in immune evasion and pathogenesis the continued identification of proteins in the signaling pathways described above only adds to the abundance of potential host proteins that may be targeted by viral proteins additionally increased knowledge of pathway inter-regulation and proteinprotein interaction networks expand the possible ways that viral pathogens modulate the host response to infection with these new tools we will be able to gain insight into the critical questions1which host sensor proteins recognize sars-cov genomic rna or mrna or viral dsrna2how do coronaviruses protect their rna from rna sensing enzymes in the cell does compartmentalization of the replication process keeps the viral rna in double membrane vesicles and away from the sensing machinery of the host or does an active process of antagonism block sensing of incoming viral genomes do these key viral mediators function as virulence alleles and influence disease outcomes3although coronavirus replicase proteins are highly conserved the accessory proteins are heterogeneous has each virus evolved a different set of ifn antagonizing proteins or are there common mechanisms and proteins that functions as an antagonist during coronavirus infection how many viral antagonist of type i ifn are encoded in the coronavirus genome are they species specific what is their role in pathogenesis4why is 229e unique in its induction of ifn in culture while the other coronaviruses do not does the availability of specific innate immune antagonists modulate the pathogenesis of other human coronaviruses like nl63 and hku15does sars-cov or other covs induce ifn in monocyte derived cells in a host in vitro the results are quite different depending on the cell type origin and preparation what happens in vivo6are coronaviruses killed in mps when they are engulfed during infection many sars-cov infected lungs show mps containing sars-cov particles is this a mechanism for clearance of the virus or is sars using the mp to evade the immune system and carry the virus deeper into the lung tissue do coronaviruses have ways of evading death induced by the mp are innate immune responses blocked in during replication in the lung7are viral proteins acting as intracellular or extracellular ifn antagonists during infection and what stages in the pathways are targeted for inactivation8how does aging impact the innate immunity response and contribute to the increased pathogenesis noted in elderly patients following sars-cov infection
it is anticipated that the interactions of coronavirus genomes and gene products with the host innate immune system will provide a robust research agenda over the next several years yielding critical information that should elucidate many molecular mechanisms that contribute to coronavirus virulence and pathogenesis in human and animal hostsa new disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome sars originated in china in late 2002 and spread rapidly to many countries upon this outbreak a global collaboration network was coordinated by who as a result of this unprecedented international effort a novel type of coronavirus sars-cov was identified as the etiologic agent of sars 12 in march 2003 the genomic sequence of sars-cov was completed and we now know that sars-cov has all the features and characteristics of other coronaviruses but it is quite different from all previously known coronaviruses groups iiii representing a new group group iv 34 it is assumed that sars-cov is a mutant coronavirus transmitted from a wild animal that developed the ability to productively infect humans 35 the genome of sars-cov is a single-stranded plus-sense rna 30 kb in length and containing five major open reading frames that encode non-structural replicase polyproteins and structural proteins the spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid protein n in the same order and of approximately the same sizes as those of other coronaviruses 5the reason why sars-cov induces severe respiratory distress in some but not all infected individuals is still unclear in patients with sars and probable sars cases virus is detected in sputum stool and plasma by rtpcr 12 these patients developed serum antibodies against sars-cov and high antibody titers against n protein were maintained for more than 5 months after infection 6 because of their generally poor pathogenicity and difficulty of propagation in vitro there have been few studies regarding immunity to human coronaviruses oc43 and 229e in the veterinary field however coronaviruses have been known for many years to cause a variety of lung liver and gut diseases in animals as we learned from these animal models both humoral and cellular immune responses may contribute to protection against coronavirus diseases including sars for review see 7the clinical manifestation of sars is hardly distinct from other common respiratory viral infections including influenza because an influenza epidemic may occur simultaneously with the re-emergence of sars it is urgently required that we develop effective sars vaccines as well as sensitive diagnostic tests specific for sars recently the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 was identified as a cellular receptor for sars-cov 8 the first step in viral infection is presumably the binding of s protein to its receptor ace2 in the murine mhv model s proteins are known to contain important virus-neutralizing epitopes that elicit neutralizing antibodies in mice 910 therefore the s protein would be the first candidate coronavirus protein for induction of immunity however the s m and n proteins are also known to contribute to generating the host immune response 1112following an established vaccine protocol is one of the best ways to shorten the time and cost of new vaccine development most of the currently available vaccines for humans are inactivated and applied cutaneously except oral polio vaccine and adjuvant usage is mostly limited to aluminum hydroxide gel alum in order to know the immunogenicity of inactivated sars-cov as a vaccine candidate we immunized mice with uv-inactivated sars-cov either with or without alum we report here the evaluation of humoral and cellular immunity elicited by uv-inactivated sars-cov administered subcutaneouslysars-cov hku39849 was kindly supplied by dr jsm peiris department of microbiology the university of hong kong the virus was amplified in vero e6 cells and purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation concentrated virus was then exposed to uv light 475 jcm2 in order to inactivate the virus we confirmed that the virus completely lost its infectivity by this methodfemale balbc mice were purchased from nippon slc inc shizuoka japan and were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions all experimental procedures were carried out under niid-recommended guidelines mice were subcutaneously injected via their back or right and left hind leg footpads with 10 g of uv-inactivated purified sars-cov with or without 2 mg of alum and boosted by the same

packard instruments meriden ct incorporated radioactivity was counted by a microplate scintillation counter packard instrumentsto examine the level of anti-sars-cov response in mice after inoculation with vaccine candidates three mice in each group were subcutaneously inoculated with 10 g of uv-inactivated purified sars-cov with virionalum or without alum virion or inoculated with alum alone alum or left untreated none as a control fig 1 one month after inoculation vaccinated mice elicited the anti-sars cov igg antibody in sera at high levels as expected the alum adjuvant enhanced the level of igg antibody response 10-fold higher than the level without adjuvant fig 1c compared with b when mice were boosted at 7 weeks the level of igg antibody in both groups of mice was further increased 10-fold above the primary response fig 1b and c notably the level of serum antibodies induced by a single injection of virion even in the absence of the alum adjuvant was maintained at least more than 6 months fig 1d these results suggest that long-term ascs can be established by a single shot of uv-inactivated virion administrationupon restimulation with antigen memory b cells rapidly differentiate into ascs and migrate into the bone marrow to establish a long-term asc pool 1516 to enumerate the number of plasma cells specific for sars-cov we performed an elispot assay using recombinant n proteins amino acid numbers 149 n149 and 340390 n340390 as coating antigens consistent with the serum anti-sars cov igg level sars-specific igg1 plasma cells were maintained in the bone marrow at day 10 after boost immunization with virionalum fig 2 in contrast the number of spots from control mice was below the detection limit ie 1 asc9  105 cellswe determined the subclass of serum anti-sars-cov igg antibodies in the boosted mice using anti-mouse igg1 igg2a igg2b or igg3 second antibody by elisa fig 3 interestingly the level of anti-sars-cov igg2a in mice immunized with virionalum was comparable to that in mice immunized with virion alone whereas the level of anti-sars-cov igg1 was higher in mice with virionalum than the mice with virion alone in contrast the levels of igg2b and igg3 antibodies were fairly low in both groups therefore our results indicated that vaccination with a combination of inactivated virion and alum induced a predominantly th2-type immune responsewe also measured serum immunoglobulins other than igg in the early and late phases of immunization to avoid high igg concentrations interfering with the detection of igm and iga antibodies the serum igg was absorbed with protein g-conjugated beads 98 the levels of anti-sars-cov igm antibodies in the igg-depleted sera which were obtained 4 weeks after priming were below our detection limit likewise anti-sars-cov iga antibody in the igg-depleted sera which were obtained 1 week after booster was not detectable data not shownwhether or not immune sera possess a neutralizing activity against sars-cov is a crucial aspect of vaccination we estimated the neutralizing activity of sera obtained 1 week after boost inoculation table 1 we observed that neutralizing activity against sars-cov was detected at a high level in sera of mice inoculated with virionalum or virion alone taken together these results indicate that subcutaneous vaccination with uv-inactivated sars-cov virion is able to elicit a sufficient amount of igg antibodies with neutralizing activityusing the immune sera of mice boosted with virionalum 1 week before we analyzed the specificity of serum igg by western blot analysis see methods as shown in fig 4a the robust signal detected at 50 kda corresponds to the n protein of sars-cov as predicted by its genome size 34 a band near 200 kda appears to correspond to s protein analogous with the s protein of other human coronaviruses hcv-229e and hcv-oc43 which are known to be heavily glycosylated and detected at 186 kda and 190 kda respectively 17 our result is consistent with the data reported recently by xiao et al who expressed the full-length s glycoprotein of sars-cov tor2 strain in 293 cells and showed that the protein ran 180200 kda in sds gels 18 the origins of the 120 kda and the faint 37 kda bands were unknown however similar bands were also detected on a fluorogram by using anti-n mabs ohnishi k sakaguchi m takasuka n et al unpublished data suggesting that it is related to n protein the specificity of igg in the immune sera was also determined by elisa plates coated with lysates of cells infected with either s- or n-expressing recombinant vaccinia viruses fig 4b the results indicated that anti-s as well as anti-n protein igg antibodies were elicited by virionalum vaccinationto examine whether or not subcutaneously vaccinated mice gained an induced t-cell response against sars-cov mice were immunized either with virionalum virion or alum only via the footpad t cells of these mice were enriched from the spleen and regional lymph nodes 1 week after a booster immunization and cultured with irradiated apcs in the presence or absence of uv-inactivated sars-cov virion at 1 or 10 gml as shown in fig 5a regional lymph node t cells proliferated in vitro in response to uv-inactivated virion in virionalum-immunized mice and to a lesser extent in virion-immunized mice because mice inoculated with virionalum showed a high basal level of proliferation of lymph node t cells in the absence of antigen there is not much difference in the net proliferative response of these cells between the virionalum group and the virion only group on the other hand in splenic t cells a low level of proliferation was observed only in the virionalum group of mice the level of proliferation of these t cells however was virion-dose independent therefore our results suggest that the subcutaneous injection of inactivated virion even without alum does induce t cell activation to some extent in the draining lymph node a result which hardly occurs systemicallywe also measured the level of cytokine production in the supernatant of lymph node t cells stimulated with inactivated virion in vitro for 4 days we found that the inactivated virion induced the production of all the cytokines il-2 il-4 il-5 ifn- and tnf- in t cells of virionalum-immunized mice in a dose-dependent manner fig 5b likewise t cells of virion-immunized mice produced low yet significant levels of these cytokines in a dose-dependent manner except il-5 in contrast lymph node t cells from normal mice did not produce any cytokines at all in response to virion suggesting that the virion itself does not possess innate stimulating activity as bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide lps and purified protein derivative of mycobacterium tuberculosis ppd do taken together these results suggest that subcutaneous vaccination with uv-inactivated sars-cov is able to activate cd4 t cells in regional lymph nodes where t cells produce several immunoregulatory cytokines including ifn-the present results demonstrated that even a single subcutaneous administration of uv-irradiated virion without alum adjuvant induced a high level of systemic anti-sars-cov antibody response in mice probably followed by the generation of long-term antibody-secreting cells and memory cells in the bone marrow considering that polyvalent particulate structures such as hepatitis b virus surface antigen-based hiv-1 gag-based and ty virus-like particles have been shown to elicit humoral as well as cellular immune responses 19 these particulates probably have comparable dimensions and structures to the pathogens that are targeted for uptake by apcs to facilitate the induction of potent immune responses the antibodies elicited in mice vaccinated by the current protocol with or without adjuvant recognized both the s and n proteins of sars-cov and were able to neutralize the infection of virus to vero e6 cells however serum anti-sars-cov iga antibody was not detectable probably owing to the route of vaccination in addition the present vaccination protocol caused t cell response at the regional lymph nodes although it did not allow for the induction of a sufficient cellular immune response systemicallywe show here the potentiality of subcutaneous injection of inactivated virion with alum which is utilized for most of current human vaccinations alum has been used as an adjuvant for vaccines such as diphtheria pertussis and tetanus and these vaccines have a long safety record for human use 20 we observed that the addition of alum to the vaccine formula resulted in a large augmentation of serum igg1 production but not igg2a production the level of igg1 in alum-vaccinated mice reached a level similar to that found in hyper-immunized mice which were subcutaneously injected with 5 g of inactivated virion emulsified with a complete freund adjuvant followed by consecutive three-times intravenous boosters with 2 g of virion alum is known to selectively stimulate an igg1 dominant type 2 immune response reviewed in 21 activation of complement by alum could contribute to the type 2-biased immune response partly via an inhibition of il-12 production interestingly a quite recent report demonstrated that an alum-induced gr1 myeloid cell population produced il-4 and activated b-cells 22there are various diseases associated with animal coronavirus infection the clinical manifestations of the disease and the correlates of protection with immunity have been studied extensively in these animal coronavirus infections reviewed in 7 although antibodies and t cells may play a role in exacerbating the pathology in some animal coronavirus infections 2324 both humoral and cellular immune responses are known to contribute to protection against coronavirus infection in murine hepatitis virus a group 2 coronavirus the mortality of susceptible mice was partially prevented by the transfer of immune serum containing neutralizing antibody prior to challenge 25 recently zhi-yong et al reported in the murine acute infection model that the neutralizing antibody elicited by vaccination of dna encoding s was protective but cellular components of vaccinated mice were not required for the inhibition of viral replication 26 because a twice parenteral administration of inactivated virion with alum induced a high level of antibodies that are able to neutralize sars-cov this vaccination protocol may have a certain effect on the protection of humans from sars-cov infectionwe observed that two successive inoculations with inactivated virus at 7 week intervals generated sars-cov-specific t cells these cells were restimulated with the irradiated virus in vitro but their response was low in terms of the level of proliferation and production of inf- and il-2 however irrespective of vaccination protocols with or without alum adjuvant virus-primed t cells of vaccinated animals were capable of producing il-4 at high levels upon in vitro stimulation comparable to other reports for a variety of vaccination studies 2728 this outlook seems compatible with the idea that the present vaccine protocol may tend to select t-cell subsets with th2 phenotype however it remains to be elucidated whether such t cells may exhibit serological memory phenotype and persist in the immune system after vaccination as long as memory b cells which may persist more than 180 days post vaccination in addition further analysis is needed to clarify whether t cell response is a crucial factor for long-term protection against sars-cov infectionsefforts to develop a sars-cov vaccine have been carried out by many profitable or non-profitable organizations in various ways for example it has recently been reported that the combination of adenovirus vector expressing sars-s -m or -n protein elicited a neutralizing capacity in serum and n-specific t-cell response in rhesus macaques 29 however it is still uncertain whether or not the immunity against only these components of sars-cov is sufficient for virus protection sars-cov tends to cause replication errors which may allow the virus to escape the host-immune response and result in a seasonal outbreak from this point of view it resembles influenza virus in influenza virus inactivated ha vaccine showed incomplete protection but had a certain efficacy and safety record for a long period of time indeed this approach has been used in the veterinary field such as with the bovine coronavirus 30 and canine coronavirus 31 these advantages make a whole killed virion a prime candidate for a sars vaccine even if it may not have the best protective abilityunfortunately no information is available so far on the immune correlates of protection against human coronaviruses including sars-cov in consideration that sars-cov transmission occurs by direct contact with droplets or by the fecal oral route mucosal secretary iga in both the lower respiratory tract and digestive tract seem to be crucially important failure to induce iga-type antibodies in a current systemic vaccination method should be improved notably iga antibodies were detectable in the sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from mice hyper-immunized with uv-irradiated virus data not shown therefore if a non-toxic and more potent adjuvant becomes available for human use the subcutaneous injection of inactivated virion would become an effective vaccination method to reduce the number of susceptible peoplein the future it will be necessary to determine whether or not the inactivated whole virion vaccine possesses protective ability against sars-cov infection by the use of adequate animal models furthermore whether the alum addition augmented the protection and the effective period of sars-cov virion vaccination should be addressed because currently used inactivated influenza virus whole virion vaccine is significantly effective without any adjuvant meanwhile we also need to develop a potent adjuvant for induction of a much stronger mucosal immunity in addition to evaluating available methods of virion inactivationthe emergence of the novel coronavirus in wuhan china which causes severe respiratory tract infections in humans covid-19 has become a global health concern most coronaviruses infect animals but can evolve into strains that can also infect humans recently we showed that intravenous immunoglobulin ivig treatment reduces inflammation of intestinal epithelial cells and eliminates overgrowth of the opportunistic human fungal pathogen candida albicans in the murine gut in association with downregulation of proinflammatory mediators combined with upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines 1coronaviruses are enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses belonging to the family coronaviridae 2 an envelope-anchored spike protein promotes coronavirus entry into host cells by first binding to a host receptor and then fusing viral and host membranes 2 whole-genome sequencing of viral rna has revealed that the virus causing covid-19 is phylogenetically related to the sars-related coronaviruses first isolated in chinese horseshoe bats during 20152017 34 researchers in guangzhou china have recently suggested that pangolins are the probable animal source of the covid-19 outbreak 5 in terms of the interaction between the virus and its host lu et al have reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace 2 is most probably used by the spike protein of the covid-19 virus as a receptor similar to that sars-cov 6recently tang et al showed that the covid-19 has evolved into two major lineagesdubbed l and s types the older s-type appears to be milder and less infectious while the l-type which emerged later spreads quickly and is currently more aggressive than the s-type 7 current symptoms reported for patients with covid-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever fatigue cough myalgia and difficulty breathing 8 tyrrell et al showed that infected respiratory epithelial cells by coronavirus become vacuolated and show damaged cilia that lead to production of inflammatory mediators which increase nasal secretion and cause local inflammation and swelling 9 these responses in turn stimulate sneezing obstruct the airway and raise the temperature of the mucosa 9currently there is no single specific vaccine or effective antiviral therapy against covid-19 several pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies are working on vaccine development and estimate that this vaccine will take years to develop and test before it can reach a large population additionally there are currently no approved treatments for any coronavirus disease including covid-19 several antiviral drugs are being tested and initial findings are expected soon individuals with weakened immune systems appear to be at greater risk of developing complications associated with covid-19 immunotherapy using igg in combination with antiviral drugs could be used to treat or prevent covid-19 and to strengthen our immune response against this virus 1011 igg antibodies include two functional portions the fab2 fragment which is responsible for antigen recognition and the crystallizable fragment fc which is important for activation of the immune response by interacting with fc receptors on b-cells and other innate immune cells 12 the fc fragment also plays an important role in the activation of complement and in the clearance of microorganisms 12ivig is a pool of igg from thousands of healthy donors and exposure of individual donors to endemic infectious diseases vaccines and ubiquitous microorganisms participates in the production of igg antibodies against different microorganisms and their products 131415ivig has been used to treat patients with autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases such as dermatomyositis kawasaki disease multiple sclerosis lupus chronic lymphocytic leukemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura 161718 furthermore ivig has also been used as an anti-infectious agent against viruses bacteria and fungi in human patients and experimental models 13192021 ivig treatment may result in some adverse events which are associated with specific immunoglobulin preparations and individual differences but many clinical and experimental studies show that switching from ivig to subcutaneous immunoglobulin can minimize these adverse events 222324ivig plays an important role in the prevention of infectious episodes in primary immunodeficient patients and the beneficial effects of these antibodies in the treatment of infectious diseases goes beyond simple neutralization of microorganisms or their toxins anti-inflammatory pathways are also critical for protection against infection 25ivig may modulate the immune response via multiple mechanisms including blocking a wide array of proinflammatory cytokines fc-gamma receptors fcrs and leukocyte adhesion molecules suppressing pathogenic th1 and th17 subsets and neutralizing pathogenic autoantibodies 262728 ivig can also expand regulatory t-cells by induction of cyclo-oxygenase-2-dependent prostaglandin e2 production in dendritic cells 29in our study ivig treatment reduced intestinal inflammation and decreased escherichia coli enterococcus faecalis and c albicans populations in the gut of mice 1 overgrowth of e coli and e faecalis populations is known to be involved in dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases ibds which are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract 3031 we also showed that the beneficial effects of ivig were associated with suppression of inflammatory cytokine il-6 and enhancement of anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 in the gut 1 additionally ivig therapy also led to increased expression of ppar a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates anti-inflammatory functions and resolution of inflammation while tlr-4 expression which mediates the inflammatory response was reducedin general sera from virtually all healthy adults contain anti-coronavirus antibodies 32 pyrc et al showed that human sera from healthy adults inhibited hcov-nl63 infection 10 additionally they reported that ivig can also neutralize hcov-nl63 10 boukhvalova et al showed that in contrast to commercially available polyclonal therapeutic igg products ivig obtained from donors with high-titer antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus rsv have great potential to improve the outcome of rsv infection in immunocompromised subjects not only by controlling viral replication but also by reducing damage to the lung parenchyma and epithelial airway lining 3334currently all efforts to prevent the spread of covid-19 so far have been inadequate immunotherapy with igg can be employed to neutralize the virus causing covid-19 the efficiency of igg would be better if these immune igg antibodies were collected from patients recovered from covid-19 in the same city or the surrounding area as these donor subjects have naturally been confronted with the virusimmune igg collected in europe or the usa may be different from that collected in china as lifestyle diet and the environment play an important role in the development of specific antibodies against the virus recently researchers at the sacco university hospital in milan italy have announced that they have isolated a new strain of coronavirus from an italian patient that showed genetic differences when compared to the original strain isolated in chinathe idea is to treat infected patients with immune igg collected from the same city in order to increase the chance of neutralizing the virus different procedures may be used to remove or inactivate any possible pathogens from the plasma of recovered coronavirus patient derived immune igg including solventdetergent 60 c heat treatment and nanofiltration 20 nm 35363738 terpstra et al showed that a 15 nm filtration step combined with pepsin and solvent-detergent treatment contribute to virus-elimination from liquid intravenous immunoglobulin 38overall immunotherapy with immune igg combined with antiviral drugs could provide alternative treatment against covid-19 these immune igg antibodies collected from the recovered patients will be specific against covid-19 by boosting the immune response in newly infected patients although a vaccine for covid-19 is currently not available the combination of the immune igg antibodies with antiviral drugs can offer short-term and medium-term solutions against covid-19coronaviruses belong to the family coronaviridae and are characterized by causing respiratory tract infections ranging from mild diseases such as common cold to pneumonia with a lethal outcome 1 typically coronaviruses have been associated with a large number of diseases in livestock and companion animals such as pigs cows chickens cats and dogs table 1 2 in this context transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev 3 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv 4 are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young piglets similarly porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus phev causes enteric infection in pigs but can also lead to encephalitis by targeting the nervous system 5 in cattle bovine cov bcov is responsible for mild to severe respiratory tract infections resulting in significant losses in the cattle industry due to diarrhea dehydration decreased milk production and depression 67 in addition to cattle bcov also infects other ruminants such as elk deer and camels another coronavirus rat cov rcov causes respiratory tract infections in rats providing a useful model for studying early events of innate immune responses to coronavirus infections in lungs 8 infectious bronchitis virus ibv targets chickens causing respiratory tract infections but also renal disease 9 ibv has a significant negative effect on egg production and growth of chickens leading to substantial losses in the chicken industry 7 in domestic cats a mild or asymptomatic infection has been associated with feline enteric coronavirus fcov 10 although a highly virulent strain of feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv causes lethal feline infectious peritonitis fip 11 which shows similarities to human sarcoidosis 12interestingly wildlife can also be infected by coronaviruses for instance a novel coronavirus sw1 was isolated from a deceased beluga whale 13 the whale had suffered from a respiratory disease and acute liver failure and large quantities of sw1 particles were isolated from the liver however electron microscopy was not able to identify the virus as a coronavirus but nucleic acid sequencing of liver tissue confirmed the presence of coronavirus rna phylogenetic analysis indicated that sw1 belonged to the group of -coronaviruses for obvious reasons there has been an intense interest in bat coronaviruses as bats have been indicated as the original source of several coronavirus outbreaks in the past decade hundreds of novel bat coronaviruses have been identified 14 in this context both the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus sars-cov and the middle east respiratory syndrome-cov mers-cov have been suggested to originate from bats moreover it has been already discussed in 2015 that a sars-like cluster of bat coronaviruses could pose a threat for human epidemics 15 for instance the disease potential of a sars-like virus shc014-cov circulating in chinese horseshoe bats was evaluated by reverse genetics 15 the chimeric virus composed of shc014-cov spikes and wild-type backbone was able to efficiently utilize multiple orthologs of the sars receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 replicate to high levels in primary human airway cells and generate in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic sars-cov strains moreover the chimeric virus showed replication in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis in vivo these results indicated that there is a potential risk of sars-cov re-emergence from viruses circulating in bat populations needless to say the re-emergence of sars-cov is a reality today as will be discussed belowthe murine hepatitis virus mhv is the best studied animal coronavirus resulting in respiratory enteric hepatic and neurological infections and is also a useful disease model 16 for instance mhv-1 causes severe respiratory infections in aj and c3hhei mice a59 and mhv-3 are associated with severe hepatitis and jhmv causes severe encephalitis interestingly a59 and an attenuated jhmv cause chronic demyelinating disease in mice which resembles multiple sclerosis ms providing a mouse model for ms 17 another advantage of mhv is the requirement of bsl2-level laboratory conditions whereas sars-cov and mers-cov require bsl3-level laboratory conditions making mhv ideal for studies on replication in cell cultures as well as pathogenesis and immune responses in vivoin the context of human coronaviruses it was thought that they caused only mild self-limiting infections until the sars-cov outbreak in 20022003 2 two human -coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 and two -coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 were identified as endemic in human populations responsible for 1530 of annual respiratory tract infections 1820 however a more severe disease has been detected in neonates elderly people and in individuals with pre-existing illnesses moreover hcov-nl63 has also been associated with acute laryngotracheitis 19 interestingly human coronaviruses differ in genetic variability as hcov-229e isolated from around the world showed only minimal sequence divergence 2324252627282930 while hcov-oc43 isolated from the same location in different years demonstrated significant genetic variability 31 for this reason hcov-229e does not cross species barriers and is incapable of infecting mice while mice and several ruminant species are susceptible to hcov-oc43 and the closely related bcov as mentioned above although mhv possesses the ability to cause demyelinating disease no evidence exists of human coronaviruses being associated with msthe first major human coronavirus outbreak caused by the -coronavirus sars-cov originated in guangdong in china 21 during the 20022003 epidemic approximately 8098 cases were recorded with 774 deaths at a mortality rate of 9 22 however the mortality rate was much higher in the elderly population reaching almost 50 in individuals over 60 years of age although closely related viruses were isolated from exotic animals such as himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs 24 based on sequence data and serologic evidence sars-cov originated in chinese horseshoe bats 2526 related to sars-cov two novel bat sars-related covs with closer similarity to sars-cov than any other virus were identified in 2013 27 they utilize the same receptor ace2 as sars-cov another indication that sars-cov originated in bats the sars outbreak was only spread through direct contact with infected individuals due to the relatively inefficient transmission of the virus which allowed containing the outbreak within households and health care institutions 28 therefore the sars-cov outbreak was controllable through quarantining and it died out in june 2003after the sars-cov epidemic the novel human mers-cov emerged in the middle east in 2012 causing a series of highly pathogenic respiratory tract infections in saudi arabia and other middle east countries 29 despite fears the outbreak did not accelerate in 2013 and the cases of mers-cov totaled at 855 individuals and 333 deaths resulting in a mortality rate of almost 40 23 mers-cov is a -coronavirus which is highly related to the bat coronaviruses hku4 and hku5 32 suggesting its origin in bats although dromedary camels have been indicated as an intermediate host 33 moreover it was demonstrated that mers-cov replicated in camel cell lines further indicating that camels may be natural hosts for the virus 34 additionally a case study showed that virus isolated from a person who had been in contact with an infected camel was identical to virus isolated from the camel 35 in contrast to sars-cov the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 dpp4 receptor is utilized making bats humans camels rabbits and horses susceptible 36 however differences in the structure of the mouse dpp4 receptor make mouse cells resistant to mers-cov which does not allow evaluation of antivirals and vaccines in appropriate mouse models however a mouse model for mers-cov was engineered by introduction of the human dpp4 gene into mouse lungs by an adenoviral vector 37the current 2019-ncov officially called severe acute respiratory virus-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 was first detected in the city of wuhan in china in december 2019 3839 it was thought to have originated from wild animals at the huanan market in wuhan and spread by person-to-person transmission causing the disease named covid-19 with various degrees of severity from mild flu-like symptoms to pneumonia and death 39 bats snakes and pangolins are potential carriers of sars-cov-2 based on sequence comparison to virus isolated from sars-cov-2-infected patients the covid-19 pandemic has already overtaken both sars and mers in severity and has recently led to extreme quarantine measures including sealing off large cities closing borders and confining people to their homes despite these efforts as of april 28 there are 3041912 cases of covid-19 and there have been 211167 deaths in 210 countries 40 whether the trend will be a further expansion of the pandemic and when it will die out or return in a seasonal pattern is impossible to determine at this stage and only time will tell the outcomecurrently there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines available for the treatment of covid-19 41 the urgent need for treatment has therefore triggered a variety of approaches to design and develop novel drug and vaccine strategies against covid-19 therapeutic approaches have included angiotensin receptor blockers monoclonal antibodies mabs gene silencing and even plant and mushroom extracts based on traditional chinese medicine moreover vaccine development involves different alternatives including epitope-based peptide vaccines viral vector-based vaccines and the support of bioinformatics and immunoinformatics for the design of more efficient targets however before the various approaches are described in detail it is appropriate to give an overview of the genomic composition of sars-cov-2 and its lifecycle to identify potential drug and vaccine targetscoronaviruses possess a non-segmented positive-sense single-stranded rna ssrna genome of approximately 30 kb 4243 it contains a 5 end cap structure replicase genes rep 1a and rep 1b coding for the non-structural proteins nsps comprising two-thirds of the genome and the structural protein genes s spike e envelope m membrane and n nucleocapsid and various accessory genes interspersed within the structural genes at the 3 end 2 figure 1 although the accessory proteins have been considered non-essential for replication they play an important role in viral pathogenesis 43the virion structure has been studied by cryo-electron tomography and microscopy showing the prominent club-shaped spike projections on spherical particles of approximately 125 nm in diameter 4445 the n protein is helically symmetrical with both n- and c-terminal domains needed for optimal encapsulation of the rna genome 46 the transcription regulation sequences trss 47 and the genomic packaging signal 48 have been identifiedof which the latter has been demonstrated to bind specifically to the c-terminal rna-binding domain facilitating the packaging of the genome into viral particles 49 the m protein containing three transmembrane domains may exist as a dimer binds to the n protein 50 and is thought to give the virion its shape 51 the topology of the small 812 kd e protein is not completely resolved but is believed to have a transmembrane structure with an n-terminal ectodomain and a c-terminal endodomain with ion channel activity 52 it facilitates the assembly and release of virions and has been associated with pathogenesis 53 the spikes consisting of the s protein give the virion the appearance of a solar corona and mediate the attachment to the host receptor 54 the s protein is cleaved by a host cell furin-like protease into s1 and s2 polypeptides for most coronaviruses 5556 however sars-cov and sars-related cov lack the furin cleavage site while sars-cov-2 accommodates it 57 a fifth structural protein the hemagglutinin-esterase he is present in the genome of some coronaviruses such as mhv 58 the function of the he is thought to be the enhancement of the s protein-mediated cell entry and spread through the mucosa 59 as well as increase of the neurovirulence of mhv 60the coronavirus lifecycle is characterized by various steps including attachment and entry expression of replicase proteins replication and transcription and assembly and release of mature viral particles figure 2 the initial attachment occurs between the receptor-binding domain rbd of the s1 region of the s protein and its receptor mhv uses an rbd at the n-terminus 61 while sars-cov has an rbd at the c-terminus of the s1 region 62 the s proteinreceptor interaction governs the virus tropism which also reflects the targeting of different receptors by different coronaviruses for instance mhv targets carcinoembryonic antigen-related adhesion molecule 1 ceacam1 63 mers-cov dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 dpp4 64 and sars-cov and hcovnl63 ace2 65 recently it was demonstrated that sars-cov-2 also uses ace2 21 after the initial attachment acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of the s protein by cathepsin or another protease occurs followed by fusion in acidified endosomes or at the plasma membrane which leads to the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm 6667the translation of the coronavirus replicase genes from two large open reading frames orfs rep1a and rep1b allows the expression of two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab utilizing a slippery sequence 5-uuuaaac-3 and an rna pseudoknot 6869 the complicated composition of the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins and the assembly of nsps are described in detail by fehr and perlman 2 following the translation and assembly of the replicase complex viral rna synthesis from both genomic and subgenomic rnas occurs the latter serves as mrnas for the structural and accessory genes 2 in the 5 untranslated region there are cis-acting sequences such as stemloop structures which are important for viral rna replication 70717273 an interesting feature of coronavirus replication relates to the fusing of the leader and body trs segments during the production of subgenomic rnas although originally thought to occur during positive-strand synthesis a recent model suggests that rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp pauses at any of the body trs sequences during the discontinuous extension of negative-strand rna followed by either continued elongation to the next trs or switching to amplification of the leader sequence at the 5 end 7475in the context of assembly the viral structural proteins s e and m are translated and transported along secretory pathways into the endoplasmic reticulum er and the ergolgi intermediate compartment ergic 7677 at the ergic viral genomes surrounded by n protein participate in the formation of mature virions 78 assembled virions are then transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis 79 an interesting observation relates to coronaviruses assembled without the s protein which leads to the formation of giant multi-nucleated cells spreading the virus within an infected organism without being detected or neutralized by virus-specific antibodies 2among therapeutics the use of protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir as a combination therapy with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of hiv-1 infections has provided durable virologic suppression and improved immunological outcomes 84 lopinavirritonavir combination treatment was evaluated in marmosets with a mers-like disease 85 in comparison to mycophenolate mofetil mff the treatment showed improved clinical radiological and pathological outcomes and lower mean viral loads in necropsied lung and extrapulmonary tissues whereas mff-treated animals developed severe or fatal disease based on these results a study protocol for a clinical trial for hospitalized adult mers patients was prepared 86 the goal is to investigate laboratory-confirmed mers patients in a recursive two-stage multi-center placebo-controlled double-blind randomized controlled trial related to the recent covid-19 pandemic a clinical trial on 99 patients receiving lopinavir and ritonavir were compared to 100 patients subjected to standard care however no difference in clinical improvement mortality or detectable viral rna was obtained 87 in a modified intention-to-treat analysis the median time to clinical improvement was one day shorter for lopinavirritonavir treatment and although gastrointestinal adverse events were more common serious adverse events were less frequent overall the study indicated that the treatment offered no benefit compared to standard care another approach comprises the application of nucleoside analogues as antivirals 88 for instance several classes of nucleoside analogues were verified against sars-cov in vero cells 89 in the study the d-isomer of thymine analogue exhibited strong anti-sars-cov activity and did not show any toxicity at the highest tested dosage of 100 m although the l-cytosine analogue showed good activity it exhibited strong toxicity to cells likewise the 3-azido-2 3-unsaturated thymine analogue provided strong anti-sars-cov activity but also significant toxicity additionally dioxalane-thymine showed moderate antiviral activity without any significant cytotoxicity although c-nucleoside4-amino-7--l-ribofuranosylpyrrolo 32-d pyrimidine hydrochloride inhibited sars-cov replication it was cytotoxic overall despite several classes of nucleoside analogues against sars-cov exhibiting moderate antiviral activity in vitro no clear structureactivity relationship could be established in another study a series of doubly flexible nucleoside analogues were designed based on the acrylic sugar scaffold of acyclovir 90 one compound displayed selective antiviral activity against hcov-nl63 and mers-cov in contrast no activity was detected against sars-cov in a study on fip the nucleoside analogue gs-441524 a precursor to the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate molecule and acting as an alternative substrate and rna chain terminator of viral rdrp was non-toxic and effectively inhibited fipv replication in feline crfk cells 91 moreover all ten cats treated with gs-441524 showed rapid reversal of disease symptoms in two weeks in another approach the guanosine analogue ribavirin was administered together with interferon-2a in adult patients with laboratory-confirmed mers-cov infection and pneumonia needing ventilation support 92 the study demonstrated that patients treated with ribavirin and interferon-2a showed a significantly improved survival rate at 14 days but not at 28 days of treatment compared to the control group of patients the adenosine nucleoside analogue remdesivir has proven efficient for inhibition of rna viruses such as filoviruses pneumoviruses and paramyxoviruses by targeting rdrp 93 moreover the antiviral activity of remdesivir has also been demonstrated for human endemic and zoonotic coronaviruses such as hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e 94 in another study it was shown that remdesivir potently inhibited rdrp from mers-cov 95 very recently it was demonstrated that remdesivir effectively inhibited sars-cov-2 in vero cells and in human huh-7 liver cancer cells known to be susceptible to sars-cov-2 96 the first case of compassionate treatment of covid-19 with intravenous administration of remdesivir took place in the us leading to improvement in the patients condition with a decline in viral load 97 neuraminidase inhibitors such as zanamivir laninamivir oseltamivir and peramivir have demonstrated potency against most influenza strains 98 in this context the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir tamiflu and zanamivir relenza were tested for inhibition of cytopathic effects of sars-cov in a cytopathic endpoint assay in vero cells 99 however neither neuraminidase inhibitor showed any effect on sars-cov arbidol a broad-spectrum antiviral agent against several dna and rna viruses has been approved in russia and china for prevention and treatment of influenza 100 antiviral effect against zika virus zikv west nile virus wnv and tick-borne encephalitis virus tbev has been demonstrated in vero cells 100 furthermore it was shown that arbidol can inhibit six different isolates of zikv and can protect against the cytopathic effects of zikv 101 related to sars-cov patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 were treated with oral arbidol in combination with lopinavirritonavir or lopinavirritonavir monotherapy 102 after seven days sars-cov could not be detected in nasopharyngeal specimens in 12 out of 16 patients subjected to the combination therapy compared to 6 out of 17 for the monotherapy group the numbers at day 14 were 15 out of 16 for combination therapy and 9 out of 17 for monotherapy at day 14 furthermore ct scans revealed improvement for 11 out of 16 patients receiving the combination therapy and 5 out of 17 receiving the monotherapya hot topic today has been the potential therapeutic effect of the widely used antimalarial and auto-immune disease drug chloroquine on coronaviruses 96 chloroquine blocks virus infection and interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of sars-cov 110 the application of chloroquine for covid-19 patients has been justified by its common use by travelers in malaria-endemic geographic regions for decades and continuous use by locals 111 however as indications of severe side effects of chloroquine use have been reported hydroxychloroquine possessing a similar antiviral potency to chloroquine but a safer clinical profile should be considered 112 in a limited clinical trial 20 french covid-19 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine resulting in a significant reduction in viral load in comparison to control patients 103 addition of azithromycin further significantly improved the efficiency of virus elimination despite the small sample size the study indicated that hydroxychloroquine treatment was associated with a significant viral load reduction and disappearance of covid-19 however the trial design was poor and the results unreliable as six patients dropped out and the assessment of efficacy was based on viral load which was not a clinical endpoint additional studies are therefore needed in a larger number of patients to thoroughly validate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquinechinese traditional medicine has also tried to provide support in the fight against coronaviruses in this context case studies of treatment with the shuanghuanglian oral liquid shl of a family suffering from covid-19 has been reported 104 case 1 a 51-year-old female with high fever diagnosed with covid-19 was confined into an isolation ward five days later where she started to take oral shl twice a day the following day shl administration was increased to three doses a day without taking any other drugs the fever decreased in two days and she gradually recovered case 2 the 27-year-old daughter of case 1 presented with a high fever vomiting and diarrhea two days after she was confined in an isolation ward she started to take shl three times a day a couple of days later a decrease in body temperature and recovered appetite were noted case 3 the husband of case 1 had mild diarrhea vomiting and fever and was diagnosed with covid-19 he started to take shl three times a day as well as moxifloxacin and arbidol which resulted in all symptoms with exception of light nausea disappearing within four days in another study four patients with mild or severe 2019-ncov pneumonia were treated with lopinavirritonavir arbidol and traditional chinese medicine in the form of shufeng jiedu capsules 105 three patients showed significant improvement related to the pneumonia symptoms and tested 2019-ncov negative and one patient with severe pneumonia also showed improvement another potential approach for covid-19 treatment relates to ahcc an -glucan-based standardized mushroom extract from lenintula edodes which has demonstrated immunostimulation in humans infected by wnv influenza virus avian influenza virus hepatitis c virus papilloma virus herpes virus hepatitis b virus and hiv 113 although the potency of ahcc has not yet been verified for sars-cov-2 it might be an attractive alternative approach to explore likewise lianhuaqingwen capsules have proven to be efficient for the prevention and treatment of respiratory infections caused by influenza a 114 but have not yet been validated for sars-cov-2in light of therapeutic strategies to rapidly target sars-cov-2 one approach aims at blocking virus entry using a soluble version of ace2 fused to an immunoglobulin fc domain 81 this approach will elicit broad-ranging neutralizing antibodies and stimulate the immune system recombinant protein expression can be utilized for the rapid production of a drug for compassionate use while formal clinical trials are undertaken and vaccines developed another target related to ace2 comprises the transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 involved in s protein priming for which tmprss2 inhibitors might be approved for clinical use to block coronavirus entry 106 it was also demonstrated that sera from convalescent sars patients are capable of cross-neutralizing sars-cov-2 s-driven entry 106 in the context of ace2 although the binding affinity of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is similar the presence of the furin cleavage site uniquely in the sars-cov-2 s protein sets it apart for the design of specific inhibitors 57 moreover the finding that sars-cov s murine polyclonal antibodies can potently prevent sars-cov-2 s-mediated cell entry indicated that cross-neutralizing antibodies against conserved s epitopes might be a feasible approach for therapy in the context of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies for sars-cov-2 the first sars-cov-specific human monoclonal antibody mab cr3022 showed potent binding to the sars-cov-2 receptor-binding domain 107 however the cr3022 epitope does not overlap with the ace2 binding site which indicates that cr3022 could have the potential as a therapeutic as such or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies interestingly the potent sars-cov-specific m396 and cr3014 neutralizing antibodies which target the ace2 binding site failed to bind the sars-cov-2 s protein suggesting differences in the receptor-binding domains of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 it is therefore necessary to develop mabs with specific binding affinity to the sars-cov-2 receptor-binding domain another tentative approach comprises the evaluation of existing angiotensin receptor 1 atr1 blockers such as losartan commonly used for the treatment of hypertension 108 for a reduction in aggressiveness and mortality from sars-cov-2 infections 115 the approach is based on the finding that ace2 most likely represents the binding site for both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 thereby providing a sensible target for therapeutic interventions for coronavirus infections targeting atr1 might also address the problem with new emerging coronavirus mutations very recently the first report on the human 47d11 mab targeting a conserved epitope in the spike receptor-binding domain was published 109 it cross-neutralizes sars-cov and sars-cov-2 independently from receptor-binding inhibition and will be useful for the development of antigen detection tests and serological assays moreover it adds to the potential to prevent and treat covid-19 and possible future emerging coronavirusesgene silencing based on rna interference has proven to be an important tool in basic research but also for therapeutic applications 116117 the mechanism of rnai relates to 1923 base pair double-stranded rnas dsrnas mediating degradation of target rna in a sequence-specific manner 118 coronaviruses have been subjected to several gene silencing studies table 3 for instance short interfering rnas sirnas have been demonstrated to efficiently inhibit sars-cov replication in vero e6 cells 119 moreover 48 sirna sequences were designed throughout the sars-cov genome targeting several key proteins 120 chemically synthesized sirnas were transfected into fetal rhesus kidney frhk4 cells before or after sars-cov infection and the inhibitory effects were verified by the decrease in intracellular viral genome copy number and viral titers four sirnas demonstrated potent inhibition of sars-cov infection and replication prophylactic effects with up to 90 inhibition lasted at least for 72 h combination of sirna duplexes from different regions of the viral genome provided up to 80 inhibition furthermore sirna duplexes have been shown to significantly suppress sars-like symptoms in vivo in rhesus macaques 121 in another approach expression of u6 promotor-driven sirna homologous to ace2 mrna silenced ace2 expression in vero cells 122 it was further demonstrated that sars-cov infection was reduced in ace2-silenced cell lines providing an attractive approach for sirna-based prophylactic or therapeutic strategies moreover sirna duplexes were applied to knock down expression of the actin-binding protein ezrin which interacts with the sars-cov spike protein during the entry stage of infection 123in the context of mers-cov the orf1ab region encoding the replicase polyproteins plays a vital role in viral infection and therefore represents a suitable target for disease control four mirna and five sirna molecules were rationally designed by computational methods for silencing of nine different mers-cov strains for exploration of the treatment of mers-cov at the genomic level 124 in attempts to optimize delivery of mers-cov sirnas transfection electroporation and viral gene transfers have been applied recently advanced nanotechnology based on lipids polymers and inorganic compounds have been formulated 128 gene silencing of fipv by sirnas has been hampered by mutations creating resistant viruses to address the problem combination therapy with three sirnas prevented viral escape over the course of five passages 125 moreover dicer-substrate sirnas provided equivalent or better potency than canonical sirnas for fipv in the context of porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov two short hairpin rna shrna-expressing plasmids targeting the m pgenesil-m and n pgenesil-n genes of pdcov were evaluated in swine testicular st cells 126 challenges with the pdcov hb-bd strain provided highly specific and efficient protection of st cells treatment with pgenesil-m and pgenesil-n resulted in a 132- and 324-fold titer reduction respectively and a 458 and 561 decrease in viral rna respectively in another study shrnas targeting the m gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus sads-cov and the n gene of pdcov inhibited expression of each viral rna over 98 127 moreover shrnas significantly restricted the expression of m and n proteins and impaired pedv sads-cov and pdcov replicationthe classic approach for vaccine development against viral diseases has involved immunization with live attenuated or inactivated viruses 129 the availability of genetic engineering and efficient recombinant protein production technologies has shifted applications to the utilization of recombinantly expressed antigens and immunogens for immunization 130 in the context of coronaviruses vaccine development started seriously after the sars and mers outbreaks providing alternative approaches of applying subunit vaccines whole inactivated virus vectored and live attenuated virus vaccines 83 table 4 efforts to tackle other coronaviruses have also been explored for instance a modified-live vaccine against bcov was developed by progressive attenuation of the respiratory bcov strain 43806-tn 131 the vaccine was proven safe and intramuscular injection in calves elicited high antibody titers against bcov 30 days post-vaccination the intranasal drug bovilis has been approved against enteric disease caused by bcov in young calves 132 the lack of relevant vaccines for equine coronavirus ecov catalyzed the study on antibody responses to ecov in horses after vaccination with the bcov vaccine 133 antibody titers against ecov increased in all six vaccinated horses at 14 days post-inoculation although the titers were lower against ecov than bcov and it remained unclear whether the elicited antibodies provided protection against ecovin the context of vaccine development different computational and informatics tools play an essential role for instance the immune epitope database iedb has been used to predict suitable mers-cov epitope vaccines against the most known world population alleles based on the s and e proteins 134 the study showed that highly conserved sequences in the s and e proteins might be considered immunogenically protective and can elicit both neutralizing antibodies and t cell responses when reacting with b cells t helper cell lymphocytes htls and cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls in another approach the sars-cov-2 s protein was characterized to obtain immunogenic epitopes for vaccine development 135 thirteen major histocompatibility complex mhc-i and three mhc-ii epitopes with antigenic properties were identified the epitopes were linked by specific linkers and docked to toll-like receptor-5 tlr5 and immunoinformatics analysis was utilized for fast immunogenic profiling to accelerate vaccine development in another immunoinformatics and computational approach conserved b and t cell epitopes for the mers-cov s protein were identified 136 the antigenicity of the epitopes and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen hla b7 allele were estimated the highest antigenicity score was obtained for the immensely immunogenic b cell epitope qlqmgfgitvqygt the t cell epitope peptides yklqpltfl mhc-i and ycileprsg mhc-ii were also highly antigenic these identified putative antigenic epitopes may prove effective for the development of novel vaccines using in silico approaches two multi-epitope vaccines against mers-cov were designed by screening ctl and htl epitopes from 13 different mers-cov proteins 137 both multi-epitope vaccines also carried potential b cell linear epitope regions b cell discontinuous epitopes and interferon--inducing epitopes moreover human -defensin-2 and -defensin-3 were used as adjuvants for enhanced immune responses the most potent ctl and htl epitopes and adjuvants were linked by short peptide molecular linkers tertiary models for both multi-epitope vaccines were verified for their molecular interaction with tlr3 and cdnas were generated for in silico analysis of expression in human cell lines before being tested in vivo as potential vaccine candidatescomputational approaches and immunoinformatics have provided strong support for vaccine development as described above moreover structurefunction studies have also contributed to the field in this context in comparison to antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain on the mers-cov s protein less attention has been paid to antibodies targeting non-receptor-binding domain epitopes such as the neutralizing antibody g2 which targets the mers-cov n-terminal domain of s1 138 structural and functional characterization of g2 alone or complexed with the mers-cov n-terminal of s1 demonstrated that g2 strongly disrupts the attachment of mers-cov s to the ddp4 receptor and could play an important role as a target for immunotherapy and vaccine development in another approach cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em was applied for the human hcov-nl63 providing a 34  resolution of the spike glycoprotein trimer essential for viral entry into host cells and representing the main target for neutralizing antibodies 139 the structure revealed important components of the fusion process including the triggering loop and the c-terminal domains involved in the anchoring of the trimer to the viral membrane the study also revealed that hcov-nl63 use molecular trickery based on epitope masking with glycans and activating conformational changes in attempts to evade recognition by the host immune system in another study the sars-cov-2 s protein was subjected to cryo-em structure determination of the ectodomain trimer for the identification of potential targets for vaccines and viral entry inhibition as the furin cleavage site between the s1 and s1 subunits is unique for sars-cov-2 and not present in sars-cov or other related coronaviruses 57 in a study on sars-cov screening of experimentally determined b and t cell-derived epitopes from the s and n proteins which maps identically to sars-cov-2 showed no mutations among the 120 available sars-cov-2 sequences 140 immune targeting of these epitopes may therefore potentially offer protection against sars-cov-2 related to the t cell epitopes a population coverage analysis of associated mhc alleles was conducted allowing the identification of a set of epitopes which might provide a broad global coveragenucleic acid-based vaccines have become attractive alternatives to vaccines based on live attenuated or inactivated viruses in this context four plasmid dna-based vaccine constructs were intradermally administered into c57bl6 mice 141 the pll70 vector contained the sars-cpov s gene and the pcdna-ss vector contained the codon-optimized sars-cov s gene fused with the leader sequence from the human cd5 gene the pcdna-st vector carried the n-portion of the codon-optimized s gene with the cd5 leader sequence and the pcdna-st-vp22c contained the n-portion of the codon-optimized s with the cd5 leader sequence fused to the c-terminal of the bovine herpesvirus-1 bhv-1 vp22 protein known to facilitate and enhance protein delivery 156 immunization studies revealed that pcdna-ss and pcdna-st-vp22c elicited superior cellular and humoral immune responses in mice and therefore represent the most immunogenic sars vaccine candidates moreover the dna vaccine approach was verified targeting the sars-cov s protein using an improved plasmid dna vector containing donor and acceptor splice sites and heterologous viral rna export elements such as the constitutive transport element cte and the post-transcriptional regulatory element pre from mason-pfizer monkey virus and woodchuck hepatitis virus respectively 142 these vector modifications significantly improved the immunogenicity and immunization of mice with 2 g of naked dna induced neutralizing anti-s antibodies and provided protection against challenges with sars-covin another plasmid dna-based study immune responses to a naked plasmid vector and plasmidpolyethylenimine nanoparticles expressing the sars-cov s protein were investigated in balbc mice after intranasal administration 143 immunization with nanoparticles elicited significantly higher s-specific igg1 antibodies in sera and mucosal secretory iga antibodies in lung wash than in mice receiving naked plasmid dna in another study dna plasmid-based prime immunization was combined with a boost vaccination with a protein 144 turkeys were immunized with one or two doses of 750 g of a dna plasmid carrying a turkey coronavirus tcov s protein fragment containing neutralizing epitopes 4f4r followed by a boost with 200 g of 4f4r fragment animals were challenged with infectious tcov and clinical signs were monitored by an immunofluorescence antibody assay immunized turkeys showed less clinical signs and a lower viral load compared to control animals the vaccination also induced humoral immune responses and provided partial protection against challenges with tcovcellular and viral vector-based expression systems play an important role in vaccine development the large size of the cov genome has complicated the construction of infectious clones for utilization in studies on basic viral processes and development of genetically defined vaccines 156 in this context bacterial artificial chromosomes bacs can provide a robust system for expression of viral rna in the nucleus under the control of a cytomegalovirus cmv promoter followed by rna amplification by the viral replicase in the cytoplasm 157 in a prokaryotic approach a eukaryotic recombinant plasmid expressing the sad epitope a and d antigenic sites of the s protein of tgev was transformed into lactobacillus acidophilus originating from swine 145 oral administration of l acidophilus in balbc mice induced significantly higher levels of s iga antibodies compared to a commercial inactivated tgev vaccine the levels of tgev-specific iggs were similar but higher levels of interferon- were induced by the l acidophilus vaccine overall the oral tgev l acidophilus vaccine induced high levels of both mucosal and humoral immune responses in another approach a stable cho cell line was engineered to express a subunit recombinant protein vaccine of residues 377-588 of the receptor-binding domain of the mers-cov s protein 146 the vaccine has been demonstrated to elicit significant neutralizing antibody responses and can provide protection against mers-cov challenges in vaccinated animals for stable expression the il-2 signal peptide was introduced in front of the s protein domain fused to the human igg fc fragment and transfected into an adherent dihydrofolate reductase-deficient cho cell line the adcho-expressed fusion protein was secreted and showed functionality and binding specificity and a suspension cho cell line has been developed engineered transgenic mice with the dpp4 receptor susceptible to mers-cov were immunized with the s377-588-fc subunit vaccine and adjuvant which resulted in production of neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov and survival for at least 21 days after challenges with live mers-covan interesting approach has been to utilize plant expression systems for coronavirus vaccine development for instance the n-terminal part amino acids 1-658 of the sars-cov s protein was optimized for codon usage in plants and expressed as a fusion protein with the green fluorescent protein gfp in tobacco leaves 147 it was demonstrated that the s1-gfp fusion protein was expressed in the cytoplasm stable expression from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter resulted in a high level of expression of the fusion protein in tobacco and lettuce leaves moreover s1 production was also achieved in chloroplast-transformed plants suggesting the potential for developing safe oral plant-derived subunit vaccines against sars-cov in another study an n-terminal fragment of the sars-cov s protein was expressed at high levels in tomato and low-nicotine tobacco plants 148 the plant-derived antigen elicited systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice significantly increased levels of sars-cov-specific iga antibodies were detected in mice after oral administration of tomato fruits expressing the s1 protein moreover sars-cov-specific igg antibodies were detected in the serum of mice primed with tobacco-derived s1 protein enhanced expression of the sars-cov n protein was achieved in the tobacco plant nicotiana benthamiana by including the post-transcriptional gene silencing suppressor p19 protein from tomato bushy stunt virus 149 intraperitoneal administration of plant extract in balbc mice elicited n protein-specific igg antibodies and overall it could be concluded that plant-based expression of the sars-cov n protein can induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice finally recent progress in plant-based expression systems has allowed the production of numerous antigens and monoclonal antibodies in plants 158 which has now also accelerated the application of plant-based expression systems for rapid vaccine development against sars-cov-2viral vectors have been frequently used as delivery vehicles for immunization against infectious agents such as pathogenic viruses 159 in many cases strong humoral and cellular immune responses have been observed as well as protection against challenges with lethal doses of pathogenic viruses in the context of coronaviruses a recombinant adenovirus vector expressing the heat-labile enterotoxin b ltb and the core neutralizing epitope coe of pedv was administered intramuscularly or orally into balbc mice and piglets 150 three vaccinations at two-week intervals generated robust humoral and cellular immune responses cell-mediated immune responses were seen in mice and neutralizing antibodies inhibited both the vaccine strain and emerging pedv isolates strong immune responses were observed in piglets but further studies are required to verify the protection against challenges with highly virulent pedv strains in another study the modified vaccinia virus ankara mva strain was utilized for the expression of recombinant mers-cov s protein 151 immunization of dromedary camels elicited mucosal immunity immunized camels showed significantly reduced excretion of infectious virus and viral rna transcripts and protection against mers-cov correlated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies in the serum in another application of mva the mers-cov n was used for induction of cellular immune responses 152 identification of mhc-i- and mhc-ii-restricted t cell responses was carried out on overlapping peptides spanning the whole mers-cov n polypeptide in balbc mice immunized with mva-mers-cov n an h2-d restricted decamer peptide epitope showing cd8 t cell antigenicity was identified which will be further subjected to protection studies in mouse models for mers-cov in the context of sars-cov the n and s protein genes were cloned between the glycoprotein g and polymerase l genes in a highly attenuated safe rabies virus rv vector 153 a single injection with the rv-sars-cov s vector induced strong neutralizing antibody responses in mice which makes it a promising candidate for eradication of sars-cov from animal reservoirsfinally self-replicating rna viruses have proven to be efficient as vaccine vectors due to the highly efficient replication of their ssrna genome of positive polarity directly in the cytoplasm 159 as vectors have been engineered allowing immunization of plasmid dna replicons naked rna replicons or replication-deficient particles the application range is wide moreover due to self-replication the amounts required for obtaining similar immune responses as seen for conventional dna plasmids or synthetic mrna molecules are 100- to 1000-fold lower 160 in the context of coronaviruses venezuelan equine encephalitis virus vee replicon particles were used for the expression of the urbani sars-cov s or n proteins 154 it was demonstrated that vee particles expressing sars-cov s but not n provided complete short- and long-term protection against challenges with homologous strains in both young and senescent mice to evaluate challenges of heterologous strains a chimeric virus icgdo3-s encoding a synthetic s gene of the most genetically divergent human gdo3 strain was engineered the chimeric virus was highly resistant to neutralization with antisera directed against the urbani strain however immunization with vee particles expressing sars-cov s provided complete short-term protection against challenges with icgdo3-s in young mice but not in senescent mice the failure to protect senescent mice was addressed in another study where mice were vaccinated with vee particles expressing sars-cov s antigen packaged with either attenuated 3014 or wild-type 3000 vee glycoproteins 155 the results revealed that aged animals immunized with vee 3000-based vaccine were protected against sars-cov while mice immunized with vee 3014-based vaccine were not furthermore the superior protection was also confirmed for challenges with influenza virusrelated to the safety of vaccine development antibody-dependent enhancement ade comprises an important mechanism facilitating viral cell entry in which virions are complexed with antibodies resulting in enhanced viral replication 161 in the context of covid-19 prior infection with other coronaviruses from common cold to sars-cov may have primed covid-19 patients causing severe disease once infected with sars-cov-2 this could explain the discrepancy between the severity of disease in covid-19 patients in the hubei province in china compared to other regions of the world 162 recently a novel molecular mechanism for ade was revealed demonstrating that a neutralizing antibody binding to the coronavirus s protein can trigger a conformational change of the s protein mediating viral entry via igg fc cellular receptors 163 another issue related to vaccine development comprises the type ii cellular immunity for lung pathogenicity in this context accumulated evidence suggests that the lungs are a major site of immune regulation 164 therefore a highly regulated immune response in the lungs can protect from pathogen infection in contrast inefficient immune responses can trigger various pulmonary diseases related to sars and covid-19 lung pathology recovery requires rigorous innate and acquired immune responses and epithelial regeneration 165 however administration of epithelial growth factors such as the keratinocyte growth factor kgf might stimulate the production of ace2-expressing cells increasing the viral loadan immunotherapeutic approach of great interest relates to the use of plasma from convalescent covid-19 patients convalescent plasma has previously been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis andor treatment of sars and mers 166 in the context of covid-19 in a case study a patient with severe covid-19 was treated with convalescent plasma from six donors 167 the anti-sars-cov igm responses from the convalescent plasma were weak but high titers of igg were obtained the treatment allowed the patient to be released from mechanical ventilation 11 days after plasma transfusion and then transferred to a general ward in another case study five critically ill covid-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards were treated with convalescent plasma obtained from patients who had recovered from covid-19 168 the patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation and had been treated with antiviral agents and methylprednisolone showed a normalized body temperature within 34 days and their viral load decreased and became negative within 12 days moreover sars-cov-2-specific elisa and neutralizing antibody titers increased ards resolved in four patients after 12 days and three patients did not need mechanical ventilation after two weeks three patients were discharged from the hospital and the two remaining patients were in stable condition obviously the limited number of patients and study design do not permit an evaluation of the efficacy of the treatment and further larger clinical trials are requiredin summary there are no efficient antiviral drugs or vaccines currently available for covid-19 however due to the extent of the current covid-19 pandemic it seems like the whole world has come together to conquer the outbreak there seems to be enormous political and economic will to support research and development efforts in an unprecedented way the positive outcome is that all avenues are explored including antiviral drugs in the form of existing drugs for other viral diseases which should be subjected to thorough well-planned clinical evaluation moreover new drugs targeting sars-cov receptors in the form of small molecules and monoclonal antibodies and gene silencing approaches preventing sars-cov replication are being exploredas drug development and particularly antiviral drugs used for other indications have seen a renaissance of clinical trials for covid-19 it is appropriate to summarize recent clinical findings in this context remdesivir was applied for compassionate use in 53 hospitalized covid-19 patientsof which 22 were in the us 22 in europe or canada and 9 in japan 169 thirty-six of the 53 patients 68 showed clinical improvement 25 patients were discharged and 7 died additionally covid-19 patients were subjected to a clinical trial for remdesivir in china 170 of the 237 patients enrolled in the study 158 received remdesivir and 79 were in the placebo group the study indicated that remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits although numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement was observed on 29 april 2020 gilead the manufacturer of remdesivir put out a press release on preliminary data on their phase iii simple trials in covid-19 patients 171 the first of the two randomized open-label multicenter simple trials in 397 patients demonstrated that the time of clinical improvement for 50 of patients was 10 days in the group receiving intravenous remdesivir for 5 days and 11 days after 10 days of treatment compoared to 15 days for the control group and more than half of the patients in both groups were discharged from the hospital by day 14 the plan is to extend the study by enrolling an additional 5600 patients and conducting trials at 180 sites in china france germany hong kong italy japan korea the netherlands singapore spain sweden switzerland taiwan the united kingdom and the united states in the second simple trial the safety and efficacy of 5- and 10-day dosing duration of intravenous remdesivir will be compared to standard of care treatment of covid-19 patients with the first results expected by the end of may 2020 regarding hydroxychloroquine initial clinical evaluation in 20 patients was conducted in france as described earlier 106 although the study indicated some therapeutic effect of hydroxychloroquine and at least 80 trials on chloroquine hydroxychloroquine or their combination with other drugs have been registered globally one should be cautious as many proposals are based on in vitro studies animal models or experiences from other viral diseases 172 for instance a chinese trial in more than 100 patients demonstrated superiority of chloroquine phosphate compared to control treatment in inhibition of pneumonia exacerbation 173 moreover in a placebo-controlled randomized trial of two different doses of hydroxychloroquine in 62 patients with radiological conformation of pneumonia but without severe hypoxia small improvements in body temperature and cough were registered only for the higher dose 174 however the results from the lower dose were not described the endpoints specified in the published protocol differed from those reported and the trial was terminated prematurely 175 supporters of hydroxychloroquine have referred to the history of wide and safe use of the drug however hydroxychloroquine will potentially expose patients to serious cutaneous adverse reactions 176 hepatic failure 177 and ventricular arrhythmias when co-administered with azithromycin 178in the context of lopinavirritonavir a randomized controlled open-label trial conducted on 199 covid-19 patients showed no difference related to clinical improvement compared to the standard-care control group 87 detectable viral rna levels and mortality numbers were similar for the two groups gastrointestinal adverse events were more common for patients treated with lopinavirritonavir but serious adverse events were more frequent in the standard-care group the efficacy of lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol against coronavirus infection elacoi single-blind randomized controlled trial in china included 44 patients with mild or moderate clinical status taking lopinavirritonavir or arbidol umifenovir 179 the study showed no differences in the time to negative pharyngeal sars-cov-2 pcr detection pyrexia cough or lung ct findings between the treatment and control groups however in the lopinavirritonavir group 381 of patients deteriorated to severecritical status compared to 125 and 143 for the arbidol and control groups respectively no adverse events were registered in the arbidol and control groups in contrast gastrointestinal and deranged liver adverse events were seen after lopinavirritonavir treatmentoverall although drugs developed for other infectious diseases might provide alternative treatment strategies for covid-19 when evaluated in well-designed and well-executed clinical trials development of prophylactic drugs and vaccines targeting specific structures of sars-cov-2 seems like the preferred approach in the context of vaccine development utilization of purified epitope peptides and antigens and cellular or viral delivery systems should all be explored in parallel to achieve maximum success in a minimum time frame not surprisingly more than 60 vaccine projects are in progress at pre-clinical or clinical levels 180 these initiatives apply all possible means of delivery including mrna plasmid dna non-replicating viral vectors inactivated and live attenuated virus and protein subunitsit will also be necessary to look ahead to the possibility of preventing sars-cov-2 outbreaks in the future and if not to be better prepared for a second or third wave of coronavirus or any other pandemic it is important to understand the origin of sars-cov-2 rather than place blame on bats for the cause of the pandemic 181 on several occasions it has been pointed out that bats are the only flying mammals how wrong is this in fact human beings are the real flying mammals jetting around the world at an ever-accelerating pace and frequency only last year an estimated 45 billion passengers took to the skies furthermore in defense of bats recent findings suggest that pangolins are the prime suspects as the source of sars-cov-2 although it has yet to be confirmed 182 in any case all trails lead back to humans as pangolins are sought after for their meat and scales instead of the blame game the focus should now be on accelerated efforts to develop novel safe and efficacious prophylactic and therapeutic approaches in the form of coronavirus drugs and vaccines
companies that have the skill to be able to do it are not going to just sit around and have a warm facility ready to go for when you need it said anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at nih usa and a member of the white house coronavirus task force at a panel discussion florko 2020 he has been aware of the mood of vaccine-manufacturing big pharma which has not changed much since the 1980s and is largely driven by a few very pertinent questions will the demand fade away with the end of the outbreak will the people choose sometimes due to foolish reasons of vaccine hesitancy not to use the product what would be the timeline to reach breakeven and create wealth with negligible prospects for profits most drug makers have been neglecting emerging infectious disease areas however due to the present spread of the covid-19 pandemic which has claimed at the time of writing this article 217192 lives and infected 3117204 individuals so far across all the continents except antarctica the need for vaccines have rekindled new interests and with a higher enthusiasm johns hopkins university 2020 this can be understood from the rapidity in response to contain the outbreak and designing modalities for treatment according to reports from institute pasteur shanghai the first notice on treatments provided for pneumonia from hospitals in wuhan china was received on 30th december 2019 within 8 days the coronavirus was identified and by 10th january 2020 the very first genome of the virus was shared by the university of sydney on behalf of the chinese academy of sciences fontanet 2020 huang et al2020 consequent to that a number of efforts are being made to socially contain the outbreak screen available drugs for repurposing for covid-19 and design specific vaccines against the new coronavirus this review highlights the genomic features of coronavirus that should be considered for vaccine design current innovations in vaccine technology global efforts and future challenges in vaccine developments for covid-19covid-19 is a new infectious disease of the respiratory tract with chances of developing fulminant pneumonia similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and is caused by the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 which spreads through contact with respiratory droplets from nose and mouth chan et al2020 who 2020a notably 80 of people who are exposed or infected do not develop the active disease and show mild symptoms of seasonal flu and recover without major treatment however its estimated rate of incidence is much higher and is in the range of 2060 in comparison with 8 for flu and initial observations concludes that those developing severe disease require hospitalization for a period twice as much as that for acute flu lenski 2020 it originated in the hubei province of china in late 2019 and spread rapidly around the world through human-to-human transmission along the international air-travel routes the case fatality rate for covid-19 at the time of writing this article stands at 10 times more than 01 as reported for the seasonal flu lenski 2020 sars-cov-2 is the third member of the pathogenic coronavirus after sars-cov and mers-cov causes the middle east respiratory syndrome that shows severe pathology in humans among few others that only cause mild clinical symptoms like the flu cui et al2019 in the absence of a clinically proven effective treatment regime current therapies for covid-19 mainly receive supportive care supplemented by different combinations of anti-retroviral drugs a few fda approved drugs and immune therapies are being repurposed and currently in clinical trials at several stages and available only on compassionate grounds they have been proven efficacious in controlling sars influenza hiv and the ebola virus replication by either targeting the viral rna polymerase or the poly-protein protease or by boosting host immunity as adjunct therapy harrison 2020 convalescent plasma from recovered individuals and monoclonal antibody therapies which showed some success during the ebola outbreak in western africa are being developed van griensven et al2016 these antibodies will also form the basis for the serological diagnosis of asymptomatic spreaders which are absent at the moment however here we will restrict our discussion to the multiple vaccines being developed against sars-cov-2from the entire initial set of five genome sequences available it was concluded that the new coronavirus is 999 identical among themselves suggesting its recent entry into humans zhou et al2020 all the 3365 viral genomes known today form a tight cluster based on phylogeny and show evidences of only 20 mutational events much lower than the expected rate of 104 substitutions per site per year this slow evolution is despite carrying rna as the genome and much to the advantage for vaccine researchers dong et al2020 the closest match with 8896 overall identity is that of the bat-derived beta-coronaviruses indicating a zoonotic origin of the disease similar to sars and mers but genetically distinct from the respective coronaviruses andersen et al 2020 interestingly genomic and evolutionary evidence places the coronavirus found in malayan pangolins pangolin-cov as the next best match with greater than 91 identity thus hinting at the anteater as a possible intermediate host to the new coronavirus after spillover from bats like the palm civets and the dromedary camels in case of sars-cov and mers-cov respectively zhang et al2020 further the study posits pangolins-cov as the possible common ancestor for the human and bat versions based on the key amino acid residues present in its surface protein and crucial for interaction with the host receptor recombination events among the small sub-genomic regions are very common in coronaviruses due to the high level of co-infection that exists in their hosts therefore tracing the evolutionary history of coronaviruses can be quite challenging and debatableits positive-strand rna genome consists of six major open reading frames and accessory genes coding for the typical non-structural proteins including the rna-dependent rna polymerase proteases and the structural proteins including the matrix m envelope e spike s and nucleoprotein n the surface spike s glycoprotein is responsible for binding to the human cell surface receptor followed by membrane fusion and entry figure 1 de wit et al2016 this spike protein is also pivotal for determining host specificity estimating the capacity of disease transmission and for production of neutralizing antibody in human generally the spike protein of coronaviruses consists of a signal peptide extracellular trans-membrane and intracellular regions the host-recognizing extracellular domain responsible for cell membrane fusion is divided by a polybasic cleavage site into a receptor binding s1 domain and the s2 domain andersen et al 2020 when it comes to sequence identity at the amino acid level which determines molecular recognition to the host receptor the s1 domain shows only 68 identity in comparison with the bat version expectedly phylogenetic analysis also places the receptor binding domain to a lineage closer to that of the sars-cov version thus suggesting a binding to the same angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 lu et al2020 zhou et al2020 further it underscores the emergence and reservoirs of sars-cov-2 which originated from bats but may have jumped into pangolins with a plausible long period of natural selection in human or human-like ace-2 the receptor binding domain appears to have accumulated mutation at five amino acid positions for optimizing binding to host following an early zoonotic transfer much before november 2019 andersen et al2020 an educated speculation indicates that a covid-19-type epidemic may recur at any time in the future by a different sars-cov-2 variant evolving from the early isolates under selective pressure in animals further emphasizing the need for a vaccinevaccination strategies can be effectively used to reduce disease severity control transmission by viral shedding and prevent future infections vaccines are usually directed to induce both arms of the adaptive immune response producing neutralizing antibody that prevents attachment to host cells and activate the bodys t killer cells that recognize and kill infected cells vaccine candidates are chosen from the various approaches available as per the level of protection required the simplest method involves introducing a virus into the body after inactivation by chemicals gamma irradiation or heat proteins expressed on the dead viral surface serves as antigen and induce the production of neutralizing antibodies as in the case of the early polio vaccine figure 1 bandyopadhyay et al2015 another method involves introducing weakened or attenuated versions of the virus that slowly replicates inside the host cell but provides enough viral antigen to induce an immune response like the oral polio vaccine rabies vaccine or the bcg vaccine given at birth to prevent childhood tuberculosis administering a non-virulent organism is less safe than the inactivated virus and has been the cause for disease outbreak but is much superior in terms of establishing a mild infection necessary for mounting a successful adaptive immune response afrough et al2019 developing an attenuated vaccine in a short time is however challenging as it requires isolating a non-virulent strain through several rounds of time-consuming sub-culturing in the laboratory and requires adequate knowledge about the virulence factors expressed by the coronavirus furthermore the level and type of adaptive immune response sometimes depend on the strain used in the product one each of the above types is currently under preclinical development to estimate efficacy and toxicity formaldehyde-inactivated formulation is being developed by sinovac biotech in china while a genetically modified poorly replicating coronavirus is being developed in a partnership between codagenix usa and serum institute of india india using their proprietary deoptimization technology platform earlier used for developing vaccines for zika dengue and influenza who 2020ba more targeted approach involves inducing adaptive immunity by introducing immunogenic viral proteins or their fragments to generate both antibodies and cell-mediated immune response delivering the antigenic epitopes with optimal levels of antigen presentation required for a broad protective immunity is vital for a successful immune response the high degree of similarities in the genome structural proteins and even the host attachment receptor indicates the existence of a possible similarity in the immune responses against the two sars coronaviruses this also means that conclusions made from studies on sars-cov proteins might help in determining the immunogenic determinants required for vaccine development in addition to the high level of potent antibodies against the s and n proteins of sars-cov which were incidentally short-lived strong t-cell responses that provide long term protections were detected for the same structural proteins tang et al2011 intriguingly when the experimentally identified dominant b-cell and t-cell epitopes of sars-cov were mapped to the amino acid sequence of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins 27 t-cell epitopes matched the sars-cov-2 proteins without a single mutation further the epitopes located within the predicted receptor binding domain of the spike protein were associated with the most prevalent major histocompatibility complex mhc alleles in the human population ahmed et al2020 similarly a large number of b-cell epitopes found complete sequence identity with that of the nucleocapsid protein and both s1 and s2 domains of the spike protein the prevalence of epitopes corresponding to the less exposed s2 domain however indicates its possible access to antibodies post attachment to the host cell this analysis also helps preclude the apprehensions about the mismatches observed in the receptor binding region of the s1 domain from the structural analysis of the spike protein wrapp et al2020 antibodies raised against the s2 domain of sars-cov spike protein may cross-react and neutralize sars-cov-2 thus positing an excellent opportunity for repurposing the candidate monoclonal antibodies that did not cross phase i trials for sars vaccine development tian et al2020 therefore the spike protein of sars-cov can be confidently placed as the most potent antigenic determinant against which candidate vaccines should be developed
another important consideration in designing vaccines particularly in case of rna viruses that generally have higher mutation rates is the antigenic drift or genetic variability which plays a pivotal role in choosing the best genome sequence of the viral strain for vaccine development and this means we need to sequence the sars-cov-2 genome from as many regions possible from around the world dong et al2020 choosing the right vaccine candidate is as much an art as a science since finding the viral components that will not trigger severe inflammation but can provide a protective immune memory is not trivial more so when nothing much is known about the immune pathology of the disease and the immune evasion strategies employed by the virus to evade the host defense and most of our assumption is based on studies conducted on sars-covsince a virus is an obligate intracellular replicative entity that requires the host cell for its proliferation all vaccine strategies are aimed at preventing the attachment of the virus to the host cell at the molecular interface this recognition is characterized by binding of the viral surface protein spike glycoprotein in sars-cov-2 to the receptor on human cells ace2 lu et al antibodies generated against the surface protein antigen helps to neutralize this receptor binding thus making protein subunit vaccines very popular however by themselves these proteins would normally be unstable and may lose their molecular structure soon after injection rendering it difficult for the immune cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus furthermore the free-floating viral protein may change its shape to a post-recognition stable conformation which is very different from the pre-recognition state as displayed on the surface of the virus the molecular clamping approach uses joining key structural polypeptides at several regions in the protein structure to efficiently retain the original shape of the immunogenic epitopes thus stimulating a stronger response uniquest 2014with advances made in understanding the replication and pathogenesis of a wide variety of viruses along with the development of tools for genetic manipulation it is now possible to generate safer attenuated vaccines expressing recombinant viral protein antigens from a proxy infection model robert-guroff 2007 replicating vectors in use includes adenovirus measles virus poxvirus and vesicular stomatitis virus vsv humphreys and sebastian 2018 these viruses are either non-pathogenic in humans vsv or carry a genetically modified genome which neutralizes their virulent nature the coding sequence for the required proteinsubunit antigen is attached to the genome for optimal expression assembly and packaging into the recombinant virus two major advantages underscore their potential as a vaccine of choice its ability to elicit a complete innate and adaptive immune response that is also tunable in terms of type and intensity of the response is its biggest advantage the proxy natural infection model employed also allows the induction of co-stimulatory immune molecules that provide an adjuvant effect second its replicative nature allows achieving similar protection at a 34 log lower dosage vectors based on measles virus have been considered for vaccines against hiv-aids and sars due to its potential to provide lifelong immunity as a result of its ability to infect the antigen-presenting cells dendritic cells and macrophages zuniga et al2007in this case the genes essential for replication of the adenovirus are deleted among others from the adenoviral genome and replaced with antigenic protein coding genes at the locus robert-guroff 2007 the most popular modified vaccinia virus ankara mva is a natural attenuated version of poxvirus through repeated sub-culture in chicken cells mva has lost its ability to replicate and evade immune surveillance in human cells kennedy and greenberg 2009 replication-deficient vectors can accommodate larger gene inserts and also provide stability in terms of not regaining virulence when compared with the replication-competent versionsone of the problems of using the protein subunit vaccine has been presenting the antigen in its most stable and effective conformation vlps are composed of multiple structural proteins which upon recombinant expression have the ability to self-assemble into nanostructures enclosing the capsid proteins within itself syomin and ilyin 2019 the vlps can have a lipid envelope originating from the cell membrane producing them in the form of budding and can also be chimeric in nature displaying an envelope protein from another virus a wide range of production platforms expressing and correctly folding the antigenic proteins are available in bacterial and yeast systems insect and mammalian cell lines and even in transgenic plants in addition since vlps lack a genome of its own they offer a similar level of stability as non-replicating vectors thus offering the safety of subunit vaccine and efficacy of the live-attenuated vaccine togethernucleic acidbased vaccines have emerged as a better alternative to live and inactivated vaccines for treatments against emerging pathogens as the dna expressing the pathogens protein can be produced in a short time this does not involve growing the virus in the laboratory and gives equivalent protective immunity as other forms in this case the dna sequence is introduced often facilitated by nano-carriers directly to the cells of a specific tissue once they make their way into the nucleus with the help of a targeting sequence viral surface protein production driven from an optimized promoter is outsourced to the host cells natural machinery hobernik and bros 2018 dna vaccines are safe stable and large quantities can be produced in a short time through cost-effective manufacturing processes which is crucial for distribution in low-income regionsfirst identified while studying immunization with tumor antigens for cancer therapy mrna vaccines are now extensively studied for emerging pathogens like dna vaccines they represent the new generation therapies and being mrna in nature avoid the risk of being integrated into the host genome as a bonus they come in two flavors traditional mrna-based vaccines and self-amplifying mrna vaccines both work on the strategy of using the host cell transcription machinery to produce the target proteins and induce adaptive immunity pardi et al2018 while the former is replication-deficient and contains the antigens mrna the latter codes for a modified genome of an rna virus where the target antigen of choice replaces the viruses native genes coding for the structural proteins the resulting virus can express the heterologous antigenic genes in the cytoplasm in high numbers but cannot package itself into a functional virus while the mrna can amplify itself using the rna dependent rna polymerase coded in its genome geall et al2012all of the above innovations are being rapidly utilized to develop multiple vaccines against the new coronavirus several epidemiological models predict that the present pandemic will stay for quite some time albeit in several small pockets around the world and reappear in the subsequent waves of infection but will coronavirus usher in a new era in developing innovative vaccines for emerging infectious disease beyond covid-19 we will have to wait for the results of the clinical trials to come outvaccine development for infectious diseases is equally challenging similar to drug development and normally takes the same amount of time in the case of covid-19 this is even harder because of unknown disease pathogenesis unavailability of a validated animal model and success is dependent on the human clinical trials despite all this the scale and severity of the current pandemic have attracted around 35 companies  big pharma small biotechnology firms and university spinoffs  to develop a vaccine against sars-cov-2 lee 2020 who 2020b thanks to the attractive funding from two government agencies of the usa biomedical advanced research and development authority department of health usa and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases national institutes of health usa work has been initiated on as many as 44 candidate vaccines table 1 which are currently in clinical and preclinical stages the covid-19 outbreak has also highlighted innovations in funding mechanism through the involvement of coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi a global alliance-based vaccine accelerator for emerging infectious diseases founded in 2017 by the governments of india and norway with initial support from the world economic forum and philanthropic organizations like the bill and melinda gates foundation usa and wellcome trust uk this generous funding has enabled several small biotechnology firms and academic institutions to triage their diverse candidates which is essential in situations where it is hard to predict which one and at which stage will reach a cul-de-sac the new candidates are not only based on traditional approaches they are also being built on the existing vaccines and leveraging on platforms used to develop the sars or the mers vaccines it is important to mention that although there are great similarities between the immunogenic epitopes of the two sars-covs vaccines for covid-19 do not have to be similar to the ones proposed against other coronaviruses the newly developed vaccine against the ebola zaire virus by glaxosmithkline uk was produced using the adenoviral vectors used for an hiv vaccine gsk 2016 institute pasteur has proposed to use the measles vaccine virus vector backbone used earlier to prepare vaccines for ebola zika and lassa fever who 2020bphase i trials for toxicity and immunogenicity have started on healthy adult volunteers with funding from cepi for a lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mrna vaccine mrna-1273 co-developed by nihs virus research centre niaid and moderna inc another frontrunner in starting the clinical trials is cansino biologics in partnership with chinas academy of military medical sciences institute of biotechnology this candidate is based on a non-replicating adenoviral vector used for ebola while university of oxfords jenner institute has proposed to start phase i trial for a non-replicating adenoviral vector-based vaccine backbone chadox1 due to its proven efficacy among older people with underlying co-morbidities devlin 2020 among others candidates that are undergoing preclinical testing are mrna-based vaccines from germanys curevac funded by european union and cepi and biontech co-developed with pfizer both companies are repurposing their leads from personalized cancer treatments to deliver vaccines that are tunable as per the level of immune response required curevac 2020 pfizer 2020 like moderna another american company novavax has redeveloped a spike proteinbased vaccine for sars in combination with its proprietary matrix adjuvants institute pasteur is leading a consortium with university of pittsburgh and themis biosciences austria to work on a replicating measles vaccine virus vector technology based on sars-cov pasteur institute 2020 with the availability of a high-resolution molecular structure of the trimeric spike protein researchers at the university of queensland australia are using their disruptive molecular clamp technology which helps the viral proteins to maintain their shape thus enabling the immune system to mount a stronger response university of queensland 2020 it is being combined with glaxosmithklines proprietary adjuvants in order to generate a long-lasting immune response a lower adjuvanted dose allows immunization of a larger number of individuals with a low amount of the protein product the same adjuvant-based potentiation is also being offered for clover biopharmaceuticals trimeric spike protein vaccine candidate a very promising and widely discussed dna vaccine candidate ino-4800 being developed by inovio pharmaceuticals has succeeded in raising funds from cepi although dna-based vaccines have not received any regulatory approvals in the past and the company has not delivered any vaccine since its inception it has committed to start clinical trials in april 2020 and has received support from the bill and melinda gates foundation to develop an intradermal electroporation device for vaccine delivery linnane 2020intriguingly large-scale phase iii randomized control trials have started in australia and netherlands to check for the effectiveness of the bcg vaccine a live-attenuated strain of mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis in cattle in reducing incidences and disease severity among the healthcare workers exposed to sars-cov-2 byrne 2020 this recent development stems from a report which claimed to have found an excellent correlation on country-wise severity of covid-19 symptoms to its national immunization program for protection against childhood tb and tb meningitis miller et al 2020 it is also not surprising to note that countries practicing compulsory bcg vaccination are also socio-economically backward therefore reports of low morbidity and mortality from covid-19 may be related to low co-morbidities contributed by lifestyle diseases and not necessarily a protection offered by bcg vaccination the study draws a link between high mortalities in iran which started bcg vaccination later in 1984 with the lack of non-specific protection among the older population the non-specific protection by bcg against viral infections is plausibly offered by the induction of innate immune memory again a very new concept in itself that results in enhanced production of immune modulators and cytotoxic activity of immune cells nevertheless if true this might help to provide some levels of protection until a new specific vaccine is made available moorlag et al2019 however it would be interesting to learn about the outcome of these large trials with respect to the degree of protection achieved as different strains of bcg is known to provide a wide range of efficacies in the case of tuberculosis in adultsusually it takes 1015 years of development through the classical path using inactivated or live attenuated vaccines after generating long-term efficacy data during the ebola emergency this time was brought down to 5 years for candidates that are based on viral vector vaccines and involved running a few key steps of phase ii trials in parallel as the covid-19 contagion rapidly engulfs a quarter of the worlds population inovio pharmaceutical has ambitiously accelerated this timeline to publish the human clinical trials data by the fall of 2020 which is remarkably less than a year inovio pharmaceuticals 2020 this is also expected keeping in mind that there might not be enough patient volunteers available to participate in the human trials later however the test cohort should not miss out on including different age groups ethnicity gender and pregnant women finally data needs to be collected for any rare occurrence of immunization-mediated enhancement of severe illness after infection this is primarily caused by the development of sub-neutralizing antibodies which promotes excessive viral entry to the host cells wan et al2020 however when it comes to manufacturing and delivery the process faces myriad of new challenges as often experienced by the pharmaceutical industry large quantities of the candidate vaccine are generally required to start a full-scale phase iii trial and immunizations thereafter moreover each product will require a customized scale-up technology that will have to be developed more and more pharmaceutical companies have shifted focus to the risk-averse lifestyle disease and this has resulted in their losing the skillset and expertise required for vaccine development this needs to be re-built by continuous financial commitments with no immediate guarantee for rewards and an unprecedented level of international cooperation which is thankfully quite visible another important question that may arise and needs some clarity is selecting the target cohort for immunization healthier individuals might be naturally protected and more vulnerable while the needy older population might show problems of a poor immune response and require higher doses certainly healthcare workers need them the most in our preparedness for the next wave of infection and perhaps also the traders in the wet markets if they continue to be in businessin conclusion once we have the vaccine and hopefully the apex of the pandemic is over an effective policy needs to be carefully prepared to develop a global access framework for equitable distribution in the developing world while protecting intellectual property and market rights distribution of the vaccines should be made as far as possible based on humanitarian benevolence centrally through international agencies including global alliance for vaccines and immunization gavi unicef and who allowing the vaccine producing countries or the richest economies to stockpile the doses for the native population in the absence of a national emergency as seen in the case of h1n1 influenza virus vaccine in 2009 will jeopardize all the momentum gained thus far fidler 2010the pleomorphic and enveloped coronaviruses are a genus in the coronaviridae family and contain a 30 kb positive-sense rna genome 1 the viral envelop contains envelope e protein transmembrane m and spike s glycoprotein and surrounds a disordered or flexible nucleocapsid n 2 most coronaviruses infect wild animals with narrow host range and cause self-limiting diseases 1 human coronaviruses such as oc43 229e nl63 and hku1 are associated with self-limiting respiratory tract infections 3 however two zoonotic coronaviruses the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov cross the species barrier to infect humans and have caused severe acute respiratory disease sard and thousands of deaths 45 since december of 2019 a new sars-like coronavirus named sars-cov-2 raised intense concerns not only within china but also internationally 6 importantly sars-cov-2 showed approximately 8090 of genome sequence homology with previously identified sars-cov strains suggesting an evolving similarity in virological properties 7receptor-mediated entry is the first step of a viral infection in the host cell receptor binding domain rbd of the viral s protein of sars-cov or mers-cov attaches to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 hace2 or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 hdpp4 proteins respectively the hace2 has been also believed to be the receptor of sars-cov-2 7 after entry into cells these three coronaviruses sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 replicate efficiently to produce progeny viruses give rise to cytopathogenesis and establish productive infection sars-cov of 2002 caused over 8098 cases and 774 deaths in over 30 countries mers-cov of 2012 resulted in more than 2182 cases and 779 deaths in 27 countries sars-cov-2 has caused over two million cases in more than 213 countries areas or territories with over 150000 deaths up to date 17 april 2020 therefore it is highly emergent to obtain the effective clinical medication and vaccines to prevent and treat coronavirus infectionanimal models are critical for us to understand the viral infection and pathogenesis moreover animal models are essential for development and preclinical evaluation of a vaccine or an antiviral agent an ideal animal model is the one that mimics viral infection and diseases in humans in multiple aspects including morbidity viral load typical clinical symptoms host immune responses and mortality therefore the urgent need of preventing and controlling coronavirus infection necessitates the search for an optimal sars-cov-2 animal model based on the published studies animal models of sars-cov and mers-cov include civet cats camelidaes monkeys mice hamsters ferrets rabbits and other potential hosts figure 1 we aim to summarize and discuss their ability to mimic the disease symptoms and natural history of coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 in humans as well as their usage in development of vaccine and antiviral drugs furthermore humanized animal models available to support coronavirus infection and pathogenesis might provide new options to overcome the limitations of the traditional coronavirus animal models additionally animal models for pseudovirus are also prospected to avoid the concern of biosafety
clinical symptoms of sars-cov- and mers-cov-infected patients at early time include fever chills coughing malaise myalgia headache diarrhoea vomiting and nausea 8 furthermore immunohistochemistry ihc detection demonstrated the presence of viral antigens in lung tissues the covid-19 patients present similar symptoms to those of sars-cov- or mers-cov-infected patients while some patients may show no typical clinical symptom in the early stage of infection 9 the typical pathological features of severe cases include prolonged inflammation with destruction and desquamation of alveolar pneumocytes hyaline-membrane formation interstitial inflammatory infiltration and interalveolar hemorrhage multinucleated giant cells were also observed in the tissues of covid-19 patients 10 over 70 of covid-19 patients were diagnosed as pneumonia by chest computed tomography ct to be admitted to hospital ct images showed the typical features of ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing in lungs 9 recent clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated sars-cov-2 caused the nosocomial infection and fecal-oral transmission its infection results in immune abnormality and multiple organ failures of the covid-19 patients moreover a long incubation period 29 days was observed in some covid-19 cases 11 suggesting a risk of occult and chronic infection although sars-cov-2 displays a lower rate of severe cases and case fatality than sars-cov and mers-cov its high infectivity widely spreading and huge infection population have become a catastrophic medical burden and critical social problemthe studies of coronavirus have been greatly benefited from the using nhps as the infection and disease models the old- and new-world monkeys include rhesus macaques macaca mulatta cynomolgus macaques macaca fascicularis african green monkeys chlorocebus sabaeus common marmosets callithrix jacchus squirrel monkeys saimiri and mustached tamarins saguinus mystax all of them have been demonstrated to be permissive for sars-cov infection to cause symptoms such as fever diarrhea and clinical manifestations of pneumonitis 1516 the african green monkeys cynomolgus and rhesus macaques showed mild symptoms after infection of sars-cov urbani strain and they produced neutralizing antibodies nabs that might help to clear the virus 17 in another study on rhesus macaques challenged with the sars-cov pumc01 strain transient severe pneumonia was observed 18 meanwhile greenough et al reported sard with fever diarrhea hepatitis and multi-organ failure in common marmosets around four to seven days post sars-cov infection 19in some studies the rhesus macaques and common marmosets were used as a model for mers-cov infection however mers-cov infections in the two nhps caused different levels of consequences first the symptoms in the common marmoset model was much more severe and viral yield was approximately thousand-fold higher than those in the rhesus macaque model secondly viral replication in the common marmosets reached peak level and the viral infection caused severe pneumonia within four to six days post mers-cov infection 20 however mers-cov infection in the rhesus macaques did not produce a high viral load and didnt cause severe symptoms 21 the rhesus macaque has been demonstrated permissive for sars-cov-2 infection via ocular conjunctival route 22 sars-cov-2 induced a transient infection and mild pneumonia in the rhesus macaques however severe pneumonia and death were not observed meanwhile the infected rhesus macaques pounced nabs that effectively prevent re-challenge of sars-cov-2 23 more recently the cynomolgus macaques and common marmosets were also demonstrated available to support sars-cov-2 infection 24 in this study rhesus macaques were demonstrated more susceptible to sars-cov2 infection as compared to cynomolgus macaques and common marmosetsferrets has been used as a model for the studies of respiratory pathogens including influenza virus ifv respiratory syncytial virus rsv adenovirus and coronavirus up on infection of sars-cov the ferret presented fever and sneezing associated with detectable viral titres in the upper respiratory tract 25 however severe symptoms and deaths caused by viral infection were not observed and ferrets do not support replication of mers-cov 26 recently ferrets were demonstrated available to support sars-cov-2 infection by two different groups 1427 it was reported that sars-cov infects the golden syrian hamster 28 viruses seeded in the upper and lower respiratory tract and reached a peak level at three days post sars-cov infection and declined and cleared within seven to ten days the infection of sars-cov resulted in mild and transient pneumonia by contrast similar infection course and symptoms were recently observed in hamsters that infected with sars-cov-2 29 hamsters have been demonstrated not susceptible to mers-cov infection 28 interestingly primary sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection in ferrets and hamsters elicited a strong nab response that protected the hosts from subsequent infections the above-mentioned information implies that sars-cov-2 infection might induce a mild to severe pulmonary diseases in ferrets and hamsters the severities of symptom might depend on viral strains the ability of mers-cov to infect small animal species may be defected by lack of viral entry or replication surprisingly rabbits were susceptible to mers-cov infection 30 although viral nucleic acid and infectious progeny virus were detectable in lung tissues neither significant histopathological changes nor clinical symptoms were observed these findings indicate a potential route of mers-cov transmission in some common animal species however there is no reported investigation of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection in the rabbits therefore it is important to experimentally investigate whether ferret hamster and rabbit are susceptible to the infection and are able to be used as animal model of sars-cov-2several strains of mice have been tried to be intranasally infected with sars-cov urbani strain it was found that the virus poorly replicated in several young and adult inbred strains of mice balbc c57bl6 and 129s to only a low viral yield clinical illness was not observed and the virus was cleared within nine days meanwhile mice are not naturally susceptible to mers-cov infection it was later revealed that the mouse dpp4 receptor differs from human counterpart in crucial domains that is critical to bind the s protein 13 to overcome the species-specificity barrier for sars-cov or mers-cov human receptor protein hace2 or hdpp4 was expressed in mice by knocking in or transfecting a human receptor gene in mouse the studies of hace2-transgenic mice were performed at almost the same time in 2007 independently in three groups they reported that hace2-transgenic mice supported sars-cov infection and pathogenesis mccray et al demonstrated that systemic expression of hace2 under the control of an epithelial cell-specific promoter k18 resulted in lethal sars-cov infection within five days 31 tseng et al developed two lineages of transgenic mice expressing hace2 under the cag promoter 32 after sars-cov infection the two transgene-positive mice ac70 and ac63 showed high viral load clinical illness and tissue pathology the lethal lineage of mice ac70 displayed higher hace2 expressions in several organs wider spectrum of clinical illness including wasting symptom severe pneumonia and death rather than the non-lethal lineage mice ac63 with lower hace2 expressions yang et al generated another non-lethal lineage mouse that expresses hace2 under mouse ace2 promoter 33 another study further revealed the differential virological and immunological outcomes among different hace2 transgenic lineages 34to rapidly generate a mers-cov infecting mouse model zhao et al transduced common adult balbc and c57bl6 mice with an adenoviral vector expressing hdpp4 ad5-hdpp4 after mers-cov infection these mice showed interstitial pneumonia expressed viral antigen in the lungs and lost weight but deaths were not observed later hdpp4-transgenic mice were generated to mimic severe mers-cov infection and lethal pathogenesis agrawal et al developed a transgenic mouse that expresses hdpp4 under the control of the cag promoter 35 this hdpp4-transgenic mouse was fully permissive for mers-cov infection to cause severe respiratory illness that led to death within six days after infection remarkably high viral load was detected in multiple organs and pathological changes were consistent with extensive inflammation throughout the infection course in addition mers-cov infection induced profound acute innate inflammatory responses within the lungs of this model in 2017 li et al developed another hdpp4-transgenic mouse and demonstrated that mers-cov infection induced lethal lung disease is viral load dependent 36 similar to the model by agrawal et al activated innate immune cells accumulated in the lungs after mers-cov infection recently yoshikawa et al observed the cytokine storm in a newly generated hdpp4-transgenic mouse 37these receptor-transgenic or -transduced mice have been widely used to study the pathogenesis mechanism and evaluate vaccines and other therapeutics table 2 because hace2 has been recently demonstrated as the receptor of sars-cov-2 in a cell infectious model 7 the hace2 transgenic mice are supposed as an option to study sars-cov-2 infection and pathogenesis recently bao et al demonstrated that hace2-transgenic mice are able to support sars-cov-2 infection 38 it is observed that mice presented weight loss virus replication infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes in alveolar interstitium and accumulation of macrophages in alveolar cavities from three to five days post sars-cov-2 infection however no significant histopathological lesions or viral antigens were observed in the other organs including myocardium liver spleen kidney cerebrum intestine and testis furthermore pneumonia became mild with focal lesion areas at seven days post infection suggesting a non-lethal and self-limiting infection course this lineage of hace2-transgenic mouse cannot mimic the severe and lethal cases of covid-19 which necessity attempts in other lineages with different hace2 promotors alternatively transduction of ad-hace2 in young adult balbc and c57bl6 mice might provide an avenue for rapid and robust generation of sars-cov-2 infectious mouse model
in order to promote the replication of sars-cov in young adult immunocompetent mouse three mouse-adapted ma viral strains were developed by serial passage of sars-cov urbani strain in mouse respiratory tract in contrast to the original urbani strain the sars-cov ma sarsma strains such as ma15 ma20 and v2163 replicated in the lungs of mice to a higher titre that is proportionally associated with pathological changes dissemination of the virus to extrapulmonary sites and mortality table 3 as shown in figure 2a several mutations occurred in orf1a nsp5 and nsp9 orf1b nsp13 and s protein it is believed that the combination of these genetic changes enhanced the viral virulence 39 implying the importance of these proteins in viral pathogenesis in brief the three sarsma strains induced sard in mice that is similar to the clinical symptoms observed in human cases of sars-cov infection

ferrets hamsters and mice are not naturally susceptible to mers-cov infection because mers-cov s protein cannot bind dpp4 of these animals thus progeny infectious virus could not be isolated from these animals after initial infection and the mers-cov adaptation is unlikely to be carried out as mentioned above mers-cov can successfully infect a hdpp4-transgenic mouse interestingly in vivo serial passage of the emc2012 strain of mers-cov in the hdpp4 knock-in mice resulted in a ma virus strain mersma that causes a fatal pulmonary disease phenotype associated with severe inflammatory responses 36 furthermore it was reported that more passages in the mouse caused more severe diseases for example the mersma strain with 21 adaptive passages emc-p21 cause 50 lethality of hdpp4 transgenic mice while the strain with 30 adaptive passages emc-p30 killed all the mice within eight days 36 moreover different mutations in mers-cov s1 receptor binding domain and s2 fusion domain occur in different plaques or clones of the passaged emc-p30 strain implying that the gene diversity has impacts on the viral entry figure 2bthe s protein of coronaviruses needs to be cleaved by host proteases to be functional the proteases include endosomal cathepsins cell surface transmembrane proteaseserine tmprss proteases furin and trypsin 40 for example sars-cov-2 uses serine protease tmprss2 in host cell to cleave s protein to activate its entry process 41 the s protein mutations enhanced infectivity of mersma strains by promoting early entry and broadening tissue tropism 42 comparing to mers strain with an uncleaved s protein mersma strain has an s protein that is pre-cleaved by furin of the infected cells and hence achieves a non-endosome cellular entry thus mutations in the protease cleaving site of s protein might alter infectivity of sars-cov-2 considering the similarity of receptor and highly gene sequence homology between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 adaptive viral strain of the novel coronavirus might be obtained after 1020 serial passage in hace2 transfected cells or animal models overall generating adaptive viral strains might become another approach to enhance the infectivity and establish an effective and lethal sars-cov-2 infection in experimental animalsseveral studies have attempted to use the immune-compromised mice to determine the role of immune effectors in the coronavirus infection first the following knock-out mice have been applied for the infection of sars-cov beige lacking functional nk cells cd1 lacking nk-t cells rag lacking t and b cells 43 however all the immune-compromised mice failed to allow the infection of sars-cov viral kinetics were not significantly different among the 57bl6 wild type beige cd1 and rag1 mice histopathological detection showed similar self-limiting bronchiolitis and mild pneumonia among these mice interestingly a prolonged viral replication and illness were observed in stat1 mice with 129s background 44 in this model viral replication is detectable until day 22 post infection indicating that a stat1 mediated type i interferon response is required to control sars-cov infection 45 the stat1 mice were also challenged with mers-cov emc-2012 strain because the lack of receptor hdpp4 clinical illness were not observed and viral replication was undetectable 46 however the hdpp4-transfected mice additional deficiency of interferon- receptor myd88 and mvas still cannot prolong the viral replication or cause severe cause throughout a mers-cov infection course 36 generally mice with targeted immune deficiency are useful tools to investigate interaction between host immunity and coronavirus besides the relatively low viral load and mild illness the immunodeficient mice are of limited value in the studies of vaccine and immunotherapyit is important to know the risk factors that affect the clinical outcomes of coronavirus infection 47 first does age play an important role in disease severity to know that an aged mouse model was used for sars-cov infection and it was found that sars-cov infection in aged mice resulted in increased mortality than that in younger mice in the studies 1214 month old balbc or c57bl6 mice developed more severe disease include viral replication weight loss ruffled fur and dehydration than that in the 612 week-old ones 48 however aged 129svev mice did not support prolonged pulmonary viral replication and cleared the virus within five days 49 interestingly the sarsma strain ma15 showed higher mortality in the 920 month aged balbc and c57bl6 mice than that in the 25 month ones 50 recently yoshikawa et al demonstrated that the immunopathology degree of mers-cov infection in the hdpp4-transgenic mouse is age dependent 37 mechanistic studies demonstrated that age-dependent increases of phospholipase pla2g2d and dysfunction of cd4 positive t cell could be the reasons for the enhanced sars-cov infection 5152 according to epidemiology data sars-cov-2 is more likely to cause severe causes and high mortality in elder people 53 overall the aged mouse model provided an opportunity to study the age-dependent susceptibility of humans to coronavirussecond does the gender has impact on infection outcomes generally the males generate mild immune responses and females mount stronger innate and adaptive immune responses and are relatively resistant to virus infections which explains why males and females showed different response patterns after infection of viruses recent studies showed the higher expression of hace2 in asian males than the females 54 epidemiological data showed gender-specific differences in sars-cov infection with males experiencing higher mortality compared to females 55 this gender-dependent increase in disease severity after pathogenic sars-cov infection was more pronounced with advancing age 55 male c57bl6 and balbc mice showed more susceptible to and higher mortality after sars-cov ma15 infection than female mice 50 in addition the male mice displayed a higher proinflammatory cytokine levels than female ones which was is independent of t and b cell responses throughout the sars-cov infection course these clinical and experimental findings imply a higher risk of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection in the elder asian males however mers-cov infection showed no difference between male and female hdpp4-transgenic mice in mortality and weight loss the epidemiological data of mers-cov infection in human with different gender is conflict some study showed high incidence and mortality among the males 56 and others showed that gender may not have impact on the infection outcome of mers-cov 5 thus it is necessary to clarify the conflicting results of gender impacts in clinical and experimental studies of mers-cov infection overall gender might be an interesting topic for further investigation for the mechanism of sars-cov-2 infection and pathogenesis in addition infection routes and inoculation doses might also have impact on the characteristics of virus shedding pathogenesis and disease outcomes in experimental animalspresumptively animal models of sars-cov might fit for the study of sars-cov-2 due to the similarities of the two viruses in pathogenesis replication viral characteristics and host receptor for viral entry therefore combination of hace2 transgenic- or transduce-mice and sars-cov-2 ma strains might result in an enhanced infection severe pathogenesis and higher mortality which resembling the clinical illness comparing to sars-cov and mers-cov the sars-cov-2 might be more complicated in transmission and pathogenesis which makes the animal studies more difficult for example sars-cov-2 infection has a long incubation time 11 more rapid transmission among populations 53 and more severe multiple organ failure 47an appropriate animal model is important to evaluate a vaccine in medical safety protective efficacy and comprehensive immune activation although many attempts of developing vaccines have been tried there is currently no approved vaccine for sars-cov and mers-cov several approaches to develop sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines were evaluated in indicated animal models that are summarized in table 4 the traditional inactivated virus vaccines use chemicals or radiation to render the viral genome non-infectious while maintaining the virion structure thus preserving antigenicity but eliminating the potential to cause productive infection animal studies have assessed the inactivated sars-cov vaccines and found that they can elicit the production of nabs and inhibit viral replication in nhps mice ferrets and hamsters however in some cases the inactivated vaccine may not arouse enough nabs for the cover or damage of dominant epitopes 57 moreover the inactivated vaccines might lack adequate cross-protection among different viral strains especially for the unknown and newly identified strains live-attenuated vaccines are produced by reducing or eliminating the virulence of a live virus typically using chemical-driven site mutation or gene deletion although the live-attenuated vaccine can elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses in mice and hamsters risk of phenotypic or genotypic reversion and disseminated infection in immunocompromised patients limit further translation 1
among all the functional structural proteins of coronavirus the s protein is an important antigen that might effectively inducing nabs to block viral binding and entry as well as stimulating robust host immune responses 58 therefore the s protein has been designed as the main target for the development of sars vaccines by different strategies including developing a s subunit using an expression vector packaging a virus-like particle delivering a dna plasmid and nanoparticle 3 these vaccine strategies showed protection effects in different animals table 4 however they are limited by the possibilities of incomplete protection the risk of antibody dependent enhancement ade include expanded infection tissue destruction cytokine storm and multiple organ failure 3 the mechanism of ade effect is complicated and not yet clearly clarified serum of inactivated sars-cov and s protein immunized mice as well as the s protein specific antibodies were demonstrated to promote viral infection and cytopathogenesis in human immune cells such as macrophage and b lymphocytes via a ph- and cysteine protease-independent fc receptor pathway 59 moreover s protein specific antibodies treatment caused fatal acute lung injury in sars-cov infected nhps by skewing macrophage mediated inflammation-resolving responses 60 in addition prior immunization with n protein might also cause severe pneumonia in mice infected with live sars-cov 61 indeed many studies showed that virus-like particle inactivated virus vaccine rdna-produced s protein vaccine led to occurrence of pulmonary and th2-type immunopathology on challenge with live sars-cov in mice suggesting hypersensitivity to sars-cov components was induced 5762 similar lung immunopathology was also observed in mice immunized with inactivated mers-cov vaccine 63 these findings suggested that a potential pathogenic effect of antibodies targeted at sars-cov-2 would be of major concern for vaccine development and antibody-based therapiesalthough the nhps were supposed to be closer to human different mouse models and ma viral strains have occupied a large proportion of these coronavirus vaccine studies for their advantages of convent and large-scale to draw a more robust conclusion due to the genetic differences the results from animals are not necessarily going to be the same in humans to the contrary many vaccines that are effective in animal experiments but showed inadequate protective effects in humans such as rsv 64 and hiv 65 nevertheless animal experiments are the essential step before trials in human for any vaccinesmore than a dozen anti-cov drugs have been tested in vitro and in vivo targeting protease and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp are the two of the most effective approaches for inhibition of viral replication mycophenolic acid an inhibitor of inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase and guanine monophosphate synthesis displayed a potential anti-mers-cov activity in cell culture 66 however in an animal study the mers-cov infected common marmosets treated with mycophenolate mofetil presented a worse outcome with more severe disease and higher viral loads in necropsied lung than those without treatment 67 ribavirin targeting rdrp and lopinavir-ritonavir that targeting 3clpro protease were approved to treat sars-cov and mers-cov patients respectively nevertheless these drugs showed limited antiviral effects upon monotherapy and have severe side effects on patients and animals including rhesus macaques common marmosets and mice in recent studies remdesivir a broad spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug showed a better anti-mers-cov activity than lopinavir and ritonavir in both in cell culture study and animal studies hdpp4 transgenic mice and nhps 6869 notably the in vitro anti-sars-cov-2 activity of remdesivir has been demonstrated in a cell culture study 70 the rbd site of the s protein is the most important target for development of nabs 58 these nabs have been well evaluated in animal models including rhesus macaques and common marmoset mice rabbits ferrets and hamster however like the vaccines abnormal immune responses and ade effects induced by the antibodies remain to be a serious issue 60the interferon signalling is a double-edged sword for therapy of coronavirus infection on one hand recombinant interferons showed preventive and antiviral effects in animal models include cynomolgus and rhesus macaques and common marmosets mice and ferrets at the early stage of sars-cov and mers-cov infection combined action of type i and type iii interferon restricts initial replication of sars-cov in the lung but fails to inhibit systemic virus spreading in mice 45 on another hand delayed administration of interferons induce dysregulated interferon signalling and inflammatory monocyte macrophages responses which cause severe transformation and lethal pneumonia in sars-cov infected mice 71 these experimental findings suggested that a precision intervention time is important for interferon therapy of coronavirus infectionhormones that used to restore cytokine storm and other host signalling pathways involved in viral replication might also considered as options to treat coronavirus infection but only a few of them were evaluated in mice 72 moreover old and new drugs associated with host endosomal surface and other proteases utilized for viral entry host receptors mediated viral entry endocytosis and endosomal acidification also showed ability to inhibit coronavirus infection in cell models respectively nevertheless unknown in vivo antiviral effects risk of toxicity and adverse effects might limit their further translation for example chloroquine which has been demonstrated able to inhibit viral replication of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in vitro but showed no significant therapeutic effect against sars-cov in mice model 73 other therapy strategies such as the convalescent-phase plasma still lack mechanism study or detailed in vivo evaluation because the lack of adequate or appropriate animal models additionally testing the antiviral ability of old drugs such as metformin atorvastin glitazones fibrates and sartans might be another option at this urgent moment 74 clinically the combined use of several antiviral drugs and host target agents may be more effective than using either modality alone for example sars-cov patients who received ribavirin lopinavir-ritonavir and a corticosteroid had lower 21-day sard and death rates than those who received ribavirin and a corticosteroid 75 regards to the patients with severe mers-cov infection viremia was resolved within two days after combined treatment of ribavirin lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon- 76in sum we should learn from the lessons of many previous animal experiments firstly a drug with antiviral effects in vitro does not necessarily have antiviral effects in vivo secondly combination of two or more drugs that have different antiviral mechanisms might achieve a synergistic or an enhanced therapeutic effect thirdly to know the advantages and disadvantages all the drugs need to be systematically evaluated in several different animal models before clinical studyprevention of and recovery from the coronavirus infection are usually associated with adaptive and innate immunity the outcomes of the coronavirus infection depend on humoral immune responses such as the subtype and titre of antibody although nhps mice and other experimental animals can effectively mimic coronavirus infection the genetic diversity might disturb the interpretation of the possibly different results between human and non-human species to directly study coronavirus infection in human organ or tissue humanized animal models are the method of choice which can also be used for evaluation of coronavirus vaccines and host target agents in the past decades mice with one or several human tissues or cells engraftment have been widely used to investigate the pathogenesis of hiv hbv hcv cmv varicella-zoster virus vzv and other important pathogenslung is the main target organ of coronavirus infection in 2012 maidji et al grafted human fetal lung tissues under the kidney capsule of immunodeficient scid mice 77 the lung tissues rapidly grew and developed mature structures resembling the normal human lung and were demonstrated to support cmv infection and pathogenesis in 2017 wang et al established a human lung-xenografted mouse model for vzv infection 78 after vzv infection viral replication lung pathogenies and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses were detected in the human lung xenografts more recently wahl et al reported a humanized mouse with mono human lung engraftment lom or incorporated with human bone marrow liver and thymus blt-l 79 the lom or blt-l mice supports infection and replication of human pathogens such as mers-cov rsv cmv and zika virus 79 antigen-specific humoral and t-cell responses were observed in blt-l mice suggesting that human lung and immune cell dual chimeric mice might be an ideal humanized animal model for the pathogenesis and immune study of sars-cov-2 due to the abundant expression of hace2 in multiple organs of human multiple organs and tissues including liver heart intestine kidney bladder and immune cells are susceptible to the infection of sars-cov-2 suggesting a reason that causes multi-organ failures therefore mice with engraftment of human somatic progenitor and stem cells as well as varied human tissues and organoids might be useful to investigate the tropism of sars-cov-2comparing to the traditional animal models the humanized mice provide new options for investigators to directly study the viral infection in human tissues which is adequate to delineate the tissue tropism and the host-virus interactions the development of humanized mice is important to improve our fundamental understanding for mechanisms of coronavirus infection and immunopathophysiology in the future humanized mice might become a unique tool to obtain the insights into our strategies for developing coronavirus vaccine early intervention and antiviral therapythe coronaviruses are one of the most important pathogens causing robust respiratory infection severe cases and deaths in humans here we input key words including coronavirus animal model sars-cov mers-cov sars-cov-2 also named 2019-ncov in the early stage sard and covid-19 to screen the published articles from pubmed the most related articles have been cited in this review recent proceedings and important data of the coronavirus studies are summarized we suggested that a rapid animal test of sars-cov-2 is important to assess the efficiencies of the vaccines antivirals and the sensitivity of the diagnostic tests we also debated that a rapid generation of ma viral strains or mice carrying human receptor is a good option for urgent and effective animal studies in addition development of humanized animal model might provide a direct infection of coronavirus to human tissue taken together animal models are the fundamental tolls to investigate the viral pathogenesis to develop vaccines and antiviral drugscoronaviruses are important pathogens to animals and humans and have been around for many years severe acute respiratory syndrome was first detected in guangdong in southern china in 2002 and the middle east respiratory syndrome followed and first emerged in saudi arabia in 20121 both result in severe respiratory infections which can be fatal1 in late december 2019 a further coronavirus emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 resulting in the potentially fatal covid-19 disease2 this novel coronavirus has rapidly become a global public health concern spreading to most countries worldwidemost public health strategies being employed are currently reactive however immunonutrition could have an important preventative rolea form of prehabilitation helping the body to cope with potentially lethal viruses such as coronavirus elsewhere prehabilitation has been defined as interventions that can help to improve patients health in advanced of being exposed to a physiological stressor so they are then better able to cope with that stress3 it is known that viral clearance and infection recovery require activation of the hosts immune response and nutrition could be a means of achieving this4 suboptimal immune competence commonly occurs in later life with undernutrition protein-energy malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies being age-related lifestyle factors that can further hamper this5
undoubtedly there are many nutritional myths of bolstering the immune system including diet fruit vitamin c antioxidants vitamins minerals and probioticsall typically being mentioned most often on the infosphere6 the present article extrapolates some of the most pertinent scientific evidence related to immunonutrition focusing specifically on its potential roles in resisting respiratory viruses and diseasesin late december 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged in wuhan hubei province china and is the most recent emerging pathogen of a potentially fatal disease that has rapidly become a global public health concern2 in february 2020 the world health organisation who named the disease covid-192 by 11 march 2020 the who went on to further recognise covid-19 as a global pandemic7 the virus itself has been named sars-cov-2 as it has been determined as the same species as sars but a different strain of the speciescoronaviruses are a family of viruses known to infect mammals and birds belonging to the family coronaviridae8 before the emergence of covid-19 there were six different coronaviruses known to infect humans four of which cause a mild common cold-type illness9 the remaining two coronaviruses emerged in 2002 and 2012 and result in a more severe disease in humans these were named severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome mers and are highly pathogenic viruses9 both sars and mers are believed to have originated in bats suggesting animal to human transmission9
sars-cov-2 has emerged as the third known coronavirus that causes fatal respiratory diseases in humans the causative pathogen was isolated by chinese researchers in january 2020 and discovered to be a large enveloped virus with a positive sense single-stranded rna genome of about 2633 kb1 the sars-cov-2 shares 96 similarity to bat coronavirus at the whole genome level which suggests like sars and mers bats were the original host with an intermediate host prior to infecting humans9 it will be vital to track the path of the virus in order to prevent future exposure and outbreaks in terms of the development of vaccines and antibody-based therapies it will be important to understand the mutation rate of sars-cov-2 which appears to be moderate to high and similar to the other coronaviruses10
unfortunately no vaccines against coronaviruses have ever been developed including for sars or mers with mers still remaining largely uncontrolled11 similarly there is no single specific antiviral therapy the ramification of sars-cov-2 is atypical viral pneumonia with the main treatment strategy of supportive care which may include oxygen or artificial ventilation12 antibiotics are of no use to treat viral pneumonia the fatality rates in china and now italy follow a distinct pattern with the elderly having the highest death and case fatality rate figure 1 and table 113 in particular older patients 65 years with underlying health conditions including acute respiratory distress syndrome are at increased risk of dying12
the human immune system is comprised of four central componentst cells b cells the complement system and phagocytes which are vital in defending the organism against foreign intruders14 the immune system is the bodys primary defence barrier against infections and thus any weaknesses could be potentially detrimental to the host1517
it has been recognised that a well-fed immune system is one way of helping to provide defence against pathogenic organisms5 it has been elegantly stated that an ideal immune system should be constantly alert and monitoring for signs of danger or invasion4 professor philip calder is one of the leading experts in nutritional immunology and has published widely on this topic in his article feeding the immune system he explains that the immune system functions by acting as an exclusion barrier identifying and eliminating pathogens and involving complex interplay between many different cell types and chemical mediators5
unfortunately a decline in immune function is usually inevitable with ageing a process referred to scientifically as immunosenescence which typically involves the deterioration of both innate and acquired immune systems18 19 a number of potential mechanisms have been proposed including 1 declining t cell function attributed to thymic involution and subsequent reduced output of nave t cells20 2 ageing-associated inflammation often referred to as inflammaging which paradoxically can reduce immunity and contribute to pathogenic age-related diseases21 and 3 poor micronutrient status  a bidirectional relationship between infectionimmunity and nutrition whereby changes in one of these components can impact the other22 it is also becoming apparent that ageing can modulate immune function and cellular composition in ways that are sex-specific possibly due to differences in how menopause and andropause unfold23
with regard to respiratory conditions the combined effects of compromised immune function frailty and length of exposure to pathogens mean that ageing populations are naturally predisposed to pulmonary disease24 nevertheless there is hopeinnate and acquired immune function may be supported by human nutrition particularly in instances where this is suboptimal that is in clinical settings and the aged potentially helping to lower the risk of infections and their severity and promote recovery from thesevitamin c was first puried in the early 1930s and soon after physicians proposed that vitamin c could be benecial in the treatment of pneumonia26 historically vitamin c has been used for immune support and is known to be acquired by neutrophils27 this nutrient supports epithelial barrier function against pathogens cellular functions of the adaptive and innate immune systems and protects against oxidative stress28
a review published in 201726 concluded that three controlled trials found that vitamin c prevented pneumonia and two controlled trials observed a treatment benefit of vitamin c for patients with pneumonia an earlier cochrane review29 undertaken in 2013 collated evidence from three prophylactic trials3032 finding a statistically significant 80 or greater reduction in pneumonia incidence in the vitamin c groups it was subsequently concluded that therapeutic use of vitamin c supplementation could be reasonable for patients with pneumonia and low plasma vitamin c levels given its low cost and health riskswith regard to dosages glazebrook and thomson30 monitored male students during world war ii whose diets typically provided 1015 mg vitamin c daily and an additional 00503 gday ascorbic acid was added to morning cocoa or their evening glass of milk cases of pneumonia occurred in the control group but not in the test group indicating a potential role in pneumonia prevention30 kimbarowski and mokrow31 provided 03 g vitamin c daily to military recruits who were hospitalised with influenza type a in this study pneumonia was reported in 2 subjects in the treatment group and 10 in the control group again indicating a potential adjunctive role31 pitt and costrini32 administered one of the highest dosages 2 gday to us marine recruits for 2 months with no reported symptoms attributed to the pills in this study there was a reduced incidence of pneumonia among the recruits receiving vitamin c but only 8 of 674 had pneumonia indicating a need for larger sample sizes32
in terms of potential mechanisms it is well recognised that infections increase oxidative stress26 infections typically activate phagocytes which release reactive oxygen species which are oxidising agents26 vitamin c is a renowned antioxidant which can counteract these effects26 in one study a respiratory syncytial virus reduced the expression of antioxidant enzymes and subsequently increased oxidative damage33
a number of studies have investigated the inter-relationships between vitamin d and its effects on respiratory viruses and conditions such as community-acquired pneumonia3437
it is well appreciated that vitamin d is a powerful immunoregulator with vitamin d receptors being expressed by the majority of immune cells b and t lymphocytes macrophages and monocytes38 it has also been proposed that immune cells themselves can convert 25ohd3 into 125oh2d3 its active form38
zdrenghea et al
34 reported in their review that respiratory epithelial cells macrophages and monocytes express vitamin d receptor and concluded that vitamin d could act as a potential adjuvant in protecting and treating patients with respiratory viral infections who typically have lower vitamin d status work by greiller and martineau35 also reported that vitamin d deficiency is associated with a higher risk of viral acute respiratory infection and found that vitamin d metabolites modulated the expression and secretion of type 1 interferon chemokines cxcl8 and cxcl10 and proinflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor and interleukin-6another study36 using human bronchial epithelial cells infected with respiratory syncytial and rhinoviruses with or without exogenous d showed that both viral strains reduced the number of vitamin d receptors and 24-hydroxylase however despite this exogenous vitamin d was shown to increase antiviral defences and increase rhinovirus-induced interferon-stimulated genes and cathelicidin implying a protective response36 other work37 focusing on pneumonia found a negative association between 125oh2d3 and pneumonia severitya systematic review and meta-analysis39 has collated evidence from 25 separate randomised controlled trials n11 321 participants studying the effects of vitamin d supplementation on acute respiratory infections among those aged 095 years protective effects were seen among all participants but particularly among those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels 25 nmoll indicative of deficiency39 overall the authors concluded that vitamin d appeared to be a safe strategy to protect against acute respiratory tract infections39
zinc is regarded as a gatekeeper of immune function it is essential for the functioning of the immune system40 zinc ions play a role in the regulation of intracellular signalling pathways in adaptive and innate immune cells40 zinc is also involved in inflammation elevating inflammatory responses and inducing cell-mediated immunity and is a key component of pathogen-eliminating transduction pathways that contribute to neutrophil extracellular traps networks which bind pathogens formation41
no meta-analysis or cochrane reviews currently appear to have been undertaken in this field among paediatric populations a review of several studies42 concluded that zinc supplementation for more than 3 months could be effective in preventing pneumonia in children younger than 5 years of age although the evidence was not robust enough to advocate prophylactic properties if given for shorter periods of time among the elderly it is recognised that inadequate zinc status impairs immune function reduces pathogenic resistance and is linked to an increased incidence and duration of pneumonia along with overall mortality43 rigorous trials however are yet to determine the efficacy of zinc supplementationgiven the rapid transmission of covid-19 scientists are working against the clock to find potential vaccines antiviral medications or other possible solutions one intervention could potentially be the reinforcement of the immune function a strategy that could be particularly worthwhile among vulnerable groups such as those aged 65 with underlying health conditions such as asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diabetes and heart disease or who are immunosuppressed unfortunately high-quality rigorous trials are currently lacking most of what we know are based on observational evidence or older studies conducted on military populationshopefully now more funds will be invested into nutritional immunology and its applications among ageing populations and those with viral respiratory conditions this could be a viable approach given the relatively low cost of vitamin d c and zinc supplements what remains to be confirmed are the dosages and durations that these would need to be taken to be most beneficial and whether different combinations of micronutrients would be most effective in helping to fight against infectionas previously mentioned vitamins a e b6 b12 folate copper iron and selenium are other examples of nutrients that possess important roles in helping to meet the complex needs of the immune system25 these may work individually or in synergy furthermore it is highly likely that other dietary components could also play a role in the modulation of immunity but are yet to be identifiedgiven the recent shifts towards food shortages layered on top of the already pressing concerns about food insecurity in older adults this could only further hamper the nutritional density and micronutrient profiles of diets further interventions and public health strategies should therefore consider the value of distributing both food and nutrition supplementation packages to the vulnerableunfortunately the transmission and speed at which covid-19 is spreading globally appear to be surpassing the speed at which nutritional immunology studies can give firm answers an insight into the evidence that is currently available indicates that from an immunological and respiratory stance ageing populations are undoubtedly more at risk from the harmful ramifications of such infections subsequently a number of nutritional strategies could help them taking on board what we know so fara pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in wuhan peoples republic of china and first reported to the world health organization who country office on 31 december 2019 the pathogen was subsequently discovered to be a novel coronavirus cov and named severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov2 based on sequence similarity with members of the -coronavirus family such as sars-cov and mers-cov two highly pathogenic coronaviruses responsible for previous epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle-east respiratory syndrome respectively 1234 genomes of coronaviruses are typically organized with a certain degree of similarity suggesting analogous pathogenic mechanisms other human coronaviruses include the nl63 229e oc43 and hku1 which are usually responsible for common colds andor other respiratory infections in children and older or immunocompromised individuals 56on 11 february 2020 the who named the new coronavirus disease covid-19 alias corona-virus disease 2019 two months later following a large spread outside china with epidemic foci in south korea and japan and a massive outbreak in italy the who declared covid-19 a pandemic 7 thus far this is the first highly pathogenic coronavirus epidemic to reach these proportionsmortality data and severity assessments made available by the chinese government and the who indicate that about 80 of affected individuals have symptoms similar to those of mild seasonal influenza the remaining 20 however develop viral interstitial pneumonia requiring hospitalization in approximately 5 of these patients the pneumonia is critical and requires intensive care overall mortality ranges between 05 and 5 with a clear positive correlation with age and other comorbidities 8 based on these numbers the majority of the worlds health care systems are ill-equipped to deal with the surge of patients requiring hospitalization without taking additional measures to prevent system collapse there is an immediate concern that the mortality rate could increase further due to a lack of available intensive care unit beds required to treat severe cases furthermore since no large clinical trial has been possible considering the timescale of the pandemic there is no consensus on how to treat severe cases of covid-19 viral pneumonia thus far all evidence of treatment options are derived from a few case experiences during the sars and mers epidemics from administrations made in special cases based on analogy with other diseases intuitions and experimental therapy of some pathological featuressymptoms 49101112 as we are in the rising part of an epidemic timecontagion graph with a significant proportion of the worlds population under restrictions or quarantine the identification of therapeutic options for treating severe cases of covid-19 is of paramount importancethe ubiquitin proteasome system ups is a key regulator of protein homeostasis the pathway to proteasomal degradation consists of a group of enzymes called ubiquitin ub ligases that attach ubiquitin moieties to target proteins the addition of ubiquitin serves as a highly specific destruction tag where ubiquitinated proteins are trafficked to the proteasome for degradation a reverse pathway involving ubiquitin removal also exists and is mediated by the action of deubiquitinating enzymes dubs that catalyze the removal of ub from tagged proteins 13 while proteasome targeting tends to involve poly-ub chains containing ub moieties linked via isopeptide bonds at lysine residue 48 k48 of ub other ub linkages particularly k63 and ub-like modifications ie sumoylation neddylation and isgylation are involved in signal transduction and the regulation of immune responses it is of no surprise that viruses including coronaviruses often use modulation of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers to evade the host cell immune response 1415 each coronaviridae family member codes for dubs named viral papain-like proteases plps which remove ubiquitin from target proteins and alter cellular pathways important for infection some members encode two but sars mers covs and the novel sars-cov2 3 only encode one named sars-cov plp mers-cov plp and sars-cov2 plp respectively for many coronaviruses viral plps have been studied extensively and shown to play a crucial role during viral infection of the host cell these enzymes are multifunctional and in addition to their dub activity also containing intrinsic cysteine protease and deisgylating activity that are required for viral replication and the evasion of host responses 56 the deisgylating activity of plps is similar to dub activity and involves deconjugating interferon ifn-stimulated gene isg-15 moieties from tagged proteins isg15 is a small ub-like peptide that can be covalently attached to target proteins in a mechanism similar to ub resulting in a large number of regulatory effects isg15 is largely stimulated during antiviral responses and although its broad functions are not fully elucidated it acts as an effector and a regulator of the host cells innate immune response during viral infections 1617since viral plps are used by coronaviruses to both replicate and to antagonize the innate immune response they are considered important therapeutic targets for coronavirus infections and thus may be of interest for future covid-19 treatment strategies in this review we report an up-to-date description of coronaviral plps functions and their inhibitors and provide possible therapeutic strategies for covid-19 treatment using both clinically approved and preclinical drugsthe following keywords dubs in coronavirus dubs in sars-cov sars-cov plp role plp activity plp inhibitors plp in sars-cov2 and sars therapy were used in a literature search of the pubmed database the cut off dates were 2005 for the pathogenesis dissertation and 2013 for novel drugs plps play their first role during the early replicative phase of coronavirus infection after the virus enters the host cell a replicationtranscription complex rtc is required to orchestrate the replication of the viral units in the cytoplasm here the plps cysteine protease activity is essential for the cleavage of the n-terminal segment of the rtc polyprotein pp specifically the rtc is coded by two open reading frames 1a and 1b that with a ribosomal frame shift mechanism lead to the transcription of two polyproteins pp1a that features the nsps from 1 to 11 and the larger pp1ab that in addition contains nsps 12 to 16 the pps need to be processed correctly into the nsps which are the active elements of the rtc plps are encoded within nsp3 and free the n-terminal nsps of the rtc while the remaining units are processed by the three chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease 3clp alias main protease which may also serve as an attractive therapeutic target 5626 sars and mers covs are known to adhere to this model and a visual description of the sars-cov plp role as a cysteine protease is given in figure 1the host cell innate immune response to viruses begins once the viral nucleic acids are sensed by pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors tlr and retinoid inducible gene i rig-i this event triggers signal cascades including kinases such as tank-binding kinase-1 tbk1 and inhibitor-kb kinases ikks leading to activation of transcription factors such as interferon-regulatory factor-3 irf3 and the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells nf-kb these proteins translocate into the nucleus and serve as transcription factors by binding to promoter elements in target genes leading to the expression of several cytokines including type i ifns as  and  ifns which in turn will trigger a huge number of intra and extra cellular processes leading to activation of the innate immune response 27coronaviruses infections such as sars generally include a dysregulation of the immune system in their pathogenic features at systemic level 2829 indeed early research has shown that active sars-cov replication does not stimulate infs production in cell culture 30 since it is known that cellular antiviral pathways include deubiquitination within their regulatory mechanisms 1415 plps are believed to contribute to infection pathogenesis by using their intrinsic dub and deisgylating activities to antagonize the activation of the host cell innate immune response 5 specifically plps use their dub activity to interfere with the proteins that mediate the intracellular sensing and signaling of viral infection therefore leading to a dysregulation of the immune pathways such as the irf3 and nf-kb pathways that in turn results in a decrease in the antiviral response the dub activity of plps is usually broad spectrum and not selective for specific ubiquitin linkage types such as k48 or k63 313233 since dub activity was first hypothesized as an important component of sars-cov plp in 2005 34 a number of studies investigating the dub activity of coronaviruses plps and their effects on host cell innate immunity have been performed 35363738 a map of the pathways that will be discussed in the next paragraph is given in figure 2while the mers-cov plp has been reported to have analogous effects 3139 the sars-cov plp dub activity is the best characterized and has been demonstrated to antagonize the irf3 pathway at many steps this plp was first reported to inhibit the rig-i and tlr3 induction of the ifn- 3240 to block the phosphorylation and dimerization of irf3 by interacting with its upstream regulators 4041 and to directly deubiquitinate irf3and thus disrupt its ifn- promoter activity 42 however recent studies highlight a k63 ub dub dependent broad interaction with various if not all components of the irf3 pathway such as sting traf36 mavs and tbk1 434445 another important pathway influenced by the sars-cov plp is nf-kb here the dub activity is known to be exerted upon ikb an inhibitor of nf-kb 41 and on the tnf activation of nf-kb 2145 also resulting in inf- antagonismconsidering that this plp has more than one site to bind ub 6 and a study showing that inhibition of plp protease activity results in reduced nf-kb but not irf3 antagonism 32 it could suggest that irf3 antagonism depends on dub activity towards k63 linked ub chains and nf-kb antagonism instead on dub activity against k48 linked ub chains 2145 a type of linkage that in vitro seems to be preferred by this plp 18 in summary we suggest that plps antagonism of the antiviral response is generalized upon the pathways rather than focused on their single elements and counteracts various ub modifications although additional studies may be required to fully elucidate the exact interactions through which each coronaviral plp promotes viral infections there are supporting evidences that the dub activity of plps results in a reduction of the ifn mediated anti-viral response and in a broad spectrum downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines ie ccl5 or cxcl10 39once translated type i ifns activate the jak-stat pathway through the ifns receptors via an autocrine and paracrine mechanism this subsequently leads to the expression of a plethora of isgs either effectors regulators or both that embody the antiviral response 46 isg15 is a small ub-like peptide that can be covalently attached to proteins by a three enzymes process similar to ub conjugation during viral infections isgylation seems to target a high number of proteins at the translational level either as an activating or inhibitory signal while free isg15 can also act as a cytokine 16 the large number of potential targets in multiple signaling cascades makes its role difficult to delineate however it is clear that it acts as an effector and a modulator of the antiviral response 17 isgylation can antagonize the formation of viral molecular complexes required for replication activate molecules involved in immune pathways and act as a negative feedback for upstream factors interestingly isg15 deficiency in mice leads to increased and often deadly viral infections but in humans seems to involve increased susceptibility to mycobacteria and dysregulated immune responses rather than viral infections 16there are well established evidence that coronaviral plps are able to deconjugate isg15 moieties from proteins 1921242539 and that this enzymatic activity is conserved among the species 5 but since the detailed mechanisms through which isg15 exerts its antiviral activity are still not completely elucidated the exact consequences of plps deisgylating activity in coronavirus infections are still poorly understood however two mouse models demonstrate in vivo that isg15 has antiviral properties against a murine hepatitis coronavirus 47 and that plps may disrupt them 48 this does suggest that the deisgylating activity of plps is an important mechanism used by coronaviruses to counteract the hosts antiviral responserecent reviews highlight some reciprocal interplays between the irf3 and nf-kb pathways and the isgs 4649 while previous studies have also suggested an activating effect of isg15 on irf3 50 we would thus propose that the global effects of plps on innate immune responses could result from a crosstalk and additive action of both their dub and deisgylating activitiesin addition to the above-described roles of plps enzymatic activities other authors have demonstrated further effects on the infection pathogenesis the sars-cov plp has been shown to complex with sud sars-unique domain and stabilize the p53 e3 ligase rchy1 leading to subsequent ubiquitination and the degradation of p53 thus resulting in a decrease of p53 mediated antiviral activity similar to other human covs plps 51 another report demonstrates a downregulation of erk1 by the proteasome inhibitor mg132 as a way to suppress the inf- stimulation by this plp 52 last but not least this plp was shown to induce an upregulation of the transcription and translation of transforming-growth-factor tgf-1 through erk which was inhibited by treatment with mg132 noticeably the treatment with the erk12 inhibitor u0126 inhibited the activation of tgf-1 activated genes with an 84-fold reduction observed for type i collagen 53 moreover two recent papers have further investigated these connections the results of these studies contributed to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this feature of sars-cov plp confirmed the effects seen on human samples and showed pro-fibrotic features induced in lung histology by this plp in a mouse model taken together these considerations suggest the connection of plps with collagen expression via tgf-1 signaling and a pathogenic role of sars-cov plp in inducing lung fibrosis 5455 furthermore in a previous study mg132 was also shown to improve the lung histology in a sars murine model 56 and removing the dub activity of plp2 in a murine hepatitis virus also resulted in a better liver histology if compared to controls 57 adding strength to this hypothesis see below although many additional structural and non-structural coronavirus proteins may contribute to suppress the cellular responses to viral infections 585960 the role of plps in the production of the replicase proteins and their location at the center of numerous signaling nodes suggest validity in targeting them as an anti-viral strategy collaterally considering these effects of plps and other viral proteins on dysregulating the innate immune response one may hypothesize that they could be at the origins of a mechanism that underlies the potential development of a cytokine storm 282961while the activities of plps are usually conserved among the nidovirales order members 5 to which coronaviruses belong an enhanced plp antagonism of innate immunity seems to be a peculiar characteristic of zoonotic coronaviruses such as sars-cov 62 and to be conserved among the highly pathogenic -coronaviruses 39 since the plp present in novel sars-cov2 shows a high degree of similarity to the better-known sars-cov 234 we speculate they might have similar roles in pathogenesis crystallographic analysis might clarify the mechanisms underlying the covid-19 pathogenesis and provide a therapeutic target for the identification of inhibitors through high throughput molecular screeningbased on this we propose that plp inhibitors should be evaluated as a possible therapeutic option for the treatment of covid-19several in vitro studies support the idea that plp inhibitors may be effective in reducing coronaviruses infection for instance a recent work evaluated the effects on sars-cov by substituting its native plp with the one derived from a bat sars-related cov interestingly the obtained sars-cov replicated 103-fold less than the wild type in human airway epithelial cells but showed no differences in non ifn competent cells 62 meanwhile several past independent studies showed that small molecule plp inhibitors can inhibit sars-cov replication in vero e6 cells without toxic effects on the host 63646566 remarkably in a 2017 work its authors developed an innovative therapeutic strategy using ub variants to inhibit mers-cov plp in vero cells these protein-based inhibitors were shown to be highly selective for this plp and to disrupt all of its enzymatic functions pp processing dub and deisgylating activity leading to a four orders of magnitude decrease in viral titer 67 as the authors themselves recognize the only questionable feature in this therapeutic strategy was the requirement of sophisticated protein engineering techniques however such a suggestion should not be rejected and may indicate that other bio-pharmacological techniques such as monoclonal antibodies designed against sars-cov2 plp or proteolysis targeting chimeras protacs capable of mediating the ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation of sars-cov2 plp may have meritdespite promising results shown in mice with proteasomal inhibition in a sars model 56 only two main studies on murine models specifically consider plp inhibition in vivo first in a 2014 study ifn-receptor knockout mice that lack isgs and are not able to survive sindbis virus infections were infected with chimeric sindbis viruses engineered to express isg15 and either sars-covmers-cov plps or their inactive mutants mice infected with the mutated plp virus showed a 76 survival attributable to isg15 restoration while the wild type plp virus infection resulted in more than 80 mortality 48 the treatment with a drug developed in the authors laboratory and displayed in another report 66 was specific for plp and induced an increase in isgylation that led to an increase in survival to the wild type plp virus unfortunately there was no significative efficacy in the sars-cov mouse model 48 an additional more recent work reported similar results here a usp18 a cellular dub with physiological deisgylating activity knockout mouse model displaying increased level of isgylation was infected with a murine hepatitis coronavirus higher isgylation levels were positively correlated with a delay in coronavirus replication and instead negatively with the plp2 levels in vivo although plp2 inhibition was tested in vitro lower viral titers were observed 47the latest and second main plp inhibition model in vivo is an engineered murine hepatitis coronavirus the dub and not the protease activity of a murine hepatitis coronavirus plp2 was disrupted through structure guided mutagenesis the obtained mutant coronavirus was tested in macrophages for its ability to elicit cells innate immunity and showed an increased activation of ifn however inoculation in mice only resulted in a mild attenuation of virulence despite an improvement in histological features 57 as an explanation the authors hypothesized that the dub activity of this plp may not be necessary in vivo or may only be required in some tissue-specificenvironmental contexts remarkably the authors reported difficulties in isolating a mutant virus without plp dub activity and claim this was due to the difficulty in separating it from other activities that resulted in no replication if disrupted this difficulty per se may have more meaning than just a technical issue and suggests that plps may be essential for viral replicationin summary these three mouse models may confirm in vivo the previously described individual roles of plps enzymatic activities in the pathogenesis of coronaviruses infections and give some promising insights on targeting plps as an antiviral strategy however thus far the evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of targeting plp in vivo remains questionable the first study gave positive results in a sars-adapted mouse model but only a single compound was investigated while the second did not consider the inhibition of plp in vivo and gave insights on its pathogenic role the third study was specifically aimed to investigate the role of the dub activity of plps rather than to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting plps as far as we are aware the number of in vivo studies on plps is limited therefore in vivo therapeutic-oriented studies in more reliable models such as those developed for sars and mers are strongly recommended 68in vivo studies thus far do not support the evidence of antiviral efficacy in targeting plps however since we suggest in vivo studies on the basis of the plps pivotal role in pathogenesis of the positive results in vitro against coronaviruses replication and of some in vivo features plp inhibitors might deserve at least a further discussion several additional natural compounds derivates have been demonstrated to have activity against plps six compounds were isolated from tribulus terrestris fruits and acted as mixed type inhibitors with ic50 values of 156701 m against the sars-cov plp protease activity 71 the evaluation of derivatives from angelica keiskei leaves led to the isolation of 9 chalcones and 4 coumarins with inhibitory activity against both proteases of the same coronavirus of these compound 6 xanthoangelol e has an ic50 of 12 m against the plp and 114 m against 3clp a chymotrypsin-like protease also proposed as a molecular target against coronaviruses angelica keiskei derivatives were also identified as inhibitors of plp dub and deisgylating activity 72 park et al who proposed many natural derivatives against coronaviruses recently reported similar results from broussonetia papyrifera root derivatives including the mers-cov proteases 73 lastly the seeds of psoralea corylifolia have been another source of lead compounds such as isobavachalcone and psoralidin with activity towards the sars-cov plp 74 unfortunately all of these molecules have thus far only been evaluated biochemically in vitro and not at more advanced pre-clinical development stages but encouragingly the extracts of strobilanthes cusia leaves demonstrated plp2 inhibitory properties and positive antiviral results against the human coronavirus nl63 in cells 75 therefore we suggest that further research should be performedin addition a recent meta-analysis demonstrates a protective effect of flavonoids against upper respiratory tract infections 80 and resveratrol has been found effective against mers-cov infection in vero e6 cells 81 this could indicate that the use of plants extracts such as cystus052 a polyphenols rich medication already clinically tested in preventing influenza symptoms 8283 could possibly be helpful in coronavirus infections without having significant side effects cystatin-c a small endogenous polypeptide that physiologically acts as a cysteine protease inhibitor and is used as a biomarker of kidney 84 or brain 85 injury has antiviral properties 868788 and was found to be reduced in vero e6 cells infected with a porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus 89 furthermore it has been used at slightly supraphysiological levels in a previous study to reduce viral titers of two human coronaviruses in cell cultures where the authors hypothesized a plp as target 79 and internalization of cystatin c in cells has been demonstrated 90 on the basis of these considerations we would propose further studies on cystatin c antiviral properties against highly pathogenic coronaviruses ie investigate the outcome of covid-19 in patients with high levels of cystatin cwithin the category of clinically available drugs thiopurine analogs used to treat diseases such as cancer or autoimmune diseases may have been overlooked they have previously been shown to display activity as sars-cov plp inhibitors in vitro 7691 and with similar activities either as monotherapy or in association with mycophenolic acid been shown against the mers-cov plp 77 due to their well described mechanism of action the authors proposed in vivo studies that have not been performed thus far 7677 in addition as the thiocarbonyl group has been judged to be the active element of these compounds they may also serve as models to develop safer and more effective molecules 76 indeed since such drugs have immunomodulatory actions and are known to depress the immune system we would suggest a degree of caution in their use in infectious diseaseshowever no evidence indicating a higher risk of covid-19 in patients under chronic treatment with immunosuppressive drugs has been reported although several physicians have expressed concern 9293 we agree with the need of further investigation and propose a retrospective analysis to be performed as soon as possible on covid-19 patients databases to evaluate both the risk in individuals on immunosuppressive agents and possibly the effects of thiopurine analogs or rather their prodrugs as azathioprine on the outcome moreover other similar therapeutic strategies have been proposed in vitro ie alpha-interferon and cyclosporin 94severe and advanced cases of covid-19 pneumonias often involve immune system mediated damage a so-called cytokine storm and immunosuppression has been proposed for this context 95 furthermore an il6 selective monoclonal antibody is currently being tested on humans for this specific purpose 1112 on the basis of these elements rather than in upfront therapy we would consider thiopurine analogs and their associated drugs for the treatment of the cytokine storm in covid-19 that could eventually result in an antiviral and a double immunomodulatory efficacy inhibiting the viral replication suppressing hyperinflammation damage and enhancing the endocellular innate immune response against sars-cov2 we again recommend extreme prudence in considering these drugs as their side effects might be a danger in addition we would like to highlight that a recent report demonstrated that disulfiram a clinically approved alcohol abuse antagonist now repurposed as an anticancer drug can competitively and noncompetitively inhibit sars and mers plps respectively and this activity is synergic with 6-thioguanine a thiopurine and mycophenolic acid against mers but not sars plp 78 these recent findings in vitro together with a relatively good riskbenefit ratio may make disulfiram a clinically evaluable drug against covid-19 however as a hepatic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor its pharmacological interactions might be consideredthe proteasome inhibitor mg132 has been shown to reduce cytokine levels and improve survival and lung histology in a sars murine model 56 the authors did not propose a strong explanation for this effect of mg132 but the reported anti-inflammatory 96 and anti-viral internalization effects 97 of the proteasome inhibitors may be the mechanisms underlying it interestingly mg132 has been used in recent studies to counteract the effects induced by plp 52535455 this taken together with the results in the recentmurine model of dub-mutated plp2 in murine hepatitis 57 suggests an involvement of plphowever a mechanism has been proposed by other authors who exclude proteasome inhibition and link mg132 antiviral activity to m-calpain a cysteine protease inhibition suggesting that viral cysteine proteases such as plp are possible targets of this drug even more promising results were obtained in vitro when the calpain specific inhibitor mdl28170 was used 98 and these data align with previous in vitro studies on calpain inhibitors in sars 99in summary coronaviruses plps are multifunctional enzymes with cysteine protease dub and deisgylating activities that contribute significantly to infection pathogenesis the efficacy of targeting plps as an antiviral therapy is demonstrated at least in vitro with further in vivo studies strongly recommended several compounds both clinical and preclinical have documented actions against these proteins and thus may provide an attractive therapeutic strategy for covid-19on the basis of these considerations we propose four main suggestions towards the development of plp inhibitors with the potential to treat covid-19 the first is to consolidate our knowledge on the structure and function of sars-cov2 plp in order to highlight its role in pathogenesis and facilitate drug design secondly we claim that the plps effects may be strongly interconnected between all their enzymatic activities antagonizing one of these functions alone may be less effective than inhibiting the function of the whole protein thus we suggest developing and testing molecules with such capability 67 rather than focusing on each of the plps functions alone 57 however since the plp protease activity seems to be critical for virus replication inhibiting at least this activity could be effective third the number and the specificity of in vivo plp inhibition models must be increased lastly given the importance of a new coronavirus-specific drug in the fight against the current pandemic the hypothesis of testing the proposed drugs in covid-19 should not be underestimated in detaildrugs reviewed in the past 69 and novel plant derivatives should progress to the next step in pharmacological development hopefully being evaluated in vitro against sars-cov2 and subsequently in animal modelsrecently proposed sars-cov2 plp inhibitors 3 and other drugs proposed in our review should also undergo further evaluationseffects of dietary integration with plant compounds such as polyphenols on covid-19 prevention should be investigated clinically in order to demonstrate if this can be a relatively safe and effective health measurea clinical study on the effects of high levels of cystatin c as uremia on the outcome of patients with covid-19 should be performed trialing the exogenous administration of this peptide ie via aerosol may then be considered in humansa similar strategy should be used for thiopurine analogs and disulfiram however the evaluation of thiopurine analogs may need to be retrospective and their administration reasoned cautiously disulfiram may be tested more safely paying attention to its pharmacological interactions and any alcohol consumptionas many have said this is a wonderful time to develop a stronger relationship with god by concentrating on personal religious activities these may involve praying to god or meditating christian centering prayer buddhist mindfulness meditation or hindu transcendental meditation reading sacred scriptures such as the bible quran bhagavad gita or dhammapada spending time thinking about and applying these sacred scriptures to ones life memorizing scriptures or reciting them aloud listening to or watching inspirational programs on radio podcast or tv or otherwise engaging in private religious activities that are encouraged by ones faith tradition although attending religious services together is not possible at the present time due to covid-19 restrictions people of faith can often congregate virtually by participating in services that are now being live streamed when life was normal one might have been so busy that there was no time for spiritual matters with hobbies jobs housework recreational activities social and family activities filling up every moment of the day now that normal activities have virtually come to a halt there is lots of time for activities that will help build spiritual healtha large and growing volume of research now documents the benefits of religious faith on immune functioning and vulnerability to infection viral infection in particular see below in practical application of these research findings one physicianwhen treating a religious patient with panic attacks due to fear of the coronavirusprescribed clonazepam three times a day with that prescription he instructed the patient to read psalm 91 out loud immediately after taking each dose as noted above psalm 91 mentions protection from pestilence no fewer than three times for those who take refuge in godthis is what jesus said in three of the four gospels matthew 2239 mark 1231 luke 1027 he was simply quoting what moses commanded in leviticus 1917 a similar point has been made by the prophet mohammad the buddha many hindu writers and other greater religious figures so there is very little wiggle room here regardless of a persons specific religious tradition coronavirus pandemic or not the faithful are instructed to love and care for the neighbor who is my neighbor as jesus illustrated in the parable of the good samaritan luke 102537 the answer is anyone in need there are a lot of people out there in need right nowone reason why early christianity spread so rapidly throughout europe and middle east in the first several centuries was because of infectious plagues that were decimating the population in europe and countries around the mediterranean numbers and amundsen 1986 pp 4849 christians were those who stepped up to care for christians and non-christians alike often risking their own lives to do so this made such an impression on non-christians that they began to convert to the christian faith they saw something different about these christians and wanted what they had many priests today in italy have likewise lost their lives caring for those infected with the coronavirus in that country there is now the same opportunity for those of all professions and religious faiths to spread gods love and hope to family members neighbors friends and anyone else in need while minimally increasing the risk of their own safetysocial distancing means physically separating from one another by six feet the importance of following this directive is without saying but this should not mean becoming socially distant from one another people cannot give each other physical hugs or handshakes now to prevent the coronavirus spread however there are ways of providing hugs and handshakes through the technology that is now available for example there is a marco polo phone app that allows recording of a video message the recipient can watch it whenever desired and also video record a message and send it back to the person this app informs the individual when a message arrives by a red dot on the app and a beep this may be especially helpful for less tech-savvy relatives who are isolated at home if a family member does not have a cell phone consider purchasing one and teaching the person how to use it perhaps doing this by landline is it not amazing that at this time in history there is technology capable of connecting virtually everyone during this crucial period from a faith perspective god has allowed the coronavirus pandemic for some reason at this particular time in history and it coincides with the present booming age of technology that connects people both near and far at virtually no cost or risk to healthwhat do the scriptures that command believers to love your neighbor perform acts of compassion or do good deeds mean in a practical sense it means putting faith into action such as caring for the emotional spiritual and physical needs that others may have here are two concrete actions that anyone can do one from the safety of their home and the other from the safety of their carfirst spend time at home thinking about family friends members of your congregation colleagues at work or others who might be at risk for social isolation especially those who are living alone or are dealing with physical or emotional health problems there are hundreds of thousands of older adults in nursing homes and given the new ban on visitors they too are at risk many nursing homes are even making residents stay in their rooms which means no congregating with other residents for meals socializing or recreational activities once an individual or individuals is identified that meet this criterion contact them and ask if they would like to have a spiritual partner during these unsettling times many will likely say yes often enthusiastically partnering means contacting them at times that are agreed on perhaps several times per day this time would be spent praying for and with one another listening and sharing gods love and hope this will not only give a sense of meaning and purpose to those dreary endless hours spent at home but also dispel boredom that can easily creep in when unable to get out of the house the technology is now available to do this from the safety of home not only will this spread a message of love and hope but will enhance the initiators own health and well-being by doing something good that the scriptures of all faith traditions say will be rewarded many-fold both in this life and the nextthe second way to put faith into action involves a bit more risk but this too can be done sensibly many individuals now have physical needsespecially those in difficult economic circumstances loving these individuals might involve picking up food or medical supplies for them at a grocery store or pharmacy driving to the persons home and leaving the supplies in a safe place where the person can easily access them no need to come into any physical contact with these individuals simply let them know immediately by calling them on the phone that the supplies have been deliveredthese are dangerous times that we live in and a cavalier attitude is not an attitude of faith caring for self is part of the judeo-christian great commandment that instructs to love others as you love yourself no faith tradition condones recklessness people should not expose themselves or others to the coronavirus anyone with a cold especially if they have a fever and cough should not have close physical contact with others especially with older adults anyone with underlying medical problems or anyone at all including family members caring for others can now be done remotely as noted above reckless also means not following the simple steps that can help to prevent the spread of the coronavirus 1 washing hands regularly with soap for 2030 s every couple hours especially after having any contact with others 2 being careful to wash hands after coming into contact with anything that comes into the home cardboard boxes mail food products 3 not touching the face until after hands have been thoroughly washed 4 wearing a facemask when out in public as is currently recommended 5 keeping a safe physical distance from others to avoid transmitting or receiving airborne droplets that may contain the coronavirus 6 not physically congregating with several people at a time including family members and finally and 7 staying physically healthy and resistant to infectionhere are some recommendations that may help maintain or improve physical health when cooped up at homeexercise exercise at a moderate intensity for 3045 min at home every day the type of exercise needed must increase the heart rate and cause mild shortness of breath called aerobic exercise if necessary purchase a stationary bicycle a drive medical folding exercise peddler can be purchased for as little as 38 online moderate intensity exercise is known to improve immune function and potentially reduce risk and severity of respiratory viral infection martin et al 2009 similar to the infection that the coronavirus causes exercise seven days per week at the same time each day to make it a habit and spend time briefly outdoors each day to get sun and fresh air any change in physical activity however should be approved by a physician and gradually increased in duration and intensity to reach desired goalssleep try to obtain 7 to 8 h of sleep per night given research that indicates that not getting adequate sleep can adversely affect immunity and increase vulnerability to viral infections like the coronavirus opp and krueger 2015 ibarra-coronado et al 2015 sleep during the daytime however may disrupt nighttime sleep go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time every morning this will help to regulate your circadian rhythmcontrol weight being at home all day long increases the risk of gaining weight as boredom tends to promote snacking and those snacks tend not to be carrots or celery during this time it is important to control weight by eating a healthy low-calorie high-protein high-fiber diet ie vegetables fruits high-protein foods including fish an example of a good diet to keep resilience up and weight down is the mediterranean diet now rated 1 by experts throughout the world us world  news report 2020vitamin d more than three-quarters of americans have vitamin d levels below the 30100 ngml recommended ginde et al 2009 vitamin d deficiency adversely affects immune functioning prietl et al 2013 and a strong immune system is the only thing that stands between a person and infection by the coronavirus the recommended dose of vitamin d supplementation is 2000 iu per day or more depending on blood level for those with a history of kidney stones however excess vitamin d intake should be avoided malihi et al 2016other nutraceuticals foods that contain nutrients that may help to boost immune function include shiitake mushrooms dai et al 2015 feeney et al 2014 reishi mushrooms sanodiya et al 2009 aged garlic percival 2016 and echinacea block and mead 2003 karsch-volk et al 2014 besides vitamin d the most important of all nutraceuticals for immune function other vitamins that strengthen immunity include vitamin c and vitamin e de la fuente et al 1998 moriguchi and muraga 2000 zinc barnett et al 2016 80 mgday during period of infection and probiotics sharma et al 2014 have also been shown to benefit the immune systemhydration to remain resistant to the coronavirus and the consequences of coronavirus infection it is essential to stay well hydrated staying well hydrated reduces risk of viral infection and the consequences of infection which may often involve fever diarrhea nausea etc cardemil et al 2017 well hydrated means drinking a minimum of 3264 oz twice daily most fluids should be consumed in morning shortly after rising and again around noontime prior to lunch doing so will also increase urinary output requiring several trips to the restroom thus increasing physical activity which helps to avoid deconditioning as well for those who cannot or will not exercise fluid intake after about 300 in the afternoon should be minimal and no fluids should be consumed after 600 pm drinking fluids in the late afternoon or evening will otherwise disrupt sleep at night and as noted above sleep is essentialhighly recommended by experts personal communication is a concoction made by combining water 80 plus lemon juice 20 ingesting 1 quart before breakfast and 1 quart before lunch this brew should be consumed using a straw to avoid contacting the acidic lemon juice to teeth enamel which the former can eat away swishing ones mouth with baking soda after consumption is also a good idea to neutralize any remaining acidic lemon juice in the mouth adding to each quart an airborne tablet with 1000 mg of vitamin c and other nutrients may provide extra protectionmedications be careful to take medications as prescribed ensure that an adequate supply of medications is available since it may not be possible to get prescriptions renewed at the last minute given supply shortages and maintain regular contact with a physician by telemedicine conference if necessary ensuring that medical conditions are well controlled will reduce vulnerability to both infection by the virus and the complications that may result from infection should that occurspiritual health as noted above spiritual health is closely related to both mental and physical health and resistance to infection stay spiritually healthy develop and nurture a close relationship with god and volunteer to help family friends co-workers and anyone else in need but do it remotely whenever possible without physical contact this will enhance physical health and resistance to infection while spreading gods love to othersmany systematic scientific studies have now reported a positive association between religious involvement and indicators of healthy immune function these studies are often conducted in individuals with compromised immune systems such as older adults koenig et al 1997 koenig and cohen 2002 lutgendorf et al 2004 kurita et al 2011 and those with hivaids other infections or immune system disorders see below this research shows that religious involvement is associated with a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and an increase in immune functions necessary to resist infectionlikewise research shows that those with compromised immune systems due to viral infections or cancer experience better immune function if they engage in religious activity woods et al 1999 sephton et al 2001 more directly research in both healthy and vulnerable populations eg those with hivaids hepatitis sexually transmitted diseases have found that religious activity is associated with decreased rates of infection merchant et al 2003 kagimu et al 2012 chen and vanderweele 2018 watson et al 2019 krause 2019 decreased viral load concentration of viruses in blood among those already infected ironson et al 2006 2011 2017 van wagoner et al 2016 and better outcomes from viral infection over time hepatitis c infection raghavan et al 2013 furthermore at least one randomized controlled trial has shown improved immune functions among those with viral infection in response to spiritual interventions mccain et al 2008 oman and riley 2018 provide a recent summary of studies examining the impact of religious or spiritual involvement on immune competence infection risk behavior rates of infection adherence to treatments for infections and programs for prevention or treatment of infectionthese are challenging times for all especially for older adults and those with underlying medical conditions who are at increased risk of serious health problems from contracting the coronavirus and developing covid-19 lung infection with potentially devastating consequences following the six suggestions above is one way to stay healthy and develop resistance for those who are religious in the event of infection with the coronavirus even then the course of the illness will likely be less severe and recovery sooner due to increased emotional social physical and spiritual resilienceduring infection the virus replicates in the host cytosol amidst a myriad of host signaling pathways and systems such that interaction between the virus and the host systems is inevitable virus infection and the consequent host cell response also involve complicated interaction between various host cellular and viral networks virus-host interplay occurs at multiple points during the virus replication cycle from entry to exit the nature of such interactions can range from a simple exploitation of existing host machinery to destructive interactions that modulate the host environment to the advantage of the virus while inhibiting host activities one of the most important interactions between virus and host is the modulation of host cell environment such that the latter is converted into one in which the virus can replicate successfully viruses also regulate the differential expression of host genes as well as various host antiviral defense mechanisms for more efficient replication previous studies on the infection of different hosts by nidoviruses for example have shown various modifications in host innate immune and stress responses cell cycle autophagy and cell death pathways 20212223 all of which will be discussed in this review the significance of host components being used to supplement the gene-poor virus in various processes cannot be dismissed for although they typically serve as enhancers they could also become major pathogenicity factorsthe extrinsic pathway can be induced by several cytokine death receptors from the tumor necrosis factor tnf family such as fas apo1cd95 25 upon recruitment of their respective ligands they form complexes that subsequently bind death effector domain ded-containing procysteine aspartyl-specific proteases pro-caspases in particular pro-caspase-8 where the activation and consequent oligomerization of which further serves is a signal for downstream activations thus pledging the doomed cell towards its own death 26 the intrinsic pathway on the other hand is activated by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm 27 in the cytosol cytochrome c binds the apoptotic protease-activating factor apaf1 together they form an apoptosome that leads to the release of active caspase 9 apoptotic mitochondrial events are also regulated primarily through the activation of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic proteins 28 the bcl-2 family of proteins constitutes a critical control point in the regulation of apoptosis they form three major protein subgroups the bcl-2 homology bh 3 or bh3-only proteins eg bh3-interacting domain death agonist bid bcl2-associated agonist of cell death bad bax-like proteins eg bcl-2-antagonistkiller 1 bak bcl-2-associated x bax and the bcl-2-like factors eg myeloid cell leukemia-1 mcl-1 bcl-extra large bcl-xl 29 bh3-only and bax-like proteins are essential initiators of apoptosis while the bcl-2-like proteins are pro-survival factors that safeguard the cells against apoptosisboth caspase 8 from the extrinsic pathway and caspase 9 from the intrinsic pathway have been observed to activate the main effector caspase 3 which in turn activates a caspase cascade to eventually evoke the morphological hallmarks of apoptosis such as dna fragmentation 3031 a third apoptotic pathway induced by prolonged endoplasmic reticulum er stress has also been shown to activate multiple downstream apoptotic targets including rodent caspase 12 growth arrest and dna damage-inducible gene 153 gadd153 also known as the transcription factor cebp homologous protein chop as well as activation of the pro-apoptotic c-jun nh2-terminal kinase jnk 32 human pro-inflammatory caspase 4 a nearly identical paralogue of the rodent form of caspase 12 has also been shown to possess comparable roles in er-stressed apoptosis 33 jnk activation is mediated by er transmembrane protein kinases while chop is triggered by er stress at the transcriptional level 32 the downstream apoptotic activities of both jnk and chop have also been postulated at least in part to be connected with the bcl-2 family of proteins bak and bax for recruitment to the er and subsequent initiation of apoptosis in response to stress 32 as viruses depend on the host cells they infect in order to reproduce apoptosis is often employed as an important host antiviral defense mechanism that as a protective measure leads to the abortion of virus infection such that viral productivity and persistent infectivity is consequently limited 34 in many cases p53 and the bcl-2 family of proteins have been shown to be the main mediators that induce the beleaguered cell to undergo self-induced death at various stages of the infection cycle 35 moreover host endosomal membranes are forced to undergo conformational changes for the fusion of virus and host cell membranes during virus uncoating membrane integrity is also antagonized during the process of virus disassembly as such these drastic alterations to membranes may elicit downstream pro-death signals that prompt infected cells to commit suicide 36however certain viruses have evolved strategies to both counteract and induce apoptosis in order to maximize the production of virus progeny and promote its spread to neighbouring cells an increasing number of known viruses from different families including arteriviruses have been found to induce apoptosis during their infection cycle which may possibly contribute to the cytotoxicity associated with virus infections especially during late stages of infection 37 membrane-bound cell fragments are also produced as apoptotic bodies to be phagocytosed by surrounding cells this provides an excellent method for a virus to disperse its progeny without eliciting host immune response 38 while more comprehensive work needs to be done to paint a clearer picture of how coronaviruses and arteriviruses regulate apoptosis during infection recent reports have suggested the possible activation of more than one apoptotic pathway during infection eav an arterivirus that is prevalent among global horse populations and which may induce abortions in pregnant mares 39 has been shown to activate apoptosis through the initiation of caspase-8-dependent mechanisms which is followed by mitochondria-dependent caspase-9 activation mechanisms 40 pprsv a virus that causes respiratory tract problems in young pigs and has a commercially significant impact on swine industries worldwide as a result of reproductive impairment in breeding livestock 41 has also been implicated to regulate both apoptosis and necrosis during infection 4243 replication of tgev in porcine kidney cells as well as that of canine coronavirus type ii ccov-ii in canine fibrosarcoma cells on the other hand has been reported to induce apoptosis both through fasfasl-activation and mitochondrial-dependent pathways 4445 although ibv is an avian virus it can acclimate to primate cells and has been demonstrated to conquer the host species barrier and become zoonotic to infect both human and animal cells 4647 ibv also triggers apoptosis during the late stages of its cytolytic infection cycle specifically ibvinduced apoptosis has been shown to involve bcl-2 family of proteins 48 through caspasedependent 49 and p53-independent 50 pathways in cultured mammalian cells the modulation of bcl-2 family proteins during ibv infection has also been postulated to be under the regulation of signaling pathways such as er stress and mitogen-activated protein kinaseextracellular signal-regulated kinase mapkerk pathways 48 the effects of these pathways on the regulation of other host defenses will be discussed in later paragraphswhile viral genes can also manipulate the induction of apoptosis to the benefit of viruses only two have been reported in the case of coronaviruses the unique sars-cov encoded protein 7a was discovered to have caspase-dependent pro-apoptotic functions and may function as a plausible source of virus-derived apoptotic signal 51 while tgev accessory gene 7 present only in coronaviruses classified under genus 1 52 thwarts virulence and host-induced antiviral mechanisms through the negative modulation of downstream caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways 53 figure 1 when the host immune system is exposed to viral pathogens it reacts straightaway by triggering a diverse array of defense mechanisms in order to establish a more efficacious shield the first line of defense is the mounting of an innate immune response as characterized by the increased production of type i interferons ifn- and ifn- and other inflammatory cytokines these in turn choreograph the expression of downstream ifn-stimulated genes isgs and activate several signaling pathways all of which collaboratively lead to the induction of a protective antiviral state and subsequently the inhibition of both viral replication and proliferation 57 the cytokine family of interferons is dedicated to the conveyance of the presence of infection as well as the expedition of numerous connections among the cells that provide protection against or eradication of foreign pathogens other than interfering with viral progeny production in host cellshence the name interferonifns also induce natural killer nk cells and macrophages to kill or engulf infected cells increase antigen presentation to thymus t cell lymphocytes for rapid recognition of infected cells and bring about virus resistance to new uninfected cells 58 ifns are conventionally classified into three types type i ifn- ifn- and ifn- type ii ifn- and the more recently identified type iii ifn-1 ifn-2 and ifn-3 5960 over time mammalian hosts have gradually developed a multitude of cellular sensors for the detection of viral infection and it is the involvement and operation of these cellular protein receptors that eventually leads through an intricate network of pathways to the expression of type 1 ifns major receptor systems that conduct immune surveillance and trigger the production and subsequent release of type i ifns are known as pattern recognition receptors pprs which detect viral infection through the identification of various pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps ppr families include the toll-like receptor tlr rig-like helicase rlh and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain nod-like receptor nlrs families 61 the tlr family is mainly made up of transmembrane proteins which conduct surveillance from the cell surface as well as cellular compartments such as the endosome or er constantly scanning the extracellular environment for pamps that can be derived from a wide range of microorganisms including viruses and bacteria the expression of tlrs appear to be cell-specific and is mainly found in antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells dcs monocytes and macrophages as well as on b cells 62 tlrs recognize a wide variety of pamps and the recognition of these ligands can be converted into specific intracellular responses through the direct interaction of the tlr toll-interleukin 1 receptor tir domain with one of its cytoplasmic tir-containing signaling adaptor molecules such as myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 myd88 and tir domain-containing adaptor-inducing ifn trif 63 viral recognition by tlrs has been detailed in several reports 6465 in particular the activation of tlr-3 -4 -7 -8 and 9 can also culminate in type i ifn production 6566 tlr3 as a general viral sensor detects mainly through double stranded rna dsrna a replication intermediate of both dna and rna viruses tlr4 recognizes envelope proteins from viruses such as mouse mammary tumor virus mmtv tlr7 and tlr8 have been identified to recognize ssrna viruses like influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus vsv tlr9 detects dsdna viruses such as herpesviruses 63 nlrs are stimulated by microbial agonists and collaborate with tlrs to evoke intracellular immune responses through mapk and caspase signaling cascades upon sensing bacterial components 67 nlrs are also known to sense both pamps from infectious agents and damps dangerassociated molecular patterns that arise as a result of insult or injury to the cell as well as those derived from the environment 68 although the direct binding of virus-derived pamps to nlrs is yet to be reported structural and functional studies of the c-terminal domain of nlrx1 a mitochondrial member of the nlr family has highlighted its ability to bind both ssrna and dsrna implying that some nlrs may be capable of binding viral rna directly as well 69 as such the notion of nlr-mediated recognition of coronaviruses is therefore probable and could be further investigatedthe rlh family of purely cytoplasmic prrs is made up of the following retinoic acid inducible gene-i rig-i or ddx58 melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 mda5 or ifih1 and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 lgp2 rig-i and mda5 are prrs with two n-terminal caspase-recruitment domains cards followed by a dexdh box rna helicase domain lgp2 lacks the signaling caspase recruitment domains but shares a helicase domain of similar homology and is thought to serve as a regulator of the former 70 rig-i and mda-5 both sense cytoplasmic dsrna which the host recognizes as non-self via the n-terminal cards 71 however the two prrs each sense distinct pamps depending on the length of viral dsrna from different rna viruses in addition to long dsrnas 2 kb such as the synthetic dsrna analogue poly-inosinic poly-cytidylic acid polyic mda5 also recognizes picornaviruses and noroviruses 7273 rig-i on the other hand responds to paramyxoviruses flaviviruses orthomyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses 617475 this is through its recognition of a variety of ligands such as relatively short dsrna 19-mer to 1 kb and ssrna single stranded rna both preferably in the presence of a 5-triphosphate end full-length rna viral genomes the presence of secondary structures such as poly-uridine motifs within 5-triphosphate genome termini or longer rna sequences without 5-triphosphates such as 3 untranslated regions utrs of the genome 7677787980 while the elicitation of tlrs and rlrs by pamps trigger their distinct signaling cascades through divergent downstream effectors at varying efficacies they ultimately cross paths at the juncture of transcriptional activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 irf3 81 irf7 82 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells nf-b 83848586 all of which translocate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of both type i interferons ifn and ifn and inflammatory cytokines that eventually culminates in the concerted induction and development of adaptive antiviral immune responsethe expression and induction of interferons from the cells occurs in response to viral insults and tumor growth 87 type i interferons the major group of cytokines in innate anti-virus defense bind a specific cell surface heteromeric receptor the interferon- receptor ifnar which composed of two subunits ifnar1 and ifnar2 88 the best characterized type i ifns can be classified into two major groups the immediate-early genes such as ifn that are triggered by the initial response to virus infection and the delayed-set such as ifn subtypes that rely on a secondary de novo protein synthesis pathway 89 ifn expression is regulated by ifn regulatory factors in particular irf3 and irf7 play vital roles in activating innate immune response through their respective antiviral response 66 irf3 has been functionally characterized to consist of a nuclear export signal nes a dnabinding domain dbd a c-terminal irf association domain iad as well as a number of phosphorylation sites as well as two auto-inhibitory domains that prevents a constitutive activation of the nes dbd and iad 90 normally found in an inactive cytoplasmic form irf3 is phosphorylated as a consequence of virus infection this activation signal exposes the dbd and iad and results in the dimerization of irf3 either as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with irf7 allowing the activated irf3 to form a complex with the transcriptional co-activator camp-response element-binding protein crebp to translocate to the nucleus and bind to dna to trigger the transcription and expression of immediate-early ifns which signals the jak-stat janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway through the binding of the ifnar 90 this leads to the formation of a stat1-stat2 heterodimer that teams up with the interferon regulatory dna binding factor irf9 which together constitute an activated heterotrimeric factor the interferon-stimulated gene transcription factor isgf3 that through the recognition and binding of specific isres induces downstream expression of innate immunity genes for host defense against virus invasion 91 in contrast to the constitutive expression of irf3 irf7 is involved in the positive feedback regulation of ifn production 89 expressed only in minute amounts the induction of irf7 via virusinduced activation of isgf3 results in either homo-dimerization or hetero-dimerization with irf3 and is subsequently followed by nuclear translocation for the activation of both ifn and ifn genes 9293 coronaviruses and arteriviruses have evolved multiple strategies to avoid elimination from the host these tactics range from the prevention of detection to inhibition of antiviral responses mounted by the host immune system all these activities involve virus-host interactions at different levels figure 2the modulation of sars-cov pathogenesis for example was reported to be independent of all three types types i ii and iii of interferon signaling mechanisms with sars-cov orf 3b orf 6 and nucleocapsid proteins identified to interfere with interferon signaling through various mechanisms 94 however stat1 has been shown by the same group to be crucial in activating innate immune signaling pathways during sars-cov infection with a secondary role in the prevention of uncontrolled cell reproduction 95 in contrast prrsv appears to be receptive to both ifn- porcine ifn- or ad5-pifn- and - recombinant swine beta interferon or swifn-beta dose-dependent treatment 9697 however pigs infected with prrsv do not evoke significant ifn responses with little or no ifn- and ifn- production 9899 upstream signaling pathways that may potentially lead to the inhibition of irf3 activation include the interference of prrsv with rig-i signaling events through inactivation of the rig-i downstream signaling adaptor mavs mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein 100 recent studies have also suggested prrsv infection inhibits type i ifn production and signaling processes through the impairment of stat1stat2 nuclear translocation 101 one of the most indispensible adaptor proteins in the rlh signaling pathway is mavs otherwise known as virus-induced signaling adaptor visa interferon  ifn promoter stimulator-1 ips-1 or card-adaptor inducing ifn- cardif it was discovered independently by four different research groups in 2005 102103104105 and contains an n-terminal card-like domain which interacts with the card domains of rig-i and mda5 and a c-terminal transmembrane tm region that lodges the protein in the mitochondrial membrane thus pioneering the connection between mitochondria and innate immunity a deficiency in or the cleavage of mavs from the mitochondrial membrane results in an arrested antiviral immune response highlighting the pivotal role mavs plays in mitochondria-mediated innate antiviral immunity 106 mavs can also induce apoptosis independently of type i ifn activation with sars-cov non-structural protein 15 identified as an inhibitor of mavs-induced apoptosis to escape host antiviral immune responses 107coronaviruses have devised a number of cell type-specific strategies to inhibit type i ifn responses one such strategy that these viruses have adopted is to avoid detection of its newly synthesized mrnas in the cytoplasm through the encoding of a 2-o-methylase non-structural protein nsp16 that creates a 5-cap structure analogous to the cellular mrnas on their mrnas thereby escaping detection by mda5 108109 more importantly this also highlights the significance of mrna cap alterations as such 2-o-methylation as pertinent molecular signals for the discernment between self and non-self mrna 108 however during the course of viral transcription and replication uncapped double-stranded rna intermediates are generated and these may serve as ligands for the rig-i andor mda5 mouse hepatitis virus mhv infection was first reported to activate type i ifn responses in various cell types such as macrophages and microglia in the brains of infected animals and the virus has also been shown in the same report to be recognized specifically by mda5 in mouse macrophages 110 in other reports both rig-i and mda5 have been implicated in the detection of mouse hepatitis virus mhv infection particularly in mouse oligodendrocytes 111 although conflicting evidence has been reported as well especially since it is not understood how cellular helicases could bind viral replicativetranscriptive intermediates when the latter should have been isolated by the double membrane vesicles 112 mhv infection can also delay ifn-activated isg induction however this phenomenon is limited to certain cell types and is observed only when the infection occurs before ifn exposure 113 as such the general sensing of coronaviruses appears to be cell-type specific with type i ifns derived from plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdcs conventional dcs and macrophages being particularly essential in curbing the pathogenesis of mouse coronavirus infection 114detection by the prrs would activate signaling cascades leading to the production of type i ifns resulting in the establishment of an antiviral state thus coronaviruses do not just avoid detection by the host immune system which appears to be the main strategy of ensuring successful replication 115 some viruses also encode proteins that function to disrupt the downstream signaling cascades at various points preventing the establishment of an effective antiviral state when detection of the viral pamps has occurred indeed the n protein has also been shown to interfere with the 2 5-oligoadenylate synthetasernasel 2-5oas activation that occurs downstream of ifn induction and which leads to the inhibition of global translation shutdown 116 this activity is in addition to its suppression of ifn induction through the binding of viral rnas that prevents their detection 117 in addition to the processing of polyproteins the papain-like proteinase 2 plp2 domain of nsp3 has been shown to possess de-ubiquitinating activity 118119120 plp2 of nsp3 de-ubiquitinates tankbinding kinase 1 tbk1 the activating kinase for irf3 and irf3 itself and sequesters the hypo-phosphorylated tbk1-irf3 complex in the cytoplasm as well this prevents irf3 nuclear translocation 121122 thereby inhibiting the transcription of type i interferons 123in vitro activation of chicken splenocytes and peripheral blood leukocytes with ibv has also resulted in an increase in chicken interferon gamma chifn- production as a form of cell-mediated immune response 124 this appears to be a polyclonal non-specific stimulation as chifn- production levels are also elevated in ibv-stimulated chicken splenocytes which lack prior exposure to ibv when compared to control un-stimulated cells as well as in cells exposed to inactivated ibv 124such ineffectual host innate responses could lead to poor cellular responses which may result in a delay in pathogen clearance and persistent viral infection in compromised pigs which would present significant advantages to the virus for the subsequent release of viral progeny and spread the onset of coronavirus-induced apoptosis is intricately linked with other host antiviral innate defenses infections with viruses often result in cell cycle arrests and the activation of unfolded protein response upr due to er stress both of which may be accompanied by the parallel activation of apoptosis in the infected cellsduring virus replication newly translated viral proteins accumulate in the er which may also cause stress that leads to activation of the upr mhv s protein has been shown to activate three upr transducers inositol-requiring enzyme 1 ire1 activating transcription factor 6 atf6 and protein kinase rna-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase perk 125 in particular perk activation leads to the activation of p38 mapk 126 which stimulates virus replication 127128 sars-cov on the other hand has been shown to attenuate the ire1 signaling pathway which generally led to the downregulation of stress responses and upr and further decreased apoptotic signaling in infected cells as well to the likely benefit of the virus for better viral progeny production and release 129coronavirus-induced apoptosis during the late stages of infection is also partially regulated by the p38 mapk signaling pathway which in turn up-regulates production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin il-6 and il-8 in infected host cells and mount an immune response against virus infection in these cells 130131 however while pro-inflammatory cytokines are up-regulated at the transcriptional level during coronavirus infection there is minimal to moderate up-regulation at the translational level leading to the hypothesis that the interaction between ibv spike s protein and host eukaryotic initiation factor 3 eif3 modulates host gene expression especially genes involved in innate immunity that are activated during coronavirus infection 132 this also agrees with the hypothesis that notwithstanding the presence of virus-induced er stress responses a significant decline in host mrna translation in infected cells impedes the expression of er stress proteins despite elevated mrna concentrations of the former 133 moreover the negative modulation of p38 mapk occurs through an up-regulation of the dual-specificity phosphatases 1 dusp1 feedback loop during ibv infection which reduces cytokine production by dephosphorylation of phosphor-threonine and phosphor-tyrosine residues on activated p38 mapks 130prrsv infection of porcine macrophages too appears to be under the control of the mapkerk pathway through various signaling pathways activated by the latter that regulate a variety of cellular processes 134 in particular chemical inhibition of the erk pathway resulted in an attenuation of prrsv infection during the early stages of infection post-virus attachment during which a notable reduction in viral sub-genomic mrna synthesis and translation as well as in progeny virus release was observed 134 an increase in il-10 production during the early stages of infection has also been observed in pigs infected with prrsv the up-regulation of il-10 an important cytokine in the attenuation of innate and adaptive immune responses is advantageous for prrsv to sustain for a longer period of time in the host and the prrsv n protein has been suggested as the viral protein responsible for mediating il-10 induction 135likewise the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators il-1 il-6 il-8 and tnf- are upregulated during eav infection of equine endothelial cells and macrophages with virulent eav strains activating sufficiently greater amounts of these cytokines especially tnf- than avirulent eav strains 136 moreover the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn- tnf- il-1 and il-6 is also up-regulated during porcine respiratory coronavirus and tgev infection and the differential modulation of which are postulated to function as crucial mediators of viral respiratory diseases in pigs 41 in particular early type i ifn production in coronavirus-infected pigs effectuated immunomodulatory responses which suggests the potential ability of ifn inducers as an effective antiviral strategy to control the rate of coronavirus infections in swine populations 137rantes regulated upon activation normal t cell expressed and secreted is a known member of the pro-inflammatory cc chemokines family that function in the modulation of the migration of inflammatory cells such as monocytes and natural killer cells to sites of infection particularly as a form of host antiviral immune response during virus infection 138 like coronaviruses prrsv infection also triggers the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including rantes 139 which may be fundamental in initiating the pathological conditions associated with the arterivirus the activation of rantes transcription also requires the participation of adaptor molecules from the tlr signaling pathway such as myd88 trif and tnf receptor-associated factor 6 traf6 139interestingly respiratory prrsvprcv viral co-infections that commonly occurs in pigs on the other hand frequently leads to severely attenuated innate and adaptive immune responses in order to extend the pathogenicity of prrsvthus down-regulating innate immunityand renders the host more vulnerable to subsequent infections by prcv or other respiratory viruses that instead upregulates innate immunity possibly due to further more severe damage to pulmonary cells and tissue and which may ultimately lead to a more critical form of pneumonia 140other types of host innate defense against virus infection include processes such as autophagy a vital physiological process in which cells degrade their own organelles in response to a severe lack of nutrients or other cellular stresses so as to facilitate the removal of damaged cellular components and prevent the build-up of unwanted products in the cells 141 autophagy is also known to mount crucial innate immune responses against invading pathogens with degradation of the latter through autophagy on the other hand autophagosomes may instead help promote virus infection by bringing together viral replicase proteins 142 multiple host-derived cytokines have emerged to play differential roles in regulating the onset of this essential mechanism as well of note are the t-helper cells th1 group of cytokines including ifn- tnf- il-1 il-2 and il-6 which have the ability to induce autophagy while th2 cytokines such as il-4 il-10 and il-13 have been shown to inhibit autophagy 143 recent studies have shown the ability of ibv to induce autophagy during infection independently of cellular stress or nutrient deprivation and this can be made possible through the functions of ibv nsp 6 as well as in nsp6 orthologs of mammalian coronaviruses such as mhv and arteriviruses such as prrsv although a direct link between ibv infection and autophagosome formation could not be established 22 as such the induction of autophagy that has previously been reported during coronavirus and arterivirus replication may instead be an example of an innate defense tactic against infection to remove unwanted viral particles while nsp6as well as its respective orthologsmay alternatively modify adaptive immune strategies by targeting the breakdown of immunomodulatory proteins synthesized by the er in autophagosomes 22viruses may also exploit the host cell cycle to benefit their own replication 144 figure 3 cell cycle regulation typically involves mechanisms critical to cell sustainability such as the surveillance and correction of genetic damage and the impediment of unrestrained cell division cyclins and cyclindependent kinases cdks are well-known regulatory proteins and the activation of which will dictate a cells progress through the cell cycle briefly activated heterodimers consisting of both cyclins and cdks as the regulatory and catalytic subunits respectively will alter the phosphorylation state of various target proteins for progression into the next stage of the cell cycle cdk inhibitors include tumor suppressors such as the cipkip cdk interacting proteinkinase inhibitory protein and the ink4aarf inhibitor of kinase 4alternative reading frame family of genes that thwart progression to the next stage of the cell cycle 145the inactivation of cdks can also be a reversible process through the phosphorylation of essential residues tyr 15 and thr 14 both of which are located within the cdk atp-binding loop 146 dualspecificity phosphatases of the cdc25 cell division cycle 25 family are responsible for the dephosphorylation of tyr 15 and thr 14 147 these cdc25 proteins are in turn inactivated by chk1chk2-mediated phosphorylation this inactivation averts cdk dephosphorylation and impedes its subsequent activation 148 chk1chk2 activation after dna damage andor dna replication hindrance is dependent on the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated atm and atmrad3-related atr protein kinases in mammalian cells 149150ibv infection of cultured cells results in cell cycle arrest at both s and g2m phases to boost viral replication and to enhance the production of viral proteins as well this p53-independent growth inhibitory outcome is catalyzed by regulation of the expression of multiple cell cycle regulatory genes such as corresponding cdk complexes 50 and the down-regulation of down-regulation of g1 phase regulatory cyclins d1 and d2 151 as well as through systemic modulation of atr-dependent cellular dna damage response 152 specifically the interaction of coronavirus nsp13 with the p125 subunit of dna polymerase  was discovered to trigger dna replication stress in cells during ibv infection which eventually led to cell cycle arrest at the s phase 152it has also been observed that the n protein of several coronaviruses can localize in the nucleolus where it may perturb cell cycle activities of the host cell for the benefit of viral mrna synthesis 153154155156 ibv n for example appears to target cdk2 cyclins a and d1 for proteasome-mediated degradation 50157 and cause the accumulation of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma prb resulting in the downregulation of cdk1 cyclins e and b1 50 the regulation of host protein synthesis especially at the initiation stage is often a regular viral objective for the extensive reduction of host protein translation so as to construct the most favorable condition for viral replication and progeny assembly protein kinase r pkr is a prevalent serinethreonine protein kinase that can be induced by interferon in its latent state and whose activation is dependent by the presence of dsrna products is one such viral target pkr plays an important role in the cellular anti-viral response pathway and becomes activated via auto-phosphorylation upon binding to virus-derived dsrna which then subsequently leads to host translation inhibition through phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 eif2alpha 158 the dephosphorylation of eif2alpha is established by cellular protein phosphatase-1 pp1 which functions to regular various cellular processes through the physical interaction of its catalytic subunit pp1c with regulatory proteins such as gadd34chop that is induced by dna damage signals 159160 in the case of ibv for example eif2alpha phosphorylation was significantly suppressed in both human and animal cells during infection the dephosphorylation of eif2alpha during ibv infection appears to be induced by the up-regulation of gadd34 expression which together with the simultaneous attenuation of pkr auto-phosphorylation following ibv infection in these cells serves as a viral regulatory tactic in boosting coronavirus replication while managing the delicate balance of de novo protein translation along with the identification of ibv nsp2 as a potential albeit weak mediator in the dose-dependent inhibition of pkr activation 161 tgev too suppresses both cellular rna degradation and eif2a phosphorylation during infection through an interaction between tgev protein 7 and pp1 that regulates host antiviral responses and extends the period of viral progeny dispersal as well 53 a subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 eif3f has also been discovered to modulate host translation inhibitory effects through physical interaction with coronavirus spike protein 132 as this inhibition takes place during the late stages of the coronavirus replication cycle translation of virusinduced transcripts are largely affected especially pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines this could account for the fact that while il-6 mrna expression is up-regulated during the early stages of coronavirus infection insubstantial increase in il-6 protein expression was observed 132 the inhibition of host protein synthesis through the interaction between coronavirus spike protein and eif3f may therefore have a significant impact on the modulation of coronavirus pathogenicityhost proteins are also known to play a role in the virus life cycle especially during viral rna replication and transcription figure 4 the most well studied host protein that interacts with the coronavirus genome is heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a1 hnrnp a1 a nuclear protein whose biological function is to regulate alternative splicing of cellular rnas 162163 the hnrnp a1 has been shown to bind to both negative-sense leader sequence and negative-sense intergenic ig sequence of mhv 164 the formation of a rnp complex among hnrnp a1 negative-sense leader and ig sequences has also been demonstrated 165 in addition to its ability to interact with the coronavirus rna hnrnp a1 was also found to interact and co-localize with n protein 166167 an important player in coronavirus rna synthesis 168169 it has also been highlighted that hnrnp a1 may be required to recruit other cellular proteins to the replicase complex 170 to ascertain the involvement of cellular factors in tgev rna synthesis tgev 3 and 5 genome ends were used as baits for rna affinity protein purification 171 of the ten cellular proteins pulled down with either genome end polya-binding protein pabp hnrnp q and glutamyl-prolyl-trna synthetase eprs were confirmed to enhance tgev infection through their respective interactions with the tgev 3 end while glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gapdhoriginally employed as a controlwas discovered surprisingly to have a diminishing effect on tgev infection instead 171for arteriviruses the common leader sequence of eav sub-genomic viral rnas too possesses the ability to interact several cellular proteins from the cytoplasmic fractions of vero cells likely for the modulation of eav rna synthesis 172 recent reports based on a yeast-based three-hybrid system to identify rnarna-binding regulatory protein interactions 173 and using the 5-utr untranslated region of sars coronavirus as bait identified zinc finger cchc-type and rna-binding motif 1 madp1 as a potential cellular protein that interacts with sars-cov and this was eventually established via an in vitro pull-down assay with the 5-utr of ibv 174 madp1 was also shown by the same authors to play a role in the early stages of the coronavirus replication cycle with the rna recognition motif in the n-terminal region of the protein interacting with stem loop 1 of the ibv 5-utr specifically this protein translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the cell during ibv infection and co-localizes in part with viral replicasetranscriptase complexes rtcs in order to enhance viral replication and coronavirus rna synthesis 174 interaction with viral rna is not the only way by which cellular proteins can take part in viral rna synthesis protein-protein interactions with the viral replicase complex can modulate this process as well this was confirmed in coronaviruses with a yeast two-hybrid screen that was performed using ibv nsp14 as a bait protein which ultimately led to the discovery of ddx1 an atp-dependent rna helicase in the dexdh helicase family as an interacting partner that translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and enhances ibv replication in cultured mammalian cells through subcellular colocalization with nsp14 an exonuclease during infection 175 another yeast two-hybrid screen with ibv membrane m protein as the bait identified beta-actin as an interacting partner leading to the suggestion that actin filaments may possess the ability to participate in virion assembly and budding during the coronavirus replication cycle 176 this interaction may possibly lead to the incorporation of actin into the mature virion in fact recent proteomic analysis of purified ibv particles through two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequent mass spectrometry have confirmed among others an abundance of actin within the virus particles further cementing the hypothesis that cytoskeletal elements play crucial roles in ibv replication 177retinoblastoma tumor suppressor proteins are also interacting partners of coronavirus nsp15 an endoribonuclease which may result in alterations to the cell cycle that impact coronavirus infection and viral progeny release 178 similarly with nsp1 the functional proteolytic product of prrsv nsp1 as a bait protein cellular polyc-binding proteins 1 and 2 pcbp1 and pcbp2 respectively have been identified interacting partners of the former with specific functions in modulating prrsv replication and rna synthesis 179 the relationship between a virus and its host is complex the virus must evolve evasive strategies to avoid detection and immunological defense mechanisms from the host while the host must develop various lines of defense in order to combat viral invasion as highlighted in this review the diverse virus-host interactions established during animal coronavirus and arterivirus infections may have direct implications on viral replication itself or they may also lead to the modification of numerous signaling pathways such as cellular stress andor host antiviral innate immune response as a means to expedite viral replication and pathogenesisthe intricate network between a virus and its host is a complicated affair that involves many playersderived from both virus and hostwhich are pitted against one another in the battle for ascendancy certain host processes are readily assimilated and manipulated by the virus in its bid to impede host antiviral responses while the host is itself armored with several lines of defense mechanisms and numerous antiviral factors to combat viral invasion to prevent its spread while much progress has been made in the elucidation of the various regulatory pathways that under the most propitious of conditions will allow virus and host to co-exist in an uneasy truce a clearer understanding of the complex interplay between the virus and its host could give new insights into the role of main players such as those that govern the onset of apoptosis or type i interferons and their regulators and lead to the discovery of novel andor universal targets for the therapeutic mediation against pathogenic infection coronaviruses of humans and animals are increasingly being recognized as significant pathogens in the lower respiratory tract animals and poultry of agricultural importance including cows pigs and chickens are infected by coronavirus strains that cause respiratory and enteric diseases of varying severity in 20022003 sarscov emerged from wildlife to cause an epidemic with a 10 case fatality ratio since then two previously unknown hcov nl63 and hku1 were discovered and found to cause respiratory disease worldwide new molecular technologies for concurrently screening clinical specimens for a large number of viruses have allowed investigators to associate these newly identified coronaviruses with a wide range of respiratory diseases from mild upper respiratory tract infections to severe pneumonia primary epithelial cell cultures derived from conducting airways have been studied as targets for several respiratory viruses including sarscov it is also important to understand the role of alveolar epithelial cells in initiating and regulating local immune responses to viral infection in the alveoli through the expression of cytokines and chemokines until recently the responses of alveolar epithelial cells to virus infection were studied in continuous human or animal cell lines derived from the lung however these cell lines do not maintain the differentiated phenotypes of alveolar cells and thus are not optimal models for the highly specialized cell types of the alveolar epithelium cell culture techniques that maintain the differentiated phenotypes of primary alveolar epithelial cells permit studies on the virushost interactions that influence immune responses to alveolar infection understanding the molecular details of these interactions will be critical for designing effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of respiratory virus infectionsthe repiratory and enteric tracts are common targets for coronaviruses that infect animals and poultry including pigs cows dogs rodents and chickens porcine respiratory coronavirus infects the epithelial cells of the lung and disease ranges from subclinical infection to moderate bronchointerstitial pneumonia depending on the virus strain

2
 bovine coronavirus causes disease in the enteric tract and the upper and lower respiratory tracts which has been associated with shipping fever 
3
 infectious bronchitis virus causes a highly infectious respiratory disease in the upper respiratory tract and bronchi of chickens that is especially severe in chicks 
3
 canine respiratory coronavirus was discovered in 2003 and is prevalent worldwide in populations of kenneled dogs however its pathogenesis and contribution to kennel cough in dogs are incompletely understood 
4
 
5
 the murine coronavirus mhv1 causes fatal interstitial pneumonitis in the aj strain of inbred mice

 rcov strains cause respiratory diseases with differing degrees of severity depending on the viral strain and the age strain and immune status of the animal

9
five hcov cause respiratory infections with various degrees of severity hcov229e and hcovoc43 which were discovered in the 1960s are a significant cause of common colds and can cause severe lower respiratory tract disease in elderly infant and immunocompromised patients 
10
 
11
 
12
 
13
 in 2003 sarscov was identified as the causative agent of the epidemic of sars 
14
 
15
 subsequently two additional hcov hcovnl63 and hcovhku1 were discovered to cause respiratory disease in patients worldwide 
16
 
17
 
18
 
19
 hcovnl63 is associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections laryngotracheitis croup and bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children 
17
 
18
 
19
 hcovhku1 is also associated with upper respiratory tract infections in children and pneumonia in elderly patients with underlying diseases 
10
 
20
 because of these findings it is important to understand the mechanisms of coronaviral pathogenesis in the lungmost coronaviruses with the notable exception of bovine coronavirus infect and cause disease in one species or a limited number of related species 
21
 although there are several animal models for sarscov infection 
22
 there are no animal models for respiratory diseases caused by the other four hcov 
23
 
24
 therefore it is important to study these coronaviruses in differentiated human alveolar epithelial cells in vitro however it is desirable to study respiratory coronaviruses for which in vitro studies in differentiated alveolar cells can be correlated with pulmonary infection in vivo therefore we are studying rcov infection in its natural host as a model for pathogenesis of respiratory coronaviruses the study of rcov infection in rats provides an excellent model for understanding the innate immune responses of the alveoli to infection by a respiratory coronavirus of its natural hostthe alveolar epithelium consists of two morphologically and functionally distinct cell types 
25
 ninetyeight percent of the surface area of the alveolar epithelium is made up of at1 cells which are large flattened nondividing cells that function in gas exchange and fluid homeostasis 
26
 
27
 at1 cells are identified in lung tissue by their morphology specific binding to ricinus communis 1 lectin and expression of t1 and aquaporin5 
26
 at2 cells are cuboidal dividing cells and are progenitors for replacement of damaged at1 cells 
28
 at2 cells produce surfactant lipids and proteins that keep the alveoli open and contribute to innate defense of the lung 
29
 at2 cells are distinguished in situ by binding to maclura pomifera lectin the presence of lamellar bodies and expression of spa spb and spc

 infection of alveolar epithelial cells in vivo by respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus influenza a virus and sarscov can have significant effects on respiratory functions in the alveoli infection of at1 cells can impair gas exchange and removal of fluid from the lung in addition infection of at2 cells can compromise repair of the damaged alveolar epithelium and innate defense of the alveoliin autopsy specimens from sars patients immunohistochemistry detected sarscov antigens in at1 or at2 cells or both cell types as well as in alveolar macrophages and bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells 
30
 
31
 
32
 
33
 differences in the cell types that contain viral antigen in different patients may reflect the age of the patient andor the time after infection when the patient died studies on sarscov infection in primate murine feline and ferret models have also demonstrated infection of alveolar epithelial cells sarscov antigens were detected in at1 cells of cynomolgus macaques 4 days after inoculation with sarscov at which time there was diffuse alveolar damage and neutrophil infiltration in the lung 
34
 van den brand et al 
35
 found sarscov antigen predominantly in at1 and at2 cells of cats and at2 cells of ferrets 4 days after inoculation with sarscov when all animals had diffuse alveolar damage with infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages although cats had no clinical signs of infection with sarscov ferrets inoculated with sarscov were lethargic and one of four ferrets died 4 days after inoculation in aged mouse and mouseadapted models of sars viral antigens were detected in alveolar epithelial cells without distinguishing at1 from at2 cells 
36
 
37
 
38
 in contrast to inoculation of young mice inoculation of aged mice with sarscov causes clinical signs of disease lymphocyte infiltration and alveolar damage 39 days after inoculation 
37
 despite these clinical and histopathological signs of disease aged mice recover from infection the mouseadapted sarscov ma15 isolated by roberts et al 
36
 causes lethal infection in balbc mice characterized by viral antigens in bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells with cellular necrosis and infiltration of mononuclear cells a second mouseadapted sars isolate fmusxveroe6 causes clinical signs of disease in balbc mice with a 30 mortality rate 
38
 inoculation of adult mice with this virus results in viral antigen in alveolar epithelial cells diffuse alveolar damage and infiltration of macrophages lymphocytes and neutrophils into the alveoli porcine respiratory coronavirus antigen has been identified by immunofluorescence in epithelial cells of the alveoli bronchi and bronchioli as well as alveolar macrophages 26 days after inoculation of infant pigs resulting in subclinical interstitial pneumonia

 rcov infection of adult rats results in an influx of neutrophils followed by lymphocytes and monocytes into the respiratory tract

39
 the interactions between respiratory viruses and alveolar epithelial cells can mediate the innate immune response to virus infection in the lung primary cultures of differentiated alveolar epithelial cells are a valuable model for studying these interactionshuman respiratory coronaviruses could not be isolated from patients with colds in continuous human cell lines but instead virus isolation required serial blind passage in human diploid fibroblasts or human fetal tracheal organ cultures 
40
 
41
 
42
 
43
 
44
 hcov229e and hcovoc43 caused only mild cytopathic effects in these cells but these viruses could be used to infect human volunteers to study the pathogenesis of coronavirus infection of the upper respiratory tract 
41
 
45
 hcovnl63 is also difficult to isolate from clinical specimens 
46
 and can be isolated most readily in primary differentiated human airway epithelial cells 
47
 infectious hcovhku1 has not yet been propagated in any cell culture although its entire genome sequence has been determined 
16
 in contrast sarscov could be readily isolated from patients in the vero e6 line of monkey kidney cells or in fetal rhesus kidney cells 
14
 
48
 
49
 the reasons for the fastidious requirements of most human respiratory coronaviruses for differentiated human respiratory epithelial cells are not yet understoodthe respiratory tract is lined with epithelial cells that have different functions in the upper respiratory tract nasal and sinusoidal epithelium conducting airways tracheal and bronchial epithelium and alveoli alveolar epithelial cells and all of these are susceptible to infection with a variety of respiratory viruses winther et al 
50
 demonstrated the susceptibility of primary cultures of ciliated nasal epithelial cells to infection by hcov229e without cytopathic effects polarized cultures of differentiated ciliated human conducting airway epithelia have also been used to study infection and the polarity of entry and release by hcov229e hcovnl63 and sarscov 
47
 
51
 
52
 
53
 
54
 
55
 these studies emphasize the importance of the differentiation state of ciliated cells for susceptibility to coronavirus infection 
52
 
53
 recent advances in the cultivation of differentiated alveolar epithelial cells now allow analysis of these important cell types in virus infectionas continuous cell lines derived from alveolar epithelium do not maintain their differentiated characteristics primary cultures must be used to study differentiated at1 and at2 cells in vitro primary at1 cells are difficult to isolate to a high yield and purity and propagate 
26
 however at2 cells can be readily isolated from lung tissue and under special culture conditions they maintain their at2 phenotype under different culture conditions at2 cells transdifferentiate into an at1 cell phenotype 
fig 1
 this process of transdifferentiation occurs during repair of the alveolar epithelium in vivo and can be replicated in vitro 
56
 
57
 
58
 
59
 
60
 
61
 primary rat at2 cells maintain their differentiated phenotype when they are cultured on collagenmatrigel in medium containing 5 rat serum and kgf 
62
 
63
 the at2 phenotype is characterized by a cuboidal shape lipogenesis evident by the presence of lamellar bodies and expression of surfactant proteins when rat at2 cells are cultured for 35 days in 10 fbs without kgf they lose properties of at2 cells and transdifferentiate into an at1 cell phenotype tat1 cell also called at1like cell 
56
 
58
 
59
 these cells are flattened express markers characteristic of at1 cells in vivo t1 aquaporin5 and caveolin1 and react with at1 cellspecific antibodies and lectins 
26
 
59
 
64
 
65
 
66
 
67
 
68
 as the markers used to distinguish at1 cells in situ are present in tat1 cells in vitro tat1 cells are a practical alternative to at1 cell isolation for the study of at1 cells in vitro as with any in vitro model the biological relevance of such studies must ultimately be confirmed in vivowe showed that the differentiation status of primary alveolar epithelial cells is critical in determining susceptibility to sarscov infection 
69
 human alveolar epithelial cells that were maintained with the at2 phenotype supported infection by sarscov whereas cells from the same donor that were transdifferentiated in vitro to a tat1 cell phenotype were resistant to infection in contrast to sarscov hcov229e replicates and causes cytopathic effects in cloned at2 cells which resemble an at1 cell phenotype 
70
 our studies using rcov infection of primary differentiated rat alveolar epithelial cells were the first to demonstrate coronavirus infection in tat1 and at2 cells in vitro 
71
 
72
in the lung the roles of at2 cells and alveolar macrophages in initiating and regulating an immune response have been studied extensively at2 cells produce inflammatory mediators upon exposure to inhaled microbes or particles and regulate the functions of immune cells including macrophages dendritic cells and lymphocytes in the lung 
29
 
73
 
74
 
75
 in vitro human bronchial epithelial cells and at2 cells produce cytokines and chemokines in response to infection with viruses including rsv influenza a virus and sarscov 
76
 
77
 
78
 
79
 
80
 the innate immune functions of at1 cells have only been recognized recently expression of chemokines by primary differentiated tat1 cells in vitro is increased by exposure to il1 il1 or lps 
64
 
65
 
81
 
82
 in primary cultures of murine tat1 cells influenza a virus induces expression of ccl2 and ccl5 resulting in transmigration of monocytes 
83
we have shown that rat tat1 cells in vitro express cytokines and chemokines upon infection with rcov 
71
 this study was the first to show that virus infection of primary tat1 cells induces a proinflammatory response rcov infection of tat1 cells induces expression of cytokines including gmcsf ifn and tnf and chemokines predominantly those of the cxc family 
71
 the primary functions of cxc chemokines are to recruit and activate neutrophils we hypothesize that rcov infection in the lung induces cxc chemokine expression by at1 cells which in turn recruits neutrophils to the lung the role of neutrophils during rcov infection of the lung is unknown but these cells may contribute to viral clearance and immunopathology rat tat1 cells are a valuable model in which to study the virushost interactions that regulate this response using this model we showed that like rcov infection uvinactivated rcov induces cxc chemokine expression in rat tat1 cells 
71
 so virus replication is not required to induce the chemokine response in rat tat1 cells dual immunolabeling of viral antigen and cxc chemokines in rat tat1 cells showed that cxc chemokines are expressed predominantly from uninfected cells in the culture 
71
 therefore expression of cxc chemokines during rcov infection of tat1 cells may be mediated by a paracrine mechanism we found that rcovinfected rat tat1 cells treated with il1ra had markedly decreased expression of cxc chemokines relative to cells without il1ra 
71
 treatment with soluble tnfr protein did not affect chemokine expression by rcovinfected tat1 cells thus signaling through the il1r likely mediates cxc chemokine expression by rat tat1 cells during rcov infection 
fig 2
 as il1 and il1 signal through the il1r either or both of these cytokines may contribute to cxc chemokine expression during rcov infection of tat1 cells manzer et al 
65
 
82
 showed that ril1 and ril1 induce expression of cxc chemokines by rat tat1 cells in vitro rat tat1 cells are a valuable model for investigating the early events in innate immune responses to respiratory coronavirus infectionsneutrophils infiltrate tissues early after viral infection and through the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines can direct the subsequent recruitment of monocytes and lymphocytes for example in infants with rsv bronchiolitis neutrophils accounted for 93 and 76 of inflammatory cells in the upper and lower airways respectively 
84
 
85
 however the specific functions of neutrophils during rsv infection are unclear 
86
 neutrophils infiltrate the respiratory tract by 18 h after inoculation of mice with influenza a virus and increased numbers of neutrophils have been associated with highly pathogenic influenza virus infections in mice 
87
 
88
 depletion of neutrophils from mice exacerbated infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant influenza virus strain containing the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the 1918 influenza virus 
87
 thus neutrophils can play a role in protection from virulent influenza virus infection in infection with less virulent strains of influenza a virus neutrophils can have a protective effect 
89
 
90
 or no effect 
91
 on viral replication and pathogenesis thus with different virus strains neutrophils can have different functions in the innate immune response to respiratory infectionsneutrophils also infiltrate tissues infected by coronaviruses including sarscov rcov and mhv a high neutrophil count in the blood of sars patients at the time of hospital admission was associated with a poor prognosis 
92
 
93
 a mouseadapted isolate of sarscov fmusxveroe6 causes lethal infection in adult but not young mice 
38
 the disease severity in adult mice correlates with increased pulmonary inflammation consisting predominantly of neutrophils which are also the predominant cell type detected in the nasal exudates from chickens infected with infectious bronchitis virus and are believed to contribute to disease pathology 
94
 these findings suggest that neutrophils can contribute to immunemediated pathology in some coronavirus infections infection of rats with rcov results in infiltration of neutrophils to the respiratory tract early after inoculation followed by the recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes 
7
 
8
 
39
 
95
 infection of mice with a neurotropic murine coronavirus mhvjhm results in infiltration of neutrophils into the brain by 1 day after inoculation which then promotes the recruitment of other types of inflammatory cells into the brain likely through loss of the blood brain barrier 
96
 despite the presence of neutrophils in coronavirusinfected tissues their role in the clearance andor immunopathology of coronavirus infections is largely unknown future studies on the responses of neutrophils to rcovinfected tat1 cells in vitro may elucidate the role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of respiratory coronavirus infectionson december 31 2019 chinese health officials reported a cluster of cases of acute respiratory illness in persons associated with the hunan seafood and animal market in the city of wuhan hubei province in central china on january 7 2020 chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus 2019ncov was associated with this initial cluster1 as of february 4 2020 a total of 20471 confirmed cases including 2788 136 with severe illness1 and 425 deaths 21 had been reported by the national health commission of china2 cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland china including documentation of some persontoperson transmission and one death2 as of february 4 11 cases had been reported in the united states on january 30 the world health organization who directorgeneral declared that the 2019ncov outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern2 on january 31 the us department of health and human services hhs secretary declared a us public health emergency to respond to 2019ncov3 also on january 31 the president of the united states signed a proclamation on suspension of entry as immigrants and nonimmigrants of persons who pose a risk of transmitting 2019 novel coronavirus which limits entry into the united states of persons who traveled to mainland china to us citizens and lawful permanent residents and their families3 cdc multiple other federal agencies state and local health departments and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019ncov in the united states4 5 these measures require the identification of cases and their contacts in the united states and the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland china to the united states these measures are being implemented in anticipation of additional 2019ncov cases in the united states although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing widespread transmission of the virus in the united states they are being implemented to 1 slow the spread of illness 2 provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs and 3 better characterize 2019ncov infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely as more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak cdc will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by cdc and state and local health departmentssome coronaviruses such as middle east respiratory syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars are the result of humananimal interactions preliminary investigation of 2019ncov also suggests a zoonotic origin6 but the exact origin has not yet been determined persontoperson spread is evident7 however how easily the virus is transmitted between persons is currently unclear 2019ncov is similar to coronaviruses that cause mers and sars which are transmitted mainly by respiratory droplets signs and symptoms of patients with confirmed 2019ncov infection include fever cough and shortness of breath8 based on the incubation period of illness from mers and sars coronaviruses cdc believes that symptoms of 2019ncov infection occur within 2 to 14 days following infection preliminary information suggests that older adults and persons with underlying health conditions or compromised immune systems might be at higher risk for severe illness from this virus9 however many characteristics of this novel coronavirus and how it might affect individual persons and potentially vulnerable population subgroups such as the elderly or those with chronic health conditions remain unclearon january 21 2020 the first person in the united states with diagnosed 2019ncov infection was reported as of february 4 a total of 293 persons from 36 states the district of columbia and the us virgin islands were under investigation based on current patient under investigation pui definitions4 and also included those being evaluated because they are close contacts of these puis 11 patients have confirmed 2019ncov infection using a realtime reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcr assay developed by cdc these 11 cases were diagnosed in the following states arizona one california six illinois two massachusetts one and washington one table 1 nine cases were in travelers from wuhan eight of these nine cases were identified as a result of patients seeking clinical care for symptoms and clinicians connecting with the appropriate public health systems two cases one each in california and illinois occurred in close contacts of two confirmed cases and were diagnosed as part of routine monitoring of case contacts all patients are being monitored closely for progressing illness no deaths have been reported in the united statescdc established a 2019ncov incident management structure on january 7 2020 on january 21 cdc activated its emergency operations center to optimize coordination for domestic and international 2019ncov response efforts to date cdc has deployed teams to the us jurisdictions with cases to assist with epidemiologic investigation and to work closely with state and local partners to identify and monitor close contacts and better understand the spectrum of illness transmission and virulence associated with this novel virus information learned from these investigations will help inform response actions cdc has closely monitored the global impact of this virus with staff members positioned in cdc offices around the world including mainland china and in coordination with other countries and who this coordination has included deploying cdc staff members to work with who and providing active support to cdc offices in affected countries in addition cdc in response to the escalating risks of travel from china has issued a series of travelers health notices for both wuhan and the rest of china regarding the 2019ncov outbreak on january 27 cdc issued a level 3 travel notice for travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to mainland china5
us quarantine stations located at 18 major us ports of entry are part of a comprehensive regulatory system authorized under section 361 of the public health service act 42 us code section 264 that limits the introduction of infectious diseases into the united states to prevent their spread on january 17 consistent with existing communicable disease response protocols cdc quarantine staff members instituted enhanced entry screening of travelers on direct and connecting flights from wuhan china arriving at three major us airports los angeles lax new york city jfk and san francisco sfo6 which then expanded to include travelers arriving in atlanta atl and chicago ord these five airports together receive approximately 85 of all air travelers from wuhan china to the united states us customs and border protection officers identified travelers arriving from wuhan and referred them to cdc for health screening7 any traveler from wuhan with signs or symptoms of illness eg fever cough or difficulty breathing received a more comprehensive public health assessment performed by cdc public health and medical officers8 all travelers from wuhan were also provided cdcs travel health alert notice than9 that advised them to monitor their health for 14 days and described recommended actions to take if relevant symptoms develop as of february 1 2020 a total of 3099 persons on 437 flights were screened five symptomatic travelers were referred by cdc to local health care providers for further medical evaluation and one of these persons tested positive for 2019ncovon january 24 2020 travel bans began to be instituted by the chinese government resulting in restricted travel in and out of hubei province including the city of wuhan and fewer travelers undergoing entry screening in the united states in response to the escalating risks associated with travel from mainland china on january 31 2020 the presidential proclamation further refined the border health strategy to temporarily suspend entry undergo additional screening or possible quarantine for individuals that have visited china excluding hong kong macau and taiwan in the past 14 days these enhanced entry screening efforts are taking place at 11 airports at which all air travelers from china are being directedchinese health officials posted the full 2019ncov genome sequence on january 10 2020 to inform the development of specific diagnostic tests for this emergent coronavirus1 within a week cdc developed a clinical laboratory improvement amendmentsapproved realtime rtpcr test that can diagnose 2019ncov respiratory samples from clinical specimens on january 24 cdc publicly posted the assay protocol for this test httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncovlabindexhtml on january 4 2020 the food and drug administration issued an emergency use authorization to enable emergency use of cdcs 2019ncov realtime rtpcr diagnostic panel to date this test has been limited to use at cdc laboratories this authorization allows the use of the test at any cdcqualified lab across the country cdc is working closely with fda and public health partners including the american public health laboratories to rapidly share these tests domestically and internationally through cdcs international reagent resource httpswwwinternationalreagentresourceorg in addition cdc uploaded the genome of the virus from the first reported cases in the united states to genbank the national institutes of health genetic sequence database of publicly available dna sequences httpswwwncbinlmnihgovgenbank cdc also is growing the virus in cell culture which is necessary for further studies including for additional genetic characterization once isolated the virus will be made available through bei resources httpswwwbeiresourcesorg to assist research effortsadditional information about 2019ncov is needed to better understand transmission disease severity and risk to the general population although cdc and partners are actively learning about 2019ncov initial cdc guidance is based on guidance for management and prevention of respiratory illnesses including influenza mers and sars no vaccine or specific treatment for 2019ncov infection is currently available at present medical care for patients with 2019ncov is supportiveon january 31 cdc published its third health advisory with interim guidance for clinicians and public health practitioners10 in addition cdc issued a clinical action alert through its clinician outreach and communication activity network on january 3111 interim guidance for health care professionals is available at httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncovhcpclinical-criteriahtml health care providers should identify patients who might have been exposed and who have signs or symptoms related to 2019ncov infection isolate these patients and inform public health departments this includes obtaining a detailed travel history for patients being evaluated with fever and lower respiratory tract illness criteria to guide evaluation and testing of puis for 2019ncov include 1 fever or signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness eg cough or shortness of breath in any person including health care workers who has had close contact12 with a patient with laboratoryconfirmed 2019ncov infection within 14 days of symptom onset 2 fever and signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness eg cough or shortness of breath in any person with a history of travel from hubei province china within 14 days of symptom onset or 3 fever and signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness eg cough or shortness of breath requiring hospitalization in any person with a history of travel from mainland china within 14 days of symptom onset additional nonhospitalized puis may be tested based on consultation with state and local public health officials clinicians should evaluate puis for other possible causes of illness eg influenza and respiratory syncytial virus as clinically indicatedcdc currently recommends a cautious approach to the examination of puis these patients should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and directed to a separate area if possible separated by at least 6 ft 2 m from other persons patients should be evaluated in a private room with the door closed ideally an airborne infection isolation room if available health care personnel entering the room should use standard precautions contact precautions airborne precautions and eye protection eg goggles or a face shieldclinicians should immediately notify the health care facilitys infection control personnel and local health department the health department will determine whether the patient needs to be considered a pui for 2019ncov and be tested for infection if directed by the health department to increase the likelihood of detecting 2019ncov infection cdc recommends collecting and testing both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens13 additional specimen types eg stool or urine may be collected and stored specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a pui is identified regardless of time since symptom onsetfor persons who might have 2019ncov infection and their close contacts information and guidance on how to reduce the risk for transmitting and acquiring infection is available at httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncovhcpguidance-prevent-spreadhtml close contacts should immediately call their health care providers if they develop symptoms in addition cdc is working closely with state and local health partners to develop and disseminate information to the public on general prevention of respiratory illness including the 2019ncov this includes everyday preventive actions such as washing your hands covering your cough and staying home when you are ill additional information and resources for this outbreak are available on the cdc website httpswwwcdc govcoronavirus2019ncovindexhtmlthe 2019ncov has impacted multiple countries caused severe illness and sustained persontoperson transmission making it a concerning and serious public health threat it is unclear how this virus will impact the us over time for the general population who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at the current time the immediate health risk from 2019ncov is considered low cdc multiple other federal agencies state and local health departments and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow us transmission of 2019ncov4 5 these measures require the identification of cases and contacts in the united states and the effective management of the estimated 14000 travelers arriving from mainland china to the united states each day3 these measures are being implemented based on the assumption that there will be more us 2019ncov cases occurring with potential chains of transmission with the understanding that these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing widespread transmission of the virus in the united statesit is important for public health agencies health care providers and the public to be aware of this new 2019ncov so that coordinated timely and effective actions can help prevent additional cases or poor health outcomes the critical role that the us health care system plays in halting or significantly slowing us transmission of 2019ncov is already evident eight of the first 11 us cases were detected by clinicians collaborating with public health to test persons at risk the early recognition of cases in the united states reduces transmission risk and increases understanding of the virus including its transmission and severity to inform national and global response actions2019ncov symptoms are similar to those of influenza eg fever cough or sore throat and the outbreak is occurring during a time of year when respiratory illnesses from influenza respiratory syncytial virus and other respiratory viruses are highly prevalent to prevent influenza all persons aged  6 months should receive an annual influenza vaccine and vaccination is still available and effective in helping to prevent influenza10 reducing the number of persons in the united states with seasonal influenza will reduce possible confusion with 2019ncov infection and possible additional risk to patients with seasonal influenza public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely as more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak cdc will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance

coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic poses a massive crisis to global public health as of march 11 2020 there were 118326 confirmed cases and 4292 deaths according to the world health organization who and who declared the covid-19 as a pandemic on the same day the causative agent of the covid-19 disease is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 coronaviruses can cause animal diseases such as avian infectious bronchitis caused by the infectious bronchitis virus ibv and pig transmissible gastroenteritis caused by a porcine coronavirus1 bats are commonly regarded as the natural reservoir of coronaviruses which can be transmitted to humans and other animals after genetic mutations there are seven known human coronaviruses including the novel sars-cov-2 four of them hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 have been circulating in the human population worldwide and cause mild symptoms2 coronavirus became prominence after severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers outbreaks in 2003 the sars disease caused by the sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov infected over 8000 people worldwide and was contained in the summer of 20033 sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share high sequence identity4 the mers disease infected more than 2000 people which is caused by the mers-associated coronavirus mers-cov and was first reported in saudi arabia and spread to several other countries since 20125there is no human vaccine on the market to prevent covid-19 and there is an urgent need to develop a safe and effective vaccine to prevent this highly infectious disease coronaviruses are positively-stranded rna viruses with its genome packed inside the nucleocapsid n protein and enveloped by the membrane m protein envelope e protein and the spike s protein6 while many coronavirus vaccine studies targeting different structural proteins were conducted most of these efforts eventually ceased soon after the outbreak of sars and mers with the recent covid-19 pandemic outbreak it is urgent to resume the coronavirus vaccine research as the immediate response to the ongoing pandemic the first testing in humans of the mrna-based vaccine targeting the s protein of sars-cov-2 clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04283461 table 1 started on march 16 2020 as the most superficial and protrusive protein of the coronaviruses s protein plays a crucial role in mediating virus entry in the sars vaccine development the full-length s protein and its s1 subunit which contains receptor binding domain have been frequently used as the vaccine antigens due to their ability to induce neutralizing antibodies that prevent host cell entry and infection however studies showed that s protein-based vaccination did not provide full protection and sometimes raise safety concerns78 in the meantime many other research groups and companies are also putting great efforts into developing and manufacture covid-19 vaccinesin recent years the development of vaccine design has been revolutionized by the reverse vaccinology rv which aims to first identify promising vaccine candidate through bioinformatics analysis of the pathogen genome rv has been successfully applied to vaccine discovery for pathogens such as group b meningococcus and led to the license bexsero vaccine9 among current rv prediction tools1011 vaxign is the first web-based rv program12 and has been used to successfully predict vaccine candidates against different bacterial and viral pathogens1315 recently we have also developed a machine learning approach called vaxign-ml to enhance prediction accuracy16in this study we first surveyed the existing coronavirus vaccine development status and then applied the vaxign rv and vaxign-ml approaches to predict covid-19 protein candidates for vaccine development we identified six possible adhesins including the structural s protein and five other non-structural proteins and three of them s nsp3 and nsp8 proteins were predicted to induce high protective immunity the s protein was predicted to have the highest protective antigenicity score and it has been extensively studied as the target of coronavirus vaccines by other researchers here we selected nsp3 protein as an alternative vaccine candidate which was predicted to have the second-highest protective antigenicity score yet has not been considered in any vaccine studies we investigated the sequence conservation and immunogenicity of the multi-domain nsp3 protein as a vaccine candidateto better understand the current status of coronavirus vaccine development we systematically surveyed the development of vaccines for coronavirus from the clinicaltrialsgov database and pubmed literature as of march 17 2020 extensive effort has been made to develop a safe and effective vaccine against sars or mers and the most advance clinical trial study is currently at phase ii table 1 it is a challenging task to quickly develop a safe and effective vaccine for the on-going covid-19 pandemicthere are two primary design strategies for coronavirus vaccine development the usage of the whole virus or genetically engineered vaccine antigens that can be delivered through different formats the whole virus vaccines include inactivated17 or live attenuated vaccines1819 table 2 the two live attenuated sars vaccines mutated the exoribonuclease and envelop protein to reduce the virulence andor replication capability of the sars-cov overall the whole virus vaccines can induce a strong immune response and protect against coronavirus infections genetically engineered vaccines that target specific coronavirus protein are often used to improve vaccine safety and efficacy the coronavirus antigens such as s protein n protein and m protein can be delivered as recombinant dna vaccine and viral vector vaccine table 2we first used the vaxign analysis framework1216 to compare the full proteomes of seven human coronavirus strains sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 the proteins of sars-cov-2 were used as the seed for the pan-genomic comparative analysis the vaxign pan-genomic analysis reported only the n protein in sars-cov-2 having high sequence similarity among the more severe form of coronavirus sars-cov and mers-cov while having low sequence similarity among the more typically mild hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 the sequence conservation suggested the potential of n protein as a candidate for the cross-protective vaccine against sars and mers the n protein was also evaluated and used for vaccine development table 2 the n protein packs the coronavirus rna to form the helical nucleocapsid in virion assembly this protein is more conserved than the s protein and was reported to induce an immune response and neutralize coronavirus infections20 however a study also showed the linkage between n protein and severe pneumonia or other serious liver failures related to the pathogenesis of sars21the vaxign rv analysis predicted six sars-cov-2 proteins s protein nsp3 3cl-pro and nsp810 as adhesive proteins table 3 adhesin plays a critical role in the virus adhering to the host cell and facilitating the virus entry to the host cell22 which has a significant association with the vaccine-induced protection23 in sars-cov-2 s protein was predicted to be adhesin matching its primary role in virus entry the structure of sars-cov-2 s protein was determined24 and reported to contribute to the host cell entry by interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace225 besides s protein the other five predicted adhesive proteins were all nonstructural proteins in particular nsp3 is the largest non-structural protein of sars-cov-2 comprises various functional domains26the vaxign-ml pipeline computed the protegenicity protective antigenicity score and predicted the induction of protective immunity by a vaccine candidate16 the training data consisted of viral protective antigens which were tested to be protective in at least one animal challenge model27 the performance of the vaxign-ml models was evaluated table s1 and figure s1 and the best performing model had a weighted f1-score of 094 using the optimized vaxign-ml model we predicted three proteins s protein nsp3 and nsp8 as vaccine candidates with significant protegenicity scores table 3 the s protein was predicted to have the highest protegenicity score which is consistent with the experimental observations reported in the literature the nsp3 protein is the second most promising vaccine candidate besides s protein there was currently no study of nsp3 as a vaccine target the structure and functions of this protein have various roles in coronavirus infection including replication and pathogenesis immune evasion and virus survival26 therefore we selected nsp3 for further investigation as described belowthe multiple sequence alignment and the resulting phylogeny of nsp3 protein showed that this protein in sars-cov-2 was more closely related to the human coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov and bat coronaviruses btcovhku3 btcovhku4 and btcovhku9 we studied the genetic conservation of nsp3 protein figure 1a in seven human coronaviruses and eight coronaviruses infecting other animals table s2 the five human coronaviruses sars-cov-2 sars-cov mers-cov hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 belong to the beta-coronavirus while hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 belong to the alpha-coronavirus the hcov-hku1 and hcov-oc43 as the human coronavirus with mild symptoms clustered together with murine mhv-a59 the more severe form of human coronavirus sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov grouped with three bat coronaviruses btcovhku3 btcovhku4 and btcovhku9when evaluating the amino acid conservations relative to the functional domains in nsp3 all protein domains except the hypervariable region hvr macro-domain 1 mac1 and beta-coronavirus-specific marker sm showed higher conservation in sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov figure 1b the amino acid conservation between the major human coronavirus sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov was plotted and compared to all 15 coronaviruses used to generate the phylogenetic of nsp3 protein figure 1b the sars-cov domains were also plotted figure 1b with the relative position in the multiple sequence alignment msa of all 15 coronaviruses table s3 and figure s2the immunogenicity of nsp3 protein in terms of t cell mhc-i  mhc-ii and linear b cell epitopes was also investigated there were 28 and 42 promiscuous epitopes predicted to bind the reference mhc-i  mhc-ii alleles which covered the majority of the world population respectively table s45 in terms of linear b cell epitopes there were 14 epitopes with bepipred scores over 055 and had at least ten amino acids in length table s6 the 3d structure of sars-cov-2 protein was plotted and highlighted with the t cell mhc-i  mhc-ii and linear b cell epitopes figure 2 the predicted b cell epitopes were more likely located in the distal region of the nsp3 protein structure most of the predicted mhc-i  mhc-ii epitopes were embedded inside the protein the sliding averages of t cell mhc-i  mhc-ii and linear b cell epitopes were plotted with respect to the tentative sars-cov-2 nsp3 protein domains using sars-cov nsp3 protein as a reference figure 3 the ubiquitin-like domain 1 and 2 ubl1 and ubl2 only predicted to have mhc-i epitopes the domain preceding ubl2 and pl2-pro dpup domain had only predicted mhc-ii epitopes the pl2-pro contained both predicted mhc-i and mhc-ii epitopes but not b cell epitopes in particular the tm1 tm2 and ah1 were predicted helical regions with high t cell mhc-i and mhc-ii epitopes28 the tm1 and tm2 are transmembrane regions passing the endoplasmic reticulum er membrane the hvr mac2 mac3 nucleic-acid binding domain nab sm nsp3 ectodomain 3ecto y1 and cov-y domain contained predicted b cell epitopes finally the vaxign rv framework also predicted 2 regions position 251260 and 329337 in the mac1 domain of nsp3 domain having high sequence similarity to the human mono-adp-ribosyltransferase parp14 np0600242our prediction of the potential sars-cov-2 antigens which could induce protective immunity provides a timely analysis for the vaccine development against covid-19 currently most coronavirus vaccine studies use the whole inactivated or attenuated virus or target the structural proteins such as the spike s protein nucleocapsid n protein and membrane m protein table 2 but the inactivated or attenuated whole virus vaccine might induce strong adverse events on the other hand vaccines targeting the structural proteins induce a strong immune response202930 in some studies these structural proteins including the s and n proteins were reported to associate with the pathogenesis of coronavirus2131 and might raise safety concern a study has shown increased liver pathology in the vaccinated ferrets immunized with modified vaccinia ankara-s recombinant vaccine32 although there were no other adverse events reported in other animal studies the safety and efficacy of these vaccination strategies has not been tested in human clinical trials our study applied the state-of-the-art vaxign reserve vaccinology rv and vaxign-ml machine learning strategies to the entire sars-cov-2 proteomes including both structural and non-structural proteins for vaccine candidate prediction our results indicate for the first time that many non-structural proteins could be used as potential vaccine candidatesthe sars-cov-2 s protein was identified by our vaxign and vaxign-ml analysis as the most favorable vaccine candidate first the vaxign rv framework predicted the s protein as a likely adhesin which is consistent with the role of s protein for the invasion of host cells second our vaxign-ml predicted that the s protein had a high protective antigenicity score these results confirmed the role of s protein as the important target of covid-19 vaccines however the s protein exists in many coronaviruses and many non-pathogenic human coronaviruses also use s protein to cell invasion for example despite markedly weak pathogenicity hcov-nl63 also uses s protein and employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 for cellular entry33 this suggests that the s protein is not the only factor determining the infection level of a human coronavirus in addition targeting only the s protein may induce high serum-neutralizing antibody titers but cannot induce sufficient protective efficacy34 thus alternative vaccine antigens may be consideredthe sars-cov-2 nsp3 protein was predicted to be a potential vaccine candidate as shown by its predicted second-highest protective antigenicity score adhesin property promiscuous mhc-i  mhc-ii t cell epitopes and b cell epitopes the nsp3 is the largest non-structural protein that includes multiple functional domains to support viral pathogenesis26 the multiple sequence alignment of nsp3 also showed higher sequence conservation in most of the functional domains in sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov than in all 15 coronavirus strains fig 1b the induction of nsp3-specific immunity would likely help the host to fight against the infection besides the s and nsp3 proteins our study also suggested four additional vaccine candidates including 3cl-pro nsp8 nsp9 and nsp10 all these proteins were predicted as adhesins and the nsp8 protein was also predicted to have a significant protective antigenicity scoreour predicted non-structural proteins nasp3 3cl-pro nsp8 nsp9 and nsp10 are not part of the viral structural particle and none of the non-structural proteins have been evaluated as vaccine candidates the sarsmerscovid-19 vaccine studies so far target the structural smn proteins still the non-structural proteins have been used effective vaccine antigens to stimulate protective immunity against many viruses for example the non-structural protein ns1 was found to induce protective immunity against the infections by flaviviruses35 the non-structural proteins of the hepatitis c virus were reported to induce hcv-specific vigorous and broad-spectrum t-cell responses36 the non-structural hiv-1 gene products were also shown to be valuable targets for prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines37 therefore it is reasonable to consider the sars-cov-2 non-structural proteins as possible vaccine targets as suggested by the present studyinstead of using a single protein as the vaccine antigen we would like to propose the development of a cocktail vaccine as an effective strategy for covid-19 vaccine development a typical cocktail vaccine includes more than one antigen to cover different aspects of protection3940 the licensed group b meningococcus bexsero vaccine which was developed via reverse vaccinology contains three protein antigens9 to develop an efficient and safe covid-19 cocktail vaccine it is possible to mix the structural eg s protein and non-structural eg nsp3 viral proteins the other proteins identified in our study may also be considered as possible vaccine targets the benefit of a cocktail vaccine strategy could induce immunity that can protect the host against not only the s-ace2 interaction and viral entry to the host cells but also protect against the accessary non-structural adhesin proteins eg nsp3 which might also be vital to the viral entry and replication the usage of more than one antigen allows us to reduce the volume of each antigen and thus reducing the induction of adverse events nonetheless the potentials of these predicted non-structural protein targets in vaccine development need to be experimentally validatedfor rational covid-19 vaccine development it is critical to understand the fundamental host-coronavirus interaction and protective immune mechanism7 such understanding may not only provide us guidance in terms of antigen selection but also facilitate our design of vaccine formulations for example an important foundation of our prediction in this study is based on our understanding of the critical role of adhesin as a virulence factor as well as protective antigen the choice of dna vaccine recombinant vaccine vector and another method of vaccine formulation is also deeply rooted in our understanding of pathogen-specific immune response induction different experimental conditions may also affect results4142 therefore it is crucial to understand the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms for rational vaccine developmentwe annotated peer-reviewed journal articles stored in the pubmed database and the clinicaltrialsgov database from the peer-reviewed articles we identified and annotated those coronavirus vaccine candidates that were experimentally studied and found to induce protective neutralizing antibody or provided immunity against virulent pathogen challengethe sars-cov-2 sequence was obtained from ncbi all the proteins of six known human coronavirus strains including sars-cov mers-cov hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 were extracted from uniprot proteomes43 the full proteomes of these seven coronaviruses were then analyzed using the vaxign reverse vaccinology pipeline1216 the vaxign program predicted serval biological features including adhesin probability44 transmembrane helix45 orthologous proteins46 and protein functionss1216the ml-based rv prediction model was build following a similar methodology described in the vaxign-ml16 specifically the positive samples in the training data included 397 bacterial and 178 viral protective antigens pags recorded in the protegen database27 after removing homologous proteins with over 30 sequence identity there were 4979 negative samples extracted from the corresponding pathogens uniprot proteomes43 with sequence dis-similarity to the pags as described in previous studies4749 homologous proteins in the negative samples were also removed the proteins in the resulting dataset were annotated with biological and physicochemical features the biological features included adhesin probability44 transmembrane helix45 and immunogenicity50 the physicochemical features included the compositions transitions and distributions51 quasi-sequence-order52 moreau-broto auto-correlation5354 and geary auto-correlation55 of various physicochemical properties such as charge hydrophobicity polarity and solvent accessibility56 five supervised ml classification algorithms including logistic regression support vector machine k-nearest neighbor random forest57 and extreme gradient boosting xgb58 were trained on the annotated proteins dataset the performance of these models was evaluated using a nested five-fold cross-validation n5cv based on the area under receiver operating characteristic curve precision recall weighted f1-score and matthews correlation coefficient the best performing xgb model was selected to predict the protegenicity score of all sars-cov-2 isolate wuhan-hu-1 genbank id mn9089473 proteins downloaded from ncbi a protein with protegenicity score over 09 is considered as strong vaccine immunity induction weighted f1-score  094 in n5cvthe protein nsp3 was selected for further investigation the nsp3 proteins of 14 coronaviruses besides sars-cov-2 were downloaded from the uniprot table s2 multiple sequence alignment of these nsp3 proteins was performed using muscle59 and visualized via seaview60 the phylogenetic tree was constructed using phyml61 and the amino acid conservation was estimated by the jensen-shannon divergence jsd62 the jsd score was also used to generate a sequence conservation line using the nsp3 protein sequences from 4 or 13 coronavirusesthe immunogenicity of the nsp3 protein was evaluated by the prediction of t cell mhc-i and mhc-ii and linear b cell epitopes for t cell mhc-i epitopes the iedb consensus method was used to predicting promiscuous epitopes binding to 4 out of 27 mhc-i reference alleles with consensus percentile ranking less than 10 score50 for t cell mhc-ii epitopes the iedb consensus method was used to predicting promiscuous epitopes binding to more than half of the 27 mhc-ii reference alleles with consensus percentile ranking less than 100 the mhc-i and mhc-ii reference alleles covered a wide range of human genetic variation representing the majority of the world population6364 the linear b cell epitopes were predicted using the bepipred 20 with a cutoff of 055 score65 linear b cell epitopes with at least ten amino acids were mapped to the predicted 3d structure of sars-cov-2 nsp3 protein visualized via pymol66 the predicted count of t cell mhc-i and mhc-ii epitopes and the predicted score of linear b cell epitopes were computed as the sliding averages with a window size of ten amino acids the nsp3 protein 3d structure was predicted using c-i-tasser67 available in the zhang lab webserver httpszhanglabccmbmedumicheduc-i-tasser2019-ncovthe first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 likely occurred from a zoonotic transmission in china in december 2019 linked to a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals the causative virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is capable of human-to-human transmission and spread rapidly to other parts of china and then to other locations by 24 march 2020 sars-cov-2 had infected more than 381000 people across 195 countriesregions and killed more than 16000 a pandemic as declared by the world health organization1 daily reports of sharp rises in the number of new cases continue to emerge from many countriesregions but efforts to overcome the virus are hampered by a lack of knowledge of several important aspects of sars-cov-2 infection ranging from pathogen biology to host response and treatment options therefore there is an urgent need to better understand the hostpathogen biology of covid-19 as this will offer important insights into treatment and management of the disease including identification of new therapies here we review the literature on sars-cov-2 pathophysiology its interaction with target cells and the immune response to the virus including the contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression specifically we highlight the implications of specific features of the infection for promising therapeutic interventions that could target the virus or the dysfunctional immune response moreover we discuss how studies focused on the adaptive immune response will be crucial in informing the development of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodiescoronaviruses are known to cause disease in humans and animals among these four human coronaviruses 229e nl63 oc43 and hku1 typically infect only the upper respiratory tract and cause relatively minor symptoms2 however there are three coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov-2 that can replicate in the lower respiratory tract and cause pneumonia which can be fatal sars-cov-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus its closest relative among human coronaviruses is sars-cov with 79 genetic similarity3 however among all known coronavirus sequences sars-cov-2 is most similar to bat coronavirus ratg13 with 98 similarity4 and coronavirus sequences in the pangolin a scaly anteater also share high similarity5like the other respiratory coronaviruses sars-cov-2 is transmitted primarily via respiratory droplets with a possible but unproven faecaloral transmission route on infection the median incubation period is approximately 45 days before symptom onset69 with 975 of symptomatic patients developing symptoms within 115 days8 at the point of hospital admission patients with covid-19 typically exhibit a fever and dry cough less commonly patients also experience difficulty in breathing muscle andor joint pain headachedizziness diarrhoea nausea and the coughing up of blood61015 within 56 days of symptom onset sars-cov-2 viral load reaches its peak  significantly earlier than that of the related sars-cov where viral load peaks at about 10 days after symptom onset1619 severe covid-19 cases progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards on average around 89 days after symptom onset1120the pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 infection closely resembles that of sars-cov infection with aggressive inflammatory responses strongly implicated in the resulting damage to the airways21 therefore disease severity in patients is due to not only the viral infection but also the host response the pattern of increasing severity with age is also broadly consistent with the epidemiology of sars-cov and mers-cov61114ards seen in severe covid-19 is characterized by difficulty in breathing and low blood oxygen level22 as a result some patients may succumb to secondary bacterial and fungal infections14 ards may lead directly to respiratory failure which is the cause of death in 70 of fatal covid-19 cases22 in addition the vast release of cytokines by the immune system in response to the viral infection andor secondary infections can result in a cytokine storm and symptoms of sepsis that are the cause of death in 28 of fatal covid-19 cases22 in these cases uncontrolled inflammation inflicts multi-organ damage leading to organ failure especially of the cardiac hepatic and renal systems fig 1 most patients with sars-cov infection who progressed to renal failure eventually died23the first step in infection is virus binding to a host cell through its target receptor earlier work on sars-cov demonstrated that this virus principally targets airway epithelial cells alveolar epithelial cells vascular endothelial cells and macrophages in the lung all of which express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 host target receptor used by sars-cov2426 fig 2 as sars-cov-2 uses the same entry receptor these cell subsets are likely targeted by this virus42728 sars-cov infection reduces ace2 expression in lung cells because loss of pulmonary ace2 function is associated with acute lung injury virus-induced ace2 downregulation may be important for disease pathology2932 ace2 has been shown to regulate the reninangiotensin system ras32 therefore a reduction in ace2 function after viral infection could result in a dysfunction of the ras which influences blood pressure and fluidelectrolyte balance and enhance inflammation and vascular permeability in the airwayscovid-19 shows a difference in fatality rate between males 28 and females 1733 as ace2 is located on the x chromosome there may be alleles that confer resistance to covid-19 explaining the lower fatality rate in females alternatively the oestrogen and testosterone sex hormones have different immunoregulatory functions which could influence immune protection or disease severity34sars-cov-2 shares 79 genome sequence identity with sars-cov4 the spike s protein is expressed on the surface of the virus particles giving the characteristic crown appearance the s protein comprises two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 subunit consists of an amino-terminal domain and a receptor-binding domain rbd which in sars-cov spans from amino acid residue 318 to amino acid residue 510 refs3537 the rbd binds to ace2 as its host cell target receptor which starts the infection process4 rbd binding to ace2 triggers endocytosis of the sars-cov-2 virion and exposes it to endosomal proteases38 the s2 subunit consists of a fusion peptide fp region and two heptad repeat regions hr1 and hr2 refs3940 within the endosome the s1 subunit is cleaved away exposing the fusion peptide which inserts into the host membrane the s2 region then folds in on itself to bring the hr1 and hr2 regions together this leads to membrane fusion and releases the viral package into the host cytoplasmthere is 72 similarity in the amino acid sequence of the rbds of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 with highly similar tertiary structures computational modelling and biophysical measurements indicate that the sars-cov-2 rbd binds to ace2 with higher affinity than that of sars-cov4142 in addition the sars-cov-2 s protein contains a furin-like cleavage site similarly to mers-cov and human coronavirus oc43 which is not found in sars-cov43 these characteristics could contribute to the increased infectivity of sars-cov-2 relative to sars-cov in addition to furin precleavage the cellular serine protease tmprss2 is also required to properly process the sars-cov-2 spike protein and facilitate host cell entry44one pathway for the development of therapeutics against sars-cov-2 is to block the host target ace2 receptor or tmprss2 fig 3 currently there are compounds that target these molecules that have been clinically approved for other indications for example machine learning algorithms predicted that baricitinib a janus kinase jak inhibitor approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis could inhibit ace2-mediated endocytosis45 another jak inhibitor ruxolitinib will be tested in clinical trials for treatment of covid-19 later this year46 an alternative strategy is to deliver high concentrations of a soluble form of ace2 that could potentially reduce virus entry into target host cells this principle is being tested with apn01 a recombinant form of ace2 developed by apeiron that is currently in clinical trials47 monoclonal antibodies targeting the s protein may also inhibit virus entry or fusion and are further discussed in the section entitled b cell immunity nafamostat mesylate4849 and camostat mesylate44 are known inhibitors of tmprss2 and are currently approved in several countriesregions to treat other conditions while there are no clinical trials specifically testing these drugs against covid-19 at the time of writing when camostat mesylate was tested on sars-cov-2 isolated from a patient it prevented entry of the virus into lung cells4450 if this approach is validated rapid repurposing of these drugs will be effective and timely in the fight against covid-19sars-cov-2 infection and the destruction of lung cells triggers a local immune response recruiting macrophages and monocytes that respond to the infection release cytokines and prime adaptive t and b cell immune responses in most cases this process is capable of resolving the infection however in some cases a dysfunctional immune response occurs which can cause severe lung and even systemic pathologycytopathic viruses including sars-cov-2 ref51 induce death and injury of virus-infected cells and tissues as part of the virus replicative cycle viral infection and replication in airway epithelial cells52 could cause high levels of virus-linked pyroptosis with associated vascular leakage as seen in patients with sars-cov53 pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death that is commonly seen with cytopathic viruses54 this is a likely trigger for the subsequent inflammatory response55 il-1 an important cytokine released during pyroptosis is elevated during sars-cov-2 infection11 using a variety of pattern-recognition receptors prrs alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages detect the released pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps such as viral rna and damage-associated molecular patterns damps including atp dna and asc oligomers a wave of local inflammation ensues involving increased secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines il-6 ifn mcp1 and ip-10 into the blood of afflicted patients1122 these cytokines are indicators of a t helper 1 th1 cell-polarized response which parallels observations made for sars-cov and mers-cov56 secretion of such cytokines and chemokines attracts immune cells notably monocytes and t lymphocytes but not neutrophils from the blood into the infected site5758 pulmonary recruitment of immune cells from the blood and the infiltration of lymphocytes into the airways may explain the lymphopenia and increased neutrophillymphocyte ratio seen in around 80 of patients with sars-cov-2 infection659in most individuals recruited cells clear the infection in the lung the immune response recedes and patients recover however in some patients a dysfunctional immune response occurs which triggers a cytokine storm that mediates widespread lung inflammation it was observed that patients with severe covid-19 requiring intensive care in hospitals exhibited higher blood plasma levels of il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor g-csf ip-10 mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 mip1 and tumour necrosis factor tnf11 il-6 levels in these patients continue to increase over time and are relatively more elevated in non-survivors than survivors60 notably there exists a highly inflammatory monocyte-derived fcn1 macrophage population in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with severe but not mild covid-19 ref61 also patients with severe disease show a significantly higher percentage of cd14cd16 inflammatory monocytes in peripheral blood than patients with mild disease62 these cells secrete inflammatory cytokines that contribute to the cytokine storm including mcp1 ip-10 and mip1 fig 1the mechanisms by which sars-cov-2 subverts the bodys innate antiviral cytokine responses are yet to be studied but research on sars-cov shows that multiple viral structural and non-structural proteins antagonize interferon responses antagonism occurs at various stages of the interferon signalling pathway including by preventing prr recognition of viral rna6365 by preventing prr signalling through tbk1inhibitor of nuclear factor-b kinase subunit- ikk traf3 and irf3 refs6366 by preventing downstream interferon signalling through stat1 ref67 and by promoting host mrna degradation and inhibiting host protein translation68 it is very likely that at least some of these pathways are conserved in sars-cov-2 antagonism of the interferon response aids viral replication resulting in increased release of pyroptosis products that can further induce aberrant inflammatory responsesunrestrained inflammatory cell infiltration can itself mediate damage in the lung through excessive secretion of proteases and reactive oxygen species in addition to the direct damage resulting from the virus together these result in diffuse alveolar damage including desquamation of alveolar cells hyaline membrane formation and pulmonary oedema5758 this limits the efficiency of gas exchange in the lung causing difficulty in breathing and low blood oxygen levels the lung also becomes more vulnerable to secondary infectionsin addition to local damage cytokine storm also has ripple effects across the body elevated levels of cytokines such as tnf can cause septic shock and multi-organ failure these may result in myocardial damage and circulatory failure observed in some patients69 older people those aged over 60 years and people with co-morbidities are more likely to develop such a dysfunctional immune response that causes pathology and also fails to successfully eradicate the pathogen the exact reasons for this are unclear although one reason may be an ageing lung microenvironment causing altered dendritic cell maturation and migration to the lymphoid organs70 and thereby defective t cell activation in contrast children tend not to develop severe disease despite being capable of experiencing high viral titres71 across all age groups younger than 18 years more than 50 of children experienced mild symptoms or were asymptomatic with less than 6 of children developing severe symptoms72 thus while the aforementioned studies represent important inroads a full picture of the critical host immune factors that underlie the development of severer inflammatory responses in some patients remains poorly definedit remains controversial whether virus persistence is necessary to drive the ongoing damage the peak of viral titres in respiratory tract samples might occur even before symptom onset of pneumonia in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infections1719 however a large retrospective cohort study showed that viral rna was detectable in non-survivors up until the point of death suggesting a correlation between virus persistence and poor disease outcome60 as viral rna may linger even after active infection and is not representative of the infectivity of the virus whether the poor disease outcome is directly due to large amounts of infectious particles is speculative at this moment furthermore earlier studies of sars-cov found that the virus may infect other targets besides lung cells notably virus was found in t lymphocytes73 macrophages7476 and monocyte-derived dendritic cells77 direct virus killing of lymphocytes could contribute to the observed lymphopenia in patients73 viral infection in immune cells such as monocytes and macrophages can result in aberrant cytokine production even if viral infection is not productive7477 the degree to which sars-cov-2 targets these cells remains poorly defined understanding the precise drivers of immune dysfunction is crucial to guide the application of appropriate immunomodulatory treatmentsseveral immunosuppressive therapies aimed at limiting immunomediated damage in covid-19 are at various phases of development and are listed in table 1 currently trials of corticosteroids for treatment of covid-19 are under way78 although this class of treatment was not recommended during the 2003 sars epidemic7980 a clinical trial of the il-6 antagonist tocilizumab is also under way to test its efficacy81 and sarilumab is also being explored82 other clinical trials are also testing the effects of targeting granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf including the use of gimsilumab83 lenzilumab84 and namilumab85 another novel adjunctive therapy is cytosorb86 which acts by absorbing a broad spectrum of cytokines damps and pamps in order to reduce their circulating levels and ameliorate immunopathology thalidomide an agent with immunomodulatory properties has also been successfully administered to a single patient with covid-19 ref87 as a result two clinical trials have now been initiated to test its potential to reduce lung injury8889 tnf antagonism was suggested but not tested in the context of sars-cov infection and it has not yet been tested in patients with covid-19 ref90 a small open-label non-randomized study suggested that a combination of hydroxychloroquine a known antimalarial agent and azithromycin a common antibiotic may be beneficial for treating patients with severe covid-19 ref91 although hydroxychloroquines effect on direct inhibition of the virus92 and its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities are known93 whether these mechanisms play a role against covid-19 remains to be determined94both t and b cell responses against sars-cov-2 are detected in the blood around 1 week after the onset of covid-19 symptoms cd8 t cells are important for directly attacking and killing virus-infected cells whereas cd4 t cells are crucial to prime both cd8 t cells and b cells cd4 t cells are also responsible for cytokine production to drive immune cell recruitment the first autopsy of a patient with covid-19 revealed an accumulation of mononuclear cells likely monocytes and t cells in the lungs coupled with low levels of hyperactive t cells in the peripheral blood57 together with reports of lymphopenia and reduced peripheral t cell levels in patients 69597 these findings suggest that t cells are attracted away from the blood and into the infected site to control the viral infection in patients with covid-19 increased t cell exhaustion and reduced functional diversity predicted severe disease98 despite the impaired response patients who recovered from sars-cov infection developed coronavirus-specific memory t cells which were found up to 2 years after recovery99100sars-cov-specific cd4 t cells express ifn tnf and il-2 which suggests that patients with sars-cov infection exhibit a th1 cell response and mainly use cellular immunity to control the infection101102 although this pro-inflammatory profile may be an aggravating factor for immunopathogenesis cd4 t cells have been hypothesized to control sars as depletion of these cells in mice resulted in slower clearance of the virus from the host and severer lung inflammation103 with the use of a mouse-adapted strain of sars-cov immunization with dendritic cells bearing sars-cov peptides resulted in higher numbers of virus-specific cd4 and cd8 t cells that accumulated in the lungs and increased survival104105 also transfer of sars-cov-specific cd4 and cd8 t cells into immunodeficient mice resulted in better protection against a mouse-adapted strain of sars-cov105despite evidence for an important role of t cells in controlling infection several vaccine formulations against sars-cov previously tested in animal models showed signs of immunopathology associated with th2 cell-mediated eosinophil infiltration106107 in particular aged mice that were vaccinated seemed to display increased immunopathology rather than protection108 further study of the nature of protective versus detrimental t cell responses is critically needed to determine the optimal t cell engagement strategies for vaccines109coronavirus-specific t cells are clearly important in eliminating the virus and controlling disease development and should be considered in vaccine strategies however whether t cell responses alone are capable of preventing infection in human settings remains to be investigated this knowledge will be important for vaccine developmentb cell responses in patients with covid-19 occur concomitantly with t follicular helper cell responses from around 1 week after symptom onset110 in patients with sars-cov infection b cell responses typically arise first against the nucleocapsid n protein within 48 days after symptom onset antibody responses to s protein are found111112 neutralizing antibody responses likely to the s protein begin to develop by week 2 and most patients develop neutralizing antibodies by week 3 refs113114 given that viral titres peak earlier for sars-cov-2 than for sars-cov1619 antibody responses may also arise earlier it seems that a subset of patients may not develop long-lasting antibodies to sars-cov-2 ref115 it remains unknown whether these patients are susceptible to reinfection of which there are sporadic reports116117 antibodies are likely to be effective against sars-cov-2 convalescent serum samples have been applied with apparently good clinical results in covid-19 ref118 and were also previously used successfully in the treatment of sars119121while mechanistic correlates of protection have not yet been identified in humans neutralization of the virus is presumed to be an important mechanism of action for antibodies although the specific titre and specificity of the antibody repertoire required for protection remain undefined in sars-cov the primary target of neutralizing antibodies is the rbd122 comprising a 193 amino acid region amino acids 318510 in the s protein which can independently bind to the host target ace2 receptor3537 although a few previously identified monoclonal antibodies to sars-cov also bind to or neutralize sars-cov-2 ref123 the majority do not124 this could be due to significant differences in the rbds of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov fig 4 in particular of the 33 amino acids in the region amino acids 460492 in the sars-cov s protein that contains the critical residues that contact ace2 ref125 less than half 1533 are conserved in sars-cov-2 nevertheless mouse antiserum raised against sars-cov protein can cross-neutralize sars-cov-2 pseudovirus indicating overlapping neutralizing epitopes between the two viruses28126in china hospitals have initiated the use of convalescent plasma as a source of therapeutic polyclonal antibodies for treatment of covid-19 and early data suggest a positive impact on respiratory viral load and mortality127128 efforts are under way to develop therapeutic monoclonal antibodies to sars-cov-2 using approaches including phage library display traditional mouse immunization and hybridoma isolation and cloning of b cell sequences from convalescent human patients129132 sars-cov does not appear to have strong mechanisms to escape or prevent antibody neutralization such as glycan shielding of the receptor-binding site against antibody binding133 this is further corroborated by the fact that patients with sars-cov infection were generally capable of developing neutralizing antibodies a recombinant s protein fragment that included the rbd of sars-cov showed the highest immunogenicity relative to other recombinant s protein fragments tested suggesting that the immune system is capable of targeting neutralizing epitopes effectively134 thus if sars-cov-2 behaves like sars-cov in this respect it is likely that these efforts will be successful in developing neutralizing monoclonal antibodiesit is possible that alterations in the s protein will render sars-cov-2 resistant to some monoclonal antibodies especially as it spreads and mutates as of now the entire rbd remains conserved and there are only four known rare non-synonymous alterations in the s protein v483a l455i f456v and g476s135 the v483a alteration maps to a similar natural alteration found in mers-cov i529t where it reduced viral protein binding to the host receptor target and also increased resistance to antibody neutralization from serum samples from patients with mers136 f456v and g476s alterations also map to similar alteration positions in sars-cov l443r and d463g which were found in a panel of neutralization escape mutants137however the selection of therapeutic antibody candidates should include careful consideration of potential unwanted side effects for example pre-existing antibodies to other coronaviruses may exacerbate sars-cov infections through antibody-dependent enhancement138140 also previous studies in animal models showed that in sars-cov infection neutralizing antibodies to s protein can potentially augment severe lung injury by exacerbating inflammatory responses141 in addition a correlation has been observed where development of ards coincides with antiviral igg seroconversion in 80 of patients19 patients who developed neutralizing antibodies to s protein earlier in infection had a higher rate of disease it took an average of only 147 days for patients who died of infection to reach their peak levels of neutralizing antibody activity as opposed to 20 days for patients who went on to recover142 similarly for mers patients with severer disease appear to have higher antibody titres than those with mild disease143144 although one study argues that it is a delay in the development of antibody responses that is associated with disease145 the binding of antibodyvirus immune complexes to activating fc receptors on alveolar macrophages could induce the expression of pro-inflammatory factors including il-8 and mcp1 which add to the immunostimulatory milieu146 such complexes may also activate the complement system and lead to further unwanted inflammation141 as a result it is important to consider engineering therapeutic antibodies with little or no pro-inflammatory activity but that retain their virus-neutralizing capacity147 for instance alterations could be made to the fc region andor its glycosylation to change its binding affinity for activating fc receptors146148this review has presented the various mechanisms of sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 immunopathogenesis controlling the inflammatory response may be as important as targeting the virus therapies inhibiting viral infection and regulation of dysfunctional immune responses may synergize to block pathologies at multiple steps at the same time the association between immune dysfunction and outcome of disease severity in patients with covid-19 should serve as a note of caution in vaccine development and evaluation further studies of the host immune response to sars-cov-2 are necessary including a detailed investigation of the determinants of healthy versus dysfunctional outcomes these will also help identify biomarkers to define immune correlates of protection and disease severity for effective triage of patientsmiddle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov is a recently described coronavirus with high mortality as of november 18 2013 there have been 157 confirmed cases and 66 deaths httpwwwwhointcsrdon20131118enindexhtml mers disease is characterized primarily by respiratory symptoms but several patients also developed renal failure zaki et al 2012 drosten et al 2013 in most cases reported thus far immunosuppression or other types of medical disorders have been associated with more severe disease assiri et al 2013 the sequence of the rna genome of mers-cov is most similar to bat coronaviruses hku4 and hku5 van boheemen et al 2012 however the origin of mers-cov is not known a recent report showed that dromedary camels have high levels of neutralizing serum antibodies against mers-cov suggesting a possible zoonotic source reusken et al 2013 in addition analysis of fecal samples from bats identified an egyptian tomb bat as a potential source of infection memish et al 2013 but more work is needed to identify the animal reservoirs for mers-cov limited human-to-human transmission of mers-cov has been reported which considering the high mortality raises a concern that the virus has a potential to become a threat to public health assiri et al 2013 guery et al 2013 similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov the sars-cov pandemic from 20022003 was controlled by public health measures of identification and isolation of infected symptomatic individuals and their contacts which broke the chain of human-to-human transmission a sars-cov-like virus is endemic in chinese horseshoe bats but changes in the sequence of the spike glycoprotein are required for this virus to efficiently infect humans lau et al 2005 rockx et al 2007 for mers-cov it is unclear if the virus can jump directly from bats to humans if there are any mutations in the viral genome that facilitate infection or disease in humans and if there are both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases which would make any potential epidemic more difficult to control by public health measures alone our goal was to apply the knowledge gained from the study of sars-cov to identify and characterize the mers-cov papain-like protease domain as an innate immune antagonist and as a potential target for therapeuticsmers-cov similar to other coronaviruses is a positive-strand rna virus that upon entry into cells is translated to produce a viral replicase polyprotein the replicase polyprotein is processed by viral proteases to generate a membrane-associated viral replication complex snijder et al 2006 perlman and netland 2009 sequence analysis of mers-cov indicates that the canonical papain-like protease plpro and 3c-like proteinase 3clpro are likely responsible for processing the polyprotein to generate 16 nonstructural proteins that assemble to form the replication complex the majority of coronavirus papain-like proteases plps including sars-cov plpro have been shown thus far to act as deubiquitinases and interferon antagonists clementz et al 2010 frieman et al 2009 ratia et al 2006 zheng et al 2008 xing et al 2013 barretto et al 2005 sulea et al 2005 chen et al 2007 the ubiquitin pathway is important for regulating a number of innate immune pathways and the ability of a viral protein to cleave ubiquitin from host cell proteins can contribute to virus pathogenesis in addition to ubiquitination modification of cellular proteins with interferon-stimulated gene 15 isg15 is known to have a broad-spectrum antiviral activity isg15 is ubiquitin-like protein that can be conjugated to cellular targets via a mechanism called isgylation regulating innate immune responses coronavirus plps are known to have the ability to remove isg15 conjugates from cellular substrates clementz et al 2010 lindner et al 2005 lindner et al 2007 in this study we demonstrate the deisgylating and deubiquitinating dub activities of the papain-like protease from mers-cov and provide new information on the potential role of coronavirus proteasedubs to inhibit the innate immune responsemers-cov plpro is encoded within nonstructural protein 3 nsp3 of the replicase polyprotein fig 1a to gain insight into the potential of mers-cov plpro to recognize and cleave ubiquitin and isg15 from proteins we used the high-resolution x-ray structure of sars-cov plpro in apo-enzyme form pdb2fe8 chain c to generate a homology model of mers-cov plpro we threaded the mers-cov primary amino acid sequence into the sars-cov structure and then energy minimized the structure the homology model displays several conserved structural features between mers-cov and sars-cov plpro including the ubiquitin-like domain ubl a catalytic triad consisting of c1594h1761d1776 and the ubiquitin-binding domain at the zinc finger to model ubiquitin ub into the zinc finger and palm domains of mers-cov plpro we used the x-ray structure and associated electron density of sars-cov plpro in complex with ub aldehyde ubal pdb4mm3 for refinement and energy minimization of the model in complex with ub the resulting mers-cov-ubal model displays a nearly ideal fit of the ub moiety within the palm and the zinc finger regions of the enzyme with the c-terminal extension of ubiquitin oriented properly towards the mers-cov substrate subsites and catalytic triad 
fig 1b from this model we hypothesize that the plpro domain from mers-cov like sars-cov is a multifunctional enzyme with protease deubiquitinating and likely deisgylating activitywe recently described expression and protease activity of mers-cov plpro in cell culture kilianski et al 2013 to determine the deisgylating activity of mers-cov plpro we transfected hek293t cells with c-myc-isg15 plasmid isg15 conjugation machinery and increasing amounts of plasmids expressing mers-cov plpro wild-type and catalytic mutant c1594a plproca cysteine 1594 is predicted to be the active site cysteine nucleophile that attacks the substrate peptide bond and mutation to alanine should significantly reduce or abolish enzymatic activity fig 1 in addition we transfected cells with plasmids expressing sars-cov plpro wild-type or catalytic mutant c1651a we harvested cell lysates at 20 h post-transfection to evaluate the presence of isgylated proteins we found that both mers-cov and sars-cov plpro can deconjugate isg15 from multiple cellular substrates in a dose-dependent manner in contrast plpro catalytic mutants did not deconjugate isg15 indicating that catalytic activity of plpro is required for its deisgylating activity 
fig 2a thus mers-cov plpro like sars-cov plpro lindner et al 2007 has deisgylating activityto assess the dub activity of mers-cov plpro we transfected hek293t cells with plasmid expressing flag-ub and increasing amounts of wild-type plpro or plproca we determined that plpro can deubiquitinate multiple cellular substrates and that plpro catalytic activity is required for dub activity fig 2b this dub activity is also observed with expression of sars-cov plpro consistent with previous reports frieman et al 2009 ratia et al 2006 barretto et al 2005 lindner et al 2005 lindner et al 2007 in these experiments we noticed the difference in the expression levels of sars-cov and mers-cov plpros in transfected cells which may be due to differences in codon optimization in the mers-cov plpro construct further in vitro studies using purified enzymes are needed to determine the relative kinetics of sars-cov and mers-cov plpro dub and deisgylating activitiestaken together our data indicate that mers-cov plpro is a potent deisgylating enzyme that also exhibits dub activity and that both activities require cysteine 1594 for catalysis likely in the context of the predicted catalytic triad fig 1bcoronavirus plps have been shown to block interferon  ifn induction in transfected cells clementz et al 2010 frieman et al 2009 devaraj et al 2007 in addition the deubiquitinase function of an arterivirus papain-like protease has been shown to have a role in interferon antagonism during virus infection van kasteren et al 2013 therefore we assessed the ability of mers-cov plpro to antagonize interferon production first we addressed if mers-cov plpro can inhibit mda5 induced ifn reporter since mda5 has been implicated in recognition of coronaviruses during virus infection zust et al 2011 we transfected hek293t cells with plasmids expressing ifn--luciferase renilla luciferase pef-bos-mda5 rothenfusser et al 2005 and increasing amounts of wild-type plpro or plproca at 16 h post-transfection we assessed luciferase reporter activity we determined that mers-cov plpro can potently inhibit mda5 mediated induction of ifn in a dose-dependent manner and that catalytic activity of mers-cov plpro is required for ifn antagonism fig 3a using overexpression of an active form of rig-i we determined that mers-cov plpro can also inhibit n-rig-i induced ifn reporter similarly to the experiment with mda5 stimulation the catalytic activity of mers-cov plpro is necessary for ifn antagonism upon n-rig-i stimulation 
fig 3bupon recognition of viral rna by pattern recognition receptors prrs such as mda5 or rig-i the signal is transmitted downstream via mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein mavs thus we tested if plpro is able to inhibit mavs induced ifn reporter to stimulate the ifn reporter we overexpressed pef-bos-mavs rothenfusser et al 2005 in hek293t cells co-expressed reporters and either the wild-type plpro or plproca we found that plpro but not plproca inhibits mavs induced ifn reporter fig 3cfinally we tested the ability of mers-cov plpro to inhibit nf-b reporter activity as observed with sars-cov plpro we transfected cells with plasmids expressing nf-b luciferase renilla luciferase and mers-cov wild-type plpro or plproca treated cells with tnf to activate the nf-b pathway and harvested cell lysates at 4 h post-treatment to assess luciferase activity we determined that wild-type plpro can reduce induction of nf-b reporter in a dose-dependent manner and that the catalytic cysteine residue is required for this activity fig 3d taken together these results indicate that mers-cov plpro is an interferon antagonist and that catalytic activity is required for the antagonism in addition plpro can reduce tnf-mediated induction of nf-b reporter activity and catalytic activity is also requiredto further investigate the role of coronavirus plpros in inhibiting innate immune responses we tested the effect of mers-cov plpro on the expression of endogenous cytokines first using the human innate and adaptive immune responses pcr array sabiosciences we determined that in hek293t cells ccl5 rantes ifn and cxcl10 ip-10 mrna levels are upregulated more than 20-fold upon mda5 stimulation data not shown and therefore selected these genes for further analysis to determine the effect mers-cov plpro and sars-cov plpro on cytokine expression we performed qrt-pcr to measure mrna encoding ccl5 ifn and cxcl10 levels in the presence of cov plpros hek293t cells were transfected with pef-bos-mda5 and wild-type or catalytic mutants of mers-cov or sars-cov plpros at 18 h post-transfection the total rna was extracted and qrt-pcr was performed we found that both mers-cov and sars-cov plpro can potently inhibit over 3-fold reduction expression of ccl5 upon mda5 stimulation and that catalytic activity is required for this inhibition fig 4a in agreement with the results from luciferase reporter assays we observed that expression of ifn in mda5 stimulated cells is inhibited in the presence of wild-type mers-cov plpro and sars-cov plpro 
fig 4b cxcl10 mrna levels were also significantly reduced p00005 when wild-type but not catalytic mutant versions of mers-cov plpro and sars-cov plpro were expressed fig 4c to our knowledge this is the first report showing that both mers-cov plpro and sars-cov plpro can reduce induction of endogenous proinflammatory cytokines in cells and that the mechanism requires catalytic activityviruses must do more with less because of the compact nature of their genomes one example of this is the multifunctional plp domain encoded in all members of the order nidovirales nidoviruses including those in the coronavirus and arterivirus families encode one or more plp domain these plps are critical for proteolytic processing of the viral replicase polyprotein in addition to protease activity many of these plps have also been shown to act as viral deubiquitinating enzymes dubs able to deconjugate ubiquitin and isg15 from cellular substrates coronavirus dub activity was first proposed by molecular modeling of the sars-cov plpro domain which predicted that the protease may be multifunctional sulea et al 2005 indeed analysis of the dub activity of purified cov plps and the x-ray crystal structure of sars-cov plpro fully support the initial prediction of viral dub activity ratia et al 2006 barretto et al 2005 lindner et al 2005 ratia et al 2008 analysis of plps from coronaviruses and arteriviruses have revealed conserved dub activity although the enzymes in the coronavirus family fall into the ubiquitin specific protease usp family whereas the arterivirus plps are in the ovarian tumor otu domain family of enzymes the identification of a newly emerged coronavirus mers-cov provides an opportunity to evaluate plpro enzymatic activity and develop new hypotheses about how this proteasedub may contribute to viral pathogenesisour modeling of the mers-cov plpro domain onto the structure of sars-cov led to the prediction of viral dubdeisgylating activity although the enzymes are only 30 identical to sars-cov plpro at the amino acid level we show that deisgylating dub and interferon antagonism activities are conserved importantly we show that coronavirus plpro activity can modulate the innate immune responsecoronaviruses have been shown to modulate immune responses upon infection however the mechanisms involved in the regulation are not yet clear totura and baric 2012 cytokine and chemokine responses to sars-cov in non-lymphatic cells and in infected patients results in low levels of several cytokines including ccl5 and ifn wong et al 2004 spiegel and weber 2006 in addition cxcl10 ccl5 and ifn among others are not induced in cloned bronchial epithelial cell line and human alveolar type ii cells infected with sars-cov early post infection yoshikawa et al 2010 qian et al 2013 the innate immune response to mers-cov is also intriguing microarray analysis of mers-cov infection of calu-3 cells results in distinct immune response compared to sars-cov infection expression of multiple genes involved in activation of adaptive immune responses such as mhc class i and ii are downregulated in mers-cov infected cells josset et al 2013 the ability of sars-cov and mers-cov to modulate early immune responses is likely due to multiple proteins encoded within virus genomes that may act as interferon antagonistsprevious reports showed that several coronavirus proteins can block the activation of innate immune responses particularly production and induction of ifn response reviewed in totura and baric 2012 structural proteins such as sars-cov nucleocapsid n and membrane protein m in addition to being critical elements of the viral particles have been shown to block the ifn response several accessory proteins sars-cov orf3b orf6 and mouse hepatitis virus ns2 are known to act as antagonists of innate immunity kopecky-bromberg et al 2007 zhao et al 2012 indeed mers-cov accessory protein 4a has been reported to block induction of ifn niemeyer et al 2013 in addition nonstructural proteins including nsp1 nsp7 nsp15 have been implicated as ifn antagonists frieman et al 2009 kamitani et al 2009 importantly plps encoded within nsp3 have been shown to block ifn induction sars-cov plpro and hcov-nl63 plp2 are interferon antagonists and catalytic activity is important for plpro antagonism clementz et al 2010 frieman et al 2009 devaraj et al 2007sars-cov plpro is the only plp in the sars-cov genome and it is both a deisgylating and a deubiquitinating enzyme ratia et al 2006 lindner et al 2005 lindner et al 2007 on the other hand hcov-nl63 encodes two papain-like proteases plp1 and plp2 in the genome but only plp2 which has 22 homology to sars-cov plpro is an ifn antagonist with deisgylating and dub activities clementz et al 2010 hcov-nl63 plp1 is devoid of these activities chen et al 2007 in addition mouse hepatitis virus plp2 and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus plp have dub activity and act as ifn antagonists zheng et al 2008 xing et al 2013plps from arteriviruses are also known to block ifn responses the n terminal region of nsp2 encodes the papain-like protease in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv this plp has been characterized as an otu with deubiquitinating and deisgylating ability frias-staheli et al 2007 in addition sun et al 2010 showed that prrsv plp domain can block sendai virus induced ifn and can also inhibit nf-b by preventing ib degradation by its deubiquitination a more recent report showed that prrsv plp has also deisgylating activity which suggests multiple roles of prrsv papain-like protease in antagonism of innate immunity sun et al 2012 nsp2 of another member of the arteriviridae equine arteritis virus eav has deubiquitinating and deisgylating activities as well frias-staheli et al 2007 the deubiquitinating ability of eav plp can block rig-i induced ifn by inhibiting ubiquitination of rig-i which is required for its activation van kasteren et al 2012 co-crystal structure of eav plp with ubiquitin reveled potential interaction sites between those molecules and mutagenesis studies showed that plp dub activity is required for inhibition of innate immunity in infected cells van kasteren et al 2013 specific deubiquitinating and deisgylating activities have been shown for crimeancongo hemorrhagic fever virus cchfv which is a highly pathogenic negative-strand rna virus belonging to the family bunyaviridae the l protease of cchfv contains otu domain with the ability to cleave isg15 modification l protease can remove isg15-meidated immune protection in type i ifn receptor knock-out mice and make them highly susceptible to sindbis virus infection frias-staheli et al 2007overall the results from multiple laboratories studying a variety of coronavirus arterivirus and bunyavirus proteases indicate that deubiquitinating and deisgylating activity of viral proteases have an important role for inhibition of innate immune responses and possibly virus pathogenesis here we characterized the papain-like protease from mers-cov revealing the deisgylating and deubiquitinating activities and that it can act as an interferon antagonist further we showed for the first time that sars-cov plpro and mers-cov plpro can block induction of several endogenous proinflammatory cytokines our data suggest that antagonism of innate immune responses mediated by mers-cov and sars-cov plpros is not limited to ifn but may affect expression of many cellular cytokines our results suggest that plpro might contribute to the modulation of innate immune responses upon sars-cov and mers-cov infection however the exact mechanism and the role of coronavirus plps and their associated dub and deisgylating activities in these processes remains to be determinedthe crystal structure sars-cov plpro pdb2fe8 was used as the template structure to generate a homology model of mers-cov plpro using the automated web-based homology modeling

for the first time in the guandong province of china in late 2002 spread rapidly around the world and resulted in more than 8000 cases 10 of which resulted in death in 33 countries and areas of five continents httpwwwcdcgovmmwrmguide sarsenhtml world healh organization who declared the end of the sars outbreak in july 5th 2003 nevertheless several isolated outbreaks subsequently occurred because of accidental contaminations in laboratories of taiwan singapore and mainland china httpwwwwhointcsrsarsen in late 2003 and early 2004 newly infected persons who had contact with animals infected with sars-cov strains significantly different from those predominating in the 20022003 outbreak were reported in guandong china peiris et al 2004 these events indicate that a sars epidemic may recur at any time in the future although this event most likely would require the generation of new isolates evolving from sars-cov-like virus circulating in animals jiang et al 2005 as a consequence of this possibility and because sars-cov could be used as a biological weapon it has been declared as a category c priority pathogen by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases biodefense httpwww2niaidnihgovbiodefensebandc priorityhtmsars-cov infection results in severe acute respiratory disease pneumonia diarrhea and sometimes death peiris et al 2003 sars-cov is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier most likely originating from bats and has been amplified in other species preferentially civets lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 woo et al 2006 the sars-cov like viruses that exist in animals do not cause typical sars-like disease in the natural host and are not easily transmitted from animals to humans under certain conditions the virus may have evolved into the early human sars-cov with the ability to be transmitted from animals to humans and from humans to humans resulting in localized outbreaks and mild human disease jiang et al 2005 in fact the virus most likely crossed the species barrier before the 2002 outbreak as sera samples collected in 2001 were positive in 18 of the cases zheng et al 2004 furthermore 40 of animal traders whereas only a 5 of vegetable traders in guandong markets were seropositive for sars-cov without showing signs of disease guan et al 2003sars-cov vaccines are urgently needed to prevent potential sars epidemics as sars-cov disease severity has been linked to age with higher mortalities for ages over 45 special attention should be paid to vaccine development to protect elderly people several types of vaccines are being developed including inactivated viruses subunit vaccines virus-like particles vlps dna vaccines heterologous expression systems and vaccines derived from sars-cov genome by reverse genetics this paper will review previously published sars vaccination strategies and announce new accomplishments in sars-cov based vaccination approaches while focusing on the correlates of protection detected serotypes vaccination side effects and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the sars-cov genomeknowledge on the diversity of serotypes is essential information for vaccine design phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov isolates from animals and humans strongly suggest that the virus originated from animals most likely bats lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 poon et al 2005 was amplified in palm civets and transmitted to human population via live animal markets kan et al 2005the neutralization of a set of eight pseudoviruses expressing the spike glycoprotein of eight sars-cov strains selected from the three phases of the sars epidemic early middle and late plus another human isolate collected at the end of 2003 gd03 and two civet cat isolates from 2003 sz16 and sz3 has been studied chinese-consortium 2004 yang et al 2005 human monoclonal antibodies against the s protein of the frankfurt isolate fra-1 derived from epstein-barr virus transformed b lymphocytes were used the virus tested in the neutralization assays included pseudotypes made with the s protein from members of the four main genetic clusters defined with the bayesian analysis of the sars-cov glycoproteins fig 1a deming et al 2006igroup 1 originating from animals isolated in 2003 a prototype of this group is the isolate sz16 which primarily uses civet but not human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a receptoriigroup 2 low pathogenic viruses originating from civets raccoon dogs or sporadic human cases such as strain gd03 reported from a sporadic sars case in december 22 2003 this virus represented an independent introduction of a less pathogenic virus having an s glycoprotein sequence that is the most divergent of all human strains chinese-consortium 2004 in general group 2 isolates appear to have a receptor binding domain rbd that is capable of recognizing the human ace2 receptor and have been successfully cultured gd03 s glycoprotein contains 18 amino acid substitutions relative to group 3 urbani s protein many of which map within neutralizing epitopes between amino acids 130150 and 318510 corresponding to the rbd

basically all virus pseudotyped with s proteins from different strains were neutralized to the same extent except the human gd03 and the two civet cat isolates sz16 and sz3 indicating that there were at least two human sars-cov serotypes most likely originated from two independent transmissions of the virus from civet cat to human baric et al 2006 yang et al 2005 it will be important to determine if recombinant viruses bearing zoonotic s glycoproteins display similar neutralization kinetics as pseudotyped viruses bearing sars spikesthe sars-cov-like isolated from bats identified in rhinolophus spp has a nucleotide identity with tor-2 strain higher than 92 lau et al 2005 li et al 2005 in addition six novel coronaviruses from six different bat species have been described woo et al 2006 four of these coronaviruses belong to group 1 and two of them to group 2 based on sequence data these authors have proposed the classification of bat cov in three subgroups 2a 2b and 2c subgroup 2b comprises both sars-cov and a bat-sars-cov rp3 isolate the sequences of these sars-cov isolates differ in the s1 domain of the s protein where sequence identity fell to 64 this sequence divergence in the s1 domain corroborated the serum neutralization studies which indicate that although bat sera have a high level of cross-reactive antibodies they failed to neutralize human or civet cat sars-cov when tested in vero e6 cells li et al 2005 in contrast other authors lau et al 2005 have reported that 42 of the bat sera samples tested neutralized human sars-cov isolate hku-39849 using frhk-4 cells the discrepancy could be due to the presence of a different sars-cov-like virus serotype in the bats studied by the two different groups or to the two test systems used in the evaluation consequently vaccine design should take into account this antigenic diversity interestingly recent characterization of the antigenic structure of sars-cov s protein with a large panel of mabs has shown that at least one epitope providing susceptibility to sars-cov that maps in the rbd for ace-2 is highly conserved in most virus strains and therefore may confer protection to most sars-cov strains he et al 2006sars-cov has at least seven structural proteins s 3a e m 7a 7b and n fig 2
 huang et al 2006 schaecher and pekosz 2006 weiss and navas-martin 2005 sars-cov s 3a e and m proteins are viral membrane proteins with domains exposed to the external face of the virus ito et al 2005 shen et al 2005 that in principle could be involved in protection by induction of neutralizing antibodies it has been shown that proteins s and 3a induce in vitro sars-cov neutralizing antibodies with s protein being the main component of protective immunity qiu et al 2005 saif 2004 although strong immune responses are elicited against both s and n proteins buchholz et al 2004 subbarao et al 2004 wang et al 2005 zhu et al 2004 passive transfer studies illustrate that only s-specific antibodies confer protection from sars-cov replication in the mouse model bisht et al 2004 subbarao et al 2004the relevance of s protein in protection against sars-cov has been reinforced by the identification of neutralizing antibodies from convalescent patients the majority of the coronavirus neutralizing epitopes are located within the spike protein of the virus buchholz et al 2004 hogan et al 2004 two domains are defined in the spike protein the amino-terminus s1 and the carboxy-terminus s2 halves in some coronaviruses but apparently not in the case of sars-cov the s protein is processed in these two halves weiss and navas-martin 2005 wong et al 2004 recent evidence has determined that sars-cov neutralization is sensitive to deglycosylation of the spike protein suggesting that conformational epitopes are important in antibody recognition song et al 2004 the rbd located in the s1 subunit of s protein contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes this suggests that recombinant proteins containing rbd and vectors encoding the rbd sequence can be used to develop safe and effective sars vaccines jiang et al 2005 the continuous viral epitopes targeted by antibodies in plasma samples from convalescent sars patients have been identified by biopanning with a m13 phage display dodecapeptide library zhong et al 2005 these epitopes converged to very short peptide fragments one on each of the spike nucleocapsid 3a 9b and nsp3 proteins immunoassays found that most of the patients 82 that recovered from sars developed antibodies to the epitope-rich region on the spike s2 domain indicating that this domain also is an immunodominant site on the s protein these s2-targeting antibodies were shown to effectively neutralize sars-cov moreover it is possible that s2-specific antibodies provided protective immunity to help the patients recover from viral infection zhong et al 2005 in fact among the rabbit antibodies elicited by different fragments covering the entire s protein expressed in e coli some of them were specific for aa 10291192 which include the heptad-repeat sequence of the s2 domain that interacts to form s protein trimers and had neutralizing activities indicating that this region of the s protein also carries neutralizing epitopessars-cov 3a protein consist of 274 amino acids contains three putative transmembrane domains and is expressed on the virus and cell surface ito et al 2005 tan et al 2004b the topology of 3a protein on the cell surface was experimentally determined the first 34 aa located before the first transmembrane domain are facing the extracellular matrix akerstrom et al 2006 and its c-terminal after the third transmembrane domain aa 134274 is facing the cytoplasm tan et al 2004b interestingly in two separate cohorts of sars patients one from taiwan liu et al 2004 and the other from hong kong zhong et al 2005 b cells recognizing the n-terminal region of 3a protein were isolated from patients moreover significant proportion 40 of the convalescent sars patients examined in a dot blot assay using a synthetic peptide with a sequence corresponding to amino acids 1227 of the n terminus of the protein were positive zhong et al 2005 in addition it was recently reported that the n-terminal domain of 3a protein elicits strong and potentially protective humoral responses in infected patients zhong et al 2006 accordingly rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to aa 1528 of 3a protein inhibit sars-cov propagation in vero e6 cells in contrast to antibodies specific for the c-terminal domain of the protein akerstrom et al 2006sars-cov e m and 7a proteins have shown low immunogenicity tan et al 2004a sera from three convalescent phase sars patients do not recognize these proteins expressed in mammalian cells accordingly sars-cov e protein peptides were not recognized by convalescent patient antisera using a protein microarray qiu et al 2005 in a study using rabbit antibodies to 13 recombinant fragments associated with sars-cov s e m n 3a 3b 6 7a and 9b proteins strong neutralizing antibodies were only elicited by the s1 fragment aa 241591 of s protein qiu et al 2005 the incorrect folding of the proteins expressed in e coli could be responsible for the lack of detection of antibodies to other viral proteins such as the 3a protein that is known to induce neutralizing antibodies see abovethe m protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus tgev is required for virus assembly and budding and m protein specific antibodies significantly but weakly neutralize tgev and mediate complement-dependent lysis of tgev infected cells delmas et al 1986 risco et al 1995 woods et al 1987 consistent with the tgev data described above it has been shown that sars-cov m protein also induced virus neutralizing antibodies in the absence of complement buchholz et al 2004 in addition a mixture of s and m proteins showed a synergistic effect in the in vitro synthesis of tgev neutralizing antibodies by immune leukocytes anton et al 1995 in the case of sars-cov immunization of hamsters with a parainfluenza virus vector has shown a differential role of s m e or n proteins in protection buchholz et al 2004 parainfluenza virus expressing s protein alone provided complete protection against sars-cov challenge in the lower respiratory tract and partial protection in the upper respiratory tract this protection was slightly augmented by co-expression with m and e proteins buchholz et al 2004 nevertheless expression of m e or n proteins in the absence of s protein did not confer detectable protection these results identify s as a main sars-cov neutralization and protective antigen among the structural proteins and confers a limited role to sars-cov m protein in protectionsars-cov n protein specific antibodies do not neutralize the virus in vitro as it could be expected for an internal virus protein pang et al 2004 however sars-cov n protein induces t-cell responses gao et al 2003 accordingly dna immunization using sars-cov n gene induces potent th1 polarized immune responses in mice as well as specific antibodies in these animals in fact the highest levels of humoral response and t cell proliferation activity were induced by the n gene construct jin et al 2005 analysis of the immune response to another coronavirus tgev using an in vitro antibody synthesis system has shown that the optimum combination of viral proteins to stimulate the production of tgev neutralizing antibodies in vitro was a mixture of s and n proteins or a combination of s protein oligomers rosettes and the n or n protein-derived peptides anton et al 1996 anton et al 1995 these data in principle suggest that n protein could be used in a vaccine to promote the synthesis of s-specific neutralizing antibodies9b protein 98 aa elicits antibodies in sars-cov patients indicating that it is expressed in natural disease and that it is immunogenic qiu et al 2005 zhong et al 2005 in fact 100 of convalescent phase patients sera were positive for 9b protein based on this data it has been speculated that 9b protein could be structural qiu et al 2005 nevertheless the presence of 9b protein in sars-cov virions needs to be further provedin summary with the available data sars-cov proteins s and 3a elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses whereas protein m only induces a reduced neutralizing humoral immune response these antigens probably are relevant in the protection against sars-cov in addition other structural proteins such as e m 7a 7b and n and possibly protein 9b could also play a role in protectionto study the role of the humoral immune response to sars-cov spike specific monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the virus have been developed berry et al 2004 subbarao et al 2004 traggiai et al 2004 zhang et al 2004 passive transfer of these monoclonal antibodies or immune serum into nave mice protected them from infection with sars-cov subbarao et al 2004 using epstein-barr virus transformed human b cells the memory repertoire of a patient who recovered from sars-cov infection has been rescued traggiai et al 2004 some of the monoclonal antibodies exhibited neutralization activity in vitro and some of them also conferred protection in a mouse model of sars-cov infection in addition human igg monoclonal antibodies neutralizing sars-cov developed using phage display libraries protected ferret from lung disease and virus shedding in pharyngeal secretions ter meulen et al 2004 in both mouse and ferret models administration of human monoclonal antibodies with in vitro neutralization activity reduced sars-cov titers in the lungs 3 to 6-log10-unit protecting from lung pathology in ferrets ter meulen et al 2004 overall these data indicate that humoral immune responses alone can protect against sarsimmune responses to sars-cov elicited by a dna vaccine encoding a codon optimized sars spike protein yang et al 2004 or the s1 fragment induced neutralizing antibodies zeng et al 2004 as well as t-cell responses nevertheless protection from sars-cov challenge was mediated by a humoral immune response but not by a t-cell-dependent mechanism yang et al 2004surprisingly immunodeficient mice can clear a sars-cov infection showing the role of innate immune responses in the defenses against sars-cov c57bl6 mice that lack nk-t cells cd1 or nk cells or those that lack t and b cells ragl cleared the virus by day 9 after infection glass et al 2004 and displayed high induction of proinflammatory cytokines these data suggest that the nk cells and the adaptative immune response were not essential for virus clearance in mice possibly interferon pathways were relevant in viral clearance the importance of interferon response was reinforced by infecting stat1-deficient mice with sars-cov hogan et al 2004 stat1 is important to the regulation of interferons and stat1-deficient mice produced one hundred-fold increase in viral titer over control mice additionally the mutant mice developed interstitial pneumonia not seen in control mice hogan et al 2004 but not alveolar damage as seen in lungs of human patients it is unclear at this time if the observed pathological differences between human and stat 1-deficient mouse lungs were due to time of sampling or to differences in host responses hogan et al 2004neutralizing antibodies were detected 23 weeks after the onset of disease in immunocompetent sars patients and 90 of patients recovered without hospitalization ksiazek et al 2003 these data indicate that most patients successfully respond to sars-cov infection although many types of vaccines for sars-cov have been attempted such as expression of recombinant proteins or the use of virus vectors these vaccines require considerable research set-up time bradbury 2003 therefore the classical approach using inactivated cell-culture based sars-cov is likely to be the easiest way for sars vaccine development based on the experience with available vaccines including inactivated or live polio and rabies vaccines montagnon 1989 zhou et al 2005 this is the case of companies that favored the development of an inactivated candidate whole virus vaccine based on the well-established technologies for the development of such vaccines spruth et al 2006the fast spreading of sars initially prompted a chinese company sinovac biotech of beijin to develop a vaccine in collaboration with the chinese academy of medical sciences that started tests of the vaccine an inactivated form of sars-cov as early as 2004 using 30 volunteers marshall and enserink 2004 no side effects were reported for the first patients that were injected with the inactivated virussars-cov inactivation to produce the killed vaccines has been performed using different methods for instance sars-cov purified by ultracentrifugation has been inactivated with -propiolactone and administered with or without alhydrogel as adjuvant see et al 2006 the virus subcutaneously administered to mice was more efficient than recombinant adenoviruses expressing either the s or n proteins provided by the intranasal or intramuscular routes an alternative method was the inactivation of sars-cov by -propiolactone before initiating the purification step immunization with this virus was compared with vaccination using dna or adenovirus vectors the humoral immune response was most effective using inactivated virus with adjuvants such as mf59 chiron vaccines or alum pierce rockkford il and was associated with stimulation of the cd4 but not the cd8 response supporting the use of inactivated sars-cov as vaccine kong et al 2005sars-cov has also been purified up to 98 homogeneity by ultrafiltration gel filtration and exchange chromatography and inactivated with -propiolactone cynomolgus macaques were immunized with different amounts of the purified virus in the absence or in the presence of adjuvant monkeys were challenged by the nasal route 30 days post-immunization high levels of neutralizing antibodies that prevented the replication of sars-cov and interstitial pneumonia were induced qin et al 2006interestingly no side effects were observed even in the presence of low titer neutralizing antibodies indicating that the purified sars-cov vaccine is safe in monkeysin other approaches sars-cov partially purified in sucrose cushions was completely inactivated with formaldehyde this virus efficiently competed the binding of infectious virus to cells indicating that the inactivated virus kept a functional rbs qu et al 2005 polyethyleneglycol precipitated virus alone or in the presence of cholera toxin b ctb sigma or cpg administered to mice by the intranasal route elicited serum sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies and iga specific antibodies in the trachea and lungs qu et al 2005in another approach formaldehyde inactivated whole virus prepared in vero cells was used in intramuscular immunization of 25 year-old rhesus monkeys zhou et al 2005 after 3 weeks monkeys were challenged with sars-cov doses of 05 or 5 gmonkey protected most of the monkeys against challenge with 108 pfu of sars-cov and higher doses 50 g conferred complete protection in contrast the control animals developed a typical sars-cov infection after challenge the immunization preferentially induced th1 responses but also enhanced other cellular immune responses including the production of ifn- that can increase the activity of natural killer cells and inhibit virus replication no systemic side effects were observed in vaccinated animals post-immunization even at the high dose 5000 gmonkey and after two injectionsone vaccine manufactured to large scale using fermenter cultures of vero cells in serum free medium has been based in a double-inactivated whole virus vaccine spruth et al 2006 virus infection at a moi of 0001 resulted in generation of high viral titers around 108
 tcid50ml culture supernatants were harvested and inactivated by formalin treatment followed by uv inactivation this two step inactivation procedure was utilized in order to ensure a high safety margin with respect to residual infectivity mice immunized twice with l g of sars-cov vaccine using adjuvant 02 aluminium hydroxide developed high antibody titers against sars-cov spike protein as determined by an elisa test the use of the adjuvant aloh3 had only a minor effect on the immunogenicity of the vaccine in addition cell mediated immunity as measured by the production of inf- and il-4 stimulation was elicited the vaccine confers 100 protection that was correlated to antibody titer against the sars-cov s protein and to neutralizing antibody titer induction of neutralizing antibodies with titers 114 and an s-specific elisa titer 25600 resulted in 100 protection against intranasal challenge with 105 tcid50 of infectious virusa polypeptide containing amino acids 14762 of the sars-cov spike protein has been expressed using the baculovirus system bisht et al 2005 the affinity purified protein was administered to mice with either saponin or ribi as adjuvants both regimens induced binding and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies although the best results were obtained with saponin and polypeptide which provided the highest antibody response after challenge protective immunity was shown by the reduction of sars-cov titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract this subunit vaccine induced higher neutralizing antibody and more complete protection against an intranasal challenge than that achieved by inoculation of mice with live sars-cov subbarao et al 2004 vaccinia virus ankara mva expressing the full length s protein bisht et al 2004 or dna expressing the full-length s or s protein lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains yang et al 2004n protein by itself does not provide protection against sars-cov infections still a large number of reports using n protein as an antigen have been published the immune response of mice vaccinated with a purified n protein fused to glutathione s-transferase gst was analyzed and compared with the response of two dna-based vaccination approaches gupta et al 2006 the immunization with n-gst elicited a strong t-cell il-4 and antibody responses but minimal ifn- response this response differed markedly with the immune response shown by mice immunized with both dna encoding unmodified cytoplasmic n protein and dna encoding n as a lamp-1 chimera targeted to the lysosomal mhc ii compartment dna immunizations elicited a strong t-cell ifn- and ctl responses nevertheless the t-cell responses to the three immunogens were elicited by the same n peptides as shown by the elispot analysis of antigen-activated t cells in vivo protection experiments were not performed with these vaccinesthe n protein of sars-cov was expressed in e coli and purified liu et al 2006 balbc mice were vaccinated with n protein emulsified in montanide isa-51 containing the oligodeoxynucleotide cpg or in pbs in the first case anti-n antibodies were found to be mainly igg2a suggesting a prevalence of th1 immune response in contrast anti-n protein antibodies of mice immunized with n protein in pbs were found to be mainly igg1 reactivity of antisera raised against n protein formulated in isa-51cpg in mice and monkeys and that of sera from patients were tested with a panel of overlapping peptides the region around residues 156175 of n protein is immunogenic in the three models in addition peptides corresponding to residues 130 86100 306320 and 351365 contained murine immunodominant t-cell epitopes using and ifn- secretion cell assay peptides containing residues 8195 were capable of stimulating cd4 and cd8 cell proliferation in vitro peptides corresponding to residues 336350 were capable of stimulating inf- production in t-cell cultures derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs of macaques immunized with the n protein emulsified in isa-51cpg no protection experiments were performed with this immunogenthe requirements for sars-cov vlp formation differs using different expression systems and cell types production of viral proteins in insect cells using baculovirus has shown intracellular sars-cov vlps assembly by expressing m and e proteins ho et al 2004 secretion of these vlps to the extracellular media required the co-expression of s protein mortola and roy 2004 in these experiments secretion of vlps was relatively efficient 200 g per 1  109 infected cells these results are at variance with those obtained by expressing sars-cov proteins in human 293 renal epithelial cells under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter using dna plasmids huang et al 2004 in this system any combination of genes that expressed m and n proteins with or without s or e proteins generated intracellular vlps and the pseudoparticles did not form in the absence of the m and n proteins no single viral gene was able to support the formation of viral capsids within these cells the additional expression of the s protein allowed the formation of budding particles with morphology typical of sars and related coronaviruses different types of vlps could be formed depending of the protein composition of these sars-cov vlps protection by the administration of vlps has not been reportedthe development of plant-based vaccines against different coronaviruses tgev infectious bronchitis virus ibv and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv using the oral delivery of recombinant s protein that elicit protective immunity has been reported bae et al 2003 lamphear et al 2004 tuboly et al 2000 zhou et al 2003 one of these studies include a s protein plant-based vaccine candidate against tgev that has advanced into early phase farming trials tuboly et al 2000 more recently to develop a safe effective and an inexpensive vaccine candidate the s1 domain of sars-cov s protein has been expressed in tomato and low-nicotine tobacco plants pogrebnyak et al 2005 high expression levels of recombinant s1 protein 01 total soluble protein were observed in several transgenic lines by western blot analysis using s protein specific antibodies plant-derived antigen induced systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice which showed significantly increased levels of sars-cov specific iga after oral ingestion of tomato fruits expressing s1 protein pogrebnyak et al 2005 sera of mice parenterally primed with tobacco-derived s1 protein revealed the presence of sars-cov-specific iggseveral approaches based on dna vaccination have been described in order to elicit protection against sars two of them used prime-boost strategies and showed that the combination of the dna vaccine and the whole chemically inactivated vaccine can be used to enhance the magnitude of the immune response and also to change the balance of humoral to cellular immune response zakhartchouk et al 2005a a combination of the dna and inactivated virus induces th1 immune responses while the whole killed virus vaccine induces th2 immune responsesmice immunized intramuscularly with a dna vaccine expressing s protein and intraperitoneally boosted with e coli expressing s peptides showed high neutralization titers 11280 this vaccine might have a practical value to immunize in farms growing civet cats due to its low cost woo et al 2005other dna vaccines express n protein alone or linked to calreticulin the first ones preferentially induce igg responses of the igg2a isotype ifn- and il-2 and cd8 ctl responses to n protein but produce strong delayed-type hypersensitivity dth that could have undesired side effects zhao et al 2005 the expression of n protein linked to calreticulin increases major histocompatibility complex mhc class i presentation to cd8 t cells in the absence of reported adverse effects in mice kim et al 2004 these vaccines led to the generation of strong n-specific humoral and t-cell-mediated immune responses in mice but no protection experiments were shown n protein has also been expressed linked to hlamp n-hlamp that target antigen to the mhc class ii leading to a stronger and higher memory cellular immune response associated to high ifn- production than immunization with n protein alone gupta et al 2006studies on dna immunization to protect against sars using three forms of the spike protein full-length s and s proteins with the cytoplasmic or the transmembrane domains deleted have been reported yang et al 2004 these vaccines induced neutralizing antibodies and t-cell responses resulting in protective immunity in mice viral replication was reduced more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these s plasmid dna expression vectors protection was mediated by a humoral but not a t-cell dependent immune mechanism as shown by adoptive t-cell transfer in which donor t-cells were unable to reduce pulmonary viral replication in recipient animals by contrast passive transfer of purified igg from immunized mice but not control igg provided immune protection against sars-cov yang et al 2004 the vector expressing the s protein with the cytoplasmic domain partially deleted induced the most potent neutralizing antibody responseusing the highly attenuated modified mva sars-cov s protein has been expressed by several groups bisht et al 2004 chen et al 2005 the first one has shown that intranasal or intramuscular immunization of balbc mice elicited protective immunity as shown by the reduction of sars-cov titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract after challenge furthermore passive transfer of serum from mice immunized with the recombinant mva expressing s protein to nave mice also reduced the replication of sars-cov in the respiratory tract after challenge demonstrating a role for s protein specific antibodies in protection the second group chen et al 2005 showed the induction of neutralizing antibodies in mice ferrets and monkeys although protection experiments were not performed in an antibody absorption assay the majority of the antibodies raised by the mva recombinant expressing the full-length s protein were absorbed by an s protein fragment including aa 400600 that includes the rbd indicating that the major sars-cov neutralization mechanism likely occurs through blocking the interaction between the virus and the cellular receptor ace2in contrast other authors immunized ferrets using mva expressing the sars-cov s protein inducing a vigorous immune response that did not prevent virus infection and spreading czub et al 2005 weingartl et al 2004 liver inflammation was found in all mva-spike vaccinated ferrets these authors suggested that their results indicate the induction of antibody dependent enhancement ade of disease similar to that caused by feline infectious peritonitis virus fipvsars vaccines based on the use of adenovirus vectors have shown that expression of s protein alone or in combination with n protein led to the protection of mice against the challenge with sars-cov the efficacy of immunization with adenovirus vectors was compared with that of chemically inactivated partially purified virus whole-killed virus vaccine was more effective in conferring protective immunity against live sars-cov see et al 2006 other adenovirus vaccines tested in mice have expressed either the s or the n protein zakhartchouk et al 2005b and shown that the s2 domain and the n protein contain strong t-cell epitopes but reported no challenge experiments in the monkey model adenovirus-based vaccines induce strong sars-cov-specific immune responses indicating that these vectors are promising vaccine candidates but again no information on protection have been provided gao et al 2003 the adenovirus ad5 vector with a deletion in the e1 and e3 regions have also been used to express the s1 domain of the sars-cov s protein 490 aa liu et al 2005 wistar rats immunized three times throughout consecutive weeks produce antiserum capable of protecting from sars-cov infection in cell culture histopathological examination found no evident side effects in the immunized animals nevertheless in vivo protection experiments were not performed therefore additional experiments are required with the adenovirus based sars vaccinessevere disease and high death rates were noted in senescent human populations infected with sars-cov while children under 12 years of age did not develop the severe disease that was seen in adults baric et al 2006 deming et al 2006 ng et al 2004 these data suggest that the quality of the immune response may play a role in the outcome of virus infection the ability of vaccines to induce robust immune responses in senescent populations has been evaluated to determine if protection can be elicited in elderly populations with senescent immune systems to evaluate vaccine efficacy against homologous and heterologous strains the urbani s glycoprotein and nucleocapsid genes were inserted in vee virus replicon particles vrp-s or vrp-n baric et al 2006 deming et al 2006 in addition expression of the influenza a ha glycoprotein vrp-ha was used as a control using reverse genetics synthetically resurrected recombinant viruses bearing the gd03 s glycoprotein that replicated to high titers in vero and human airway epithelial cells have been obtained baric et al 2006 deming et al 2006 importantly human convalescent sera had plaque reduction neutralization titre of 50 prnt50 values of about 11600 against late phase isolates like urbani yet were reduced about 1015 fold against the heterologous icgd03 virus prnt50 1150 fig 3a young and senescent balbc mice with ages exceeding 1 year at the time of challenge were vaccinated with vrp-ha vrp-s vrp-n or a combination of vrp-s and vrp-n and challenged with recombinant sars-cov expressing the urbani s protein or the antigenically different gd03 s protein fig 3b in vaccinated animals vrp-s vaccines provided complete short- and long-term protection against homologous challenge protecting both young and senescent mice from the urbani strain replication after challenge vrp-s and vrp-s  vrp-n vaccinated mice displayed little if any pathologic lesions in the lung whereas vrp-ha vaccinated aged mice demonstrate pathological lesions in the lung similar to that reported in the literature roberts et al 2005a vrp-s vaccines also provided short-term protection in young mice challenged with the heterologous gd03 s strain despite the significantly reduced ability of anti-urbani s antibody to neutralize virus expressing gd03 s in contrast vaccination of senescent mice with vrp-s provided limited protection 38 and the combination of vrp-s  vrp-n vaccines provided little long-term protection against infection by the antigenically different sars-cov gd03 although virus titers were reduced about 10-fold compared with vrp-ha controls the sars-cov gd03 challenge also produced pathological lesions in both the vrp-ha and sars-vaccinated animals that were virtually indistinguishable from those produced by infection with the sars-cov-urbani strain therefore it is likely that declining immunity of senescent animals in combination with the reduced ability of antibody to neutralize heterologous challenge viruses resulted in vaccine failure in aged animals it seems that vaccine approaches that induce less robust neutralization responses like dna and killed vaccines might completely fail in protecting senescent populations against sars-cov gd03 challengesars-cov disease severity was linked to age and other co-morbidities with mortality rates increasing with age and exceeding 50 in individuals over 65 it is also known that elderly respond poorly to new antigens as compared to younger populations but overall this phenomena is poorly studied consequently vaccine efficacy in the elderly is a key property of efficacious sars-cov vaccines immunosenescence is common in animal models and in clinical studies that occur during aging and vaccine efficacy is often attenuated in the elderly frasca et al 2005 song et al 1997 zheng et al 1997 immune complications include a generalized decrease in the function of b and t cell and innate immune function diminished macrophage and granulocyte function diminished cellular traffic cell growth and differentiation and decreased natural killer cell numbers and activity new and different vaccine regimens should be developed and tested with the ultimate goal of eliciting complete protection against antigenically heterologous forms of sars-cov especially in the most vulnerable elderly populations and that there is a need for further testing developing vaccines that induce an anti-n response in more animal models similarly to what has been described in other viral systems frech et al 2005 mcelhaney 2005a vector based in an existing live attenuated parainfluenza virus that is being developed for intranasal pediatric immunization against human parainfluenza virus type 3 hpiv3 was used to express sars-cov s protein bukreyev et al 2004 vector administration to monkeys resulted in the production of systemic immune response by mucosal immunization after challenge with sars-cov all monkeys in the control group shed sars-cov in contrast no viral shedding occurred in the group immunized with the parainfluenza vector expressing the s protein recombinant viruses expressing sars-cov structural s m and n proteins individually or in combination have been evaluated for immunogenicity and protection in hamsters that support the replication of both sars-cov and parainfluenza vector buchholz et al 2004 a single intranasal administration of the vector expressing the s glycoprotein induced a high titer of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies only two fold lower than that induced by sars-cov infection this response provided complete protection against sars-cov challenge in the lower respiratory tract and partial protection in the upper respiratory tract in contrast expression of m n or e proteins did not induce detectable serum sars-cov neutralizing antibodiesa recombinant rabies virus vector has been used to express the s protein of sars-cov faber et al 2005 immunogenicity studies in mice showed the induction of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies after a single dose but no protection studies have been shown similarly an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus vsv vector was used to express the s protein of sars-cov kapadia et al 2005 mice vaccinated with vsv-s developed sars-cov neutralizing antibodies that controlled challenge with sars-cov performed at 1 or 4 months after a single vaccinationin summary immunization to prevent sars using different live vector systems has shown that protection is mainly mediated by humoral immune responses to the s protein a warning signal was that at least with some vectors such as vee virus the expression of n protein may lead to side effectsthe effect of the deletion of group-specific genes in different coronaviruses has been studied reports using mouse hepatitis virus mhv as a model have shown that deletion mutants removing orfs 4 5a 7a and he are attenuating in the natural host de haan et al 2002a similarly studies deleting orf 7 of tgev ortego et al 2003 and orfs 3abc and 7ab of fipv haijema et al 2004 led to virus attenuation however sars-cov deletion mutants lacking orfs 3a 3b 6 7a or 7b did not significantly influence in vitro and in vivo replication efficiency in the mouse model yount et al 2005 all recombinant viruses replicated to wild-type levels in the murine model suggesting that either the group-specific orfs play little role in in vivo replication efficiency or that the mouse model is not of sufficient quality for discerning the role of the group-specific orfs in disease in fact it has been surprising that orfs like 3a 7a and 7b that encode structural virus proteins huang et al 2006 schaecher and pekosz 2006 yount et al 2005 have little influence on in vivo virus replication in the mouse model only deletion of orf 3a has shown a minor decrease about one log unit in virus growth yount et al 2005 furthermore deletion of more than one gene such as deletion of orfs 3a and 3b and orf6 showed a 115 log reduction in vero cells but little effect on growth in the murine model at day 2 postinfection moreover little difference in growth or pathogenesis were noted in the mice model between wt and deletion mutants lacking orf3a and orf7 therefore the effect of sars-cov gene deletions needs to be tested in more relevant animal models interestingly the simultaneous deletion of larger combinations of group-specific genes such as 6 7a 7b 8a 8b and 9b has lead to the production of an infectious sars-cov deletion-mutant that propagates in cell culture with a titer similar to that of the parental wild type virus the potential of this deletion-mutant as a promising vaccine candidate is being studied ml dediego and l enjuanes unpublished resultsa recombinant sars-cov rsars-cov that lacks the e gene generated from a bacterial artificial chromososme bac was attenuated in vitro and in an animal model dediego et al 2007 the e gene was previously shown to be a non-essential gene for the group 2 mhv coronavirus kuo and masters 2003 although elimination of this gene from mhv genome reduced virus growth in cell culture more than one thousand-fold in contrast for group 1 tgev coronavirus expression of the e gene product was essential for virus release and spread propagation of e gene deleted tgev tgev-e was restored by providing e protein in trans curtis et al 2002 ortego et al 2002the role of e protein in sars-cov propagation was studied by constructing sars-cov with a deleted e gene dediego et al 2007 interestingly viable viruses were recovered in vero e6 cells with a relatively high titer around 106
 pfuml and also from huh-7 and caco-2 cells with reduced titers fig 4
 indicating that sars-cov e protein is not essential for virus replication in cell culture electron microscopy observation of vero e6 cells infected with the sars-cov wt or the e deletion mutant showed much higher assembly efficiency for the wt virus fig 5
 in this respect sars-cov-e behaves as mhv the other group 2 coronavirus studied although sars-cov-e grows to a considerably higher titer the differential behavior of e mutant viruses from different coronavirus groups may indicate basic differences in virion assembly or life cycles among the different groupsthe hamster model has been used to study sars-cov-e virus pathogenicity because it demonstrates elements present in human cases of sars-cov infections including interstitial pneumonitis and consolidation dediego et al 2007 an ideal animal model that completely reproduces human clinical disease and pathological findings has not been identified nevertheless the hamster model reproducibly supports sars-cov replication in the respiratory tract to a higher titer and for a longer duration than in mice or non-human primates virus replication in this model is accompanied by histological evidence of pneumonitis and the animals develop viremia and extrapulmonary spread of virus roberts et al 2005b although overt clinical disease is absent the hamster model is a useful model for the evaluation of sars-cov infection titers of recombinant sars-cov rsars-cov achieved in the respiratory tract of hamsters fig 6
 were similar to those previously reported roberts et al 2005b and were 1001000-fold higher than titers of the rsars-cov-e virus suggesting that this mutant virus is attenuated histopathology examination of lungs from infected hamsters was performed at two and five days post-infection because it has been shown that pulmonary disease was most notable at these time points detection of viral antigen was reduced in lungs from rsars-cov-e infected hamsters and pulmonary inflammation was less prominent in these animals than in rsars-cov-infected animals indicating that rsars-cov-e is attenuated in vivo dediego et al 2007 in fact reduction of sars-cov titers in patients has been associated with a considerable reduction in pathogenicity and survival rates chu et al 2004 hung et al 2004 in contrast challenge of hamsters with recombinant viruses lacking single group specific orfs3a and orf7 did not result in significant reductions in virus titier or pathology baric et al unpublished therefore sars-cov-e attenuated virus is a promising vaccine candidate that is being evaluated in different animal models mice ferrets and macaqueslive attenuated virus vaccines face a series of potential concerns including reversion to wt and recombination repair with circulating heterogeneous human coronaviruses or zoonotic sars strains consequently live virus vaccine formulations should include rational approaches for minimizing the potential for reversion to wt phenotype and simultaneously resist recombination repair it is clear that modifications of sars-cov genome could lead to viruses with an attenuated phenotype that could be considered safe and effective vaccine candidates the replicase as a target for attenuating coronaviruses is undiscovered territory likely ripe with alleles that might influence replication efficiency and virulence the sars-cov replicase represents a major target of future research endeavorscoronaviruses have a characteristic strictly conserved genome organization with structural genes occurring in the order 5-polymerase pol-s-e-m-n-3 mhv virus mutants with the genes encoding the structural proteins located in different order were constructed de haan et al 2002b these recombinant viruses were tested for the ability to replicate in the natural host the mouse the results indicate that the canonical coronavirus genome organization is not essential for in vivo replication some of the mutants showed an attenuated phenotype similarly to what has been observed for the vsv ball et al 1999 therefore deliberate rearrangement of the viral genes may be useful in the generation of attenuated coronaviruses which due to their reduced risk of generating viable viruses by recombination with circulating field viruses would make safer vaccinesvaccines based on modifications of the replicase gene could in principle be generated by mutagenesis as modifications introduced in the mhv nsp-1coding regions have identified residues important for protein processing and viral rna replication that may affect virus virulence and could be introduced in vaccine candidates brockway and denison 2005 sars nsp1 blocks host macromolecular synthesis and abrogates ifn signaling kamitani et al 2006 providing further evidence that nsp1 coding regions represent potential virulence determinants alternatively tyr6398his substitution in open reading frame orf 1b-nsp14 has been demonstrated that attenuate mhv replication in mice sperry et al 2005 similarly deletion of the nsp2 gene in mhv and sars-cov has been shown to yield viable attenuated mutant viruses that replicate about one log less efficiently than wt virus in cell culture and in animals and may also provide a foundation for the design of live vaccines graham et al 2005 as the nsp14 tyr residue and nsp 2 are completely conserved it may be possible to engineer common coronaviridae attenuating alleles via recombinant dna techniques alternatively changes in gene order within the replicase or even relocation to the 3-end of the genome if tolerated may led to attenuated virus phenotypesother options to include safeguards into the genetically engineered vaccines particularly those that can prevent the recovery of the original virulent phenotype by recombination between the vaccine strain and viruses circulating in the field such as hcov-229e -oc43 or -nl63 have been developed one of them is the construction of replication-competent propagation-defective viruses pseudovirions that are defective in one gene conferring an attenuated phenotype or even the ability for virus propagation enjuanes et al 2005 these viruses could be grown in packaging cell lines providing in trans the missing protein in the case of sars-cov vaccine candidates without the e gene have been constructed in order to prevent the rescue of the virulent phenotype by recombination with a circulating human coronavirus the deletion of an essential gene located in a position distant from gene e and the relocation of the deleted gene to the position previously occupied by gene e has been proposed a potential recombination leading to the rescue of gene e would lead to the loss of the essential gene enjuanes 2005an alternative approach for developing safer recombination resistant live coronavirus vaccines has been developed by modifying the transcriptional regulatory sequences trs of a vaccine strain to a sequence incompatible with the trs of any known circulating coronavirus the idea being that recombinant events between wt coronaviruses and trs remodeled sars-cov would result in genomes containing lethal mixed regulatory sequences that block expression of subgenomic mrnas fig 7a yount et al 2006 trs sequences among coronaviruses are highly conserved and direct the expression of subgenomic mrnas using a molecular clone the sars-cov trs network was remodeled from acgaac to ccggat fig 7b this rewiring of the genomic transcription network allows for efficient replication of the mutant virus icsars-crg the icsars-crg recombinant virus replicated to titers equivalent to wt virus and expressed the typical ratios of subgenomic mrnas and proteins interestingly some new transcripts were noted initiating from the replicase gene most of which could encode n-terminal truncated orf1a polyproteins it is not clear if these novel transcripts might influence pathogenic outcomes although in some instances nsp3 is truncated potentially allowing for the establishment of dominant negative phenotypes on replication in cell culture and animals an attractive sars-cov vaccine could further be modified by building attenuating mutations on the genetic template of the recombination-resistant trs rewired virus either for use as a safe high titer seed stock for making killed vaccines or as a live virus vaccine one interesting refinement of this approach would be to include secondary traps that are activated in recombinant genomes in this instance wt trs sequences can be designed into intragenic sites in essential orfs like the s and m glycoprotein genes in recombinant viruses encoding wt leader trs sequences subgenomic transcription might initiate from within the essential structural genes and the resulting n-terminal deletions would likely be lethal or severely attenuatingboth humoral and t-cell-mediated responses to animal coronaviruses may exacerbate disease or cause new health problems zhong et al 2005 t-cell responses have been implicated in the demyelinization of the brain and spinal cord following infection with neurotropic mhv castro and perlman 1995 wu et al 2001 a group 2 coronavirus like sars-cov adverse humoral responses to another group 2 coronavirus bovine coronavirus bcov have also been linked to the development of shipping fever in cattle oconnor et al 2001 moreover previous exposure to fipv or passive or active immunization against this virus a group 1 coronavirus was found to cause the early death syndrome instead of providing immune protection pedersen et al 1981 weiss et al 1980 this disease exacerbation was due to the virus-specific antibodies that facilitated and enhanced uptake and spread of the virus causing ade of infectivity porterfield 1986 vennema et al 1990 weiss and scott 1981 that is caused by spike protein specific antibodies corapi et al 1995 corapi et al 1992 olsen et al 1993 olsen et al 1992with this scenario of side effects caused by some coronavirus vaccines a safety concern is that sars-cov could induce similar antibody- or cell-mediated immune pathologies this concern was increased mainly by three reports one study utilizing lentivirus pseudotyped with various sars-cov s proteins yang et al 2005 indicated that within the s protein the major target for vaccine and immunotherapy there are minor differences among eight strains transmitted during human outbreaks in early 2003 whereas substantial functional changes were detected in s derived from a case in late 2003 from guandong province isolate gd03 and from two palm civets sz16 and sz3 the gd03 spike pseudotyped virus is markedly resistant to antibody neutralization alternatively antibodies that neutralized most human s glycoproteins enhanced virus entry mediated by two civet cat virus s glycoproteins related to the gd03 isolate yang et al 2005 in another report it has been shown that the administration into ferrets of mva-based sars-cov s vaccine but not mva alone followed by live sars-cov challenge resulted in enhanced hepatitis weingartl et al 2004 these side effects have not been reported in other studies with sars-cov in ferrets in which it has been shown that ferrets are a useful model for sars-cov martina et al 2003 similarly these data were not reproduced by other groups he et al 2006 furthermore ade of disease has not been observed with any human sars-cov strain therefore it will be important to assess vaccines in relevant animal models as they become available antibodies directed against sars-cov were found to be protective and not to enhance viral infectivity in the mouse or hamster models bisht et al 2004 roberts et al 2005b subbarao et al 2004 yang et al 2004 using inactivated sars-cov or immunization with recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing the s and n proteins of sars-cov see et al 2006 although their effect in humans remains unknown zhong et al 2005 side effects have not been observed in other animal models such as african green monkeys that 2 months after administration of sars-cov into the respiratory tract were challenged with sars-cov and no evidence of enhanced disease upon re-challenge was shown mcauliffe et al 2004consistent with these results cynomolgus macaques immunized with different amounts of purified virus in the absence or the presence of adjuvant challenged by the nasal route 30 days post-immunization showed no side effects even in the presence of low titer neutralizing antibodies temperature breathing appetite mental state and all biochemical indexes were normal for immunized monkeys and no abnormalities were observed in major organs such as lung liver kidney etc all control non-vaccinated animals showed interstitial pneumonia these results indicate that the purified sars-cov vaccine is safe in monkeys qin et al 2006 in summary immunization of mice using either s protein or whole inactivated virus spruth et al 2006 or of monkeys with whole inactivated sars-cov qin et al 2006 zhou et al 2005 most frequently resulted in the absence of side effects after providing different types of sars-cov vaccinesin contrast vee virus expressing n protein failed to induce protection in either young or senescent animals and resulted in enhanced immunopathology following viral challenge between days 4 and 14 post-infection therefore caution has to be taken before including n in vaccine formulations by expressing n protein using dna immunization or vee vectors deming et al 2006 as no protection was elicited in mice against homologous challenge and no benefit to vaccination with a cocktail of both s and n proteins was observed rather the co-expression of n protein in vaccine regimens which failed to simultaneously induce a strong neutralizing anti-s antibody response led to an increased number of lymphocytic and eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrates which are also characteristic of the immune pathology observed with respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection following vaccination with formalin inactivated rsv de swart et al 2002 hancock et al 1996 therefore the concern has been raised that expression of n protein may result in vaccine-enhanced pulmonary disease as previously described for viruses like rsv kim et al 1969 the data suggest that the presence of n protein in vaccines should be evaluated in each vaccine formulation deming et al 2006 although thus far no human sars-cov s vaccine has been shown to be involved in ade of disease possible immunopathological complications of sars vaccine candidates require rigorous clinical and immunological evaluationwhereas the production of effective and safe vaccines for animal coronavirus previously reported has not been satisfactory cavanagh 2003 enjuanes et al 1995 saif 2004 the production of inactivated subunit or vaccines based on dna recombinant vectors or by reverse genetics using sars-cov genomes seem more promising an optimum animal model for sars-cov vaccine evaluation is still required after preclinical trials in animal models efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccine candidates described has to be performed in humansthis work was supported by grants from the comisin interministerial de ciencia y tecnologa cicyt the consejera de educacin y cultura de la comunidad de madrid fort dodge

rsbsome viral diseases have caused fatal havoc on the human species since they are associated with high mortality rates as well as low prevention and treatment approaches currently there is a high risk of the spread of the covid-19 disease caused by the sars cov-2 viruses sars cov-2 virus is one of the types of human novel-coronavirus of the family coronavirus the nature of transmission of the virus makes it one of the most infectious pathogenic diseases that has ever existed though the human coronaviruses have existed since the discovery of the human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e and human coronavirus oc43 hcov-oc43 in 1960 it has been a challenge to develop an effective cure as well as vaccine for the diseases associated with coronaviruses later in 2003 a coronavirus pandemic erupted in guangdong a chinese province famous for live wild animal trade and was identified as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov sars-cov pandemic affected at least 37 nations causing 1879 deaths across the globe by 2005 when it was effectively controlled 1 commonly human coronaviruses cause illnesses such as intestinal and respiratory tract illnesses nevertheless the symptoms reflected after infection from the coronaviruses take some time before being identified thus the viruses can replicate and cause more harm to the human body before being detected antibiotic treatment has been ineffective in treating infections due to coronaviruses which acts as another factor contributing to the very high death toll 1 through conducting this research this paper will establish reliable information on the transmission mode of coronaviruses and explore the various traits of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 while offering various measures to control the implications of the viruses on the human population older people with pre-existing diseases and men are more susceptible to this infection and make up the majority of the victims however most people with severe symptoms are middle-aged adults who were stable at an early stage several studies conducted to determine the cause of such variation by collecting data from around the world in particular from countries with a large number of cases to find clues to help find a common denominator that can help in finding a cure age sexual orientation socio-economic status and access to the health care system are some of the variants that were not very helpful but researching genome could help answer the question we were looking for a cure to combat this deadly viral infection and avoid another wave of similar diseaseswe used pubmed as our main database to search for the relevant published literature we searched for all types of the articles that were related to the topicanimal to human transmissionthe infections caused by the coronaviruses family to human beings since the onset of the 21st century influenced researches to identify the origin and transmission mode of the viruses across human beings a study conducted to identify the initial cause of the severe acute respiratory syndrome disease revealed that the sars-cov virus was transmitted from the wild animal reservoirs in the guangdong animal market the direct or indirect interaction between human beings and animals such as bats was identified as the critical source of the coronavirus direct consumption of bats or being close to them facilitated the spread of the virus from the wild animals to human beings thus increasing the impacts of the disease onto the human population 23 similarly the covid-19 disease caused by sars cov-2 coronaviruses originally erupted from the interaction of human beings and wild animals such as bats in the wuhan market in the hubei province of china coronaviruses have been identified in various wild animals especially mammals hence illustrating their potential impacts on the human species though the viruses do not have a severe effect on the wild animals they have been identified to influence severe respiratory infections that are resistant to known antibiotics as well as treatmentshuman to human transmissionthe contact between infected persons and uninfected persons influences the spread of both the sars cov-2 and covid-19 making them one of the most infectious diseases on the globe since both infections affect the respiratory tract the viruses can spread via the cough droplets sputum and closeness such as touching an infected individual moreover the sars cov-2 viruses were discovered in the feces of a child infected by the disease thus depicting that fecal contact could facilitate the spread of the disease 4 further the diseases influence the human species respiratory issues such as influenza thus possible to spread via the air from one individual to another covid-19 has been identified as a disease affecting the upper respiratory tract during the first few days after an infection where it causes pain in the throat and later moves down to the lower respiratory tract disposing of the viruses on the skin after circulating across the body system increases the possibility of spreading the viruses via sharing clothes body contact shaking hands and hugging 5 crowding and high socialization among human beings increase the chances of infections across the human population hence people need to avoid such situationsincubation periodthe incubation period of a disease is the duration that the symptoms take to first appear after exposure to infection a long incubation period depicts that an individual has a high tendency to infect other individuals before the disease can be medically diagnosed during the incubation period the pathogens causing the disease replicate and the host immune response is activated producing cytokines such as interferon that can have global effects hence reducing the body resistance posed by the immune system 6 although an incubation period might be longer such as 14 to 21 days after exposure the ability to infect other individuals can be before the symptoms are identified moreover determining the length of the incubation period of certain infectious diseases provides the most probable time frame during which an individual can be subjected to isolation and intensive medical observation 6 the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 caused by the novel coronaviruses influenced studies on the coronavirus family and its traits during the study the incubation period for the disease was estimated to be a mean of 64 days currently the estimated incubation period for the prevalent covid-19 has faced various changes since different people are affected differently by the disease according to the world health organization the incubation period of covid-19 is between two to 10 days 7 the china national health commission had initially approximated the covid-19 incubation 10 to 14 dayson the other hand the centers for disease control and prevention cdc approximates that the incubation period of the covid-19 is two to 14 days 7 quarantine self-isolation and intensive medical examination are carried out to prevent the spread of the covid-19 in public since there is no known cure or vaccine for the current global pandemic many nations have opted to control the spread of the disease across the population to avoid fatal impacts such as high mortality ratesgenomic differences between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 virusesgenomic traits of disease-causing pathogens reflect their origin as well as establish their implications on the host body further the study of the genomic characteristics of a disease-causing agent influences the development of possible treatment measures that can be used to address the effects of the infection across the affected population 8 current researches conducted on nine patients depicted that the human novel coronavirus 2019 has a ten genomic sequence similar to two bat novel coronavirus-like pathogens with a similarity of 9998 across the examined nine patients 89 the bat-sl-covz45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 are distinct from the sars-cov virus that affected at least 37 nations in 2003 9 studies have shown that despite some variations in genomic sequences covid-19 has a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of sars-cov moreover the 2019 sars-cov-2 is categorized as a subgenus sarbecovirus of the genus betacoronavirus 810 additionally the close relation of the sars-cov-2 infection with the bat-like coronaviruses shows that close contact between humans and bats could have influenced the spread of the virus into the human hosts moreover the mutation of the sars-cov is long term since it can take years hence the resistivity to vaccines could be low but develop within several years of exposure 11 currently the mutation rate of the sars-cov-2 virus is not known though its replication rate is high and poses fatal challenges to human healthimmune response and gene variationsthe gene known as human leukocyte antigen hla produces proteins that bind to the pathogen that acts as warning signs to alert immune cells the human body has three different classes of proteins to determine how the body can best fight certain infections including sars-cov-2 if hla binds a viral protein that is critical for the pathogen to replicate and survive the subsequent antibody activity is likely to be more effective in targeting the virus if someone was previously exposed to common coronaviruses - which cause the common cold - and had the right hla types that provide some protection against other viruses it is theoretically possible that they could also generate an early immune response against the novel sars-cov-2 virus 12immune system response is different in different people overreaction of the immune system which is known as cytokine storm is thought to be the leading cause of death in many severe acute respiratory syndrome sars patients and is believed to be responsible for some of the deaths among young covid-19 patients the mortality rate among men infected with covid-19 is higher than mortality rate among women with covid-19 partly due to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 found in the x chromosome which means that men have one of the genes that make them more vulnerable to this disease in comparison women have two copies of the gene ace2 would mitigate any viral susceptibility to one variant from the second allele of ace2 13to date some genetic studies suggest that variants in hla genes are likely to play a role while others point to the difference in abo blood type and ace2 genes that sars-cov 2 binds to human cells in addition to the genetic variants of the ace2 receptor the severity of the disease is influenced by variations in human leukocyte antigen genes that affect the immune response to the viruswuhan university research tested different sources of abo blood from 369 virus-infected patients and found 3216 2490 910 and 3384 for a b ab and o respectively it has proposed a high type a contingent and a low type o contingent these results reflected blood tests in another hospital followed by 3775 2642 1003 and 2580 a similar pattern has been reported for mortality rates with 206 deaths at 4126 2427 922 and 2524 respectively in classes a b ab and o 14 based on these findings it is suggested that people with blood type a are at significantly higher risk of infection than people with other abo blood-types which may be due to the presence of anti-a antibody in the blood however more clinical trials are needed to support this association of abo blood groups and covid-19the association between the levels of ace2 expression and the four key levels of immune signature in the tissues including cd8t cells interferon response b cells and natural killer nk cells was evaluated according to the human protein atlas hpa significantly higher levels of ace2 protein and gene expression are found in the gastrointestinal tract kidney gallbladder and male reproductive tissues this data could also explain the higher number of cases of covid-19 in males compared to females 15looking at the interaction of ace2 levels of expression with cd8t cells interferon b cells nk cells in males there was a substantially positive linkage in the thyroid heart adrenal glands liver kidneys colon and bladder whereas the females only had interaction between ace2 and immune markers in thyroid heart and colon which indicates the variations and similarities between male and female expressions of ace2 and immune markers it also explains why some people have respiratory symptoms and others have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea nausea vomiting and other signs of the system it has already shown that the lung cells are more easily contaminated with sars 2 due to higher levels of ace2 male and older age groups have a higher degree of association between ace2 expression and immune signature than females and young adults which explains the higher level of sars 2 cases and death in this population there are no significant differences in ace2 expression between males and females but the distinction lies in the immune response that varies from person to person 15diagnosis for both virusesthe diagnosis of coronaviruses is based on the symptoms reflected by the affected individual since both the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 cause a severe influenza-like infection that affects the human respiratory system respiratory symptoms are commonly used to detect the viruses 16 the initial indications of the presence of the virus in the human body include coughing running nose common cold headaches body aches and difficulty in breathing further various more advanced techniques are used to determine the type of the virus as well as its genetic composition in the human respiratory system 17 electron microscopy reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr amplification serology and sequence-independent amplification are the fundamental techniques used to develop the essential traits of both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in the human body m currently rt-pcr amplification serology and sequence-independent amplification are commonly used approaches to diagnose the sars-cov-2 virus across the human populationtreatment measuresthe treatment process of the sars-cov infection varies slightly from the methods currently employed to address the increasing issues of sars-cov-2 disease on the globe sars-cov treatment measures involved the initiation of ventilators that assisted the patients in accessing effective breathing ability 18 treatment of the subsequent infections facilitated by the virus enhanced the ability to control the disease though it eventually caused at least 1800 deaths 19 on the other hand the current treatment measures imposed to counter the fatality of the sars-cov-2 include the treatment of the conditions associated with the infection since there is no known cure for the disease further scientists are considering the application of virus antiviral medication to assist in curbing the prevalence of the disease across the human population the close association of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 has influenced the use of ventilators to enhance the breathing ability of patients affected by sars-cov-2 20 controlling the impact of sars-cov-2 has been a problematic issue across the globe because of its high infectious condition and its generic composition the protein coat over the key genetic ribonucleic acid rna material inside the sars-cov-2 virus resists the impacts of any treatment chemical utilized to cure the ailment 21 currently regular washing of hands avoiding social contact with an infected individual as well as wearing protective masks and gloves are the commonly used measures to prevent the spread of the coronaviruses across the human population isolation and quarantine measures are being imposed on the individuals who have tested positive with the diseaseplasma transfusionconvalescent plasma is used as a clinical procedure and as an option for patients who are either seriously ill or who do not respond to other therapies this plasma comes from patients who have recovered from covid-19 infection and who have developed antibodies to control the virus these antibodies are formed in plasma to protect against possible infections with the same virus however the potential treatment benefits and risk of developing side-effects need to be further investigated the use of convalescent plasma in previous middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and sars outbreaks demonstrated safety and faster viral clearance particularly when given early in the course of the disease transferring plasma from patients who developed neutralizing antibodies nabs to specific sars-cov-2 proteins could neutralize the virus prevent further replication and stop ongoing tissue damage in patients with less severe infections earlier in the course of the disease or prophylactically administered to high-risk individuals 22understanding the actions of crucial covid-19 proteins is critical to the development of plausible treatment or vaccines cov-2 s protein plays a vital role in the fusion infection and transmission of viruses moreover the most likely objective is to build nabs to block the binding and merging of covid-19 the s protein is the primary inducer of nabs consisting of two components s1 and s2 the receptor-binding domain rbd interacts directly with the host receptor s1 although sars 2 uses the same ace2 receptor as sars for cell entry sars-cov-2 s protein binds ace2 with a higher affinity than sars-cov suggesting that its ace2 recognition may differ from sars-cov besides there is a minimal cross-reactivity of the antibody between the two virus s proteins some studies indicate that sars-cov antibodies may be binding to sars cov-2 rbd but their ability to neutralize is not understoodsars and mers unique nabs that include monoclonal antibodies mabs target regions s1 and s2 and block rbds to their respective receptors and interfere with s2-mediated membrane fusion or host cell entry preventing viral infection despite the use of polyclonal antibodies to treat sars 2 disease in recovered covid-19 patients researchers have yet to discover novel neutralizing mabs for sars-cov 2 if these antibodies developed it will take several years for them to be ready for human use as their safety and efficacy should be tested 23data from various human and animal-acquired viral infections and vaccines indicate that neutralizing antibodies nabs are needed to prevent or cure viral infections these nabs may be either contaminated or vaccinated to avoid viral infections lack of data on the role of nabs in disease progression due to possible heterogeneity of sars 2-specific nabs in recovered covid-19 patients needs further investigation in the development of an appropriate vaccine and patients undergoing convalescent plasma therapyin the past antibody therapy for plasma infusions has been commonly used to treat viral infections including sars and mers the efficacy of this therapy has been linked to the concentration of nabs in the recovered plasma donor if viral infection with sars-cov-2 persists convalescent plasma continues in recovered patients or serum is used as an alternative therapynab levels in patients recovered from covid-19 may vary some with high nab titers some with very low titers indicating that other immune responses including t cells or cytokines may contribute to the recovery of these patients research has shown that higher c-reactive protein crp and lower lymphocyte counts have a strong innate immune response at the time of admission to elderly patients than younger patients which may have caused an adverse condition following coronavirus infection rapid innate immune responses in older patients often suggest higher rates of nab titer it attributes to the fact that neutralizing antibodies nabs have a positive association with crp but are negatively associated with the indication of patient lymphocytes a link between cell-mediated antibody response and immune response 24comparative analysisthe impacts of coronaviruses on the globe have caused fatal situations that led to the death of more than 25000 individuals globally up to this day sars-cov-2 is a very highly infectious disease that can spread via close contact between human beings 25 coming into contact with surfaces that contain the virus further facilitates the spread of the virus since humans are social beings participating in social events it increases the risk of spreading the virus from one individual to another the traits of the virus make it more likely to affect a large number of individuals across the globe moreover the sars-cov-2 disease is a viral disease caused by a novel human coronavirus that has a long strand of rna hence it is complex to regulate its replication in the human body 26 covid-19 viruses have protein spikes that enhance their compatibility with the human cells therefore they can survive in the human bodythe coronaviruses multiply at a higher rate hence they spread through the affected human organs at a high rate the high replication rate increases the rate by which the viruses spread across the human body hence it is challenging to cure the disease the compatibility of the viral cells with human cells further inhibits treatment approaches aimed at denaturing the viral cell the key difference between the sars-cov virus and the sars-cov-2 virus is their genomic structure and their response to different treatment approaches sars-cov genomic make-up varies from the sars-cov-2 since the sars-cov-2 virus has longer rna strand than the strand in the sars virus the rna s-sequence in both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov viruses is similar hence the key differences have not been effectively proven 27 the impacts of the diseases on human bodies are identical though the sars-cov affects various organscurrently there are different facts about the sars-cov-2 that are not known through current researches that are being conducted to answer the different concerns on the sars-cov-2 infection the treatment approaches in terms of vaccine and a medicinal cure have not been discovered the survival of the covid-19 virus in the human corpse after demise is not currently known thus the researches conducted are aimed at informing the relevant risk eminent when one comes into contact with the corpse of corona patient 28 people are encouraged to maintain a social distance to avoid further spread of the disease moreover frequent hand-washing and disinfecting the possibly contamination-prone surfaces is recommended using face masks and gloves prevents individuals from the virus from the surfaces as well as from the other infected individuals staying at home has been advocated across the globe where individuals are encouraged to conduct essential activities from their homes and avoid moving out of their houses for unnecessary reasons comparison between sars and covid-19 is shown in table 1sars and covid-19 have similarities but can they co-infect a patient if they do co-infect then how often do they have a synergistic effect if they do have a synergistic effect then is there a way to differentiate them from each other symptomatically can they both be differentiated based on signs and symptoms when they co-infect a patientsymptom wise covid-19 symptoms vary why these variations exist why some patients exhibit some symptoms while others exhibit different symptoms is this because of the variant of the virus or is it because of the genetic differences between the individuals and the way covid-19 manifests with different symptoms in different individuals is it the same situation with sars if yes then to what extentthese are the questions that arise and we recommend future scientists to explore more about these questionswe have much to learn from previous outbreaks of coronaviruses and the new ongoing pandemic by looking at the similarities and differences between the current sars-cov-2 and the previous outbreak of sars a remarkable resemblance emerges with some unique features of its own every time a new strain of these viruses appears it is more aggressive than the previous ones which makes it more difficult to find treatment and a vaccine a clear understanding of the host immune response may help in finding how the virus causes disease and a possible cure to eradicate this virus the wet animal markets have played a significant role in the sars and covid-19 global epidemics emphasize the need for a change in china - away from their use to prevent zoonotic transmission the best approach is to suspend or close down these markets however due to its long history in china it will be impossible to shut down permanently as the income of most people relies on selling live animals the best possible way to prevent and control the disease spread is the use of proper hygiene and rules for limiting animal-human contact would be ideal in addition to epidemiological surveillance and monitoring the knowledge we have so far is limited and more research work is needed to design prophylactic and therapeutic measures to fight current epidemics and any future outbreak of similar coronavirusa pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is currently underway resulting in worldwide severe morbidity and mortality limited pre-existing immunity to this virus is thought to be responsible for the explosive increase in cases across the world nearly all transmission models of sars-cov-2 assume that infection produces immunity to reinfection for durations of at least one year13 this assumption is relevant to public health officials implementing and managing various non-pharmaceutical interventions the utility of sera from infected individuals as a therapeutic4 and the ability for serological tests to identify those who are immune5 the dynamics of immunity will also affect the performance of serological testing to quantify the extent of infection in populations however knowledge of the dynamics and nature of immune response to sars-cov-2 infection is limited and the scientific basis for durable immunity upon which these key public health and clinical strategies are dependent is not well developedseveral authors have noted human experimental infection studies called human challenge studies suggesting that protection after coronavirus infections may last only 1 or 2 years69 hcovs have been used in human challenge experiments since shortly after their discovery in 19651011 these experiments where individuals were intentionally infected with hcov provide some of the clearest characterization of human responses to coronaviruses and the potential for immune responses to limit infection and disease multiple human challenge studies measured antibody immunity before a coronavirus challenge and identified antibody responses that were associated with protection from infection serological response or symptom12 the low severity of hcov allowed for safe use of these viruses in human challenge experiments the greater likelihood of severe illness in sars-cov-2 limits the applicability of such experiments although some have argued for their use in subsets of the population13the duration of immunity of sars-cov-2 will dictate the overall course of the pandemic and the post-pandemic dynamics7 and so an understanding of the temporal dynamics of protective immunity is critical as with other introductions of novel pathogens14 explosive outbreaks of sars-cov-2 across the globe may threaten its persistence by reducing the number of available hosts susceptible to infection immune interactions with endemic coronaviruses could theoretically affect the short- and long-term dynamics of sars-cov-2 and vice versa1516 through cross-protection or antibody-dependent enhancement17 but these interactions and effects are not yet understood if sars-cov-2 does become endemic age-stratified seroprevalence studies of endemic coronaviruses may provide estimates for incidence rates in the presence of higher levels of population immunityhere we describe the results of a systematic review of the literature on antibody measures of immunity to coronaviruses including endemic human coronaviruses principally hcov-229e hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 sars-cov-1 mers-cov middle east respiratory syndrome cov and early work on sars-cov-2 we conceptualize the stages of exposure and infection at which immunity may play a role in the dynamics of sars-cov-2 and how literature describing work on this and other coronaviruses can provide insights into these stages as follows see figure 1 a visual abstract of our review first an exposure to a pathogen generates an immune response that changes over time and between individuals antibody kinetics upon exposure infection history might play a role in providing protection against new infection and the literature can provide evidence for such correlates of protection through challenge studies and longitudinal cohort studies upon infection an individuals immune state possibly impacted by pre-existing antibodies to other coronaviruses among other mechanisms may cause harm through immunopathogenesis and the literature on this topic primarily consists of in vitro experiments correlates of immunity or risk through immunopathogenesis are complicated by the existence of multiple genera of coronaviruses that are antigenically diverse and may provide cross-protection and may also cause false positive assay results due to cross-reactivity finally the preceding phenomena at the individual level interact to determine population seroprevalence studies that measure these quantities across different age groups can provide evidence albeit ecological evidence for or against proposed mechanisms of immunity at the individual levelwe conducted searches of the pubmed database on march 20 2020 using the search term coronavirus and each of the following terms or phrases serolog serop cross reactivity and complement fixation we also searched for each of these terms with the search terms sars and mers articles were included in the search

papers according to pre-defined criteria for each area of focus related to accessibility utility in answering the key questions and suitability for the pooled analyses see supplementary appendix for details data are available at httpsdoiorg105281zenodo3751566we summarized approximate time to detection across studies for two sets of studies the first set includes studies with cumulative number of positive cases over time each additional positive case added to the cumulative curve was assumed to be a new detected case at that time point this is approximate only because cumulative curves sometimes decline figure s1 indicating some participants were lost to follow-up second we identified data that described either seropositivity as a function of time or measures of antibodies with a reported cutoff data was included if i the first seropositive time point was within three weeks of illness onset or ii the first estimates were negative but a subsequent measurement within three weeks of the first was positivewe estimated the annual force of infection from age-stratified seroprevalence data assuming that individuals acquire infection with a single strain-specific force of infection that is constant in time using standard methods18 and that once an individual becomes seropositive they remain seropositive for the remainder of their lifetime regardless of their protective status we estimated the total force of infection foi from the four major endemic strains by drawing 100000 bootstrap samples of four strain-specific fois and calculating the sum across strains age at first infection is given by the inverse of total foimultiple serological assays have been used to characterize antibody responses to coronaviruses assays we encountered in our review fell into two major categories table s1 the most commonly used assays were binding assays including enzyme linked immunosorbent assays elisa immunofluorescence assays ifa western blots hemagglutination inhibition hai and complement fixation cf the second category of assays was neutralization assays neutralization assays are typically considered the gold standard for measuring functional antibody responses as they measure biological activity throughout the viral replication process researchers have used assays of both types to characterize antibody activity by antibody class ie igg igm iga as these antibodies are known to have different temporal dynamics we reported when specific classes of antibodies were characterized in figures if no characterization was specified we reported the measures of antibody aggregated across all classes the source of samples in the reviewed studies was almost exclusively serum samples however mucosal samples collected by swab or nasal washings were also reportedin the studies we shortlisted antibody responses to infecting coronaviruses were rarely reported during the acute phase of illness 17 days1922 many studies reported an immune response characterized by a robust increment of antibody titers for hcov-229e mers-cov sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 after the second or third weeks following the onset of illness82330callow et al8 found similar dynamics in iga and igg across 10 individuals experimentally infected with hcov-229e antibody levels increased after 8 days and peaked around 14 days although significant variation between patients was reported yang et al31 analyzing data across 67 patients found higher positive rates of igm against sars-cov-1 than igg during the first month they further found that the proportion of patients who seroconverted for igm peaked 30 days after onset followed by a gradual decrease of igm levels while igg levels peaked by week 2531 another study on 30 sars-cov-1 infected patients32 detected seroconversion of igg igm and iga at similar times indicating that the earliest they reached a peak was on average 15 days while it is currently too early to characterize how anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies will change over prolonged periods of time preliminary studies have analyzed antibody changes in recent infections tan et al33 found that igm was detected on day 7 and peaked on day 28 across 28 patients and igg appeared by day 10 and peaked on day 49 45 patients while zhao et al34 determined that seroconversion among 173 patients took place at median times of 12 igm 14 igg and 11 neutralizing antibodies daysmultiple studies reported that while igm and igg titers increased during the first weeks following symptom onset igm levels gradually waned while remaining detectable for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov in comparison to igg levels about a month post follow-up2332 most studies that examined antibody kinetics over extended periods of time focused on igg323540 callow et al8 found among experimental infections with hcov-229e that after peaks in igg and iga antibody levels waned and between 11 weeks and 1 year post inoculation were at similar levels to those found in inoculated but uninfected patients other studies3540 reported detectable igg levels in recovered mers-cov patients respectively at five months and one year after illness onset while another31 detected igg antibodies across 67 sars-cov-1 patients after 82 weeks the endpoint of the study we found few studies that analyzed changes in antibody kinetics over the course of many years after illness onset3637 cao et al37 described similar long-term dynamics in igg and neutralizing antibodies over the course of a 3-year study on sars-cov-1 titers for both peaked at month 4 and while they waned thereafter 742 and 839 of patients had detectable levels of igg and neutralizing antibodies respectively at month 36studies have increasingly explored a potential link between case severity and antibody response however the available information analyzing the nature of this relationship is uneven across viruses several studies on mers-cov as well as the first preliminary analyses on sars-cov-2 explicitly explore this connection while fewer studies on endemic hcovs and sars cov-1 do so several studies found that cases of varying severity eg asymptomatic mild and severe developed detectable antibodies against hcov-229e sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 and mers-cov334144 one study45 found that the rise in antibodies between acute and convalescent sera correlated positively with symptoms and clinical score in 15 patients experimentally infected with hcov-229e table 1 however most studies of sars-cov-1 did not report symptom severity and evidence of differences in antibody responses among cases experiencing symptoms of different severity is inconclusive sars-cov-1 survivors with sequelae were found to have lower neutralizing antibodies than patients without sequelae37 although the same study otherwise found no significant differences in kinetics according to disease severity another study39 found no evidence of difference in antibody responses between patients who survived or died in mers-cov on the other hand ko et al46 found that both seroconversion rate and peak antibody levels increased with disease severity while okba et al47 reported a robust response to severe infections as opposed to low or no seroconversion in asymptomatic and mild cases milder infections also appeared to be less likely to elicit serologic responses4748 although okba et al suggests that seroconversion detection may depend on the antibodies being targeted more severe cases were also found to have slower responses2427 75 of patients who died had not seroconverted by week 346 some authors have hypothesized4749 that seroconversion rates in severe cases may be associated with prolonged viral shedding and that low antibody responses in mild cases may be due to short-lived infections another study40 suggested that weaker antibody responses to endemic hcovs specifically hcov-229e might be because these mainly infect the upper respiratory tract preliminary studies on sars-cov-2 point to a possibly contrasting pattern to mers-cov while igm antibodies appear at the same time in severe and non-severe cases igg appears sooner in severe cases33 on the other hand neutralizing antibody titers were higher in severe cases34the distributions of time points at which antibodies were detected see methods in the digitized data are shown in figure 3 the median time to detection was similar across different antibodies for sars-cov-1 12 days iqr 8152 days and sars-cov-2 11 days iqr 72514 days but longer for mers-cov 16 days iqr 1319 days severity appears to be associated with time to detection of igm in mers-cov cases only 2 days longer and igg in both mers-cov and sars-cov-2 2 to 3 days longer for more severe cases all data on time to seroconversion was based on symptomatic patients no data were available for asymptomatic individualsfigure 4 provides a broad sense for trajectories of antibodies also see figures s2 and s3 most longer-term studies 10 weeks were for mers-cov and reported igg and neutralizing antibodies these showed the presence of igg and neutralizing antibodies up to 60 weeks after symptom onset figure 4 the studies reporting symptom severity with longer-term data focused on mers-cov not all of these studies reported a cutoff for the assay used in those that did two thirds of patients with mild symptoms had detectable or positive igg antibodies at six months and one year while all patients with severe symptoms had detectable igg antibodies at the same points in time table 1several studies exposed volunteers to two challenges of virus some months apart reed re-challenged 6 volunteers who had been experimentally infected 812 months previously9 on the first challenge all 6 developed symptoms and detectable viruses and 5 of 6 experienced significant rise in titer in the second 06 experienced illness detectable virus or significant rise in titer callow et al re-challenged volunteers with the same dose of coronavirus one year apart8 of 9 volunteers who were infected in the first exposure 6 67 were infected in the second exposure however none of these individuals developed respiratory illness symptoms and they experienced a mean duration of detectable virus of 2 days compared to a mean of 56 in the initial challengewithin the coronaviridae family the coronavirinae subfamily includes four distinct genera the alphacoronaviruses include two major human coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 multiple hcov-229e-like strains have also been characterized the betacoronaviruses are categorized into 4 lineages lineage a includes hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 lineage b includes sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 lineage c includes mers-cov and multiple bat coronaviruses and lineage d contains coronaviruses thus far only identified in bats hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e are documented to cause common cold while the more recent strains hcovhku1 and hcov-nl63 infect both the upper and lower respiratory tract resulting in more severe but rarely fatal disease52 other covs have been associated with human disease including enteric disease in infants and zoonotic infections from livestock but seem rare and are not described here95358coronaviruses have four structural proteins the spike protein s the nucleocapsid n the envelope protein e and the membrane protein m5960 the s protein which protrudes from the virus envelope is immunodominant and consists of two subunits the s1 protein which contains the receptor binding domain rbd and the s2 protein which mediates cell membrane fusion6162 the nucleocapsid protein which is also immunogenic is smaller than s lacks a glycosylation site and induces antibodies sooner than to s during infection making it an attractive protein for diagnostic assay design63 sequence homology for the n and s of sars-cov-1 to other betacoronaviruses is 3347 and 29 respectively while homology to alphacoronaviruses is lower 2529 homology to n and 2325 for s63 sars-cov-2 is most similar to sars-cov-1 harboring sequence homology of 90 in n and 76 in s followed by mers-cov 48 and 35 respectively64individuals experimentally inoculated with hcov-229e and hcov-229e-like strain lp experienced a 4-fold rise in neutralizing antibodies to both hcov-229e and lp while individuals inoculated with hcov-oc43 did not65 however while volunteers experimentally inoculated with hcov-229e-like strains were protected against challenge with the homologous strain at one year n66 none shed virus showed symptoms or had a rise in antibodies volunteers experienced only partial protection against heterologous hcov-229e-like strains n512 protected increasing population immunity to hcov-229e in the population was associated with less clinical disease upon challenge with hcov-229e-like strains9 studies of serological responses to hcov n proteins point to cross-reactivity within alpha-hcovs 229e and nl63 and beta-hcovs oc43 and hku1 but not between alpha- and beta-hcovs6668 consistent with observations in human challenge studies children experiencing natural hcov infections experience 4-fold seroconversions to either hcov-oc43 or hcov-229e but not both simultaneously69 however a longitudinal study in newborns found that children seroconverted to either hcov-nl63 or hcov-229e but not both although both viruses are alpha-hcovs70 a later study in newborns followed from age 0 to 20 months71 showed asymmetric interactions within alpha-hcovs and beta-hcovs seroconversion to hcov-nl63 was observed after hcov-229e but no recent hcov-229e seroconversions had a recent infection by hcov-nl63 suggesting hcov-nl63 provides at least short-term protective immunity against hcov-229e similarly hcov-hku1 seroconversion occurred prior to hcov-oc43 but rarely after suggesting hcov-oc43 protected against hcov- hku1individuals experiencing natural infections with hcov-oc43 or hcov-229e did not have detectable antibodies in acute or convalescent samples against sars-cov-1 to n protein72 by ifa or neutralization39 healthy individuals with antibodies to hcov-229e hcov-oc43 and other endemic hcovs rarely had detectable antibodies that bound sars-cov-1 infected cells or sars-cov-1 n protein687374 hcov-oc43 n and sars-cov-1 n proteins have a subset of sites with shared homology potentially explaining low-level false positive results for n-based assays75 blood donors in southern china n152 and saudi arabia n130 did not have detectable binding ifa or neutralizing antibodies to either mers-cov or sars-cov-17677 because children experience less severe disease during sars-cov-1 infection than adults it was hypothesized that childhood vaccination with non-covs provided cross-protection against sarscov-1 however binding and neutralizing antibodies and t cell responses induced by routine childhood vaccinations ampv bcg dpt hbv hib jev mmrv and mv rv opv pi sv vv varicella vaccine did not cross-react with sars-cov-1 in experimentally inoculated mice78sars patients often experience a 4-fold rise in antibody to hcov-229e hcov-nl63 andor hcov-oc43 in paired acuteconvalescent samples n122039 in one study the number of sars patients who experienced a 4-fold rise in binding antibodies was greater to hcov-oc43 n1011 than hcov-229e n51173 some sars patients also showed a rise in antibodies to hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 n protein73 and hcov-nl6379 among sars-cov-1 patients n28 60 had detectable ifa titers to mers-cov and 25 had anti-mers-cov neutralizing antibodies a subset with available paired samples experienced seroconversion to hcov-oc43 but limited seroconversion to alpha-covs in the same study animal handlers at a wildlife market in guangzhou n94 with low-level prevalence of antibodies to sars-cov-1 138 by ifa 43 by nt had detectable antibodies toward mers-cov 22 by if76 a follow-up study found that the cross-reactivity between sars-cov-1 and mers-cov was unlikely to be due to similarity in the receptor-binding domain rbd as monoclonal antibodies mabs raised to sars-cov-1 rbd did not bind mers-cov rbd or neutralize mers-cov even at high concentrations80 mers-cov may produce less cross-reactivity against sars-cov-1 a subset of slaughterhouse workers in saudi arabia had antibodies to mers-cov by ifa as well as to pandemic hcovs but none had reactivity to sars-cov-1 spike protein mers-cov patients were observed to have low-level cross-reactivity to sars-cov-177 and in one study hcov-hku1 n protein79 because of this cross-reactivity researchers have developed diagnostic assays with truncated sars-cov-1 s n and m proteins8184 see figure 5 for associations between homologous and heterologous titersa study of sars-cov-1 strains from the zoonotic phase palm civets and bats to early and late in the sars epidemic revealed that some escaped neutralization by mabs targeting the spike rbd of sars-cov-18587 sera from balbc mice immunized with full length s protein from civet strains were ineffective against human sars-cov-1 and vice versa88 despite significant cross-reactions between mabs against conformational epitopes of rbd with multiple mutational differences single mutations were shown to disrupt neutralizability89 in contrast mabs targeting regions critical for fusion and entry on the s2 protein are immunogenic and can broadly neutralize sars-cov-1 strains5990 a recent study showed reduced binding of mabs from sars patients to the rbd of sars-cov-2 especially those that blocked binding to the ace2 receptor the only mab potently bound to sars-cov-2 rbd protein did not compete with the rbd for binding to the ace2 receptor suggesting it bound a different conserved site on the protein91 similar studies were conducted to study changes in mers-cov five recombinant rbd proteins were constructed with mutations detected from mers-cov strains isolated in humans 20122015 and camels92 these rbds maintained functionality and induced potent neutralizing antibodies when residues in their receptor binding motifs were mutated to evade neutralization cross-reactivity persisted but binding affinity to dpp-4 the main receptor for mers-cov was lost suggesting limited antigenic escape for mers-cov a study of mers-cov isolates with distinct amino acid differences in the s and other replication proteins found differences in replication kinetics but it is not clear that these were attributable to differences in s93multiple studies have suggested the possibility that pre-existing antibodies increase disease by facilitating viral entry into cells this mechanism a long hypothesized explanation for severe dengue infections is called antibody-dependent enhancement ade this has also been hypothesized as relevant to coronaviruses specifically in patients who seroconverted early in sars-cov-1 infection259495 reasons why some individuals can mount responses more quickly than others are unknown but the correlation between greater age and early response with higher titers suggest priming effects from existing antibodies against endemic strains95 authors from another study pointed toward enhancement from antibodies within the episode17 nasopharyngeal viral load increased in the first week and declined thereafter but clinical worsening was seen in many of the patients at week two with virus shedding in stool and urine observed towards the end2594 many manifested with new-appearing lesions as original lesions improved the timing of the appearance of new lesions correlated with igg seroconversion suggesting that pathology post week one was driven by the immune response rather than by uncontrolled viral replication others have argued that ade due to neutralizing antibodies is unlikely as treatment of sarscov-1 with convalescent serum did not result in adverse effects95observation of increased risk of disease in infants with mid-levels of maternal antibody to dengue compared to high or low levels of maternal antibody is important evidence supporting the role of antibody in pathogenesis for dengue96 a similar mechanism has been identified for seropositive and seronegative kittens infected with feline infectious peritonitis virus a coronavirus that causes fatal disease in cats97 one study characterizing endemic hcov in infants observed the highest lower respiratory tract infection burden 78 at 623 months of age 15 at 6 months close to none at 25 years while upper respiratory tract infection burden was close to uniform98 the heightened disease burden after maternal immunity waning to medium levels in the lower tract and the absence of such observation in the upper tract where antibodies do not circulate subtly supports the possibility of ade in hcovscontrolled in vitro experiments have explored the possible enhancing action of antibodies for hcov infections a series of studies by yip et al demonstrated that opsonization of anti-spike antibodies allowed sars-cov-1 to enter non-ace2 expressing immune cells that bear fc- -rii cd3299100 though replication is observed after entry the virus does not exit nor alter the expression of proinflammatory immune mediators ccl2mcp-1 ccl3mip-1a cxcl10ip-10 tnf-a and apoptosis inducing ligands fasl101 this contrasts with effects in nonhuman primate studies where endocytosis into macrophages stimulated inflammation which in turn drove severe lung injuries102 a study by another group in human promonocyte cell line hl-cz which expresses both ace2 and fc--rii demonstrated increased infectivity and virus-induced apoptosis when anti-sars-cov-1 sera from patients were added at 100- to 2000-fold dilutions while at higher concentrations neutralization occurred103 upon infection tnf-a il-4 and il-6 expressions heightened while il-3 and il-1 only appeared in trace amounts the difference could have resulted from the cell line differences or the set of mediators assessed104 regarding regions of the spike protein that may induce antibodies with enhancement effects both anti-s1a and anti-s1b mabs showed mild to moderate effects103 only one particular anti-s1b clone showed neutralization no effect was seen for anti-n mabs there is limited evidence that these mechanisms are causal to inflammatory gene expression differences among patients with differing severities105while the link between antibody presence and enhanced severity via infection of immune cells remains unclear some have suspected a role for auto-reactive responses in increased severity of illness prolonged tissue destruction can increase presentation of host proteins to t- or b-cells and result in an adaptive response against self ie epitope spreading52 anti-s2 igg antibodies targeting uninfected lung epithelial cells a549 were detected in sars-cov-1 patients after twenty days post-symptom onset106 a reactivity not seen in serum from healthy individuals and non-sars-cov-1 pneumonia patients complement inactivation only showed cytotoxic effect when igg was presentunbounded presence of anti-s2 antibodies also increased the binding of immune cells pbmcs to a549 cells treated with ifn- replicating the conditions under which a cytokine storm would be observed a separate study demonstrated colocalization of anti-s2 abs collected from serum of sars patients 50 days post-fever onset with annexin a2 and immunoprecipitated annexin a2 on a549 cell surfaces elevated expression of annexin a2 on the surface can be stimulated by il-6 and ifn- both cytokines induced by sars-cov-1 which in turn increases binding of anti-s2 abs to the cell however its pathogenic role was not explored107 alternatively similarity between viral and host epitopes molecular mimicry can generate cross-reactive antibodies in mice108 and humans109 there is evidence of anti-n antibodies that cross react with il-11 an anti-inflammatory cytokine expressed in many tissues including lung and bone marrow the authors suggest high anti-n antibodies induced relatively early during infection may be involved in the thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia observed early in sars-cov-1 infection108for endemic coronaviruses seroprevalence rises sharply in childhood with little to no change in seroprevalence by age among adults while exact dynamics from 6 months to 20 years vary between studies the general trend remains consistent figure 7 displays hcov age-seroprevalence curves for the 7 papers with digitizable data on seroprevalence by age with the panels representing the four major endemic strains74110115 trends from papers not displayed in the figure are largely the same6870116117 two studies show a marked decline in seroprevalence with age above 4068111available data sets are more sparse for incidence and the patterns are inconsistent between studies110118120 figure 8 displays age-incidence curves for the 4 papers with digitizable data on incidence by age with each panel representing the two strains included in these studies hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 there was an increasing trend in seroincidence with age during an outbreak for hcov-229e in tecumseh michigan110 but a similar analysis of hcov-oc43 seroincidence in the same outbreak showed no such increase118 longitudinal follow-up of 10 families in seattle found a lower rate of seroconversions among adults compared to children119 a comparison of a cohort of 2140 year-olds and a cohort of 65 year-olds found no clear difference in incidence between the two age groups as measured by seroconversion or pcr-confirmed hcov-associated respiratory illness120 finally observational studies have shown evidence of coronavirus-associated respiratory illnesses in elderly populations121123 and across all ages124the force of infection of endemic coronavirus strains is high and the age at first infection low but variable across studies simple catalytic models fit to the digitized data predict median total force of infection across studies of 021 95 ci 009 040 see table s8 for estimates by study corresponding to an average age at first infection with any strain of 48 years 95 ci 25 112 a cohort of 25 infants followed from birth for an average of two years experienced annual strain-specific incidence rates from 0120707071 zhou et als serosurvey measured igg and igm separately and showed very different patterns with age115 figure 7 while igg seroprevalence rose to high levels by age 10 and remained high into the adult population igm seroprevalence declined to zero for all individuals aged 14 and older the authors interpreted this as evidence that first infections occurred before the age of 14 for all strainsthe rapid rise in seroprevalence with age observed in the literature suggests a force of infection and thus proportion seropositive to all serotypes at older ages high enough to preclude significant rates of coronavirus infection among older adults if each serotype confers lifelong homologous immunity figure 9 green dotted line on the other hand short-term complete immunity lifelong partial immunity and the existence of multiple genotypes within a single serotype with limited cross-immunity could explain the age-seroprevalence and age-incidence curves seen in the literature figure 9the review gave rise to several observations that were either consistent or conflicting across papers studies that enrolled children less than 6 months detected loss of maternal antibodies representing a preliminary line of defense for newborn children707174117 most studies showed no discernible difference in age-seroprevalence trends or in overall seroprevalence by strain gao et al68 found that seroprevalence of hcov-229e and hcov-hku1 was significantly lower than seroprevalence of hcov-oc43 and hcov-nl63 in addition chan et al114 found seroprevalence to hcov-hku1 to be low 216 in 3140 year olds in hong kong and stated that this was expected from the low rates of hcov-hku1 among respiratory illnesses finally most studies measured the presence of binding antibodies in the blood of the studies in figure 7 only cavallaro and monto110 red measured seropositivity using a neutralization assay that the seroprevalence is markedly lower in that study compared to the others could indicate lower test sensitivity compared to more modern tests or of the lack of correlation between neutralizing and binding antibodies against endemic coronavirusesregarding the novel coronaviruses serosurveys of sars-cov-1 confirmed that the rate of asymptomatic or subclinical infection was very low125 asymptomatic and subclinical rates of mers-cov are generally higher but available serosurveys lack the power to draw strong inference about age trends a large serosurvey conducted across saudi arabia found that the age of seropositive individuals was significantly lower than the age of clinical cases126 while another conducted across multiple countries in africa and asia found no trend in seroprevalence with age127 studies of risk factors within camel workers have either not addressed age as a risk factor128129 or not found an association130we have presented a broad comprehensive review of multiple aspects of the literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses we identified a number of key findings the median time to detection was similar across different antibodies for sars-cov-1 12 days iqr 8152 days and sars-cov-2 11 days iqr 72514 days but longer for mers-cov 16 days iqr 1319 days most long-term studies found that igg waned over time typically detectable up to at least a year while others found detectable levels of igg three years post symptoms onset antibody kinetics varied across the severity gradient with longer durations of detectable antibody associated with more severe symptoms human challenge studies with hcov indicate that serum and mucosal immune responses serum igg iga neutralizing titer mucosal iga provide possible correlates of protection from infection and disease however repeat human challenge experiments with single hcov suggest individuals can be infected with the same hcov one year after first challenge but with possible lower severity there is cross-reactivity within but minimal reactivity between alpha- and beta-covs while endemic hcovs rarely induce cross-reactive antibodies against emerging hcovs sars-cov-1 and mers-cov stimulate antibodies induced by prior hcov infections multiple mechanisms for immunopathology have been suggested but no strong causal evidence exists and the extent to which the presence of antibodies affects human disease severity is not known seroprevalence with the four major endemic hcov strains rose rapidly during childhood and remained high in adults the median age at first infection with any strain was 48 years 95 ci 25 112 there was no clear trend in seroincidence with age and many studies have demonstrated incidence of coronavirus infections in elderly populations these results suggest a measurable impact of immunity to coronaviruses on future risk but this protection may be transientwe have suggested a set of search terms to identify relevant work and others may expand on this search due to the speed of new research being produced we limited our systematic review of sars-cov-2 papers to before march 20 2020 further evidence on immune responses to sars-cov-2 is likely contained in work that has since been published we excluded from the review animal studies and studies of animal covs to remain human-focused but this literature is likely relevant to some areas of the review we limited the scope of the review to antibody-mediated immunity meaning that understanding of some areas of the review may be incomplete finally digitized data could be affected by publication bias or other selection bias meaning that it might not be representative of data from all studies the aim of the pooled analyses was to summarize the array of studies rather than formally explore hypotheses and as a result the models used are simple for example in estimating force of infection from age-stratified seroprevalence data we did not consider other features of a model such as assay sensitivity time- and age-varying force of infections seroreversion and cross-reactivity between strains that might better explain patterns seen in the datathere is a need for development of serological assays with high sensitivity for screening and sufficient specificity to exclude individuals from unneeded interventions evidence from previous emerging covs suggests that false negativity is likely to result from waning of antibody levels as most studies on antibody kinetics are on symptomatic patients the kinetics in subclinical infections a significant proportion of sars-cov-2 infections131 remains a key gap in the literature indications that less severe illnesses are associated with reduced antibody responses suggests that mild cases may pose challenges to serological assayson the other end the proposed policy of immunity passports to allow individuals presumed immune to return to work once social distancing measures are relaxed requires highly specific serological tests to mitigate adverse outcomes evidence from past emerging hcovs suggests low false positivity from cross-reaction with endemic hcovs however antibody titers do not necessarily translate to immunity challenge studies indicate multiple candidates that may serve as correlates of protection including serum and mucosal measures however these will need specific evaluation for sars-cov-2 the knowledge gap in correlates of protection and their durability must be filled before immunity passports are safe for general usepharmaceutical interventions to protect susceptible individuals or improve outcomes among sick individuals will first need to be tested in randomized trials vaccines with various antigens are currently under development132 and polyclonal antibodies from sars-cov-2-recovered patients have been used in some cases for treatment133 though the evidence for immunopathogenesis remains limited134 it will be important to design rigorous trials that can provide valid evidence of positive effect but also detect negative effects if they occur with associated adaptive stopping criteria such concerns might extend beyond vaccine development if negative effects are subtle and not or weakly detectable in phase iii studies in the event of mass vaccination following successful efficacy studies surveillance designed to detect waning immunity and adverse events due to vaccine-mediated immunopathogenesis is criticalkey questions for the long-term dynamics of sars-cov-2 include whether it is likely to be eradicated whether widespread immunity will lead to transient decreases in incidence and how long it will take for another large outbreak to occur modeling studies will be crucial in answering these questions but they will rely on an understanding of immune responses to sars-cov-2 and interactions with other coronaviruses to make relevant predictions analysis of datasets specifically of serosurveys needs to account for the kinetics of waning immunity and effects of imperfect assays to draw meaningful inferencesfinally we note that the best evidence for immune responses to sars-cov-2 will come from studies of the virus itself such studies are being performed and reported with unprecedented speed but in the absence of firm evidence many are turning to the existing coronaviruses as a model to that end we have produced this review to aid researchers in understanding the scope of the evidence for immune responses to these coronavirusesin december 2019 hospitals in wuhan china began to report cases of pneumonia of unknown cause most of the initially identified patients were geographically linked to a local wet seafood wholesale market where living or slaughtered wild animals are sold the virus then rapidly spread to over 200 countries and territories resulting in 3 672 238 confirmed cases and 254 045 deaths globally according to a report released by who on may 7 2020 subsequent deep sequencing of lower respiratory tract samples identified a novel coronavirus distinct from the other strains of coronavirus known to infect humans subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2a highly contagious virus that can be transmitted from person to person1 who designated the disease caused by sars-cov-2 infection as covid-19 similar to other diseases caused by coronaviruses the main transmission route of sars-cov-2 is via aerosolised droplets other possible transmission routes such as direct contact oralfaecal route and mother-to-child transmission have been proposed but further proof is needed with regard to these2 a retrospective study done at the beginning of the pandemic reported an incubation period of sars-cov-2 of approximately 514 days3 however a more recent report indicates that the incubation period could be as long as 24 days4
there is no effective cure for sars-cov-2 infection and the most common treatment for patients with covid-19 is supportive care although multiple anti-viral drugs including remdesivir and lopinavir plus ritonavir have been used in clinical practice5 6 the safety and efficacy of these are still unclear and are under clinical evaluation immune-mediated lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with covid-197 histological examination of lung biopsy tissue from a patient who died of covid-19 showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage and fibroblastic proliferation in airspaces and laboratory tests indicated a hyperactivated status of circulating cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes7 8 due to the hyperactive nature of the immune system in some patients with severe covid-19 several disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs dmards such as tocilizumab interleukin il-6 receptor inhibitor baricitinib janus kinase jak inhibitor anakinra il-1 receptor antagonist and the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine have been proposed as potential treatments for covid-19 in this review we discuss the immunological aspects of the sars-cov-2 virus infection and the potential implication of dmards in the treatment of patients with covid-19coronaviruses are a group of highly diverse enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses that belong to two subfamilies coronavirinae and torovirinae in the family of coronaviridae these viruses were first discovered in the 1960s and can be further classified into four main genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures9 among these four genera alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses primarily cause respiratory and intestinal infection in mammals whereas gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses mainly infect birds currently there are seven strains of coronaviruses that are known to infect humans including the recently identified sars-cov-2 human coronavirus 229e hcov-229e oc43 hcov-oc43 nl63 hcov-nl63 hku1 hcov-hku1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov10 11 12 domestic or wild animals could have important roles as zoonotic reservoirs that enable virus transmission to humans on the basis of current sequence databases the origins of sars-cov mers-cov hcov-nl63 hcov-229e and sars-cov-2 are thought to be bats whereas hcov-oc43 and hku1 probably originated from rodents13 14 15 16 17 although most coronavirus infections cause only mild respiratory symptoms infection with sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 can be lethalsars-cov first appeared in southern china and quickly spread around the world between 2002 and 2003 this virus was identified as the causative agent of the global pandemic sars18 which led to substantial morbidity and mortality a decade after sars an outbreak of mers-cov emerged in 201219 most people with mers had no previous contact with bats leading to the identification of camels as an intermediate host20 patients with sars or mers present with a variety of clinical features ranging from asymptomatic or mild respiratory illness to fulminant severe ards with extra-pulmonary complications21 22
sars-cov-2 belongs to the genus of betacoronavirus and on the basis of evolutionary analysis is most similar to the sars-like coronavirus from the chinese horseshoe bat with a nucleic acid homology of 843 10 sars-cov-2 also has 78 similarity with sars-cov and 50 with mers-cov at the nucleic acid level3 10 only 10 days after the release of the sars-cov-2 genome researchers found a similar coronavirus from fruit bats batcovhku91 based on evolutionary characteristics23 several later reports suggested that snakes mink and pangolins could be intermediate hosts based on codon preference and viral infection patterns24 25 26 at the onset of the covid-19 pandemic the main symptoms were fever 98 cough 76 and myalgia or fatigue 4427 about half of the patients developed breathing difficulty in one week and the severely ill patients soon developed ards acute cardiac injury secondary infections or a combination thereof27 the diagnosis of the disease mainly depends on sars-cov-2 rna detection in nasopharyngeal swab by real-time polymerase chain reaction epidemiological history clinical manifestations and lung imagingthe invasion and pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 are associated with the host immune response the spike glycoprotein s protein on the viral envelop binds to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 on the surface of human cells15 23 an analysis of the structure of the sars-cov-2 s protein and its binding affinity for ace2 using cryogenic electron microscopy and surface plasmon resonance showed that the structure of sars-cov-2 s protein is very similar to that of sars although with minor differences28 the affinity of sars-cov-2 s protein binding to ace2 is 10 to 20 times higher than that of the sars s protein suggesting that sars-cov-2 might transmit more readily from person to person28
innate immunity is the first line of defence against virus invasion viral infection of mammals activates intracellular pattern recognition receptors that sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as double-stranded rna or uncapped mrna the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns results in subsequent cytolytic immune responses mainly through the type i interferons ifn and natural killer cells adaptive immunity also plays an important part in viral clearance via activated cytotoxic t cells that destroy virus-infected cells and antibody-producing b cells that target virus-specific antigens patients with covid-19 especially those with severe pneumonia are reported to have substantially lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma concentrations of a number of inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 and tumor necrosis factor tnf27 29 30 another study29 reported that cd4 t cells cd8 t cells and natural killer cells were reduced in severely ill patients compared with those with mild disease symptoms moreover a substantial reduction of cd4 t cell and cd8 t cell counts in the peripheral blood was also observed in a patient who died7 notably the proinflammatory subsets of t cells including il-17-producing ccr4 ccr6 cd4 t-helper 17 or th17 cells and perforin and granulysin-expressing cytotoxic t cells were increased which could be partly responsible for the severe immune injury in the lungs of this patient7
the anti-viral immune response is crucial to eliminate the invading virus but a robust and persistent anti-viral immune response might also cause massive production of inflammatory cytokines and damage to host tissues31 the overproduction of cytokines caused by aberrant immune activation is known as a cytokine storm in fact in the late stages of coronavirus disease including sars mers and covid-19 cytokine storms are a major cause of disease progression and eventual death7 32 33 huang and colleagues27 found increased plasma concentrations of both th1 eg il-1 and ifn and th2 eg il-10 cytokines notably patients admitted to the intensive care unit icu had higher plasma concentrations of il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ifn-induced protein-10 ip-10 macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 and tnf compared to those not admitted to the icu two other studies29 34 also showed that plasma il-6 concentrations were above the normal range in patients with severe symptoms of covid-19 compared with healthy individuals and those with milder symptoms mehta and colleagues35 suggest that secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh could be associated with severe covid-19 cases hlh is a disease entity characterised by an uncontrolled cytokine storm and expansion of tissue macrophages or histiocytes that exhibit haemophagocytic activity36 hlh can result from genetic defects in cytolytic pathways familial or primary hlh or other diseases such as infection malignancy and rheumatic disease shlh37 in 1952 farquhar and claireaux first described cytokine storm in patients with hlh38 the characteristics of hlh including hypercytokinaemia unremitting fever cytopenias hyperferritinaemia and multi-organ damage are commonly seen in seriously ill patients with covid-1927 35 it is suggested that alveolar macrophages expressing ace2 are the primary target cells for sars-cov-2 infection these activated macrophages may play an important part in hlh-like cytokine storm during covid-1939 thus early identification and appropriate treatment of this hyperinflammatory status is important for reducing the mortality of patients with covid-19 35
evidence has shown that asymptomatic covid-19 carriers can transmit the disease to others and that the virus has a wider range of incubation time than initially thought 024 days4 in addition the virus displays a high infectivity if the virus continues to mutate to lower its pathogenicity there is a high possibility that it might coexist with humans therefore there is an urgent need to develop therapies to treat sars-cov-2 repurposing of approved drugs is commonly employed to fight against newly emerged diseases such as covid-19 as these drugs have known pharmacokinetic and safety profiles due to the importance of immune imbalance in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infection several immune-modulating drugs that regulate different aspects of inflammation table
 are being tested for their efficacy in the treatment of severe covid-19 hyperinflammation is an important determinant of disease outcome in covid-19 and immunosuppression might be beneficial to reduce the mortality in patients with severe symptoms7 35 therefore early identification of such patients is crucial it has been proposed that laboratory tests of ferritin lymphocyte or leukocyte counts platelet counts erythrocyte counts and sedimentation rate could be used to screen patients at high risk of hyperinflammation application of the hscore used for the evaluation of patients with shlh was recommended by mehta and colleagues35 to identify patients with covid-19 at high risk of hyperinflammation the hscore combines both laboratory and clinical parameters including serum aspartate aminotransferase triglycerides fibrinogen ferritin cytopaenias body temperature organomegaly haemophagocytosis on bone marrow aspirate and signs of immunosuppression35 in addition evaluation of cytokine profiles and immune cell subsets has important implications for selecting appropriate immunosuppressants eg tocilizumab could be considered in patients with high concentrations of serum il-6 given the fact that anti-viral immunity is required to recover from covid-19 the pros and cons of using an immunosuppressant on these patients should be carefully considered the severity of the hyperinflammation and viral load or replication status needs to be taken into consideration one way to avoid the suppression of anti-viral immunity is to choose selective instead of broad immunosuppressive drugs the timing of treatment is also crucial to reduce the side-effects of immunosuppression unfortunately there is not yet any definitive evidence with regard to the appropriate timing of administration of these agents further studies are required to determine the appropriate timing and routes of drug administrationil-6 is a key inflammatory cytokine that has a critical part in inflammatory cytokine storm and is elevated in patients with covid-1929 34 tocilizumab a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody against the il-6 receptor is widely used in treatment for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis40 in patients with covid-19 il-6-producing cd14 cd16 inflammatory monocytes were significantly increased and numbers of these cells were further increased in patients with covid-19 admitted to the icu41 the authors of this study proposed that hyperactivated th1 cells producing granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor gm-csf and ifn in the lung promote il-6-producing monocytes through release of gm-csf suggesting that both il-6 and gm-csf might be potential therapeutic targets in patients with covid-1941 tocilizumab is a first-line drug for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome a rapid and massive release of cytokines into the blood from immune cells usually caused by immunotherapy especially in patients with comorbidities in terms of mechanism tocilizumab binds to both the membrane and soluble forms of il-6 receptor thereby suppressing the jak-signal transducer and activator of transcription stat signalling pathway and production of downstream inflammatory molecules42 43 there are many ongoing trials assessing the efficacy of tocilizumab in covid-19 appendix p 1 however animal studies have shown that il-6 is required for the clearance of viruses and control of pulmonary inflammation44 therefore clinicians should pay close attention to the possibility that blocking il-6 could interfere with viral clearance or exacerbate lung inflammation a recent observational study45 from china reported that tocilizumab treatment in severe covid-19 cases resulted in improvement in covid-19 symptoms peripheral oxygen saturation and lymphopenia within a few days a substantial remission of lung lesion opacity in chest ct scan was observed in 95 of patients 19 of 20 after 5 days of treatment and all patients were discharged after an average of 151 days of hospital stay45
blockade of the il-1 pathway is used for the treatment of some hyperinflammation conditions the il-1 receptor antagonist anakinra is approved for rheumatoid arthritis stills disease and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome a phase 3 randomised controlled trial rct for severe sepsis reported that treatment with anakinra was associated with a significantly lower 28-day mortality in patients who were septic with hyperinflammation without increased adverse events46 a retrospective analysis47 of 44 patients with shlh who were treated with anakinra indicated that treatment with anakinra resulted in a 57 decrease of ferritin concentrations and early initiation of anakinra was associated with reduced mortality since il-1 was reported to be increased in some patients with covid-1927 blockade of il-1 seems a reasonable approach for the treatment of hyperinflammation in these patients35 several trials of anakinra are currently underway including a phase 23 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of anakinra and emapalumab ifn inhibitor in reducing hyperinflammation and respiratory distress in patients with covid-19 nct04324021 appendix p 1baricitinib is a small molecule compound that selectively inhibits the kinase activity of jak1 and jak2 baricitinib can be used in combination with one or more tnf inhibitors and is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis48 and psoriatic arthritis49 through searching the benevolentai database richardson and colleagues50 predicted that baricitinib might effectively reduce the ability of sars-cov-2 virus to infect lung cells51 as noted sars-cov-2 binds to the ace2 receptor on host cells and enters lung cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis ace2 is widely expressed in several tissues including renal vascular heart and lung high concentrations of ace2 expression on pulmonary at2 alveolar epithelial cells makes these cells particularly susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection52 ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 regulates endocytosis via phosphorylation of the clathrin adaptor protein ap2 richardson and colleagues identified six high-affinity aak1 inhibitors from 47 clinical candidates in the benevolentai database baricitinib was then further selected based on its relatively mild side-effects and the feasibility to achieve effective concentrations in the blood in addition baricitinib can also bind to cyclin g-related kinases which also regulate receptor-mediated endocytosis the immunosuppressive function of baricitinib might also be of benefit to the hyperactive immune status in severe cases of covid-19 where immune-mediated lung injury and ards might occurruxolitinib another oral jak1 and jak2 inhibitor approved specifically for the treatment of myelofibrosis has been used for the treatment of shlh ruxolitinib was shown to rapidly improve respiratory liver and haemodynamic function in an 11-year-old boy with refractory hlh53 and to substantially improve serum ferritin lactate dehydrogenase fibrinogen and liver function in a 38-year-old female patient with refractory epstein-barr virus-related shlh54 an open-label clinical trial55 showed that ruxolitinib was well tolerated and manageable for treating shlh with symptoms and cytopenias improved in all n5 patients within the first week of ruxolitinib treatment concentrations of ferritin soluble il-2 receptor and stat1 phosphorylation were also reduced after the administration of ruxolitinib55 animal studies showed that inhibition of jak1 and jak2 using ruxolitinib improved weight loss organomegaly anaemia thrombocytopenia hypercytokinaemia and tissue inflammation in animal models of both primary hlh and shlh by reducing stat1-dependent cd8 t-cell expansion56
considering the similar hyperinflammatory nature of shlh and severe covid-19 jak1 and jak2 inhibitors such as baricitinib and ruxolitinib could be potential treatments for the hyperinflammation seen in covid-1950 several registered rcts are evaluating the efficacy of ruxolitinib and baricitinib in the treatment of covid-19 appendix p 2chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine initially used as antimalarial drugs have been widely used in several infectious hiv q fever and fungal infections rheumatological systemic lupus erythematosus antiphospholipid antibody syndrome rheumatoid arthritis and sjogrens syndrome and other immunological diseases57 the mechanism of action of hydroxychloroquine is diverse and includes anti-inflammatory action immune regulation anti-infection anti-tumour metabolic regulation and anti-thrombosis chloroquine has been shown to have anti-coronavirus effects in vitro based on this and the immunoregulatory actions of these drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were proposed in the treatment of covid-19 these drugs increase the endosomal ph required for sars-cov-2 endocytosis and cell fusion figure
 chloroquine also interferes with the glycosylation of ace2 which is required for virus attachment to host cells58 chloroquine was first reported in 2020 to be a potent inhibitor of covid-19 using an in vitro sars-cov-2-infected vero-e6 cell culture model59
hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine that has similar pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action as chloroquine but substantially fewer side-effects60 compared with other immunosuppressant drugs such as methotrexate the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine is associated with a reduced risk of infection even with chronic use61 62 therefore hydroxychloroquine is more commonly used in patients with rheumatic diseases and other conditions hydroxychloroquine has been used to treat hiv-1 in humans as early as the 1990s in a randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial of 40 asymptomatic patients with hiv-1 800 mgd hydroxychloroquine treatment for 8 weeks reduced the plasma concentration of hiv-1 rna preserved cd4 t-cell counts and proliferative responses and lowered serum il-6 concentrations compared with the placebo group63 although it takes 13 months for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to fully take effect in patients with rheumatic disease the drugs anti-viral effect is relatively rapid hydroxychloroquine treatment as short as 3 days was shown to accelerate virus clearance in patients with covid-19 and azithromycin reinforced the anti-viral effect64 there are a number of ongoing clinical trials testing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in covid-19 appendix pp 25 although a recent randomised trial has shown that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might improve pneumonia symptoms laboratory tests and decrease the progression to severe or critical conditions65 other studies reported either no benefits66 67 68 or hazardous effects after chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine treatment69notably treatment in patients with covid-19 might cause cardiotoxicity especially when used at a high dose70 71 therefore results from ongoing trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in covid-19glucocorticoids and their synthetic analogues have been widely used in rheumatic disease to control autoimmune response72 due to their rapid immunosuppressive effect glucocorticoids are frequently used in hyperinflammatory syndromes such as ards in patients with ards glucocorticoid treatment improves oxygen saturation inflammatory markers icu length of stay and ventilator-free days although its effect on mortality was not consistent between trials73 74 75 in coronavirus disease inflammation-induced lung injury and ards are associated with adverse outcomes26 76 histological investigations showed severe lung inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage in patients with coronavirus disease7 77 therefore corticosteroids are commonly used in severe cases of coronavirus disease including sars mers and covid-19 to control immune-mediated damage of lung tissue27 30 78 79 however clinical evidence has not supported a beneficial effect of glucocorticoids in coronavirus illness in a retrospective study79 of 309 critically ill patients with mers after statistical adjustment for time-varying confounders corticosteroid therapy was not significantly associated with improved 90-day mortality and resulted in delayed clearance of the mers coronavirus rna in a systematic review of sars treatments that included 29 studies with cortiocosteroid use 25 studies were inconclusive with regards to the effect of corticosteroid in sars and four reported corticosteroids as causing possible harm therefore high-quality rcts are needed to provide conclusive evidenceleflunomide is a low-molecular weight synthetic oral anti-rheumatic drug the mechanism of its action includes inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis inhibition of protein tyrosine stimulation inhibition of nuclear factor kappa beta and anti-tumour effects80 81 82 83 leflunomide has been widely used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis84 and due to its immunosuppressive function the drug is also used in organ transplantation85 another important function of leflunomide is that it inhibits virus replication in vitro studies have shown that the active metabolite of leflunomide a77 1726 protects umbilical cord epithelial cells and fibroblasts from infection with human cytomegalovirus80 86 electron microscopy revealed that the morphology of virions in the cytoplasm was abnormal and the assembly of virus particles could not be completed in cytomegalovirus-infected cells treated with a77 1726 indicating that leflunomide interferes with the assembly of virus capsid80 in a study87 of 17 patients with cytomegalovirus disease 88 15 of the patients clinically responded to leflunomide therapy 3 doses of 100 mgday followed by 20 mgdaya dose that maintains blood concentrations of 2550 ngml with viral clearance from blood and healing of involved organs therefore leflunomide is effective for treatment of cytomegalovirus disease88
the anti-viral efficacy of leflunomide has also been observed in transplant recipients infected with bk virus89 and human papillomavirus hpv90 in patients with polyomavirus type bk nephropathy those that had blood a77 1726 concentrations higher than 40 gml had either cleared the virus or showed progressive reductions of viral load in blood and urine89 in another study90 leflunomide successfully cleared verrucae vulgaris and molluscum lesions in four renal transplant patients with cutaneous warts usually caused by hpv however it is worth noting that leflunomide has been associated with interstitial lung disease91 92 leflunomide-associated interstitial lung disease usually occurs within the first 20 weeks of leflunomide initiation there was a high mortality in patients with pre-existing interstitial lung disease diffuse alveolar damage or ground glass shadowing on high resolution ct91 the exact mechanism remains unclear but the presence of pre-existing interstitial lung disease cigarette smoking low bodyweight and the use of methotrexate are risk factors for leflunomide-induced interstitial lung disease92 it remains unclear if leflunomide would improve or exacerbate the pulmonary lesions in patients with covid-19 there is currently one clinical trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral leflunomide tablets against pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 appendix p 2another dmard thalidomide which has both anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activity has also been used in viral infections animal studies have shown that thalidomide inhibits lung injury in mouse models of h1n1 influenza virus infection with improved survival reduced inflammatory cell infiltration reduced concentrations of cytokines il-6 and tnf and chemokines rantes and ip-10 and reduced nuclear factor kappa beta activity93 it was concluded that thalidomide could be an alternative treatment when new influenza viruses emerge especially before new vaccines are developed a uk study94 indicated that thalidomide has immunomodulatory and immune remodelling effects by inhibiting tnf another critical cytokine in covid-19-associated lung injury in addition some studies have shown that thalidomide can treat pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and combat cytokine storm95 96 these studies indicate a potential therapeutic value of thalidomide in viral infection in a case report97 a 45-year-old female patient with severe covid-19 and elevated concentrations of circulating cytokines including il-6 il-10 and ifn on admission was treated with oral thalidomide 100 mg once a day and low-dose methylprednisolone 40 mg intravenously every 12 h for 3 days and then 40 mg intravenously once a day for 5 days due to the severity of clinical manifestations and lack of response to other treatments the patients clinical condition including oxygen index fever nausea and vomiting resolved within 1 week after thalidomide treatment concentrations of il-6 il-10 and ifn all returned to normal range after 6 days of treatment sars-cov-2 tests in swab specimens were negative after 1 week of treatment and lung lesions disappeared 12 days after treatment97 although this is a single case it could provide some useful insight for further clinical investigation there are two clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic potential of thalidomide in patients with moderate or severe covid-19 appendix p 2there are also many other immune-modulating strategies under clinical investigation for the treatment of covid-19 such as stem-cell therapy and convalescent plasma treatment mesenchymal stem cells mscs are of increased importance in inflammatory disease due to their anti-inflammatory properties animal experiments showed that msc treatment was able to reduce influenza a h5n1-induced acute lung injury in vivo98 stem cells are able to suppress the activities of viruses via chaf1a-mediated and sumo2-mediated epigenetic regulation termed proviral silencing99 several phase 1 and 2 clinical trials have confirmed the safety of msc therapy in patients with ards and have shown beneficial effects100 101 however several issues have limited msc use in clinic such as the lack of clarity with regard to optimal dose and route of msc delivery difficulties in large-scale production and cryopreservation and the potential for substantial variability there are several ongoing clinical trials testing the efficacy of msc in covid-19 appendix pp 56convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from sars-cov-2 infection has also been proposed as a potential treatment for covid-19 convalescent plasma has been used in many severe infections such as sars mers and ebola as one of the few therapeutic strategies in the absence of vaccines or other specific treatments102 the efficacy of such therapy especially in covid-19 is being evaluated in ongoing trials appendix p 6sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly since it first emerged in december 2019 and covid-19 is characterised as a pandemic by who as a new emerging virus there is no approved effective drug or vaccine as of april 16 2020 several existing drugs are being repurposed for the treatment of patients with covid-19 with dozens of ongoing clinical trials assessing their potential efficacy dmards due to their immune-modulating nature could be a potential treatment option for severe covid-19 however there are several issues that need to be taken into consideration first the issue of hyperinflammation versus viral replication although effective anti-viral immunity is required for the clearance of pathogens hyperactivation of immune response causes tissue damage and organ failure similarly there are two sides of immunomodulation therapy in covid-19 and clinicians should determine in which circumstance to use such medications second there are questions about the timing for immunomodulation therapy as noted immunosuppressants could affect anti-viral immune response and the timing should be carefully considered although early intervention is considered as a key factor for the success of immunomodulation therapy in infection-associated hyperinflammation103 direct evidence from rcts are required to determine the appropriate timing for patients with covid-19 finally the pharmacokinetics of oral medications in crucially ill patients merit consideration as physiological alterations in these patients can substantially affect the pharmacokinetics some drugs will need to be given parenterally due to gastrointestinal failure eg chloroquine has been used parenterally to treat severely ill patients with malaria although it is absorbed reliably in these patients104 compared with the oral route parenteral administration of chloroquine results in rapid absorption and transient high plasma concentrations which is associated with increased risk of acute toxicity105 in addition impaired clearance of the drugs might be problematic in patients with hepatic dysfunction and renal failure therefore smaller and more frequent doses continuous intravenous infusion or choosing a less toxic drug eg using hydroxychloroquine instead of chloroquine should be considered in patients who are severely ill104 105 the many ongoing trials will hopefully provide a better understanding of the potential effects of immunomodulation therapy on covid-19-associated hyperinflammation
two reviewers independently did a computerised literature search of pubmed ovid and web of science using the terms covid-19 or sars-cov-2 or 2019-ncov dmards or immunosuppressant or immunomodulation or anti-rheumatic drugs or immunotherapy and a combination thereof in english language we incorporated published and unpublished articles including preprint articles into this review from december 30 2019 to april 16 2020 we included publications cited in the papers when relevant we also referred to related scientific reports such as the official website of who and the chinese health organisation
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov1 2 3 4 5 6 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov7 8 9 cause severe pneumonia in humans currently no vaccines or therapeutics are licensed for use against these coronaviruses the spike s protein of coronaviruses binds to cellular receptors and mediates membrane fusion for cell entry10 11 12 antibodies against s protein can block virus binding and fusion and neutralize virus infection13 14 15 16 17 18 thus the s protein is a candidate vaccine target for blocking coronavirus infection11 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 however some animal studies have suggested that insufficient protective immunity against sarscov may induce an eosinophilic immunopathology in the lungs after the infection27 28 29
enhanced lung eosinophilic immunopathology became a problem in the 1960s when a formalininactivated respiratory syncytial virus firsv vaccine combined with alum adjuvant was injected intramuscularly into children to immunize them against rsv30 31 32 this outcome resulted in increased mortality due to enhanced respiratory disease upon subsequent rsv infection in immunized children this increased mortality is thought to be due to a skewing of the immune response toward a th2 response with enhanced eosinophil infiltration in addition the production of nonprotective antibodies in response to the firsv vaccine may have been due to poor tolllike receptor tlr stimulation33 in a previous study we showed that a uvinactivated sarscov vaccine induced a strong th2skewed immune response and that tlr agonists could limit the development of a lung eosinophilic immunopathology34
in this study we produced a recombinant tagged protein containing the ectodomain of the sarscov s protein via a baculovirus expression system we then evaluated the efficacy of the vaccine and its potential to induce a lung eosinophilic immunopathology in our murine sars model35 the recombinant s proteininduced antibodies protected against sarscov infection however a lung eosinophilic immunopathology was observed in the lungs of immunized mice after sars infection thus even with the s protein vaccine an adjuvant is required to prevent lung eosinophilic immunopathology following sarscov infectionnanoparticlebased vaccines have been expected to improve vaccine efficacy immunization strategies and targeted delivery to promote immune responses36 37 38 gold nanoparticles aunps have become the choice for immunotherapy applications because their physicochemical properties prevent antibody production against the platform material36 39 furthermore some in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that various immune cells including macrophages dendritic cells and lymphocytes are stimulated by aunps leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines ie il1 and tnf and th1 cytokines ifn and il240 thus in this study we evaluated two kinds of vaccine adjuvants including aunps which are expected to function as both an antigen carrier and an adjuvant in immunization and tlr agonists which have previously been shown to function as an adjuvant to increase the efficacy of an ultraviolet uvinactivated sarscov vaccine34

eosinophil counts and multiplex assay results were analyzed using oneway or twoway analysis of variance anova tukeys multiple comparisons test was used to compare the results from each group the results of the antibody titer assays were analyzed using nonparametric tests that is dunns multiple comparisons test following the kruskalwallis test a value of p  005 was considered statistically significanta recombinant tagged protein that included the ectodomain of the sarscov s protein was generated using a baculovirus expression system the s protein of sarscov contains a large aminoterminal ectodomain and a short carboxyterminal endodomain bridged with a hydrophobic transmembrane domain figure 1a the ectodomain of the s protein is extensively glycosylated with nlinked glycosylation and has been reported to be important for interactions with receptors on the surface of host cells14 47 in addition to avoid insoluble protein expression caused by numerous hydrophobic amino acids the transmembrane domain including the carboxyterminal endodomain was removed from the recombinant spike protein figure 1a higher expression was obtained from a construct encoding a recombinant sarscov s protein containing a strep8x histag at the carboxyl terminus compared with that obtained from an 8x histagged construct after purification of the recombinant tagged protein from culture supernatant via gel filtration chromatography the identity of the recombinant protein with an expected molecular weight of 135 kda was confirmed via sdspage and western blotting figure 1bto confirm the immunogenicity of the recombinant sarscov s protein purified protein was used for immunization into balbc mice groups of 67 mice were immunized with different amounts of recombinant s protein 10 05 01 or 005 g per immunization and then challenged with mouseadapted sarscov two weeks after the second immunization with the sarscov s protein the dosedependency of the antigenspecific igg production was assessed in all the immunized mice figure 2a approximately 6 weeks after the second immunization all the mice 12 weeks old at the time of the challenge were intranasally inoculated with mouseadapted sarscov nonimmunized animals showed body weight reductions of approximately 17 compared with the initial body weight and four of six mice were moribund and were euthanized within 5 days postinoculation dpi figure 2b two animals were fully recovered by 6 dpi on the other hand all of the immunized animals showed body weight loss within 2 dpi and the animals in the 10 and 05 g immunized groups had recovered by 4 dpi however three of seven mice in the 01 g immunized group and three of six in the 005 g immunized group did not recover and were moribund animals that survived had recovered fully by 5 or 6 dpi in summary all the 10 and 05 gimmunized mice survived the infection with a lethal dose of mouseadapted sarscov while the mice in the 01 and 005 g immunization groups did not figure 2c three of seven mice in the 01 g immunized group and three out of six in the 005 gimmunized group were moribund and were euthanized within 6 dpi no animals were killed before meeting the criteria for euthanasiain addition we found eosinophilic infiltrations around the bronchioles in the lungs from almost all the immunized mice 10 days after the challenge infection with sarscov figure 3ab from our previous work with a uvinactivated sarscov immunization model we speculated that insufficient immunization with the recombinant s protein induced the eosinophil infiltration in the lungs upon infection with mouseadapted sarscov in this balbc mouse model34 therefore we next investigated the efficacy of vaccine adjuvantswe examined the effects of two types of vaccine adjuvants aunps which are used as antigen carriers and adjuvants for subunit vaccines the saunpimmunized group and tlr agonists the stlrimmunized group the recombinant s protein was used at 01 gmouse for immunizationconjugation of s protein to aunps was confirmed by detecting changes in the diameter of the aunps after bspp coating and s protein binding by dls table 1 then the optimal aunp concentration was determined by measuring the virusspecific ig g response uvinactivated sarscov was used as the elisa antigen after the second immunization stable results were obtained when 01 g s protein  2 fmol aunps were used to immunize balbc mice figure 4ab we also evaluated the influence of the diameter of the aunps on animal immunization the effects of the size and shape of the aunps on the immunological response was previously evaluated in a study of west nile virus envelope protein wnve protein39 the wnve proteincoated 40 nm spherical aunps induced sufficient levels of wnvespecific antibodies the wnv particle is around 40 nm in diameter we evaluated 100 nm spherical aunps with a modified sarscov particle ranging from 50 to 200 nm in diameter48 animal experiments revealed that there were no differences in the igg response when spherical aunps with diameters between 40 and 100 nm were used for the immunization figure 4c we used 01 g s protein with 2 fmol of 40 nm aunps in the following experimentsthe amount of protein on the aunps was quantified via western blot analysis after adsorption of s protein to aunps figure 4d we calculated the ratio of the amount of aunpbound protein to the amount of free protein in the saunp solution via chemiluminescencebased western blotting images were captured using an las 4000 luminoimage analyzer fujifilm and then analyzed using the imagequant tl software ge healthcare the percentage of protein bound to the aunps was 283  59 five experiments in addition the structure of the saunps was examined by transmission electron microscopy figure 4e which confirmed s protein binding to the aunps and the presence of free s protein in solutionwe next evaluated the efficacies of the adjuvants we used 13weekold mice for immunization and these animals were 18 weeks old at the time of the challenge infection two weeks after the second immunization the levels of antigenspecific igg were measured in all the immunized groups and the levels were significantly higher in both the saunp and stlrimmunized groups compared with that in the s proteinimmunized group figure 5a we also confirmed virusspecific seroconversion in these mice when uvinactivated sarscov was used as an elisa antigen all the stlrimmunized mice showed significantly higher titers of virusspecific igg which were low in the saunpimmunized mice figure 5b similar results were obtained from the neutralizing antibody analysis figure 5cthree weeks after the second immunization all the animals were intranasally inoculated with sarscov n  6 or 7 within 2 dpi all the mice showed ruffled fur and body weight loss and all the nonimmunized animals showed body weight reductions of more than 20 and were moribund within 5 dpi n  6 figure 5de two mice died of pulmonary edema before meeting the criteria for euthanasia all the stlrimmunized mice recovered within 4 dpi however four of seven of the saunpimmunized mice and two of six of the s proteinimmunized mice were moribund within 6 dpi figure 5de four mice in the saunp and s proteinimmunized groups died of pulmonary edema before meeting the criteria for euthanasiafrom these results it was clear that saunp immunization induced high levels of antigenspecific igg but weak production of virusspecific igg and neutralizing antibodies against sarscov thus the protective ability of the saunp vaccine was lower than that of the stlr vaccinehistopathological investigation revealed that eosinophilic infiltrations occurred in the lungs of both s protein and saunpimmunized mice but not in the lungs of the animals in the stlrimmunized group at 10 dpi figure 6 we also investigated the histopathology of mice pretreated with aunps but no eosinophil infiltration was observed after sarscov infection aunps in figure 6abwe next used mouse lung homogenates to investigate the viral kinetics and immune reaction on days 1 3 and 5 pi the virus titers were initially low and then decreased in the lungs of the stlrimmunized mice and the others showed approximately equal titers figure 7a high levels of type 1 interferon ifn4 and ifn were detected in the lungs of nonimmunized mice but lower or delayed responses were observed in the animals in the s protein and saunpimmunized groups no response was detected in the animals in the stlrimmunized group figure 7bwe also investigated the cytokine and chemokine responses in the lungs figure 8 the levels of proinflammatory cytokines including il12p40 il1 il1 tnf and gmcsf were elevated at 1 dpi in the control mice the vaccinated mice showed moderate induction of these proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines the levels of il6 and kc were only elevated in the control mice at 3 dpi the levels of several macrophagerelated chemokines mcp1 mip1 and ip10 were higher in the control s protein and saunpimmunized mice at 3 dpi than in the stlrimmunized mice rantes was induced at 1 dpi in the control s protein and saunpimmunized mice but was delayed in the stlrimmunized mice th1 cytokine production and il10 responses following il2 and ifn induction were observed in the s protein and saunpimmunized mice on day 3 pi a high production of allergic inflammationrelated cytokines and other chemokines including il4 il5 and eotaxin was observed in the s protein and saunpimmunized mice within 5 dpi in addition the levels of il13 were higher in the s protein and saunpimmunized mice than in the control and stlrimmunized mice significant differences in the levels of il1 mip1 il2 ifn and il4 were detected in the s protein and saunpimmunized mice the stlrimmunized mice showed higher levels of gmcsf on day 3 pi and il17 within 5 dpi compared with the respective levels in the other immunized groups other cytokine and chemokine responses were moderate or absent in the stlrimmunized miceoverall each group of mice showed different types of immune responses in the lungs during the early phase of sarscov infection nonimmunized mice showed a proinflammatory response during the early phase of infection the s and saunpimmunized mice showed th1 and th2 responses accompanied by allergic inflammation th1 and th17biased cytokine induction was observed in the stlrimmunized micein the development of vaccine candidates against coronavirus infection subunit vaccines viral vector vaccines and dna vaccines targeting the viral s protein have been shown to be very effective in vivo11 19 21 23 25 26 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 subunit vaccines are considered highly safe products because they use antigenic components without the need to introduce viral particles56 furthermore it is possible to induce cellular and humoral immune responses and hightiter neutralizing antibodies when antigens are combined with appropriate adjuvants26 56 researchers have previously produced recombinant baculovirusexpressed sarscov s protein and showed that it could be used to induce a high production of neutralizing antibodies in mice22 26 however lung eosinophilic immunopathology was not evaluated in these studieshondaokubo et al reported that immunization with a commercial recombinant s protein nr722 protein science corp meriden ct which is produced in insect cells with or without alum adjuvant resulted in lung eosinophilic immunopathology after sarscov infection intramuscularly twice with 10 g s protein28 they succeeded in avoiding the immunopathology induced by the vaccine by combining it with a delta insulinbased polysaccharide adjuvant the adjuvant induced ifn responses suggesting that an inadequate vaccineinduced th1 response caused the lung eosinophilic immunopathology28 this was also observed previously by agrawal et al who reported that inactivated merscov vaccination leads to a lung eosinophilic immunopathology and il5 and il13 production upon live virus challenge in transgenic mice bearing the human cd26dpp4 receptor57 severe pneumonia related coronaviruses such as sarscov and merscov could induce the same pathologyin this study we explored the potential of aunps for use as an adjuvant to promote immune responses with balanced effects on th1 and th2 tcell immunity36 39 40 aunps stimulate macrophages dendritic cells and lymphocytes after induction of proinflammatory cytokine ie il1 and tnf and th1 cytokine ie ifn and il2 expression40 niikura et al demonstrated that aunpadjuvanted west nile virus e protein 10 g showed high antigenicity in mice and induced inflammatory cytokine production including tnf il6 il12 and gmcsf by antigenpresenting cells in vitro39 indeed aunpadjuvanted s protein induced strong igg responses to s protein itself in this study however it failed to induce protective immune responses and to limit eosinophilic infiltrations after virus challenge one explanation for the failure to induce protective immune responses could be that structural changes in s protein upon binding to the aunp adjuvant resulted in sbinding iggs that were unable to neutralize the virus58 aunps and s protein bind together via electrostatic interactions and sprotein forms a protein corona around aunps59 60 indeed both the dls and tem structure analysis indicated that the conjugated s protein on aunps formed a protein corona which is considered to result in structural changes in adsorbed proteins59 for adaptation to the nanoparticle surface and surrounding environment61 the protein secondary structure is strongly affected by the surface charge of aunps62 the particle surface of a protein corona defines the biological identity of the particle when it is attached to the cell surface in vivo58 59 thus even a small modification in s protein structure could impact both negatively and positively on its immunogenicity more work will be required to study the mechanisms and to test whether the aunpadjuvanted vaccine is effective against coronavirus infection ie effect of antigen binding methods antigen against the receptor binding sitecytokine and chemokine analysis revealed that each group of mice had different lung immune responses early after sarscov infection while similar virus titers were observed in the lungs of non s protein and saunpimmunized mice type 1 ifn and proinflammatory responses were moderate in both the s protein and saunpimmunized mice after infection type 1 ifns are secreted by infected cells macrophages and dendritic cells to counteract viral infection63 64 type 1 ifns upregulate proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including il1263 the macrophagerelated chemokine responses were similar among the non s protein and saunpimmunized mice however the th1 and th2 responses were higher in the s protein and saunpimmunized mice the cells may also moderate proinflammatory reactions in the animals in these groups interestingly although s proteinimmunized mice showed significant protection against sarscov infection the virus titers remained higher than those in nonimmunized mice in adult mouse models of sarscov infection the excessive host innate immune responses contributing to sarscov lung pathology are complex and involve changes in activated macrophages and neutrophils65 66 67 we previously reported that ifn treatment 3 hr after inoculation protected mice from severe sarscovinduced pulmonary edema that otherwise results in the death of uninoculated adult mice35 however the virus titer in the lungs did not differ between the ifntreated and pbstreated adult mice in this study s proteinimmunized mice showed an ifn response on day 1 pi thus we speculated that ifn induction may contribute to protection against sars in the s protein immunized micethe pbs pretreated challenge control mice showed very slight changes in the bronchi area of the lungs after sarscov infection figures 3a and 6b the pathological changes in sarscovinfected lungs including diffuse alveolar damage were mainly seen in the alveolar area35 however eosinophil infiltrations occurred around middle size blood vessels in the bronchi area thus we demonstrated the bronchi area from animals in these figures whereas small changes ie a few inflammatory cell infiltrations around the blood vessels with edema were observed in the bronchi area of the control mouse the histopathological findings of eosinophil infiltration around the bronchiole on day 10 pi were correlated with a high production of allergic inflammation cytokines that is il13 il4 il5 and eotaxin in both the s protein and saunpimmunized mice these findings suggest that the amount of antibody generated against sarscov was not sufficient to orchestrate immune responses including innate immunity and th2skewed responses during the infectionin this study aunps did not show dose dependency in eliciting immune responses when lowmolecular weight polyics were conjugated with gold nanorods as adjuvants for intranasal hemagglutinin ha influenza vaccination low doses of aunps ie 1 fmol were more effective in reducing virus replication in a nasal wash than 10fold higher doses of gold nanorods ie 10 fmol68 on the other hand mottram et al showed that the nanoparticle size of carboxylmodified polystyrene beads carrying whole ovalbumin influenced the th1 and th2 immune reactions when 4050 nm beads were used to vaccinate mice high ifn induction was observed whereas 93123 nm beads induced il4 production69 although we did not evaluate in detail the influence of the amount and size of aunps the amount and size of aunps should be carefully considered if nanoparticle vaccine platforms are used for the development of coronavirus vaccinesin this study we expressed s protein via a recombinant baculovirus system purification of recombinant sarscov s protein was more effective when expression was from a construct containing a strep8x histag at the s protein carboxyl terminus than when a 8x histagged construct was used the purification was conducted only via his trap purification using affinity chromatography to minimize protein loss after the second immunization with the purified recombinant s protein high igg levels against immunogenspecific igg were detected in the murine sera and they were protective against sarscov infection in vivo subcutaneously twice with 10 or 05 g of s protein the purified protein showed high immunogenicity in balbc mice but did not prevent eosinophilic infiltrationsmice of different ages were used in this study young adult mice 6 or 7weekold female were used to confirm the immunogenicity of recombinant s protein and saunp and adult mice 13 weeks old challenged at 17 weeks old were used for the challenge experiment there were significant differences in the levels of the virusspecific igg titer in mice immunized with 01 g of saunp between figures 4a and 5b we speculate that the difference could be due to differences in the ages of the mice employed in these experiments in general young adult around 6 weeks old mice show more robust immune responses than old mice and the robustness of the immune response decreases with age70 in addition the intervals between the first immunization and the timepoints of sera collection were different we conducted a minimum dose immunization of adult balbc mice with the s protein subcutaneously twice with 01 g s protein a total of 01 g of tlr agonistadjuvanted s protein induced a sufficiently high expression of neutralizing antibodies and prevented the eosinophilic infiltrations after sarscov infection induction of gmcsf rantes il10 il2 mig and il17 but not type 1 ifn expression was detected in the lungs of stlrimmunized mice that had sufficient antiviral antibodies interestingly only the stlrimmunized mice showed high levels of il17 within 5 dpi suggesting that a th17 response occurred in the lungs during sarscov infection in the presence of neutralizing antibodies interestingly a th1th17 bias in cytokine induction was also observed in a study of sarscov s protein when delta inulin was used as an adjuvant28 the activation of specific tcell subsets by adjuvants may be critical to ensure vaccine efficacy and eosinophilic immunopathology upon sarscov infectionoverall aunpadjuvanted s protein induced an antigenspecific igg response but failed to induce a protective antibody and limit eosinophilic infiltration in the lungs on the other hand the tlr agonists successfully minimized the amount of recombinant s protein required for the vaccination to 01 g and increased vaccine immunogenicity and reduced eosinophilic infiltration in the lungs after the sarscov challenge infection in our mouse model to prevent insufficient immunization against sarscov even with an s proteinbased vaccine appropriate adjuvant development is needed the findings of this study will support the development of vaccines not only against sarscov infection but also against other severe pneumoniarelated coronaviruses likely including merscovthe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interestin december 2019 a group case of unexplained pneumonia occurred in wuhan hubei province china1 with the spread of the epidemic cases have consecutively appeared in other parts of china and abroad on april 10 2020 the number of countries involved has tripled with 1521252 cases worldwide and 85054 deaths2 the epidemic has resulted in serious negative effects on health and socioeconomic development on march 11 2020 who declared covid-19 as a pandemic3 the agent of the disease is a novel coronavirus on february 11 2020 the international committee on virus classification officially termed the virus sars-cov-2 it was formerly temporarily named 2019-ncov and the disease caused by novel coronavirus was termed corona virus disease 2019 covid-19 pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus was uniformly named novel coronavirus pneumonia by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china the virus is the seventh member of envelope rna coronavirus sarbecovirus subgenus coronavirus subfamily novel coronavirus belongs to novel coronavirus of  genus with enveloped round or oval particles often pleomorphic and 60140 nm in diameter4 novel coronavirus is most similar to bat sars-like coronavirus from the chinese chrysanthemum-headed bat with nucleotide homology of 84 78 and 50 with bat sars-like coronavirus human sars virus and mers virus respectively5 the most primitive host of novel coronavirus is the chinese chrysanthemum-headed bat6 diseases are caused by spread from pangolin hosts to humans of the first 41 confirmed cases 27 reported contact with the south china seafood market1 therefore at present it is believed that the original source of novel coronavirus was the south china seafood market in wuhan and the source of infection was patients infected by novel coronavirus further asymptomatic infections and incubation periods are considered potential sources of infection7 the route of transmission is droplet contact aerosol fecal-oral andor mother-to-child transmission812 the average incubation period was 52 days and the basic regeneration number r0 in the early stage of the epidemic was 2213 clinical symptoms include fever cough myalgia or fatigue atypical symptoms include expectoration headache hemoptysis and diarrhea approximately half of patients have dyspnea complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome acute heart injury and secondary infection1 chest ct revealed that the most common radiological manifestations on admission were ground glass shadow and bilateral patchy shadow14 novel coronavirus cases are often complicated with high risk of cerebrovascular diseases such as cardio-cerebrovascular disease hypertension and diabetes15 or death occurring mainly in elderly and chronically ill patients16 according to the influence of novel coronavirus on cerebrovascular disease and the clinical manifestations of covid-19 patients this paper expounds on the pathophysiological hypothesis of covid-19 s effect on cerebrovascular diseasebased on the current epidemiological data people of all ages are generally susceptible to novel coronavirus the latest findings published in the chinese journal of epidemiology are based on the findings of 72314 cases of covid-1917 the majority of confirmed cases are between the ages of 30 to 79 years 866 mainly middle-aged and elderly individuals the proportion of patients with hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease is 128 53 and 42 respectively indicating that middle-aged and elderly individuals with chronic diseases may be more likely to be infected compared with healthy individuals stroke patients are mainly middle-aged and elderly individuals with a higher proportion of diseases such as hypertension and diabetes thus the elderly individuals with chronic diseases and individuals with poor resistance may be more susceptible to infection a recent study on the clinical characteristics of 138 patients with novel coronavirus infection in wuhan15 revealed that the median age was 56 years old with a higher proportion of middle-aged and elderly people of cases 64 were complicated with underlying diseases including 14 cases of diabetes 43 cases of hypertension 27 cases of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases and 10 cases of cancer this study demonstrated that elderly patients with cerebrovascular diseases and risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes may be at the highest risk of infection zhong nanshans team reported that the median age of critical recombination was 52 years old and that of the non-critical group was 45 years old males accounted for 5810 females accounted for 4190 and patients under 15 years old accounted for 09 suggesting that the rate of infection is higher in males than in females and infection in children is rare approximately a quarter of patients have hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease and other diseases further the proportion of patients with smoking history is less than 1518 collectively these data suggest that the elderly with cerebrovascular diseases may be more infectious than other groups when these patients were admitted to the hospital only 431 of the patients had a fever and more patients presented with a fever while in hospital conversely almost all patients with sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers both caused by coronavirus had symptoms of fever at the time of diagnosis and only 12 of the patients had no fever the case fatality rate of covid-19 is lower than that of sars and mers covid-19 is associated with a mortality rate of approximately 211 the case fatality rates of sars and mers were 96 and 34 respectively1920 the study reported that elderly patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases diabetes and hypertension had a higher case fatality rate than other populations blackburn et al21 reported that respiratory virus infection is associated with an increased risk of stroke in hospitalized stroke patients the existing studies suggest that novel coronavirus is not conducive to the prognosis of patients with cerebrovascular diseases and special attention should be paid to changes in their clinical conditionhematological reports of covid-19 patients often include counts of white blood cells and neutrophils and high c-reactive protein common complications include the presence of inflammatory reactions covid-19 patients with cerebrovascular diseases often present with complications such as hypertension diabetes hyperlipidemia and other stroke risk factors these risk factors are associated with pro-inflammatory changes including leukocyte activation and cerebrovascular thrombosis under inflammatory stimulation inflammatory cells begin to accumulate in the vascular wall in the early stage of atherosclerosis increase blood-brain barrier permeability destroy brain cells and activate the formation of atherosclerosis in the anterior and internal cerebral arteries endothelial dysfunction affects the automatic regulation of cerebral circulation these processes may lead to plaque rupture and thrombosis increasing the risk of stroke inflammatory markers such as leukocytes fibrinogen and c-reactive protein are independent predictors of ischemic stroke22 long-term chronic infection can increase the risk of stroke in a casecontrol study23 acute infection in the previous week was reported to be a trigger for ischemic stroke acute and aggravated chronic infections may play a role by activating blood clotting and chronic infection and may lead to atherosclerosis inflammatory reactions in patients with covid-19 may be a critical common determinant of atherosclerosis and stroke riskwhen an individual is infected with novel coronavirus individuals with immune function may experience excessive systemic immune responses and even die of acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock24 this mechanism is termed immunopathogenicity in which the virus stimulates immunity and causes the immune system to attack itself currently it is critical to avoid excessive immune responses in the whole body as well as improve the immune function of individuals with weak immunity cytokine storm is an over-activation of the immune system caused by infection which leads to massive accumulation and exudation of inflammatory substances leading to multiple organ failure and acute respiratory distress this may be an important cause of death in severe and critical patients with covid-1925 accumulating evidence suggests that severe covid-19 patients might present with cytokine storm syndrome26 although the symptoms of most patients with coronavirus infection are mild at present some patients present with milder symptoms in the early stage which rapidly worsen in the later stage these patients eventually die of multiple organ failure which is mainly due to the cytokine storm cytokines include interferon ifn interleukin il chemokine chemokines colony stimulating factor csf and tumor necrosis factor tnf which are secreted by immune cells cytokines can have either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects when sars swept through china in 2003 the cytokine storm was also a direct cause of death in many patients27 in 2009 excessive inflammation was observed in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by h1n1a infection28 the toxicity of the virus depends on the severity of the induced immune response however different viruses trigger cytokine storms via various mechanisms as such they cause different cytokine changes for example sars-related cytokine storms are mainly related to interleukin il-1 il6 il12 interferon ifn-  inducible protein ip-10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-129 in contrast cytokine storms caused by mers coronavirus are mainly associated with ifn  tumour necrosis factor tnf-  il15 and il1730 in the above-mentioned study doctors at wuhan zhongnan hospital observed that the blood levels of il2 il7 il10 granulocyte colony stimulating factor gscf mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein mip-1 and tnf- in critically ill patients were significantly increased suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity1 low levels of cd4t and cd8t and higher levels of il-6 and il-10 were observed in severe patients in this regard t cell subsets and cytokines are positively correlated with the severity of covid-2019 symptoms31on january 25 the lancet published an online paper on novel coronavirus32 coronavirus shows neuroinvasive characteristics secondary to peripheral organ replication in humans and animals the invasion of the blood-brain barrier by coronavirus is related to the destruction of tight junctions of brain microvascular endothelial cells induced by coronavirus which leads to blood-brain barrier dysfunction and enhanced blood-brain barrier permeability33 researchers detected sars-cov nucleic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with sars34 after invading brain tissue sars virus attracts cd68 monocytesmacrophages and cd3t lymphocytes to infected tissues through mixed cells to participate in the immune process however a large number of cytokineschemokines are released after a viral infection which induces an inflammatory cascade reaction and promotes atherosclerosis plaque rupture and thrombosis35 toll-like receptor tlr is activated after coronavirus infection which plays an important role in the mechanism of innate immunity and can promote atherosclerosis and accelerate the occurrence of ischemic stroke936 cytokine cascade aggravates ischemic brain damage and increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage after tissue plasminogen activator treatment37 il-6 can contribute to increased probability of a thrombotic event induction of platelet production and promotion of plaque disruption38angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is the cellular receptor for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 the spike protein s1 interacts with the host ace2 receptor for adherence of viral particles to the cell membrane3941 in sars ace2 signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of severe lung failure after viral infection42 ace2 is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells heart kidney liver digestive tract and other organs43 tissues and organs expressing ace2 may be sites of interaction between novel coronavirus and immune cells ace2 is a negative regulator of renin-angiotensin system ras which can balance many functions of ace by targeting angiotensin ii ang ii ace2 shows protective effects in the cardiovascular system and many other organs44 ace2 deficiency impaired endothelial function in cerebral arteries in adult mice and augmented endothelial dysfunction during aging45 indicating that ace2 provides endothelial protection ace2 inactivates ang ii while generating angiotensin ang 17 and exerts potent vasodilator effects via activation of the mas receptor46ace2 is an important metabolic enzyme in ras which plays a central role in maintaining heart and brain homeostasis46 sars-cov infections and spike protein of sars-cov reduce ace2 expression47 a decrease in ace2 is associated with a decrease in ang 1-7 which has vasoprotective effects the balance between the classical ras ace-ang ii-angiotensin 1 receptor at1r regulatory axis and the ace2-ang 1-7-masr counter-regulatory axis in the ras system is disturbed leading to higher ang ii levels in the blood angii levels in covid-19 patients are markedly elevated and linearly associated with viral load and lung injury48 ang ii stimulates nuclear factor- b nf-b activation in human monocytes nf-b participates in most signaling pathways involved in inflammation of atherosclerosis which may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis49angiotensin 17 stimulates mas receptors to promote angiogenesis in brain tissue inhibit oxidative stress resist neuroinflammation improve cerebral blood flow and resist apoptosis50 therefore ace2 as a target receptor can inhibit the beneficial effects of the ras system in the brain due to ace2 involvement in blood pressure regulation a subset of hypertensive patients with covid-19 may present with an abnormal increase in blood pressure and increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage in addition critically ill patients with covid-19 are often associated with severe thrombocytopenia which may be risk factors for acute cerebrovascular events in these patients therefore we assume that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors acei and at1r inhibitors may be used to reduce pulmonary inflammation and mortality in patients with covid-19 pneumonia under conditions of controlled blood pressure5152 however experiments in animals revealed that acei and angiotensin receptor blockers increase the number of ace2 receptors in the cardiopulmonary circulation which increases the risk of severe disease outcomes53clinical studies have demonstrated that blood of covid-19 patients contained higher levels of d-dimer and prolonged prothrombin time15 reflecting a hypercoagulable state of blood pulmonary infection is related to platelet aggregation and activation of the coagulation system54 significantly increased levels of d-dimer in severe covid-19 patients were observed5556 indicating that a hypercoagulable state may be an important marker of critical illness in covid-19 patients a clinical study demonstrated that anticoagulant therapy may be associated with superior prognosis in severe covid-19 patients with markedly elevated d-dimer levels57 decreased blood oxygen saturation leads to the release of inflammatory factors58 one possible explanation for the increase in blood coagulability is that a decrease in blood oxygen triggers inflammatory factors catecholamine increased plasma levels of tissue factors and platelet aggregation which alter capillary blood flow due to increased sympathetic activity and more widespread micro-endothelial damage resulting in blood coagulability59 if covid-19 patients remain in a prolonged state of hypoxia production of erythropoietin may increase causing secondary polycythemia increased hematocrit levels increased blood viscosity and slowing of blood flow60 more of these patients are concurrently complicated with risk factors of cerebrovascular disease1532 making them more prone to embolic vascular events and increasing the probability of acute ischemic strokecovid-19 patients often present with hypoxemia due to respiratory dysfunction1561 the features of sever patients is acute respiratory distress syndrome62 when bodily oxygen content changes the brain is the first organ to be affected63 resulting in a series of pathophysiological changes hypoxia can dilate intracranial blood vessels and increase intracranial blood flow cerebral capillary pressure tissue fluid production brain free radicals membrane lipid peroxidation and endogenous inhibitors these effects may impact cell energy metabolism6465 anaerobic glycolysis in the brain produces increased lactic acid and oxygen free radicals and lipid peroxides weakened antioxidant system and blood-brain barrier dysfunction66 metabolic acidosis caused by hypoxia increases cerebral vasospasm and permeability leading to interstitial brain edema intracranial hypertension67 and decreased atp production caused by hypoxia this initiates an injury cascade encompassing intracellular ca2 overload glutamate excitotoxicity and oxido-nitrosative stress culminating in neuronal and astroglial necrosis apoptosis and neurocognitive deficits68the diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on suspected cases and provide any one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence 1 real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr for sars-cov-2 2 genome sequencing of the coronavirus showed highly homogeneity with the sars-cov-2 3 positive for the specific igm antibody and igg antibody to sars-cov-2 in serum test or sars-cov-2 specific igg antibody changes from negative to positive or titer rising 4 times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase69at present there is a lack of effective treatments for covid-19 virus infection clinical research is underway for an effective therapeutic but the most effective immediate action involves scientific prevention and isolation people of all ages are not resistant to novel coronavirus and may be infected if transmission conditions are satisfied however the elderly and individuals with cerebrovascular diseases are at risk therefore prevention and control in these populations are particularly important presently the most effective way to treat the disease is to control the source of infection use personal protective measures to reduce the risk of transmission and protect vulnerable groups it is suggested that the elderly and individuals with cerebrovascular diseases should reduce their outdoor activities ensure good personal protection and hygiene maintain good living habits take the initiative to monitor the health of individuals and family members ventilate and disinfect their rooms frequently take medicine regularly eat healthily and maintain a positive mindset if symptoms such as fever cough sore throat chest tightness and muscle soreness are present individuals should undergo timely diagnosis isolation and treatment when treating and nursing patients medical staff have closer contact with patients and hence a higher risk of infection among the 138 consecutive patients admitted to zhongnan hospital of wuhan university from january 1 to 28 the proportion of medical staff was as high as 2915 a retrospective analysis of 1099 patients diagnosed with covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces revealed that the proportion of medical staff was 20918 when providing medical services for diagnosed patients or individuals suspected of infection medical staff should wear goggles protective clothing and other additional protective measures to strengthen their own protection and prevent cross-infection7071there is currently a lack of specific antiviral drugs for novel coronavirus clinically most patients are mainly treated with empirical antiviral anti-infective glucocorticoid drugs andor supportive care for the most critically ill patients1672 nevert heless none of these approaches have resulted in curative effects therefore for covid-19 patients with cerebrovascular diseases personalized medication should be used according to the individual factors of the patients in addition to covid-19 symptoms it is necessary to concurrently strengthen treatments for basic cerebrovascular diseases to effectively reduce covid-19-associated mortality and improve prognosis the main treatment principle of cerebrovascular disease is to treat reversible etiology control risk factors and reduce complications general treatment includes bed rest monitoring vital signs finger oxygen saturation symptomatic support treatment and maintaining water electrolytes acidbase balance and stability of the internal environment the negative psychological impact of quarantine is evident73 and psychological support may be conducive to symptom improvement of this disease antiviral therapies74 such as interferon-alpha 5 million u per dose or equivalent for adults 2 ml of sterilized water for injection twice a day nebulized inhalation lopinavirritonavir two tablets per administration twice a day for no more than 10 days ribavirin recommended in combination with interferon or lopinavirritonavir 500 mg for adults two to three times a day intravenous infusion course of treatment no more than 10 days chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice a day for adults no more than 10 days and abidol 200 mg three times a day for adults no more than 10 days have been indicated nevertheless it is not recommended to use three or more antiviral drugs concurrently and the use of related drugs should be stopped if intolerable side effects are experienced convalescent plasma therapy is suitable for patients with rapid progression severe and critical illness shufeng jiedu capsule sfjdc a traditional chinese medicine may also improve the condition7475 recently a retrospective study of influenza sars and mers published in the lancet reported that the use of glucocorticoids in patients with sars and mers viral infection did not improve prognosis but caused problems such as delayed cure secondary infections and osteoporosis therefore it is recommended that glucocorticoids should not be used in the treatment of new coronary pneumonia76 redaciclovir holds the most potential for the treatment of 2019-ncov at present77 the results of animal experiments have demonstrated that compared with the control treatment redaciclovir effectively reduced viral titer in lung tissue of mers-cov-infected mice and improved lung tissue injury further its curative effects were superior to those of lopinavirritonavir combined with interferon- treatment after the first case of novel coronavirus was diagnosed in the united states after entering a critical state the symptoms of dyspnea were significantly improved after the use of redcevir and oxygen therapy was no longer required however research and development companies and physicians state that the effectiveness and safety of the drug have not been proven and further clinical research is needed the drug is currently in clinical trials78 in china anticoagulant therapy is recommended for secondary prevention of stroke in patients with acute cerebrovascular disease with an abnormal increase in d-dimer after treatment patients are admitted to the isolation ward of the infection department and concurrent rounds by neurologists in the isolation ward should occur daily to assist doctors with patient managementcovid-19 may cause respiratory diseases as well as other primary and secondary nervous system diseases at present neurological symptoms have been reported in covid-19 patients acute cerebrovascular symptoms such as sudden speech confusion and limb paralysis symptoms of intracranial infection such as headache epilepsy and disturbance of consciousness symptoms of muscle damage such as soreness and weakness of limbs and occasionally symptoms such as neuralgia abnormal sensation in this period of high incidence of covid-19 neurologists need to pay attention to this patient population especially patients with nervous system symptoms indeed differential diagnosis of covid-19 and early detection diagnosis treatment prevention and countermeasures are warrantedthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 pandemic has hit the human species at a planetary scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic this new pandemic has put the global economy to a halt and it is urgent to restore the economy in the safest possible way there are discussions among experts of varied disciplines about certificates of immunity that would be conferred to convalescent patients who developed protective immunity due to the infection 1 people who would be considered immune to the virus and thus will not transmit it would be free to return to normal routines the epidemiology pathophysiology clinical presentation and diagnosis of sars-cov-2 have been reviewed elsewhere 2 one pertinent but unanswered critical question is what constitutes protective immunity for those who are exposed to the sars-cov-2 virus clinical and healthcare policies in response to this pandemic rely heavily on the answers to this issue to begin to answer this question it is important to understand the kinetics duration and correlation of immunological parameters with protective immunity to other viruses in particular to coronaviruses and compare it with the data emerging from sars-cov-2 there is also an urgent need to develop successful vaccines to achieve herd immunity researchers have developed very successful veterinary and human vaccines in the past nevertheless there were some failures with experimental viral vaccines that induced harm in people who were exposed to the virus after vaccination a risk that should be avoided in the race to an efficacious sars-cov-2 vaccine 3-5 therefore the understanding of what constitutes protective immunity against sars-cov-2 also has important implications in the development of effective and safe vaccineskinetics of antibody production in patients infected with sars-cov-2using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa sensitized with the receptor-binding domain rbd of the spike s protein researchers were able to detect anti-rbd igm antibodies in 73 of the patients and anti-rbd iggs in 54 of the patients at day 14 after disease onset in 173 covid-positive patients most patients seroconverted for igm 943 and igg 798 between days 15 and 39 after disease onset 6 sars-cov-2 induces a more severe disease in old adults and the induction of neutralizing antibodies early in the infection may play a role in protection interestingly total antibody titer strongly correlated with disease severity in this cohort of patients okba et al developed an elisa sensitized with trimers of the whole ectodomain of the s protein s1 n-terminal ectodomain containing the rbd s1a n-terminal ectodomain not containing the rbd the rbd and sars-cov nucleoprotein n protein 7 in serum samples from three patients with pcr-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection one with severe disease and the other two with mild disease seroconversion to igg and iga was detected between 13 and 21 days after disease onset the most clinically affected patient seroconverted at day 13 with higher optical density od and the other two at around 20 days with lesser od by elisa seroconversion was detected in all plasmas from 31 other patients at two weeks after disease onset all elisas correlated strongly with 50 plaque reduction neutralization testing 7 thus the presence of antibodies by elisa including anti-n antibodies was correlated with the titer of neutralizing antibodies in 14 convalescent sars-cov-2 patients eight of whom were immediately post-discharge and six at two weeks post-discharge it was shown that all but one had high titer of neutralizing antibody and the elisa titer of anti-rbd igg antibodies was correlated with the neutralizing antibody titers 8duration of antibodies in convalescent patients infected with coronaviruses related with sars-cov-2understanding the duration of sars-cov-2 antibody responses will be key in addressing the question of sustained protection from reinfection of all coronaviruses that can infect humans sars-cov-2 has the closest genetic resemblance to sars-cov 9 a study of 74 convalescent sars-cov patients who were tested from the 2002 outbreak showed the presence of antibodies in all patients plasma by elisa 10 the antigen for this elisa was a lysate from infected cells igg antibodies persisted at a detectable level for up to 720 days post-infection above the cut-off importantly neutralizing antibodies persisted in most patients until day 720 though the titer decreased 100 times compared to antibodies elicited at the time of the infection in another study it was found that 56 of convalescent patients were positive at three years post-infection and the level of antibodies significantly decreased by the third-year post-infection 11 these results suggest that the titer of neutralizing antibodies at two weeks post-infection is correlated with duration of immunity and these antibodies are present up to two years after infection with sars-cov as discussed above there is also a positive correlation with severity of covid-19 and titer of antibodies detected by elisa against the s and n proteins 67 thus a patient who suffered a severe disease may carry neutralizing antibodies for a longer period of time compared with patients with mild diseaseone of the target cells for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is monocytes it has been postulated that sars-cov-2 could induce antibody-dependent enhancement ade of infection andor induce fc receptor-mediated inflammation due to the presence of anti- s non-neutralizing or subneutralizing antibodies 12 therefore a previous infection with sars-cov-2 inducing low level of antibodies or waning of antibodies after an infection could potentially cause exacerbation of the disease in re-infected patientscorrelation of antibody titers with protectionthe question remains of what constitutes antibody-related immunity to sars-cov-2 and whether the serological response to infection shown by elisa is protective for a significant period of time thus far there has been no definitive study on the titer of neutralizing antibodies necessary for protection from sars-cov-2 the nature of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against other respiratory viruses could provide some insight as to what that response against sars-cov-2 may entail for example a titer of 40 hemagglutination inhibition hai assay units is considered protective against infection with influenza virus of the same strain 13 the hai detects anti-hemagglutinin antibodies the viral attachment protein and thus hai units correlate with neutralization titer an experimental model of passive transfer of antibodies followed by challenge with porcine arterivirus another member of order nidovirales in piglets was used to quantify protection with neutralizing antibodies a titer of 18 of neutralizing antibodies in blood was sufficient to block viremia but it did not block local replication in lungs and lymph nodes a titer of 132 or above was necessary to induce sterilizing immunity 14 similar experiments could be performed with non-human primates to determine the titer of neutralizing antibodies that are protective from infection with sars-cov-2seasonal coronaviruses such as 229e oc43 hku1 and nl63 are responsible for 10-35 of upper respiratory tract infections in humans volunteers infected with 100 tissue culture infection doses 50 tcid 50 of 229e presented with statistically significant p005 mild lymphopenia 15 the kinetics of iga and igg antibodies in serum and mucosal iga was determined using elisa plates sensitized with inactivated 229e virus the maximum concentration of circulating coronavirus igg antibodies was found at 12-14 days ten of the 15 volunteers were successfully infected and experienced a transient increase in serum-specific iga and igg within eight days of inoculation reaching a peak at week 12 the five volunteers who were not successfully infected had a higher baseline level of mucosal iga antibodies and reached a peak at week 2 post-challenge these results suggest that antibodies elicited by previous infection with 229e virus provided protection to the challenge after week 12 the kinetics of infected and uninfected volunteers was similar upon re-challenge one year later all five of the unsuccessfully infected volunteers and six of nine of the successfully infected patients were infected all had a lower mean time of viral shedding and less severe symptoms indicating some degree of lasting protection however no clear antibody titer has been correlated with protection for any coronavirus as has been shown with influenza when data from experiments of protection with neutralizing antibodies in non-human primates are available it will be possible to predict protection with antibodies detected by elisa plates sensitized with sars-cov-2 rbd andor whole s protein 7hence there is a need for diagnostic tests capable of determining which individuals are protected from a re-infection with sars-cov-2 elisas enable the quantification of the level of antibodies the optical density reading of anti-rbd antibodies should be correlated with the titer of neutralizing antibodiesprotective cellular adaptive immune response against sars-cov and mers-covinvestigations of the cellular immune response to other related coronaviruses can provide insight into what is needed to generate protection from sars-cov-2 memory cd8 t cells were protective from lethal sars-cov infection in mice after immunization with peptide-loaded dendritic cells and boosting with sars-cov t-cell epitopes 16 two hla-a2 specific t-cell epitopes found in the sars-cov s protein were shown to elicit a strong and likely protective cd8 t-cell response in patients who recovered from sars virus infection 17 these results in a mouse model and in humans suggest that a t-cell response is important in protection against an infection with sars-covfailure to generate a sufficient cell-mediated response may prove costly in coronavirus infections sars-cov-2 can infect t-cell lines via s protein-mediated endocytosis with greater efficiency than sars-cov virus 18 while middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in particular has been shown to induce t-cell-specific apoptosis the same was not found for sars-cov and has yet to be shown for sars-cov-2 19 nevertheless prolonged cd4 and cd8 lymphopenia was observed in patients with sars-cov and associated with more severe illness and death 20 profound lymphopenia was also associated with and observed until death in sars-cov-2 non-survivors whereas lymphopenia improved in survivors 21 lymphopenia in sars-cov-2 consists of depletion of both cd4 and cd8 t cells with no significant alteration in cd4cd8 ratio 22 these authors showed that severity of lymphopenia in covid-19 patients positively correlates with severity of disease patients responsive to treatment showed an increase of cd8 t cells after a week whereas there was not an increase of cd8 t cells in non-responsive patients thus level of cd8 t cells can be used as a predictor of clinical outcome increase of cd8 t cells is typical in infections with respiratory viruses and the reason for the depression of cd8 t cells in infections with novel coronaviruses is not fully understood sars-cov-2 shares several non-structural proteins with sars-cov which induce a strong decrease of the type i interferon ifn response in infected cells 23 secretion of type i ifns dramatically increases cd8 t cells response against viruses 24 thus the down-regulation of type i ifns by different non-structural proteins of sars-cov-2 could help to explain the absence of a strong cd8 t-cell response in patients with covid-19 the use of type i ifns is a promising treatment against infection with sars-cov-2 25 besides the anti-viral effect of type i ifns the use of these ifns early in the infection could also help to potentiate the cd8 t cells this action is mediated by increased expression of hla molecules resulting in an increase in antigen presentation by dendritic cellsof note the cellular immune protection offered by infection also has the potential to be more persistent than antibody-mediated responses both cd4 and cd8 sars-cov-specific memory t cells have been shown to persist in convalescent sars-cov patients at low frequency up to six years post-infection 26 stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs from a convalescent patient with peptides from the matrix m and n proteins of sars-cov was also shown to elicit a cd8 t-cell response 11 years post-sars-cov infection 27 it has recently been shown that the ifn-gamma-secreting t cells specific for sars-cov-2 are produced in convalescent patients and that the production of np-specific t cells correlates with neutralizing antibody titers 8 since there is a high-sequence identity between proteins from other beta coronaviruses including the np it is also possible that heterotypic cellular immunity may play a protective role against sars-cov-2 in individuals previously infected with other coronaviruses such as 229e 9 therefore the different presentations of the disease in patients infected with sars-cov-2 could be related to some extent with cd8 t-cell memory to other coronaviruses for instance a proteomic comparative analysis of the four common coronaviruses and sars-cov-2 demonstrated that hla-b 1503 shows the greatest capacity to present peptides shared between the common coronaviruses and sars-cov-2 28 thus further investigation into the profile of t cells affected and the persistence of this response in patients with sars-cov-2 is warrantedcellular immunity is important in protection against sars-cov-2 and related viruses thus in addition to detection of antibodies it is important to develop commercially available gamma-interferon release assays that will be able to correlate the level of cellular immunity these assays could be used to predict clinical outcome in patients with covid-19 and protection from sars-cov-2 in the general populationanti-sars-cov-2 rna and replication-deficient adenovirus vaccinesthe titer of neutralizing antibodies that correlates with protection against infection with sars-cov-2 is not known therefore there are no parameters to precisely determine the potency of anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines in addition vaccine-induced or natural antigenic drift could create another problem with sars-cov-2 the presence of sub-neutralizing antibodies that may induce antibody-dependent enhancement of infectivity 12 therefore it is of the utmost importance to develop vaccines inducing a high titer of neutralizing antibodies to decrease the possibility of vaccine-induced ade as well as strong cellular immunityseveral non-replicative vaccines against sars-cov-2 are currently under clinical trials of note are replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses encoding the sars-cov-2 s protein nct04324606 chictr2000031781 these vectors infect cells but there is not viral replication in the host as a result of the infection there is a strong cd4 th1 cd8 and neutralizing antibody response 29 a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus carrying the s protein of mers cov has proven effective in protecting vaccinated camels from viral shedding 30 a phase i clinical trial with this vaccine showed no relevant adverse effects and the induction of neutralizing antibodies as well as cellular immunity the level of neutralizing antibodies decreased at one year post-vaccination but cellular immunity lasted at a high level up to a year post-vaccination 31 previous results obtained with this vaccine suggest that a sars-cov-2 replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus vaccine could be successful in inducing protective immunityseveral nucleic acid vaccines are also under clinical trial of note are rna vaccines encoding for sars-cov-2 s nct04283461 2020-001038-36 nct04368728 there is plenty of experimental data mainly with influenza virus showing that this type of vaccine induces cellular and antibody immunity experiments in mice and macaques showed a strong induction of cd4 th1 and cd8 t cells and neutralizing antibody response above the threshold of protection against several types of influenza viruses 3233 a self-amplifying mrna sam vaccine encoding the hemagglutinin gene of influenza virus induced strong neutralizing antibody response and cd4 th1 and cd8 t-cell responses and conferred protection to challenge in mice 34 recently two randomized placebo-controlled double-blind phase i clinical trials were reported using mrna vaccines against two influenza strains h10n8 and h7n9 35 the vaccines were lipid nanoparticle-formulated mrna vaccines given at various dosages by the intramuscular and intradermal routes seroconversion rates for both vaccines at the higher doses were comparable to squalene-adjuvanted h7n9 influenza vaccines and detectable hai titers were present up to six months post-vaccination no serious adverse effects were shown with these vaccines therefore results in experimental models and in clinical trials showed that rna vaccines are capable of producing strong cellular and antibody titers comparable to licensed influenza vaccinesvaccines against sars-cov-2 should induce a strong long-lasting level of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunity a strategy combining an rna vaccine or a replication-deficient recombinant virus followed by a booster with an rbd protein subunit vaccine could help to induce a strong protective response against sars-cov-2 by potentiating both branches of the adaptive immune system the priming vaccine doses will induce cellular and antibody responses and the rbd vaccine could further induce higher titers of neutralizing antibodies cellular immunity and neutralizing antibodies are important in protection against infection with sars-cov-2 there is a need to develop elisas to be able to quantify the level of anti-rbd antibodies and its correlation with the level of neutralizing antibodies providing protection from re-infection there is also a need to develop gamma-interferon release assays to determine the level of cellular immunity against sars-cov-2 correlating with protection likewise anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines must induce strong cellular immunity and a high titer of neutralizing antibodies to fully protect vaccinated individuals in the xxi century we have already witnessed the global spread of three previously unknown coronaviruses in 2002 the first known case of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars occurred in china and sars coronavirus sars-cov was identified in 20031 before sars pandemic was declared to be over in summer of 2003 about 8500 cases were reported including almost 900 deaths in 32 countries ten years later in 2012 a novel coronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov was isolated and was proven to be associated with several clusters of cases first in the arabian peninsula and then in other countries as a result almost 2500 cases including more than 850 deaths in 27 countries have been reported2 in 2019 a novel -coronavirus caused severe and even fatal pneumonia in wuhan china and rapidly spread to other provinces of china and other countries in 2020 the world health organization who on march 11 2020 declared coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 a pandemic by mid-may 2020 more than 300000 people have died and over 4000000 have been infected by the coronavirus in almost 200 countries and territories worldwidecoronaviruses were first discovered in the 1930s when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens was investigated and human coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s34 these early identified human coronaviruses are circulated in the global human population and contribute to 30 of common cold infections and mild respiratory symptoms and include the coronaviruses nl63 229e oc43 and hku15 there are only seven coronaviruses known to cause disease in humans and the remaining three mers-cov sars-cov and sars-cov-2 or 2019-ncov are more severe than the four relatively benign earlier counterparts although sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share the same host receptor  the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace26 and in spite of 80 genetic identity between sars-cov 1 and 2 these coronaviruses are different in several epidemiologic and biologic characteristics including transmissibility virulence survival virushost interactions and it appears induction of immune response and immune escape pathwayslike sars and mers sars-cov-2 infection manifests most frequently with lower respiratory symptoms a minority of patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome with diffuse alveolar damage though covid-19 symptoms in general have presented chiefly within the respiratory system the infection rapidly spreads to affect the kidneys nervous and cardio-vascular systems clotting pathways skin and the immune system in some patients interestingly both lymphopenia and hyperactivation of the immune responses are reported in covid-19 patients therefore from the immunological point of view the important question is what do we need to know about covid-19 immunity and thus what should we measure in these patientsnoticeably the immune responses induced by sars-cov-2 infection seem to be in two-stages as most of the infected individuals develop only mild or no clinical symptoms it is conceivable that during the incubation and non-severe stages a specific adaptive immune response is required to eliminate the virus and to preclude disease progression to severe stages such a robust immune response as noted by virus-specific immunoglobulin production in these individuals is associated with clinical recovery of most sars-cov-2-infected patients without severe respiratory symptoms78 however when a protective immune response is impaired virus propagates and massive destruction of the affected tissues occurs particularly in organs with high ace2 expression9 at this stage hyperactivation of a few subsets of immune cells and the cytokine release syndrome crs cytokine storm induces lung intestine and kidney damage in addition liver injury has also been reported to occur during the course of the disease in severe cases as is seen in sars-cov and mers-cov10 a total of 14 cytokines from 48 analyzed were significantly elevated in plasma in patients with covid-1911 importantly these cytokines exhibited dissimilar expression profiles in patients with different disease severity for instance levels of ip-10 mcp-3 hgf mig and mip-1 were significantly higher in critically ill patients when compared with the expression in patients with severe or moderate disease also ip-10 and mcp-3 were revealed to be outstanding predictors for the progression of covid-19 disease interestingly ace2 was shown to function as an interferon-stimulated gene in human barrier tissue epithelial cells12 suggesting that sars-cov-2 may exploit ifn-induced increase in ace2 expression a crucial cell-protective factor in lung injury to augment infectionfurthermore serum il-6 il-10 and tnf- concentrations negatively correlated with reduced total t cells cd4 and cd8 t cells and survival of covid-19 patients13 t cells from these patients expressed high levels of pd-1 which was particularly seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages thus it is possible that the cytokine release may drive the depletion and exhaustion of t cells together with the fact that low t cell number and exhausted t cells can leave patients more susceptible to secondary infection these results suggest that it is important now to focus on subpopulations of t cells in order to discover their vulnerability and their role in disease progression and recovery recent data demonstrated reduced covid-19 severity in patients with respiratory allergies potentially due to the reduction in ace2 expression in allergic individuals14 suggesting the need to expansively assess the role of type 2 immune regulation in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infection at the same time an excessive immune response contributes to sars-cov-2 pathogenesis and covid-19 lethality the rapid viral replication of sars-cov-2 may cause fatal inflammatory responses and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in patients for instance during virus replication the released coronavirus nucleocapsid dimers may interact with mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases this interaction induces over-activation of the complement system and promotes cell lysis leading to further elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines characterized as cytokine storm15tissue damage particularly if associated with disproportionate inflammation and crs may dysregulate the peripheral tolerance machinery and allow initiation or hastening of autoimmune pathways it is also possible that despite the lymphocytopenia often seen in severe covid-19 patients hyperactivation of virus-specific cd8 and cd4 t cells during sars-cov-2 infection and massive destruction of infected cells may result in the development of autoimmune pathology after patient recovery although effective immune response against viral infections depends on the activation of cytotoxic t cells that can clear the infection by killing virus-infected cells very little is known about viral protein-specific t cells in covid-19 patients furthermore it is not yet clear whether these cells play a role in the elimination of sars-cov-2-infected cells andor massive destruction of infected cells in different tissues again a comprehensive analysis of t cell subsets in covid-19 patients especially after recovery is justified to predict and minimize outcomes of immune dysregulation during infectionin spite of a growing body of immunological data associated with sars-cov-2 infection it is still not completely understood how the infection is cleared16 if sars-cov-2 similar to other coronaviruses induces an acute infection which is then completely cleared by the immune system then the majority of recovered individuals should acquire at least a temporary immunity and be protected from a repeated infection for some time another scenario is viral latency when the virus may lie dormant within a cell as the viral genome has not been fully eradicated the virus is still able to reactivate via external activators as seen in herpes simplex virus which commonly infects an individual for life another scenario is a chronic infection such as in the case of viral hepatitis and hiv when a virus persists for a continued period and causes long-term inflammation and damage this limited understanding of sars-cov-2 behavior suggests the necessity to develop verified immunoassays to assess the circulation of both anti-viral antibodies and viral proteins antigens as in the case of hbv and hiv infections as many unknowns remain about antibody tests determination of several subclasses of immunoglobulins  igg igm and iga recognizing at least sars-cov-2 specific spike and nucleocapsid proteins  is urgently needed to unravel the development and stability of immune response to sars-cov-2 infection these clinical data should support the development of alternative fast reliable and non-expensive testing of the neutralizing potential of tested anti-viral antibodies this information also is needed for a better understanding of the applicability of a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement when pathogen-specific antibodies can promote pathology17 to sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 severity the results of wide antibody testing should provide information on disease prevalence and the frequency of asymptomatic infections finally the determination of spike nucleocapsid and envelop proteins of sars-cov-2 in serumplasma samples is also urgently needed to support expanded screening of different populations of people for epidemiologic predictive and risk evaluating studies further elucidation of these complex clinical data will identify novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to more effectively control this pandemic and prevent its potential recurrencesevere acute respiratory syndrome sars

al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003 marra et al 2003 peiris et al 2003 rota et al 2003 indeed the proteins of sars coronavirus had such low amino acid identity with those of known coronaviruses that it has been tentatively assigned to a new coronavirus group 4 the three existing coronavirus groups table 1 were initially devised on the basis of a lack of antigenic relationships between the species of different groups pedersen et al 1978 snchez et al 1990 enjuanes et al 2000 gonzlez et al 2003 it is probable that the vast majority of the human population is susceptible to sars coronavirus the sars epidemic was contained at only 8460 cases by the enormous effort and sacrifice of a large number of individuals associated with many public authorities so severe were the infections in a fully susceptible population that 808 died doubtless a greater proportion would have died had it not been for the medical attention focussed upon them sadly a large proportion of the deaths in some countries were sustained by health care workers in addition to the human misery there were dire economic consequences for those countries most affected
the last sars cases of the early 2003 epidemic were in june 2003 the disease might arise again by further transmission from the suspected animal reservoir or transmission from human possibly asymptomatic carriers there is evidence from studies of avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv and feline coronavirus that coronaviruses establish persistent infections chicks that had been experimentally infected with ibv at 1 day of age re-excreted virus at around 19 weeks of age jones  ambali 1987 it is suspected that the stressor of the start of egg production caused the release of the virus approximately 10 of cats that had been naturally infected with feline coronavirus became asymptomatic carriers excreting virus for over 1 year addie  jarrett 2001 addie et al 2003 others excreted virus for periods of several monthsthe world health organisation has called for the development of vaccines against sars this short review looks at the experiences with ibv vaccines over half a century which might be instructive with regard to the development of sars vaccinesas suggested by its name ibv causes respiratory disease although its replication is not limited to the respiratory tract it is the major respiratory virus of the chicken the domestic fowl as it is endemic in probably all countries that raise chickens its host range is considered to be limited to the chicken cavanagh  naqi 2003 although genetically very similar coronaviruses cause disease in turkeys enteric disease guy 2000 cavanagh et al 2001 and pheasants respiratory and kidney disease lister et al 1985 gough et al 1996 cavanagh et al 2002 ibv occurs globally both in chickens kept on a large and a small scale wunderwald  hoop 2002 it exists as scores of serotypesgenotypes cavanagh 2001 meulemans et al 2001 farsang et al 2002 which are problematic with regard to prophylaxisibv causes deciliation of the ciliated epithelia of the nose and trachea clinical signs being similar to those of the common cold caused in humans by the group 1 and group 2 human coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 respectively cavanagh 2000 2004 chickens especially those of only a few days or weeks of age exhibit nasal discharge snicking similar to sneezing watery eyes and lethargy dhinakar raj  jones 1997 cavanagh  naqi 2003 some chickens exhibit rles a vibration emanating from lower in the respiratory tract and small areas of pneumonia may be observed in the lungs dhinakar raj  jones 1997 notwithstanding this and the fact that titres of virus in the lungs can be similar to those in the nose and trachea bronchitis is not considered to cause pneumoniafrom a welfare point of view the hardest hit are chicks of only a few days or weeks of age some may die directly from the viral infection but a greater number die following secondary bacterial infection an overall slowing down of growth causes further economic losses juvenile and mature birds suffer less from ibv infection although the economic consequences of infection in egg-laying stock can be disastrous as egg production drops precipitously and usually does not rise back to normal in the flock as a wholeas discussed further later ibv grows at many epithelial surfaces beyond the respiratory tract reviewed by dhinakar raj  jones 1997 although many alimentary tract tissues are susceptible to ibv infection of enteric tissues usually does not manifest itself clinically recently a strain of ibv has been associated with disease of the proventriculitis the cranial glandular compartment of the stomach adjacent to the gizzard which is the caudal muscular compartment yu et al 2001a nephritis is not uncommon in a proportion of naturally ibv-infected meat-type birds environmental factors playing a role some ibv strains are intrinsically nephropathogenic that is they reproducibly cause nephritis when inoculated experimentally into specific pathogen free chickens lambrechts et al 1993 pensaert  lambrechts 1994 cook et al 2001 li  yang 2001 the oviduct is also susceptible to ibv which may contribute to diminished egg productionibv contains the same number of structural proteins ie those present in virons as the group 1 coronaviruses that is a nucleocapsid protein associated with the 276 kb single-stranded positive-sense rna genome a large spike glycoprotein s a smaller integral membrane glycoprotein m and a few molecules of the envelope protein lai  cavanagh 1997 enjuanes et al 2000 gonzlez et al 2003 it does not contain a haemagglutinin esterase glycoprotein such as is found in group 2 coronaviruses the coronavirus s protein is a dimer or trimer cavanagh 1983 gallagher  buchmeier 2001 lewicki  gallagher 2002 the s glycopolypeptide of ibv like that of group 2 coronaviruses is cleaved into amino-terminal s1 approximately 520 amino acid residues and carboxy-terminal s2 approximately 625 residues glycopolypeptides lai  cavanagh 1997 the ibv s protein has been demonstrated to be a determinant of the host cell range in vitro when the s protein gene of an infectious cdna clone of the beaudette strain casais et al 2001 which replicates in mammalian vero and bhk cells was replaced by that of the m41 strain which does not replicate in those cell lines the recombinant virus was unable to replicate in them casais et al 2003 the recombinant did replicate in primary chick kidney cells as did both the beaudette and m41 strains whether the s protein of ibv is a determinant of tissue tropism in vivo remains to be determinedibv initially infects the upper respiratory tract titres of live virus are maximal in the nose and trachea by 3 days post inoculation by eye-drop and intranasally and remain so for 2 to 5 days further depending on the strain table 2 ambali  jones 1990 hofstad  yoder 1966 thereafter the titre falls to below detectable levels although virus was still detectable at 14 days in some studies ambali  jones 1990 the virus is restricted to the ciliated and mucus-secreting cells reviewed by dhinakar raj  jones 1997 similar virus titres occur in the lungs and airsacs sometimes peaking a little after those in the nose and trachea small areas of pneumonia may be observed in the lungs dhinakar raj  jones 1997
lucio  fabricant 1990 investigated the growth of several isolates of ibv in chickens although they did not quantify the virus that they recovered they showed that infectious virus was recovered from the trachea bronchus lung oesophagus proventriculus duodenum jejunum caeca caecal tonsils kidney and cloaca the longest periods of isolation were in respect of the kidney and caecal tonsils the latter being at the distal end of the alimentary tract in birdsambali  jones 1990 used another strain strain g of ibv that produced high titres in the kidney similar to those in the trachea table 1 various alimentary tract tissues proventriculus duodenum ileum caecal tonsils bursa of fabricius and rectum had peak titres the same as in the trachea and kidney or within 10-fold of that amount table 1 fluorescence revealed the location of the virus in epithelial cells several other isolates were compared with the g strain they were isolated much less frequently or not at all from kidney and rectal contents el-houadfi et al 1986 organ culture studies showed that while all strains studied by bhattacharjee  jones 1997 grew in the proventriculus bursa and kidney explants some did not grow in the caecal tonsil or rectal explantsin the experiments of hofstad  yoder 1966 titres in the kidney and bursa of fabricius were approximately two orders of magnitude lower than in the respiratory tissues for a number of ibv strains of low passage number in embryos high egg-passaged virus 85 passages was almost undetectable in the kidney and bursa and gave reduced titres in the trachea and lungthe most intensively studied tropism apart from the upper respiratory tract has been that for the kidney although only a small proportion of ibv isolates exhibit high nephropathogenicity these can cause up to 44 mortality within 3 weeks of intratracheal inoculation pensaert  lambrechts 1994 in the absence of vaccination histopathological and immunochemical studies of the process showed that the ma-87 strain of virus attacked mainly the lower nephron down to the collecting duct epithelial cells chen  itakura 1996 chen et al 1996 an ultrastructural investigation revealed that the virus replicated in all segments of tubules and ducts but more frequently in the epithelial cells of the collecting ducts collecting tubules distal convoluted tubules and henles loops chen 1996 the extent of mortality is age related greatest in chicks lambrechts et al 1993 and varies according to the line of bird for example 18 and 44 of an egg layer-type bird and a meat-type bird respectively pensaert  lambrechts 1994birds have a small lymphoid organ the harderian gland in the eye-socket that is a major contributor to locally produced antibody for protecting oculonasal mucosae reviewed by dhinakar raj  jones 1997 inoculation of a mild vaccinal strain of ibv by eye-drop resulted in replication of virus in the gland and partial damage to it toro et al 1996 there was an increase in the number of plasma cells and enlargement of lymphoid foci ibv has also been isolated from another lymphoid organ the bursa of fabricius table 1 el-houadfi et al 1986 ambali  jones 1990 with gross and histopathological lesions occurring even after infection with vaccinal strainsmost recently yu et al 2001a have studied the pathogenesis of three isolates of ibv from the proventriculus of chicken flocks that had affected proventriculi experimental infections with these strains resulted in age-dependent mortality 75 to 100 in 2-week-old birds 0 to 25 in 16-week-old chickens necropsy of sick chickens revealed that the mucosa of the proventriculus was thickened and exuded a milky fluid when squeezed and the entire proventriculus was enlargedthus ibv strains as a group productively infect a large range of epithelial surfaces literally from the top to the bottom of the chicken isolates differ in their extent of replication in the non-respiratory tissues and some produce clinical disease in non-respiratory tissues most notably the kidney and proventriculus the pantropism of ibv might be the case for sars coronavirus as the latter has not only been associated with pneumonia but also with diarrhoea although it remains to be demonstrated whether the sars virus is replicating in enteric tissues peiris et al 2003 a point of difference is that whereas sars virus is associated with severe clinical signs in both the respiratory and enteric tracts ibv is usually limited to disease in the respiratory tractit is not appropriate in this short review to go into detail about the extensive antigenic variation exhibited by ibv darbyshire et al 1979 ignjatovic  mcwaters 1991 cook et al 1999 cavanagh 2001 meulemans et al 2001 farsang et al 2002 it is an issue that may not arise with sars coronavirus that said only a few amino acid differences in the s1 protein of two strains of ibv are sufficient to change the serotypethe large spike glycoprotein s comprises a carboxy-terminal s2 subunit approximately 625 amino acid residues which anchors s in the virus envelope and an amino-terminal s1 subunit approximately 520 residues believed to largely form the distal bulbous part of s cavanagh 1995 lai  cavanagh 1997 it is the s1 subunit that induces virus-neutralizing vn antibody this has been demonstrated in various ways failure to induce vn by virus from which s1 had been removed cavanagh et al 1986 induction of vn antibody by s1 released from virions by treatment with urea cavanagh et al 1986 by non-ionic detergent followed by affinity chromatography ignjatovic  galli 1994 and by expression from a vaccinia virus recombinant tomley et al 1987 by production of monoclonal antibody-resistant mutants the mutations being in the s1 part of the spike protein gene cavanagh et al 1988 koch et al 1990 kant et al 1992experimental vaccination studies usually involve application of virus to the nostrils and by eye-drop sometimes by direct application to the trachea protection is determined by challenge 3 weeks after vaccination the challenge virus being applied by the same route three main approaches to the assessment of protection have been 1 observation of clinical signs not commonly used and removal of the trachea at 4 or 5 days after challenge followed by either 2 quantitative assessment of ciliary activity or 3 detection of live challenge virus usually by inoculation of embryonated eggs the second and third methods result in similar deductions being made as regards protection marquardt et al 1982 although in some studies challenge virus was isolated from some individuals whose ciliary activity was unaffected or little affected arguably declaring a chicken as non-protected because of the recovery of small amounts of challenge virus when ciliary activity is normal is being too stringentmost ibv serotypes differ from each other by 20 to 25 of s1 amino acids adzhar et al 1997 kingham et al 2000 although some differ by up to 50 cavanagh et al 1997 gelb et al 1997 differences between the other ibv proteins are in the region of 10 rarely exceeding 15 cavanagh et al 2001 2002 generally speaking the immunity induced by inoculation with one serotype protects poorly against infection by heterologous serotypeswith regard to protection of the respiratory tract in some experiments some heterologous challenge viruses broke through in 100 of the chickens ie 0 cross-protection hofstad 1981 marquardt et al 1982 picault et al 1986 other challenge viruses known now to differ by 20 or so in s1 from the virus used to initially infect the chickens broke through immunity in 30 to 70 of cases rosenberger et al 1976 hofstad 1981 collectively these and other reports show that cross-protection can range from very poor to moderate poor for commercial purposes although in some cases the differences among these reports may be also be due to differences in stringency by which protection was assessed discussed later when winterfield et al 1976 used clinical criteria to assess cross-protection a vaccinal strain of the massachusetts serotype was concluded to protect all chickens in groups of 10 against challenge with serotypes now known to differ by 20 or so in their s1 proteins protection was assessed as being less when re-isolation of challenge virus was used as the criterion for protection there is no doubt that in the field the application of a vaccine that is homologous to the prevailing field strain has given better protection than an heterologous vaccinecross-protection against nephritis is also usually poor although some strains are more cross-protective than others pensaert  lambrechts 1994 cook et al 2001monoclonal antibody-resistant mutant investigations have revealed that many of the amino acids involved in the formation of vn epitopes are located within the first and third quarters of the linear s1 polypeptide cavanagh et al 1988 koch et al 1990 kant et al 1992 sequence analysis of variants that are genetically very similar 95 amino acid identity in s1 has shown that most of the differences are within these two regions cavanagh et al 1992 adzhar et al 1997 moreover some variants that differed by only 2 to 3 of s1 amino acids 10 to 15 residues behaved as different serotypes cook 1984 cook  huggins 1986 cavanagh et al 1992it is conceivable that there are variants eg with small differences in s1 of sars coronavirus in the field ie within its natural hosts if this were to be the case and if variants infected humans would the variants be able to break through the immunity induced by a vaccine based on a strain isolated from humans in early 2003 unfortunately there have been few protection studies based on closely related variants of ibvcavanagh et al 1997 inoculated groups of 10 chickens with the virulent uk682 isolate and challenged with isolates that differed by up to 4 of s1 amino acids some of which were different serotypes cook 1984 cook  huggins 1986 protection being assessed on retention of ciliary activity in trachea challenge with two variants 98 s1 identity with uk682 resulted in challenge scores a relative measure of retention of ciliary activity virtually the same as with the homologous challenge challenge with two others isolates 96 and 98 s1 identity respectively resulted in a higher challenge score indicative of less cross-protection although the numbers were not statistically significantly different also in three experiments one of each group of 10 birds initially inoculated with the uk682 virus was clearly not protected against homologous challenge the chickens had been individually inoculated with a high dose 5 to 6 log10 infectious virus of the primary inoculum therefore this lack of protection in 10 of birds was unlikely to have been due to a failure to initiate infection with the primary virus but rather to heterogeneity of the immune responsein other studies approximately 10 of chickens in a group which had been inoculated and challenged with the same strain or with one of the same serotype were not fully protected winterfield et al 1976 hofstad 1981 picault et al 1986 parsons et al 1992 cavanagh et al 1997 cook et al 1999 nix et al 2000 using virus isolation or tracheal ciliary activity as the criterion these results show that chickens out-bred although with restricted sets of parental breeding stocks are not uniform in their response to ibv vaccination one would imagine that the human population might be even more heterogeneous in response to vaccination against sarsnix et al 2000 inoculated chickens with several virulent isolates that had 94 or greater amino acid identity in s1 all were assessed as being of the same serotype arkansas but some cross-reacted in a vn test much less than others some isolates induced 100 protection assessed by re-isolation of challenge virus a stringent test against challenge including against challenge with a strain that was of lower serological identity however two other isolates induced cross-protection of only 55 to 58 of the chickens when the challenge virus was of lower serological identityclearly the induction of protective immunity to ibv is complex it not only depends on the antigenic relatedness of the primary infecting strain and a subsequent challenge strain but also on the response of individual chickens approximately 10 of chickens in some experiments failed to develop a protective immune response furthermore while breeds of chicken are similar in that they are all efficiently infected by ibv resulting in similar titres of virus they differ in their capacity to clear the infection otsuki et al 1990 small  5 differences in s1 amino acids would appear to be sometimes responsible for poor cross-protection it should be borne in mind that while the focus has been on the relatedness of the s1 protein other viral proteins may have a role in protective immunity for example the nucleocapsid protein of which more later recently we t hodgson r casais b dove p britton  d cavanagh manuscript in preparation have substituted swapped the spike protein gene of our beaudette infectious clone receiver strain with that of the m41 strain donor strain both strains are of the massachusetts serotype and have 950 s1 amino acid identity the beaudette and m41 strains are attenuated and pathogenic for chickens respectively when chickens were inoculated with the donor receiver or spike-swapped recombinant ibv and challenged with m41 the receiver strain induced almost no tracheal protection assessed by ciliary activity while the recombinant ibv induced protection almost as good as the donor strain this was not due to an increased virulence of the receiver strain as the spike-swapped recombinant was as non-pathogenic as the beaudette receiver strain and both replicated poorly as the receiver strain and recombinant virus had identical proteins except for the spike protein it would appear that the poor immunity induced by the receiver strain against the donor strain was due to some of the 50 of amino acid differences 27 different residues in s1 this supports the findings of earlier work that small differences in s1 can contribute to poor cross-protection cavanagh et al 1997 nix et al 2000protection of the respiratory tract following a single live attenuated virus vaccination has been found to be short-lived gough  alexander 1979 and darbyshire  peters 1984 reported a decline in the number of protected chickens at 6 and 9 weeks after vaccination respectively in regions where a given serotype of ibv vaccine is consistently not giving acceptable protection against field challenge the birds might be revaccinated 2 to 3 weeks after the first application sometimes this is with the same vaccine preparation sometimes with another product of the same serotype and sometimes with a vaccine of a heterologous serotype the latter approach sometimes gives protection against a broader range of serotypes cook et al 1999some strains of ibv are markedly nephropathogenic for example experimental tracheal infection of commercial meat-type birds with the b1648 nephropathogenic strain resulted in the death of approximately one-third of a group of 68 chickens within 9 days vaccination by coarse spray with the homologous attenuated strain completely protected against mortality upon challenge 4 weeks later pensaert  lambrechts 1994 vaccination with non-homologous commercially available vaccines markedly although not completely reduced mortality the homologous vaccine had prevented detectable growth of the challenge virus in the trachea as ascertained by virus isolation but the heterologous vaccines did not do so challenge virus in the kidney was assessed by immunofluorescence by this criterion the number of chicks with detectable ibv in the kidney was reduced by 84 by vaccination with the homologous vaccine and not at all by the heterologous vaccinesinactivated oil-emulsion ibv vaccines were developed during the 1960s and 1970s the objective was to make a vaccine that would give long-lasting immunity to the hen bird to protect against drops in egg production single applications of inactivated virus induced little or no protection against egg loss mcdougall 1969 box et al 1980 muneer et al 1987 and no protection against loss of ciliary activity in the trachea martins et al 1991however immunization of 11 chickens with a single dose of inactivated ibv strain m41 resulted in 36 to 45 depending on the criterion used developing respiratory tract protection cavanagh et al 1986 a dose of 100 g was not more efficacious than 5 g in a second experiment 29 based on retention of ciliary activity in the trachea to 76 based on not isolating challenge virus of 17 chickens were protected after a dose of 10 g in a third experiment 40 of 10 chickens were judged protected retention of ciliary activity following a single 10 g dose it is possible that larger amounts of virus was used in these three experiments than by previous workers and that this was the reason for the partial successas part of a study of the role of the ibv nucleocapsid protein n protein in protective immunity discussed later boots et al 1992 immunized chickens with inactivated ibv at 4 weeks of age and again 6 weeks later after challenge 18 and 88 of the two groups of chickens respectively were protected by assessment of ciliary activity in trachea the degree of protection was assessed as being slightly less 88 when immunofluorescence was used to detect infected tracheal cellsignjatovic  galli 1994 gave four doses each of 200 g of inactivated ibv 40 and 20 of 10 birds had developed protection assessed by non-re-isolation of challenge virus in the trachea and kidney respectively after three doses these percentages did not increase after four doses song et al 1998 immunized chickens up to three times with an inactivated nephropathogenic strain protection assessed by non-re-isolation of challenge virus of the kidney and trachea was 50 and 13 respectively of eight chickens after two inoculations rising to 88 and 50 respectively after three inoculationsto see whether two doses of inactivated vaccine would be protective against loss of egg production mcdougall 1969 vaccinated birds at an interval of 8 weeks and challenged them 18 weeks later only a few of the vaccinated birds had respiratory signs and these lasted for less than 3 days compared with 8 days for the unvaccinated controls the birds that had received the inactivated vaccine were largely protected against a drop in egg production gough et al 1977 demonstrated a poor serum antibody response to a single application of inactivated infectious bronchitis vaccine but titres increased markedly upon revaccination 10 weeks laterthe approach commonly used in the poultry industry today is to vaccinate young females two or more times with live vaccine followed by one dose of inactivated vaccine as the birds come into lay the live vaccines serve to give protection to the young bird and to prime the immune response to the later inactivated vaccine gough et al 1977 box et al 1980 finney et al 1990 gough et al 1977 demonstrated that the chickens that had received one dose of live vaccine followed by inactivated vaccine 10 weeks later were protected against challenge 10 weeks later as assessed by re-isolation of challenge virus from trachea oviduct and kidney box  ellis 1985 reported that the response to the inactivated vaccine was poor if given within 8 weeks of a live vaccinationmacdonald et al 1981 inoculated 12-week-old chickens with 2 ml convalescent ibv serum two days later they were challenged by intravenous application of the h52 vaccinal strain a procedure known to result in nephritis the birds were protected against kidney disease as assessed by lack of watery droppings macroscopic and microscopic pathology in the kidney in contrast to control birds to which non-immune serum had been given the passive application of immune serum did not protect against respiratory infection although onset was delayed and of shorter durationsmith et al 1985 and cook et al 1986 demonstrated varying mortality among different breeds of chicken both when inoculated with a mixture of ibv isolates alone and when in conjunction with a pool of escherichia coli strains the ibv predisposed the birds to infection with the bacterium resulting in increased mortality bumstead et al 1989 continued with this ibve coli infection showing marked variation in mortality among several inbred lines of white leghorn chickens more detailed analysis of two of these lines line 15i highly susceptible and line c relatively resistant showed that the rate of virus production and titres in the respiratory tract were similar during the first 4 days after infection otsuki et al 1990 thereafter however titres declined much more slowly in the susceptible line 15i taking two-fold longer to decline to undetectable levels in tracheal explants of the two lines there was no difference in the replication profile of the virus showing that the difference in the birds themselves was not because of an intrinsic difference in the capacity of the trachea to support the replication of ibv the underlying cause of the difference in vivo might be immunologicalthe extent to which infection by a nephropathogenic strain caused mortality was also dependent on the type of chicken pensaert  lambrechts 1994 thus 0 and 2 of a specified pathogen free flock died within the periods 5 to 7 days and 7 to 9 days respectively after tracheal inoculation of the b1648 strain in contrast 15 and 21 of commercial meat-type birds died in these periodsthe humoral immune response to ibv vaccination has mostly been investigated by measuring antibody levels in serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa vn or haemagglutination-inhibition hai tests ibv haemagglutinates very poorly until treated with enzyme preparations containing neuraminidases alexander et al 1983 schultze et al 1992 and references therein however there have also been a few studies of ibv antibodies in the nose and trachea it should be stated at the outset that many studies have shown that the presence or absence or titre of serum antibody to ibv does not correlate with protection that is vaccinated chickens may be protected against respiratory disease ibv irrespective of the titre of serum antibody for example raggi  lee 1965 ignjatovic  galli 1994the profile of the serum antibody response depends on the method used to detect it following infection of chickens with a virulent strain of ibv specific antibody was first detected by elisa plates coated with ibv a majority of the birds having detectable antibody by 6 days after infection with titres maximal within 21 days and tending to decline shortly afterwards mockett  darbyshire 1981 vn antibody was delayed in comparison with elisa-detected antibody being first detected in the period 9 to 21 days after infection peaking within 35 days and remaining level for the remainder of the sampling period 63 days after inoculation although in 25 28 of the birds the vn antibody was still increasing at 63 days when sampling ended the hai antibodies were first detected at 9 days peaking at 14 to 17 days and then declining although in one bird the hai titre did not peak until much later as with the vn titre in the same birdmockett 1985 also compared elisas using purified s and m proteins with the conventional virus-coated elisa the primary and secondary antibody response profiles were very similar vn antibody again later than elisa antibodyfollowing infection with a live ibv vaccinal strain there was a good primary immunoglobulin igm response mockett  cook 1986 martins et al 1991 as expected the primary igm response peaked and declined before that of the igg response figure 1 martins et al 1991 the secondary igm response ie in response to a second challenge infection peaked at the same time as that of igg but declined faster figure 1 mockett  cook 1986 suggested that measurement specifically of serum igm would be useful in defining recent infection in contrast to the response after ibv infection vaccination with inactivated virus produced almost no igm response as well as a poor igg response figure 1 martins et al 1991
a single and double vaccination with inactivated ibv resulted in hai titres of 128 and 1219 respectively 4 and 2 weeks after the respective vaccinations gough et al 1977 a single inoculation of 3 g purified ibv induced maximum titres of hai and elisa antibody of 6 log2 and 12 log2 respectively by 3 to 4 weeks after vaccination cavanagh et al 1986 vn antibodies peaked 1 week later at 5 log2 titres decreased eight-fold within 4 weeks of peakingholmes 1973 measured vn antibody in nasal washings after challenge of chickens that had received either a single live virus infection or two intra-muscular inoculations 4 weeks apart with inactivated ibv serum antibody levels rose rapidly in both groups nasal antibody rose more slowly in the group that had received inactivated virus than in the group that had received a primary inoculum of live viruswhereas a single inoculation of 10 g ibv induced tracheal protection in 40 of 10 chickens all birds were susceptible after immunization with ibv from which the s1 subunit had been removed by urea indicating that the s1 subunit was required to induce protective immunity cavanagh et al 1986 the s1 that had been released by treatment with urea was dialysed against decreasing concentrations of urea and eventually in the absence of urea this might have enabled some renaturation of the protein sedimentation analysis indicated as expected that the s1 that had been released by urea was in monomeric form that is it was no longer a multimeric dimer or trimer molecule with quaternary structure notwithstanding 22 and 44 of 10 chickens that had been inoculated on four occasions with 3 g s1 developed vn and hai antibody respectively there were no positives following three inoculations protective immunity was not assessed in that experimentignjatovic  galli 1994 dispersed the proteins of a nephropathogenic ibv using non-ionic detergent and purified s1 n and m by affinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies chickens were inoculated on four occasions 50 g for each dose chickens that had been immunized with n or m proteins did not develop protective immunity assessed by non-recovery of challenge virus to either the trachea or kidney following challenge however 71 and 86 of 10 chickens inoculated with s1 developed tracheal and kidney immunity after four inoculations the respective percentages were 70 and 10 after three inoculationsthe s1 protein has also been expressed in spodoptera frugiperda cells from a recombinant autographa californica baculovirus song et al 1998 when chickens were inoculated with these cells containing expressed s1 43 and 0 of seven birds were protected assessed by non-re-isolation of challenge nephropathogenic virus in the kidney and trachea respectively protection rose to 50 and 25 respectively of eight chickens after three inoculationsthe s1 protein has also been expressed in situ from fowlpoxvirus and adenovirus vectors three inoculations in the wing web of a recombinant fowlpoxvirus expressing s1 induced ibv-specific antibodies wang et al 2002 after challenge with ibv there was somewhat less recovery of challenge virus and less tracheal damage than in controls and only mild clinical signs greater protection was achieved following a single oral application of a fowl adenovirus expressing s1 johnson et al 2003 protection assessed by non-re-isolation of challenge virus was obtained in 90 and 100 of 10 to 13 chickens in two experimentsthe first study of the role of the ibv n protein in immunity was by boots et al 1992 the n protein was in the form of a bacterially expressed fusion protein with -galactosidase initial experiments were with mice inoculated in the footpad a single inoculation resulted in popliteal lymph node cell proliferative responses to ibv delayed-type hypersensitivity responses were obtained when mice had been inoculated with a inactivated ibv on two occasions b inactivated ibv followed by n protein and c n protein followed by inactivated ibvexperiments were subsequently undertaken with chickens following a single intramuscular inoculation of inactivated ibv 18 birds were protected against respiratory challenge as assessed by ciliary activity in the trachea and none were protected in a group inoculated with n protein other chickens were inoculated with either inactivated virus or n protein and then inoculated a second time 6 weeks later with inactivated ibv after challenge 88 and 810 chickens in the two groups respectively developed protective immunity table 3 the extent of protection was assessed as being slightly less when immunofluorescence was used to detect challenge virus in tracheal cells table 3 in a third group in which birds had been inoculated with -galactosidase without any n protein and then inoculated with inactivated ibv some chickens had protective immunity induced by the secondary inoculation with inactivated ibv table 3 linear regression analysis showed that this was statistically less than in the group that had been primed with the n protein the authors concluded that immunization with the n protein had induced protective immunity by activation of cytotoxic or helper t-cell responses
two intramuscular immunizations of chickens with a plasmid expressing the n protein or a fragment of the n protein induced immune responses that protected the birds from infection by ibv applied by eye-drop and intranasally as evidenced by mark reduction in replication of the challenge virus seo et al 1997b a fragment of the n protein comprising the carboxyterminal 120 amino acid residues was sufficient to induce protection yu et al 2001b expressed this fragment in chickens using a single inoculation of a fowlpoxvirus recombinant upon challenge with a homologous strain and one heterologous strain of ibv the birds did not develop clinical signs although some replication of challenge virus was detected by an elisa the birds were not protected against challenge with a different heterologous straincollisson and colleagues seo  collisson 1997b pei et al 2003 have shown that cytotoxic t-cell responses in chickens to ibv infection correlated with initial decreases in infection and clinical signs cytotoxic t-cell activity was major histocompatibility complex restricted and lysis was mediated by cd8cd4 cells adoptive transfer of ibv-infection-induced  t cells bearing cd8 antigen protected chicks from challenge infection seo et al 2000 reviewed in collisson et al 2000 earlier work has been reviewed by dhinakar raj  jones 1997 tissues from chickens infected with two field strains of ibv were assayed for interferon which was readily detected in the trachea and lung but at only low levels in the plasma kidney liver and spleen otsuki et al 1987if there were to be a resurgence of sars in humans one would anticipate that the authorities would rapidly put into operation the various surveillance and control measures that proved successful in early 2003 if vaccines had been developed vaccination might be included especially for health care workers and contacts in the wider community coronaviruses can establish persistent infections in at least a proportion of their hosts resulting in chronic asymptomatic shedders with subsequent problems for containment of the disease for this and other reasons a decision to apply a sars vaccine would not be taken lightly notwithstanding what type of vaccine might be usedthe poultry industry prefers to use live vaccines rather than inactivated ones the former are cheaper to make and buy and easiercheaper to apply these financial considerations would presumably not be paramount in the case of a resurgence of sars in humans efficacy would be an important criterion for use of a particular vaccine although that also applies in the poultry industry of course safety of a sars vaccine might be deemed more important than efficacy assuming that a vaccine had an acceptable if not complete efficacy in general inactivated vaccines are considered to be safer than live attenuated vaccines although the safety of inactivated vaccines cannot be taken for grantedunless a future sars outbreak were to get rapidly out of control it would seem unlikely that a conventional live attenuated vaccine would be used the potential risk of vaccine-related problems reactions might be deemed too high genetic manipulation in addition to traditional approaches will be used as a means of attenuating sars coronavirus kuo et al 2000 thiel et al 2001 de haan et al 2002ab casais et al 2003 ortego et al 2003 however a desirable outcome cannot be guaranteed and fears of vaccine-related problems will still be harboured however given the almost total susceptibility of the global human population the lethal outcome of 10 of cases and the huge strain put on the health care services and economies a killed vaccine subunit vaccine or vectored vaccine might be used in the first instance among selected groups of peoplethe experience of single applications of inactivated ibv is not greatly promising in the context of sars a single application of inactivated ibv protected 50 of chickens sometimes much less than 50 however even a poorly efficacious single application of an inactivated sars vaccine might help to reduce the spread of the virus by reducing the number of susceptible people at the first sign of a resurgence of sars the authorities might decide to vaccinate key personnel with a view to revaccinating them the outcome of some experiments with ibv in this regard is promising in a number of studies two vaccinations with inactivated ibv produced protective immunity in 85 of chickens that said in some studies even 2 inoculations of high doses of inactivated ibv gave protection in only 50 or so of chickens it might be that the criterion of protection used in these studiesnon-re-isolation of challenge virusmight be too stringent that is some amelioration of the clinical effects of infection might be obtained even if there is some detectable replication of the challenge virus in the case of infection by sars coronavirus if a vaccine only protected against the worst outcomespneumonia deaththen it might be deemed to have been successfulexperimental ibv subunit vaccines in the form of the s1 protein were efficacious but as expected not more so than inactivated virus in two studies protection of the trachea was achieved after three vaccinations in 70 and 59 of chickens respectively protection of the kidney was less efficient 10 and 25 respectivelyvectored sars vaccines might be considered likely to be less potentially problematic with regard to safety than attenuated sars coronavirus perhaps such a vaccine might be used if an outbreak developed into an epidemic or pandemic in this regard the results of the investigation by johnson et al 2003 are very promising a single oral application of a non-pathogenic fowl adenovirus expressing the ibv s1 protein gave 90 protection as good as is obtained by conventional attenuated ibvin the event that any type of live vaccine was used against sars an inactivated sars vaccine might subsequently be applied to build upon the initial vaccination and perhaps provide at least medium-term protection the experience with ibv is very good in this regardif sars coronavirus were to re-emerge in humans its s1 protein might not be the same as that of the 20022003 outbreak research with ibv has indicated that differences of only 5 of s1 protein amino acid can reduce cross-protection consequently s1 differences among sars coronavirus isolates must not be viewed complacently the finding that the ibv n protein plays a beneficial role in immunity suggests that the sars virus n protein should not be overlooked in a sars vaccine development programmethe coronaviridae were recognized as a new virus family in 1968 because their virion morphology and intracellular budding site distinguished them from other rna viruses characteristic features of their genome replication strategy structural proteins and polymerase later supported this classification the toroviruses and coronaviruses were recognized as separate genera within the coronaviridae family in 1993
the coronaviridae and arteriviridae are now classified as members of the nidovirales order viruses with monopartite plus-strand rna genomes that are transcribed to yield a nested set of overlapping subgenomic mrnas that have a common 3 enda model of coronavirus virions is shown in fig 1
 the enveloped virions are approximately 100 nm in diameter and are characterized by large petal-shaped spikes the spikes are oligomers of the 180200 kda s glycoprotein that binds to receptor glycoproteins and induces fusion of the viral envelope with cell membranes and sometimes cellcell fusion s proteins of several coronaviruses also bind to 9-o-acetylated sialic acid a small envelope glycoprotein m traverses the lipid bilayer three times and interacts with the nucleocapsid in the virion intracellular transport of the m glycoprotein is arrested in the golgi which may determine the intracellular budding site of coronaviruses the small e glycoprotein originally believed to be a nonstructural protein is present in small amounts in virions and is essential for virus budding envelopes of some coronaviruses also contain a hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein he which forms short spikes that bind n-acetyl-9-o-acetylneuraminic acid or n-glycolylneuraminic acid and have esterase activity the nucleocapsid protein n encapsidates the monopartite linear single-stranded genomic rna the internal structure of coronaviruses was originally believed to be a helical nucleocapsid as shown in fig 1 recently however cores that appear to have cubic symmetry were observed in detergent-treated virus preparations thus the internal structure of coronaviruses is not yet understoodthe 2732 kb plus-strand rna genomes of coronaviruses are capped and polyadenylated transfection of genomic rna into cells leads to production of infectious virions the genomes of several coronaviruses have been sequenced although no infectious coronavirus cdna has yet been obtained
a map of the genome of murine coronavirus mhv fig 2
 illustrates the characteristic features of coronavirus genomic rna at the 5 end of the genome is a cap with a leader rna of approximately 70 bp the order of the genes encoding the polymerase and structural proteins is the same in genomes of all coronaviruses pol s e m n but several additional open reading frames orfs are interspersed among these genes these orfs encode nonstructural ns proteins of unknown functions and they differ in number position and sequence among different coronavirusesfor both coronaviridae and arteriviridae the rna-dependent rna polymerase gene at the 5 end of the genome consists of two orfs in different reading frames joined by a pseudoknot at a ribosomal frame shift site the 5 and 3 ends of the genome contain predicted complex stem loop structures and additional stem loops are predicted within some orfs
preceding every orf in the genome is an intergenic sequence is consisting of one or more ucuaaac sequences for mhv or related sequences for other coronaviruses the is is included in a promoter that regulates the transcription of different viral genes the location on the genome of packaging signals for the initiation of encapsidation of genomic rna by the n protein appears to differ among coronavirusesupon infection the two large orfs in the 20 kb polymerase gene of the genomic rna are translated via ribosomal frameshift as a single very large polyprotein that is cleaved during translation by 3-c-like and papain-like proteases within the nascent protein to yield a variety of peptides the processing of the large polyprotein and the functions of the resulting peptides in rna-dependent rna polymerase activity are being analyzed in many laboratoriesusing the genomic rna as template the polymerase generates a full-length minus-strand rna with a 5 poly u sequence infected cells also contain a 3 coterminal nested set of polyadenylated subgenomic plus-strand mrnas that have a cap and the approximately 70 bp leader sequence at their 5 ends fig 2 a negative-strand rna template corresponding to each subgenomic mrna is also found in infected cells fig 2 a nonprocessive leader-primed polymerase activity was postulated to account for the presence of the leader on each mrna a complex of polymerase and leader transcribed from the 3 end of the full-length negative-strand template would bind to an is on the template and act as a primer for synthesis of the subgenomic mrna this hypothesis does not explain the presence of the negative-strand templates for each subgenomic rna an alternative hypothesis suggests that polymerase jumping occurs during negative-strand synthesis generating the subgenomic negative-strand templates for subsequent mrna synthesis mutations in the is preceding an orf can prevent transcription of the mrna with that orf at its 5 end although virus strains differ in the relative amounts of various mrnas in infected cells there is little temporal regulation of transcription
coronavirus replication is associated with a high frequency of mutations that arise by two mechanisms first during the replication of each approximately 30 kb rna genome several point mutations would be expected to occur based upon the known error frequency of rna polymerases second coronavirus genomes undergo a very high frequency of rna recombination
small or large deletions at the sites of recombination can produce mutant viruses or defective interfering di rnas and subgenomic replicons large deletions in certain sites of the gene encoding the s glycoprotein and mutations in the n gene yield viruses with altered virulence tissue tropism or thermal stability thus even after sequential single plaque isolations coronavirus stocks always contain a mixture of quasispecies different virus variants may be selected during passage in different cell lines or under a variety of culture conditions therefore it is important to document the passage history of coronavirus strains or mutants
rarely recombination may occur between coronavirus genomic rna and mrnas of cells or unrelated viruses such an illegitimate rna recombination event may have resulted in the incorporation of the mrna that encodes the he glycoprotein of influenza c into the genome of a coronavirus ancestral to the mhv group similarly some of the ns orfs may have been acquired through recombination with foreign mrnasgenetic analysis of coronaviruses is somewhat limited because no full-length infectious cdna clones of coronavirus genomes are yet available di rnas transfected into cells infected with wild-type virus can be replicated and have been used to study encapsidation and transcription initiation signals site-specific mutations have been introduced into several coronavirus genomes by targeted rna recombination in infected cells transfected with a mutagenized subgenomic cdnacoronavirus replication occurs in the cytoplasm and does not require the nucleus only the orf at the 5 end of each of the coronavirus mrnas is translated within the infected cell or in vitro the phosphorylated n protein which is translated from one of the smallest mrnas is the most abundant viral protein in infected cells it assembles with genomic plus-strand rna in the cytoplasm to form helical nucleocapsids viral glycoproteins are translated on the rough endoplasmic reticulum where s oligomerizes then they are transported to the golgi where s proteins of some coronaviruses are cleaved by a trypsin-like host cell protease to yield s1 and s2 peptides the s and he glycoproteins are expressed on the plasma membrane the viral s he m and e glycoproteins and the nucleocapsid assemble by budding at a special pre-golgi compartment and the virions are apparently transported to the cell surface in large vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane to release virions from the intact cell by exocytosis infected cells are characteristically coated with a thick layer of adsorbed virionsmost coronaviruses cause epidemic disease in only one species although limited replication usually without disease may result from experimental inoculation of other species coronaviruses typically cause respiratory or enteric diseases although several can also cause hepatitis infectious peritonitis nephritis myocarditis sialodacryadenitis or neurological reproductive or immunological disorders the viruses were named for their natural host and sometimes for the associated disease for example avian infectious bronchitis virus ibv mouse hepatitis virus mhv sialodacryadenitis virus of rats sdav bovine coronavirus bcov porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus hev turkey bluecomb coronavirus tcov
human respiratory coronaviruses hcov transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine tgev porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv canine coronavirus ccov feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv and feline enteric coronavirus fecov and rabbit coronavirus rbcov
in vivo coronaviruses bind to receptors expressed on the apical membranes of enteric and respiratory epithelial cells and are released either from the apical or basolateral borders or both depending upon the virus
although strains of many coronaviruses have been adapted to growth in continuous cell lines isolation of human coronaviruses from infected patients may require human fetal tracheal organ cultures some coronaviruses such as rabbit coronavirus or enterotropic strains of mhv cannot be propagated in cell culture but require animal passage coronavirus-like particles seen in electron micrographs of human feces human enteric coronaviruses hecv have not been adapted to serial passage in cell culture
ibv and tcov can be propagated in embryonated eggs and some strains grow in avian cell lines although cells of the natural host species are generally required for infection by virions purified coronavirus genomic rna can infect cells across species barriers receptors have been identified for several coronaviruses mhv uses murine biliary glycoproteins in the immunoglobulin superfamily hcov-229e and tgev use human and porcine aminopeptidase n apn respectively fipv and fecov use feline apn which can also be utilized by hcov-229e and tgev and bcov and hcov-oc43 use n-acetyl-9-o-acetyl neuraminic acid moieties expression of the cloned receptor glycoproteins in cells of a foreign species can render them susceptible to infection with coronavirus virions thus coronavirusreceptor interactions are an important determinant of the species specificity of coronavirus infectioncoronavirus infection of cells may be inapparent or cause cell fusion vacuolization rounding andor cell death cytopathic effects are minimized and virus yield and stability are increased at acid ph some strains of mhv infect cells by receptor-dependent fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane but other strains of mhv and other coronaviruses appear to enter via fusion with endosomal membranes for some coronaviruses cleavage near the middle of the s glycoprotein at a sequence of basic amino acids yields the noncovalently linked s1 and s2 peptides and enhances viral infectivity andor cell fusion s glycoproteins of many other coronaviruses such as fipv lack the protease target sequence and do not require protease activation for infectivity or cell fusionthere are three coronavirus serogroups one group includes hcov-229e tgev prcov ccov fcov and others a second group includes mhv bcov sdav hev hcov-oc43 and others avian ibv strains make up the third serogroup phylogenetic analysis of coronavirus n and s genes correlate well with the division of coronaviruses into these three groups nucleic acid sequence analysis also shows that certain pairs of coronaviruses that cause different syndromes in the same host should probably be considered strains of a single virus thus prcov and tgev of swine which cause epizootic respiratory and enteric disease respectively are highly homologous except for a deletion of more than 675 nucleotides in the s gene of prcov the feline coronavirus fecov causes epizootic enteric disease in cats and mutant fipv viruses that arise within fecov-infected animals cause fatal systemic diseasethe he glycoprotein is encoded by a gene found in the mhv group of coronaviruses but not in the hcov-229e or ibv groups phylogenetic analysis of coronavirus he gene suggests that bcov and hcov-oc43 are more closely related to each other than to mhv the organization of the polymerase gene with two large slightly overlapping orfs in different reading frames joined by a pseudoknot is conserved among all coronaviruses and shared by toroviruses such as berne virus bev and arteriviridae in addition bev encodes a protein with significant homology to he of coronaviruses and influenza c virus
recombination between genomes of related coronaviruses can occur in experimentally inoculated cell cultures or animals and also during natural outbreaks of disease in the natural host recombinants between ibv strains have been isolated from infected birds nucleotide sequencing shows that one biotype of feline coronavirus that causes epizootic disease is a recombinant between canine coronavirus and the other biotype of feline coronavirus mutants of mhv derived from persistently infected murine cell lines have acquired the ability to infect nonmurine cells these observations indicate that there may be naturally occurring interactions between the genomes of coronaviruses from different speciesmost coronaviruses cause epidemic or epizootic disease in only one species because of the great antigenic variability among coronavirus strains and because many coronaviruses replicate only in epithelia where protective immunity is relatively short-lived reinfection is common infection is often inapparent and virus particles or antigens and subsequent seroconversion are observed in healthy individuals the viruses are enzootic or endemic in their host species causing sporadic disease and seasonal outbreaks when enough susceptibles are available adults with acute self-limited inapparent infection transmit virus to neonates that develop clinical disease coronavirus diseases are more severe in neonatal animals than adults either because pre-existing immunity to related virus strains moderates infections in adults or because the immature immune system permits higher levels of virus replication
in immunocompromised hosts infection may be inapparent but virus shedding may be prolonged such individuals serve as reservoirs of virus for example enterotropic mhv strains are endemic in colonies of laboratory mice sustained both by persistent infection of immunocompromised nude mice and by the continuous availability of new susceptibles due to birth or importationoutbreaks of coronavirus diseases are often seasonal in humans coronaviruses cause 1530 of colds predominantly during the winter months and outbreaks of different human coronaviruses alternate at 23 year intervals outbreaks of bcov-induced dysentery in cattle also occur in the winter severe enteritis due to tgev or bcov infection of suckling pigs or calves respectively occurs seasonally in correlation with breeding cycles outbreaks of ibv-induced respiratory disease in chickens can occur at any time but are most common during the winter stress can exacerbate coronavirus-induced diseases mice with inapparent mhv infection can develop hepatitis if they are subjected to immunosuppression thymectomy transplanted tumors or infection with unrelated organisms cattle with inapparent bcov infection may develop respiratory disease during shippingcoronaviruses have broad geographic distribution human infections with viruses related to hcov-229e or to hcov-oc43 occur worldwide as do ibv tgev bcov fcov and ccov infections occasionally strains of these viruses that cause unusual manifestations of disease arise and spread locally and some of these viruses become very widely distributed for example ibv strains that cause severe nephropathy arise and spread locally prcov which causes a mild epizootic respiratory infection in swine has arisen several times in europe and in the usa from tgev by means of a very large deletion in the s glycoprotein the epizootic spread of prcov in european pigs has apparently acted as a natural vaccine that has decreased the incidence of serious tgev-induced enteric disease in pigletsmost coronaviruses cause only respiratory or enteric disease in one host species these viruses generally replicate only in respiratory or enteric epithelial cells where the apical membranes express specific glycoprotein receptors for the viruses coronaviruses are shed in respiratory secretions andor feces some coronaviruses such as some mhv strains fipv and rabbit coronavirus cause disseminated disease and can replicate in macrophages hepatocytes neurons glial cells endothelial cells kidney epithelium lymphocytes urogenital tract andor myocardium in general coronavirus titers in the respiratory or enteric tract rise during the first 35 days postinoculation and recovery of infectious virus from an immunocompetent host is usually not possible after 1014 days although viral antigens and rna may continue to be detectable for several weeks infectious coronavirus can be shed for months by immunocompromised hosts
although most coronaviruses do not persist in immunocompetent hosts coronaviruses such as the neurotropic mhv-jhm strain can sometimes be detected in the brain months or years after inoculation reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction rt-pcr can detect hcov-229e andor hcov-oc43 rna in up to 40 of brains from patients with neurological diseases and from healthy individuals but the significance of this observation for human disease is unknowncoronavirus-induced lesions vary markedly depending upon the virus strain dose and tissue tropism and the genetic background of the host intestinal infections with bcov mhv tgev fecov tcov and ccov cause loss of apical epithelial cells of the intestinal villi and shortening and broadening of the villi
some enterotropic coronaviruses cause necrotizing enterocolitis particularly in young animals while others cause only watery diarrhea or inapparent enteric infection diarrhea is probably due to altered transport of fluids and electrolytes by the immature epithelial cells that cover the blunted villi intestinal absorption of certain sugars in tgev-infected pigs remains altered for several days after the diarrhea has ceased mononuclear inflammatory cells infiltrate the lamina propria reinfection with a different strain of the virus generally causes more moderate disease than primary infection however kittens are more likely to develop fip following their second infection with feline coronavirus than after their first infection thus an immunological response to the primary infection may somehow facilitate the later development of disseminated disease
human respiratory coronaviruses related to hcov-229e or hcov-oc43 infect the epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract and cause colds infection of young asthmatic children can exacerbate wheezing and lower respiratory tract coronavirus infection has occasionally been observed in adults reinfection is frequent even in volunteers inoculated with the same strain of human coronavirus infection is usually demonstrated by rt-pcr or by rising serum antibody titers because primary isolation of these viruses from respiratory washings is difficult it is not yet clear how many coronavirus strains cause human respiratory disease or whether coronaviruses may play a role in other human diseases
ibv-induced respiratory diseases in chickens is of great economic importance in addition some ibv strains are nephrotropic and cause kidney disease while others infect the oviduct and reduce egg laying recombinants between several ibv strains have been isolated from infected flocks
neurological disease and hepatitis can result from coronavirus infections mhv strains cause local andor systemic infections via respiratory or fecaloral routes while some mhv strains are strictly enterotropic most strains infect both the respiratory and enteric tracts some mhv strains causes focal hepatitis acute encephalitis and subacute or chronic focal demyelinating disease in the murine brain and spinal cord cell fusion necrosis and infiltration with mononuclear cells are observed in acutely infected tissues depending upon the strain of virus and strain of mice susceptibility to mhv is affected by at least three murine genes that determine the virus receptor isoforms expressed the yield of infectious virus and the ability to generate monocyte procoagulant activity a prothrombinase in the coagulation pathway in response to mhv infection mutations in the mhv and tgev s glycoproteins can alter tissue tropism virulence and persistence
hev causes respiratory infection and outbreaks of encephalomyelitis in suckling pigs and virus infection of neurons that innervate the stomach causes vomiting and wasting syndromeunusual syndromes associated with coronaviruses include feline infectious peritonitis rabbit myocarditis and rat sialodacryadenitis fecv causes enteritis in kittens and inapparent infection in adult cats while the closely related fipv can cause infectious peritonitis with ascites wasting and death in a small percentage of infected cats a cardiotropic rabbit coronavirus causes dilated myocardiopathy and death within 712 days after intravenous inoculation of rabbits with serum from an infected rabbit rat coronaviruses infect the respiratory tract salivary and lacrimal glands causing sialodacryadenitis and can also infect the urogenital tract interfering with breedinginfection of respiratory or enteric tracts of adults results in antiviral antibodies in the serum secretory antibody in the respiratory and enteric tracts colostrum and milk and development of virus-specific t cells these immune responses are useful for diagnostic purposes terminate infection and probably ameliorate subsequent infections but they do not necessarily prevent reinfection in newborns passive oral immunization with neutralizing antibody can sometimes prevent fatal coronavirus enteritis because coronavirus diseases are generally most severe in newborns that do not respond well to active immunization an attractive strategy to protect these newborn animals that is being explored is to vaccinate pregnant dams in order to maximize antiviral antibodies in the colostrum and milk
coronaviruses can sometimes infect cells of the immune system and may modulate cytokines and immune responses to unrelated immunogens infected macrophages can spread infection to distant tissues mononuclear cell infiltrates in infected tissues consist of macrophages plasma cells and cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes infection of glial cells with mhv can upregulate expression of major histocompatibility complex mhc class i or ii antigens making these cells potential targets for cytotoxic t cells mhv infection causes thymic atrophy and the virus can also infect b lymphocytes polyclonal b cell activation and hypergammaglobulinemia are associated with fipv infection cheetahs which have little polymorphism in their mhc genes have a much higher fatality rate after feline coronavirus infection than cats
because of the economic importance of coronavirus diseases of domestic animals modified live vaccines against ibv tgev bcv ccv and fipv have been developed however they do not provide solid protection from infection with wild-type coronaviruses other approaches to protection or control of coronavirus diseases include use of recombinant s proteins synthetic peptides that mimic neutralization epitopes passive immunization with antibody against s glycoproteins and treatment with interferon  or monoclonal antireceptor antibody improvement of vaccines will require understanding of coronavirus virulence factors strain variation and mechanisms of immunopathology
full-length cdna copies of coronavirus genomes and a way to express them to obtain infectious virions are needed to investigate coronavirus replication and pathogenesis analysis of the complex synthesis processing and functions of the coronavirus polymerase peptides will provide unique insight into mechanisms of rna recombination tools for coronavirus genetics and possibly new targets for drugs to inhibit coronavirus replication improvements in diagnostic tests to identify coronavirus infections in humans and animals will elucidate the epidemiology of these viruses and may implicate coronaviruses in the etiology of additional diseases
the characterization of coronavirushost interactions during persistent infection in vitro and in vivo will provide additional insight into coronavirus epidemiology and pathogenesis further understanding of virus variants and host responses to coronavirus infections of the respiratory and enteric tracts may lead to improved coronavirus vaccines
arteriviruses arteriviridae toroviruses coronaviridae immune response  cell mediated immune response immune response  general features respiratory viruses recombination of viruses rhinoviruses picornaviridaetwo members of swine enteric coronaviruses porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and porcine deltacoronavirus pdcov have recently emerged as major causative agents of lethal watery diarrhea in piglets leading to significant losses within the swine industry worldwide pedv and pdcov are classified in distinct genera in the family coronaviridae as an alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus respectively 1 2 the transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev also an enteropathogenic porcine alphacoronavirus used to be responsible for severe economic losses around the globe in the 1990s however due to its current disappearance in many parts of the world this review will focus mainly on pedv and pdcov the two emerging swine coronavirusesthe first pedv outbreak occurred in europe around 1970s 3 4 from the 1990s onward sporadic occurrences of pedv infection were reported in countries such as the czech republic belgium hungary south korea china italy and thailand 5 before emerging as a major swine outbreak in china around 2010 6 7 this outbreak marked the appearance of highly pathogenic strains of pedv associated with 80100 morbidity and 5090 mortality in suckling piglets 8 2013 was another critical year seeing the emergence of pedv in the north american continent 9 more recently the epidemiology of pedv has taken a new turn with china seeing increasing co-infection rates up to 51 with pdcov 10 11compared to the discovery of pedv the first report of pdcov was fairly recent being detected in 2012 in hong kong during molecular surveillance of coronaviruses in avian and mammalian species 2 to date pdcov has been detected in many countries including the united states canada south korea china thailand laos and vietnam 12 13 clinical severity of pdcov infection tends to be lower than pedv with a mortality rate of around 40 when experimentally inoculated into gnotobiotic suckling piglets 14 15 nevertheless pdcov still causes severe disease 16 among diarrheic pigs in the united states and china the prevalence of pdcov was found to be as high as 307 respectively of all reported cases 10 accordingly pdcov is an emerging pathogen that warrants further study because there is still little information about deltacoronavirus infection pathogenesis and virus-host interaction 17innate immunity functions as the first line of defense against invading viruses it identifies and alerts host cells to their presence by eliciting rapid and early cellular responses and inducing production of multiple cytokines lymphoid-associated tissues including peyers patches lymphoid follicles and mesenteric lymph nodes are the largest and the first barrier against infections of the gastrointestinal gi tract 18 gut-associated lymphoid tissue galt-resident professional antigen presenting cells apcs are therefore of particular interest in studying pedv and pdcov infection with apcs such as dendritic cells dcs most prominently plasmacytoid dcs pdcs which are the major producers of types i interferons ifns in vivo during viral infection 19 and macrophages being the first immune cells to encounter pedv pdcov and other enteric viruses 20enteric coronaviruses possess pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps such as viral glycoprotein structures and viral rnas which can be recognized by pattern recognition receptors prrs present on apcs 21 recognition events initiate propagation of intracellular signaling resulting in production of soluble antiviral components of innate immunity these soluble components are primarily made up of type i and iii ifns chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines because the ifn pathway is crucial in initiating viral resistance and shaping subsequent adaptive immune responses 22 both pedv and pdcov need to evolve mechanisms to antagonize and suppress its induction and signaling in order to establish productive infection innate immune cell populations such as natural killer nk cells are also known to respond to porcine coronavirus infections and may play a role in disease outcome and pathogenesis 23in the following sections we will describe the relevant aspects of pedv and pdcov biology and pathogenesis and review the fundamentals of antiviral innate immunity subsequent sections will provide an update on recent studies regarding host antiviral innate responses as well as key mechanisms and strategies that these porcine enteric coronaviruses have evolved to evade virus recognition by host prrs inhibit ifn induction and block ifn signaling cascades finally we will discuss the potential of harnessing innate immune machineries for the control of enteric coronavirus infection and implications of this knowledge on development of immune modulators for effective vaccination against these two pathogensboth pedv and pdcov are enveloped viruses with single-stranded positive-sense rna genomes of 2826 kb in length respectively 2 24 their genome organization is depicted in figure 1 open reading frame 1a orf1a and orf1b of both viruses encode two polyprotein precursors pp1a and pp1ab which are cleaved by the papain-like protease pl-pro and a serine type 3c-like protease 3clpro 25 to give rise to non-structural proteins nsp 116 for pedv and nsp115 for pdcov 2628 many of the individual nsps interact to form the replicase-transcriptase complex rtc responsible for viral rna replication and transcription of sub-genomic rnas in addition to these replication functions some coronavirus nsps are also involved in antagonizing host innate immune responsesboth pedv and pdcov possess four structural proteins namely spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n each virus has a unique set of accessory proteins however pedv has only one accessory protein orf3 29 whereas the pdcov genome encodes non-structural ns6 ns7 and ns7a accessory protein 30 31 although distributed widely both within and between structural genes the location and function of coronavirus accessory protein genes are species-specific 32 in fact coronavirus accessory proteins possess diverse functions including modulating viral pathogenicity 33 inducing cell death 34 or antagonizing the ifn system 3537pedv and pdcov primarily target the gi tract of pigs although pedv has also been found to infect alveolar macrophages of the respiratory tract resulting in pneumonic lesions 38 while the fecal-oral route accounts for the main means of pedv and pdcov transmission vomitus and contaminated fomites such as transport trailers and feed may also be points of viral transmission 39 40 upon host entry via the oral route porcine coronaviruses bind to surface receptors on susceptible cells primarily villous epithelial cells of the small intestine brush border 38 41 42 in swine porcine aminopeptidase n papn which is highly expressed in the small intestinal mucosa was implicated to play a critical role in the target cell infection of pedv and pdcov 43 44 following cell entry porcine coronaviruses similar to most of cov initially form double-membrane vesicles dmvs where replicationtranscription probably takes place assemble in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the large virion containing vacuoles lvcvs and are transported via the golgi apparatus for release by budding from the surface membrane of the infected cells 26 4548 infected villous cells are then destroyed leading to reduction and shortening of the villibecause both pedv and pdcov target villous enterocytes of the porcine gi tract establishment of a productive infection requires both penetrating the heavily guarded mucosal barriers and circumventing the hosts robust and rapid innate immune response although many comprehensive reviews have described how other coronaviruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov 4951 and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers-cov 52 53 interact with components of innate immunity knowledge about how pedv and pdcov antagonize host innate immune responses has only started to emerge furthermore due to the challenges in propagating field isolates in a biologically relevant cell culture system and difficulties in viral genome manipulation the mechanisms behind porcine enteric virus pathogenesis remain largely unknowncell lines provide invaluable information on viral pathogenesis and its interplay with the innate immune response the lack of suitable cell lines is therefore one of the major impediments to progress in the field for the study of porcine enteropathogenic viruses for instance many of the most widely used cell lines are not even derived from natural target cells namely enterocytes of intestinal villi as a case in point the staple cell line for pedv propagation has been vero derived from the kidney of an african green monkey since the process was first described by hofmann and wyler 54 the use of vero cells however is limited to the propagation of cell-adapted pedv strains the success rate of expanding new variant and field-isolated pedv in vero cells is rather low and often comes at the cost of gradual loss of infectivity during passaging 55 while being permissive to pedv propagation and replication these cells have a major deletion in the type i ifn gene cluster resulting in ifn deficiency 5659 and thus rendering them unsuitable for studying viral modulation of innate immune responsescell lines such as marc-145 african green monkey kidney llc-pk1 porcine kidney and st swine testicle may be more appropriate for studying pedv-mediated innate immune modulation zhang et al examined various cell lines for pedv susceptibility and discovered that the ifn-competent marc-145 cells were also permissive for pedv infection exhibiting cytopathic effects cpe and infection foci staining comparable to infected vero cells 60 using these cells they were able to demonstrate the suppression of type i ifn production and degradation of creb-binding protein cbp by pedv they also used llc-pk1 and st cells to investigate the role of pedv nsp1 protein in the inhibition of early nf-b activation 61other immortalized cell lines permissive for pedv include pk-15 porcine kidney huh-7 human liver mrc-5 human lung and tb1-lu bat lung cells which were used to examine pedv receptor usage and cell entry 62 a comprehensive list of both traditional and newly established cell lines currently being tested or permissive for pedv replication can be found in a recent review by teeravechyan et al 63 these cells possess a variety of phenotypes however and will need to be carefully vetted before use in studying innate immune responses to pedvonly two immortalized cell lines of swine origin namely st and llc-pk1 are known to be permissive for pdcov and used for its isolation and propagation 64 at 2 days post-inoculation pdcov-infected llc-pk1 and st cells become enlarged and rounded characteristics of pdcov-associated cpe while the presence of trypsin in maintenance media helps to improve pdcov propagation in the llc-pk1 cell line its absence does not completely abrogate virus propagation unlike for st cells additionally cell culture media supplemented with pancreatin andor small intestine content sic solution extracted from healthy uninoculated gnotobiotic pigs supported pdcov propagation in both llc-pk1 and st cells llc-pk1 has also been used to demonstrate pdcov antagonism of various host innate immune components 65 66although the use of these cell lines has provided invaluable information about the interaction between these two enteric coronaviruses and their hosts it may not yield relevant biological information consistent with in vivo pedv and pdcov infection because these cells are not derived from pig intestinal epithelial cells iec the known target cells of both porcine coronaviruses in recent studies immortalized iecs have been derived by the introduction of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase htert gene into the neonatal-derived small intestinal epithelial cells 67 and used by many groups for pedv propagation 6872 however only ipec-j2 a porcine jejunal cell line derived from a neonatal pig has been used to study how pedv antagonizes host cell antiviral activity 73 the use of ipec-j2 cells could provide more biologically relevant information when investigating the pathogenesis of pedv infection however others found that these cells were not always susceptible to pedv 32 in their study zhang et al claimed that ipec-j2 cells in addition to its relative non-permissiveness to pedv infection were actually heterogeneous and that the infection rate achieved by this cell line was extremely low a new cell line ipec-dq was thus sub-cloned and characterized for pedv propagation 74 ipec-dq cells were found to support efficient and productive infection of pedv furthermore due to their ability to express type iii ifns ipec-dq could potentially be used as a suitable cell model for the study of gut innate immunity and its modulation by pedv nevertheless immortalization and transformation of primary cells may affect cellular antiviral signaling possibly resulting in misrepresentation of in vivo innate immune responses in fact a number of cellular pathways regulating ifn-stimulated genes and antiviral defense are closely linked to cellular tumor suppression activity including anti-proliferative pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory responses 75 accordingly the antiviral responses observed in immortalized iec or ipec cells despite being of porcine intestinal epithelial cell origin should be further compared to those in primary iecsconsistent with this idea primary porcine iecs were recently isolated and used to propagate pedv 76 for the first time primary porcine iecs were used as a model to study the interplay between molecular mechanisms of pedv infection and the host innate immune response focusing on the potential mechanism of pedv-mediated nf-b activation in particular although porcine iecs are the ideal cell type for pedv and pdcov research and representative of target cells in vivo these cells are difficult to procure have a short life span and unlike immortalized cell lines could contain a mixed population of different cell types ectopic or stable expression of exogenous genes in primary cells is also very difficult due to differences in doubling time and life span of each primary cell type making clonal selection virtually impossible another important technical reason that limits the use of primary iecs in pedv and pdcov research is their hypersensitivity to trypsin required for enteric coronavirus propagation in in vitro culture 54all things considered porcine iec-derived immortalized cell lines remain the optimal in vitro models for studying the innate immune response to pedv and pdcov infection balancing ease of use with a close approximation to in vivo target cellsmammalian hosts are equipped with innate immune mechanisms which launch immediate responses against viral infection this first line of defense prevents the establishment of successful infection and systemic spread and in many cases destroys invading viruses even before the adaptive arm of host immunity is mobilized a schematic diagram of the host innate immune signaling pathways is depicted in figure 2aupon viral infection infected host cells can sense the presence of both viruses and viral products by three main classes of host prrs 77 these are the endosomal toll-like receptors tlrs the cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene i rig-i-like receptors rlrs and the nucleo-oligomerization domain nod-like receptors nlrstlrs are found both in the endosomal and cell surface membranes while signaling mediated by most cell surface-localized tlrs induce only pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and not ifn expression activation of endosomal tlrs and a plasma membrane-resident tlr4 may lead to both 78 among the tlrs characterized to date those localized to endo-lysosomal compartments include tlr3 tlr7 tlr8 and tlr9 with each detecting distinct forms of viral nucleic acids on the other hand rlrs and nlrs are cytoplasmic sensors three types of rlrs have been identifiedretinoic acid-induced gene i rig-i melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 mda5 and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 lgp-2 79 nlrs are mostly associated with recognition of bacterial pamps 80 81 and will not be discussed further in this reviewwhile both tlrs and rlrs are capable of recognizing viral pamps particularly double-stranded rna dsrna they utilize different adaptor proteins to initiate their signaling cascade the tlr signal transduction pathways are dependent on either myeloid differentiation primary response 88 myd88 or tir domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon- trif 78 82 rlrs on the other hand utilize the mitochondrial activator of virus signaling mavsips-1visacardif as the essential signaling adaptor protein 79 83 tank-binding kinase 1 tbk1 and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-b kinase subunit epsilon ikk interact to relay signals to the critical transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 irf3 and nf-b leading to their phosphorylation and nuclear translocation 84 activation of these transcription factors as well as ap-1 then initiate transcription of type i ifns ifn- and ifn-the induction of ifn- and ifn- is one of the hallmarks of the host innate immune responses against invading viral pathogens these secreted soluble factors represent a family of antiviral cytokines which upon binding to their surface heterodimeric receptor composed of the ifnar1 and ifnar2 subunits leads to the activation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases janus kinase 1 jak1 and tyrosine kinase 2 tyk2 these kinases phosphorylate the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 stat1 and stat2 85 the phosphorylated stat1stat2 heterodimer then translocates into the nucleus where it interacts with irf9 to form ifn-stimulated gene factor 3 isgf3 this in turn binds to ifn-stimulated response elements isre in gene promoter regions leading to the expression of antiviral effectors known as ifn-stimulated genes isgs 8688 isgs function to restrict viral replication modulate other aspects of innate immunity and prime the adaptive immune response 89although type i ifns and isgs are the main host antiviral components and act as the first line of defense against viral infection type iii ifns such as ifn-s have recently been described to contribute to the host antiviral state as well as induce isg expression 90 type iii ifns share significant functional similarities with type i ifns all ifn-s bind a heterodimeric ifn- receptor complex ifnlr for signaling 91 while previous in vitro studies demonstrated that types i and iii ifns are co-produced in response to viral infection or the presence of pamps particularly nucleic acids which trigger both extracellular and intracellular sensors more recent in vivo experiments support the observation that mucosal infections appear to trigger predominantly ifn- expression and a low level of ifn- 92 93 consistent with this epithelial cells which protect the gi tract mucosal lining were found to be the main source of ifn- production during enteric virus infections 9496 indeed ifn- is known to be critical in controlling infection of epithelial cells by various enteric viruses including norovirus reovirus rotavirus adenovirus and murine cytomegalovirus 97 selectively high expression of ifnlrs on iecs in the gi tract argues for the indispensable contribution of type iii ifns to the initiation of early antiviral responses in this organ 95although the induction of types i and iii ifn pathways involves a great deal of overlap in the signaling cascade leading to establishment of a cellular antiviral state there are still differences in transcription factor requirements 90 98 while ifn regulatory factor irf-3-7 and nf-b are essential components for induction of both types i and iii ifns irf1 seems to play a unique role in the type iii ifn pathway 99 additionally unlike rlr-mediated type i ifn induction intracellular sensors of type iii ifn depend largely on peroxisomal mavs for a rapid but rather short-lived induction of ifn expression 100 101successful establishment of viral infections generally require the ability to evade antagonize or subvert innate immune responses indeed previous studies have shown that pedv infection inhibits type i ifn induction in several cell types such as marc-145 or porcine iecs 60 76 and exhibits relative resistance to ifn- by inducing the proteasome dependent degradation of stat1 73 these observations suggest that this virus has developed strategies to prevent the biological activities of ifns similarly pdcov has also demonstrated antagonism of ifn production in cell culture 66 the antiviral effects of ifn-s may also play a crucial and as-yet underappreciated role in both pedv and pdcov infection the mechanisms by which pedv- and pdcov-encoded proteins modulate components of the ifn induction pathways is summarized in figure 2b and will be discussed later in this reviewin addition to type i and iii ifn induction viral infection also results in the recruitment of innate immune cells such as dcs macrophages and natural killer nk cells to the site of infection 102 these innate immune cells not only provide immediate counterattacks against invading viruses but also present foreign antigens to t cells and prime adaptive immune responses via cytokine secretion 103dcs and macrophages are the two most prominent cellular components of innate immune responses given the essential role of both cell types in professional antigen presentation and immune cell activation it is important to gain a better understanding of the interaction of coronaviruses with these professional apcs a study with sars-cov demonstrated that although neither macrophages nor dcs were productively infected many phenotypic changes in cell viability expression of mhc class ii cd40 cd83 and cd86 and the ability to stimulate t cell proliferation were observed in these cells upon exposure to live virus 51 macrophages were both refractory to such stimuli and displayed diminished phagocytic activity whereas dcs were observed to display upregulated mhc class ii cd40 cd83 and cd86 expression as a consequence these sars-cov-primed dcs were able to efficiently stimulate allogenic t cell proliferationfor pedv however the data are still conflicting regarding the susceptibility of dcs to pedv infection 104 105 in vitro the classical pedv strain cv777 in contrast to sars-cov could productively infect both immature and mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells mo-dcs leading to the enhanced ability of mo-dcs to sample antigens and present them to t cells for t-cell activation 104 interestingly gao et al also observed that immature mo-dcs were more susceptible than mature mo-dcs to infection by cv777 possibly due to their higher rates of endocytosis and aminopeptidase n cd13 expression furthermore infected immature mo-dcs up-regulated cd1a cd8086 and sla-ii-dr which have been shown to enhance the cells antigen presentation function 106 107 up-regulation of cd1a cd8086 and sla-ii-dr was observed to a lesser extent for infected mature mo-dcs when cv777 infection was studied in vivo the virus was found to rapidly infect intestinal dcs 104 based on these observations gao et al suggested that both mo-dcs and intestinal dcs play a role in priming and promoting an effective response during pedv cv777 infectionin contrast a recent study by wang et al showed that pedv failed to undergo a productive replication in porcine mo-dcs 105 in spite of this infection activated transcription of type i ifn and chemokine interferon-inducible protein-10 ip-10 unfortunately the molecular mechanisms by which pedv triggered type i ifn and chemokine ip-10 expression in the absence of active virus replication and the implication of these cytokines in pedv pathogenesis and immunity remain to be determineddcs can also be exploited and hijacked by pedv as vehicles for viral transmission a recent study implicated porcine bone marrow-derived dcs in the dissemination of pedv from the swine nasal cavity to intestinal mucosa 108 supporting the hypothesis that pedv could be spread from infected pigs through airborne transmission this study also verified that pedv could enter porcine nasal epithelial cells necs via their apical side adjacent to the nasal mucosa and establish transient infection within the nasal cavity submucosal dcs residing near infected nasal epithelial cells necs then take up pedv from the lumen across the nasal mucosa via their extended cellular processes despite the lack of active viral replication in these dcs these virus-loaded dcs could subsequently transfer the viruses to t cells which then enter peripheral blood these recirculating t cells finally shuttle the viruses to the intestinal epithelium leading to typical pedv symptoms the utilization of dcs which are widely distributed in the mucosal lining of various tissues by pedv as carriers to overcome mucosal barriers and disseminate throughout the body is reminiscent of how many other viruses establish a foothold upon entering the host body 109112similarly the permissiveness of macrophages to pedv is still unclear lee et al showed that viral antigen could be detected in lamina propria-resident macrophages of infected pigs 113 there has also been one report of pedv infection in alveolar macrophages resulting in pneumonic lesions 38 despite these observations detection of viral replication in these cells has yet to be reportednk cells are responsible for cytotoxicity-mediated killing of virus-infected cells and are a major source of ifn- tnf- gm-csf and other cytokines and chemokines 114 115 the observation that pedv-infected neonatal and nursing piglets with more severe symptoms possessed lower nk cell numbers suggest for a potential role for nk cells in the host antiviral response to these pathogens 23 in their study annamalai et al showed that both quantitative and qualitative variation of nk cell properties can be observed in response to pedv infection in suckling and weaned pigs in uninfected animals suckling pigs which are much more susceptible to pedv have drastically lower nk cell numbers than weaned pigs in both the blood and the ileum upon infection significant ifn- production is observed from weaned pig nk cells unlike those of suckling pigs strangely frequencies of nk cells in the blood were found to be higher than in the ileum the primary site of pedv infection and became even more disproportionate during the course of infection in addition serum levels of ifn- il-12 and tnf- peaked at an earlier time point in infected suckling pigs indicating faster progression of disease when compared to those of weaned pigs and coincided with viral shedding and onset of diarrhea in both groups of pigs due to these disparate observations it remains to be seen whether nk cells play a direct antiviral function during pedv infectionit is worth pointing out that the increase in serum pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in both pedv infected suckling and weaned pigs mentioned above could reflect the outcome of the simultaneous induction of the key components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk cascade including erk12 and jnkp38 116 117 and the activation of nf-b pathway 72 118 during the pedv infection as shown in the context of other pathogenic infections 119 120 the concurrent activation of both mapk components and the transcription factor nf-b during pedv infection might lead to the upregulation of both pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines while the pedv n protein was described by xu et al as a virus-derived intermediate responsible for triggering the nf-b pathway activation the exact mechanism of mapk activation following pedv infection is still not determined it was demonstrated however that the pedv-mediated mapk activation enhanced the viral replication these findings argue for the notion that pedv to its advantage could manipulate host intracellular processes including the stimulation of the mapk cascade and the nf-b pathwayfor pdcov infections information remains extremely limited regarding the interplay with the cellular innate immune response there are some reports describing infiltration of macrophages lymphocytes eosinophils and neutrophils in the lamina propria of the small intestine during infection 14 121 122 however there is still a lack of any evidence regarding whether these innate immune cells actually engage in anti-pdcov responses and what such responses might bensp1 is only present in alpha- and betacoronaviruses 2 137 despite its relatively small size at 110 amino acids in length nsp1 shows great genetic sequence variation among alphacoronaviruses 138 139 which may account for its functional versatility and the ability to interact with a number of host innate immune signaling molecules like the sars-cov nsp1 pedv nsp1 was shown to be a potent ifn antagonist interfering with both irf- and nf-b-mediated induction of type i and iii ifns 60 61 74 these effects occur through either enhancing degradation of or inhibiting nuclear translocation of host key signaling molecules involved in ifn gene activation such as the creb-binding protein cbp 60 which forms part of the promoter-binding enhanceosome complex with nf-b ap-1 a complex of activating transcription factor 2 atf2 and jun and homodimers or heterodimers of irf3 and irf7 140 pedv nsp1 promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of cbp which renders ifnb gene transcription induction less effective as binding of the enhanceosome to the ifnb gene promoter is more stable than any of its components alone 141pedv nsp1 is also known to impede nuclear translocation of nf-b affecting not only production of ifn- but also proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf- il-1 il-6 il-15 and il-17 61 this occurs through inhibition of ib phosphorylation and its subsequent ubiquitin-mediated degradation which are required for nf-b transport to the nucleus where it can then bind to target sequences and initiate transcription 142144 the activity of nsp1 against ib was also found to block nuclear translocation of the p65 also named rela subunit of nf-b preventing the dimer formation between rela and the p50 subunit of nf-b p50rela important for nf-b signaling taken together the pedv nsp1-mediated inhibition of type i ifns and pro-inflammatory cytokines through suppression of nf-b activity argue for the antiviral potential of these cytokines during the early stage of pedv infectionpedv nsp1 also modulates type iii ifn responses in iecs 74 in pedv-infected ipec-dq llc-pk1 and marc-145 cells nsp1 was observed to block nuclear translocation of irf1 and reduced the number of peroxisomes where peroxisomal mavs link rlr signaling to type iii ifn induction furthermore the observed reduction in the number of peroxisomes and irf1-mediated ifn- suppression were dependent on the conserved amino acid residues of pedv nsp1 this intriguing insight into pedv interference with the type iii ifn pathway should pave the way for future studies elucidating the as-yet underappreciated role for ifn- in the control of porcine enteritis coronavirus infectionin coronaviruses the plpro domain of nsp3 and the 3clpro domain of nsp5 facilitate viral replication by processing pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein precursors into nsps it has also been demonstrated that many human and animal coronavirus-derived proteases mediate negative regulation of host antiviral innate immunity previous studies showed that the plpro of the human coronaviruses sars-cov and nl63-cov antagonize innate immune induction of type i ifns via de-ubiquitinationdeisgylation of nf-b signaling molecules inhibition of irf3 activation and nuclear translocation and blocking ubiquitination of sting and disrupting its dimerization 145147 xing et al recently demonstrated that the pedv plpro domain plp2 also interferes with rig-i- and sting-mediated type i ifn activation 148 through de-ubiquitinating activity preventing the post-translational modification of rig-i by lys63-linked ubiquitination that is essential for rig-i-mediated signaling 149 similar to rig-i ubiquitination of sting is critical for expression of downstream antiviral genes 150 151 accordingly pedv plp2-mediated de-ubiquitination of rig-i and sting leads to abrogation of downstream signaling and inhibition of type i ifn expressionthe 3clpro of both pedv and pdcov encoded by the nsp5 gene have also been shown to antagonize innate immune signaling through proteolytic cleavage of host key signaling molecules 152154 wang et al provided evidence that pedv nsp5 disrupts type i ifn signaling by cleaving a critical adaptor protein the nf-b essential modulator nemo also called ikk which bridges the nf-b and irf signaling pathways by triggering nf-b and irf3 nuclear translocation and eventual induction of ifn- production 79 155 156 highly conserved histidine 41 his41 and cysteine 144 cys144 of pedv nsp5 were identified as the catalytic dyad responsible for protease activity of nsp5 and suppression of ifn- induction similarly pdcov nsp5 also inhibits ifn- production through the cleavage of nemo and its protease activity dominates its ability to antagonize ifn- induction 154 interestingly nsp5 of both pedv and pdcov target the glutamine 231 q231 of nemo suggesting that nsp5 proteolytic cleavage of nemo is highly conserved and specific in both coronaviruses this is in contrast to cleavage of nemo by 3c or 3c-like proteases of other viruses such as the foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv hepatitis a virus hav and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv which cleave nemo at q383 q304 and e349 respectively 157159in addition to pdcov nsp5 inhibition of ifn- induction the protein also antagonizes type i ifn signaling downstream of ifn receptors by targeting the jak-stat pathway 153 zhu et al demonstrated that pdcov nsp5 cleaves stat2 one of the components of isgf3 disrupting the function of the isgf3 complex in initiating the isg-mediated antiviral state they also discovered that stat2 cleavage activity is probably unique to pdcov nsp5 as no other coronavirus nsp5 including those from pedv tgev sars-cov mers-cov hcov-229e hcov-oc43 and hcov-nl63 could catalyze stat2 cleavage interestingly while pedv infection leads to no cleavage of stat2 it is capable of both promoting degradation and interrupting activation of stat1 without inhibiting stat1 transcription 73 in their study guo et al showed that pedv infected veroe6 and ipec-j2 cells had diminished stat1 levels when compared to those in uninfected cells unlike pdcov-mediated stat2 cleavage pedv infection-induced stat1 degradation relies on the ubiquitin-proteasome system furthermore although stat1 degradation was confirmed in pedv-infected cells it remains to be seen whether any pedv proteins are the main culprits responsible for this processalthough a great deal of evidence supports the notion that coronavirus accessory proteins function in hostpathogen interactions and mediate viral pathogenesis during coronavirus infection in vivo 33 160 emerging studies have begun to shed light on the interplay between these accessory proteins and the host innate immune system arguing for their possible role in the regulation of host antiviral responses 161164 notable immune regulation activity has been reported for coronavirus accessory proteins 3b p3b 6 p6 and 9b p9b of sars-cov translated from orf3 orf6 and orf9 respectively orf4a and orf4b of mers-cov and ns2 of mouse hepatitis virus mhv 36 163170the possible role of pedvs sole accessory protein orf3 in host innate immune regulation remains as enigmatic as its role in pathogenesis so far only one study has directly implicated the pedv orf3 protein in suppression of type i ifn induction in vitro with overexpression of orf3 resulting in anti-ifn activity as assayed by a luciferase reporter assay 60 many groups have however proposed a role for orf3 in virus growth and replication 171175 as some strains of cell-adapted pedv display either internal truncation or amino acid sequence variation in the orf3 gene 172 175 176 as these changes are generally seen after adaptation to ifn-deficient vero cells there is a possibility that future work may link orf3 more strongly to modulation of the innate immune responsefor pdcov three accessory proteins have been identified namely ns6 ns7 and ns7a 11 30 31 the function of these proteins in viral replication pathogenesis and immune regulation remain mostly unclear ns6 has recently been shown to antagonize the host innate immune response 35 similar to sars-cov accessory proteins orf6 and orf9b pdcov ns6 was identified as being virion-associated and an inhibitor of ifn- expression 30 163 177 178 ns6 acts by blocking the recognition or binding of dsrna by rig-i or mda5 likely by directly binding to either the c-terminal domain ctd of rig-i or the helicase domain and ctd of mda-5 or both as its ability to bind to viral rna was not observed 35in addition to its indispensable role in virus entry into the target cell through receptor binding and subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes a recent study by yang et al revealed the newly discovered role of the pedv s protein in the impairment of the anti-pedv activity of type i ifn 180 yang et al demonstrated that pedv both live and killed through direct interaction between the s protein and epidermal growth factor receptor egfr induced egfr activation which in turn augmented pedv infection they further demonstrated that by acting via one of its downstream signaling pathways namely jak2-stat3 the egfr activation helped to enhance and facilitate pedv replication it is worth pointing out that while the roles of egfr signaling in the cell to cell communication as well as the transformation of various types of cancer were well documented 181 182 its involvement in facilitating pedv infections through the suppression of type i ifn-mediated antiviral response is in accordance with previous findings described in studies of other viruses 183185 although direct binding of the pedv s protein to egfr is sufficient to trigger both the egfr activation and the attenuation of type i ifn activity further studies are still needed to identify the underlying mechanisms leading to the crosstalk between both egfr and type i ifn signalspedv e protein is a small 7-kda membrane protein encoded by the e gene which is located downstream of pedv orf1a and orf1b the protein plays an important role during coronavirus budding 29 xu et al demonstrated that the e protein could induce er stress in transfected cells through up-regulation of glucose-regulated protein 78 grp78 a marker of er stress and activation of nf-b coinciding with e protein localization to the er 71 they also speculated that e protein-mediated activation of nf-b in turn would up-regulate expression of the neutrophil chemotactic factor il-8 as well as the anti-apoptotic protein bcl2 contributing to both an inflammatory response and persistent pedv infection whether the effects above recapitulate what really happens in pedv-infected iecs is still unknownunlike the e protein pedv m is equally distributed throughout the whole cell instead of being localized mainly in the er 179 compared to overexpression of pedv structural e protein which was not found to have any effect on iec growth and cell cycle pedv m altered iec growth and induced cell cycle arrest in the s-phase via the cyclin a pathway m protein expression neither promoted il-8 up-regulation nor nf-b activation in transfected iecs probably due to the lack of er stress-inducing effectsamong the 20 mature proteins encoded in pedv genome the n protein is the most abundant protein in virus-infected cells and acts as a multifunctional protein involved in viral genome organization virus assembly cell cycle regulation apoptosis induction host stress response and translational shutoff 186 187 similar to the e protein pedv n is also localized to the er er subcellular localization of both e and n but not m might account for the ability of both proteins to cause er stress via il-8 up-regulation and nf-b activation 188 189consistent with the induction of the nf-b pathway in iecs cao et al recently elucidated a possible mechanism for n protein-mediated nf-b activation they demonstrated that over-expressing pedv n protein in iecs mediated nf-b activation through tlr2 tlr3 and tlr9 pathways as sirna silencing of these tlrs dramatically blocked pedv-induced nf-b activation 118 xu et al also discovered that pedv n not only induced er stress via up-regulation of il-8 bcl-2 and nf-b activation but also inhibited cell growth by prolonging the s phase stage of cell cycle and cyclin a degradation 72 enhancement of nf-b signaling is thought to be mediated through the immunodominant central region of n 118in contrast to the enhancement of nf-b signaling observed by both xu et al and cao et al another recent study showed that pedv n inhibits ifn- production and isg expression by competing with irf3 for tbk1 binding 190 this interaction inhibited both irf3 activation and the production of type i ifns in accordance with this pedv n along with e and m was shown to down-regulate both ifn- and irf3 promoter activity in vitro 60 as previously mentioned by co-transfecting the plasmids expressing pedv e m and n protein with either pifn--luc or pirf3-luc plasmid in hela cells zhang et al observed a down-regulation of both the ifn- promoter and irf3-dependent luciferase activity the results of this study suggest that the irf3 signaling pathway is interfered in the suppression of the ifn- production by pedv e m and n protein interestingly this molecular mechanism is distinct from ifn suppression mediated by the n proteins of other coronaviruses such as sars-cov where n blocks an early step in ifn- production probably sensor recognition of viral rna 191 and mhv where n targets rnase l activity 192the discrepancies observed with the effects of pedv n on ifn- and nf-b induction as well as the distinct molecular mechanisms it uses to modulate innate immune responses point to the possibility that n protein interacts with multiple host signaling molecules involved in various host signaling pathways taken together the fact that n proteins of different coronaviruses employ different mechanisms to interfere with multiple innate signaling pathways clearly demonstrates the adaptability and coevolution of each coronavirus to a specific host and its associated innate immune pressureharnessing fast-acting antiviral mechanisms of innate immunity has shown promising results in combating a variety of pathogenic viruses stimulation of tlr signaling pathways via the use of tlr agonists for example has been shown to be an effective means for treating certain viral infections the use of tlr agonists as innate immune modulators was validated in a study where treatment of vaginal mucosa with a tlr-3 agonist protected mice against genital herpes simplex virus-2 challenge 193 furthermore triggering of another endosomal tlr tlr-7 via systemic administration of a selective tlr7 agonist also elicited anti-hepatitis c virus activity in a clinical setting 194 direct correlation between such antiviral status and upregulation of ifn production in response to tlr agonist treatment was demonstrated by cervantes-barragan et al where type i ifns were found to play a dominant role in tlr-mediated antiviral effects 195 in their study pdcs were identified as the major source of type i ifn when induced through tlr-7 stimulation while rapid type i ifn production in pdcs was observed following infection with mouse hepatitis virus mhv a betacoronavirus its induction was abrogated in tlr7 or myd88 mhv-infected mice indicating that mhv-mediated type i ifn induction in pdcs was triggered via the tlr7myd88 pathway these observations suggest that the presence of functional type i ifn-producing pdcs in swine gi tracts during exposure to pedv andor pdcov may help to restrict replication of these viruses and thereby regulate the magnitude of clinical severityin addition to the induction of antiviral mechanisms via tlr agonists modulation of the innate immune pathway has also been attempted with synthetic polypeptides harboring innate immune modulatory activities 196 in this study the recombinant polypeptide n-card-ptd was generated by fusing the n-terminal nuclear localization signal nls of histone h2b the caspase recruitment domain card of mavs and a protein transduction domain ptd like the tlr agonists discussed previously these recombinant fusion polypeptides induced strong production of type i ifns albeit via a pathway distinct from tlr-mediated signaling in addition to its potent immunomodulatory function n-card ptd also augmented immune responses against influenza virus challenge in a mouse model whether systemic or local administration of such immunomodulatory polypeptides can restrict pedv and pdcov infection in swine is an intriguing question that remains to be exploredtaking advantage of the knowledge that type i ifns confer immediate and powerful antiviral responses several groups of investigators have demonstrated the use of adenovirus type 5 ad5 vector-mediated ectopic expression of porcine ifns or a constitutively active fusion protein of porcine irf3 and irf7 poirf735d for rapid cross protection against foot-and-mouth disease virus fmdv 197202 while ad5 vector-based expression of ifns were found to be potent in the control of fmdv infection relatively high doses of recombinant ad5 viruses were required restricting large-scale application as well as use in emergencies the efficacy of ad5 as a biotherapeutic was notably higher when expressing the poirf735d fusion protein achieving prolonged systemic anti-fmdv activity and upregulation of isgs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc in inoculated swine 202 the proof of concept use of ad5-poirf735d in the protection of swine against fmdv points to the possibility that gi tract-targeted expression of type i ifns as well as irf735d could be successfully used to restrict both pedv and pdcov furthermore by utilizing similar virus vector-based platforms regulated and organ-specific expression of type iii ifn could potentially be harnessed to protect against pedv and pdcov infectionthe combination of reverse genetics technology to generate recombinant infectious cdna clones and our growing understanding of viral protein functions in modulating innate immune responses can also lead to the design of more effective candidate vaccines ifn antagonism by non-structural structural and accessory proteins of pedv andor pdcov such as nsp1 nsp3 nsp5 e m n and ns6 can potentially be attenuated by deletion or truncation of these genes leading to the generation of live attenuated vaccines consistent with this idea disruption or mutation of the sars-cov e gene has been a strategy used to generate promising live attenuated sars-cov vaccines 203 204 furthermore a tgev strain with a deleted e gene tgev-e was also put forth as a potential vaccine candidate demonstrating the ability to target mucosal tissue and induce secretory immunity 205 despite these observations the potential of attenuated pedv and pdcov carrying a disrupted e gene or any other genes as vaccine candidates await further investigationgiven the critical role of many innate immune mediators particularly the ifn system in alleviating severe clinical symptoms eliminating viral infection and enhancing vaccine immunogenicity innate immune machineries may prove powerful tools for tackling a broad range of viral diseases indeed the studies described above accentuate the value and effectiveness of harnessing our knowledge regarding these machineries in antiviral strategiesto establish productive infection invading viruses need to overcome their hosts first line of defense the innate immune response though competent and effective in protecting the host against most microorganisms this response is still susceptible to antagonism and subversion by pathogenic viruses porcine enteritis coronaviruses pedv and pdcov which have recently emerged as important swine pathogens have evolved strategies to overcome host innate immunity by either avoiding being recognized by prrs inhibiting ifn induction or antagonizing ifn signaling and antiviral effector machinery while current research has provided copious amounts of invaluable data on how other coronaviruses such as sars-cov target molecules involved in the host innate immune response studies dedicated to host-pedv and pdcov interaction have just started to gain tractionalthough both pedv and pdcov target pig enterocytes in the intestinal villi the most common in vitro cell culture systems used to study these viruses are not derived from porcine iecs both newly derived porcine iec lines and the availability of three-dimensional intestinal organoids will undoubtedly serve as alternative and more physiologically relevant models for future studies of pedv- and pdcov-host interaction furthermore more in-depth study of pedv and pdcov pathogenesis in vivo will provide less biased data to identify novel host innate immune modulators in the context of viral infectiondue to their prominent early antiviral function much attention has been dedicated to type i ifns while the defensive roles of type i ifns in pedv and pdcov infection are indisputable the importance of type iii ifns cannot be ignored as type iii ifns are selectively expressed by epithelial cells of the intestinal villi in response to viral infection its roles in anti-pedv and pdcov responses warrant a more thorough investigationthe development of novel and effective mucosal adjuvants and delivery systems may be key to successful pedv and pdcov vaccine design for the induction of mucosal immunity lactogenic immunity and possibly active immunity in newborn piglets ultimately deeper understanding of host early anti-pedv and pdcov response will help pave the way to harness our understanding of innate immunity for the development of therapeutic interventions and novel antiviral compoundsthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestthe outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is rapidly spreading across the world and have caused a global health emergency 1 patients infected with sars-cov-2 have mainly displayed pneumonia-associated symptoms including fever cough shortness of breath sputum production and myalgia or fatigue 2 3 indicating that sars-cov-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract and causes acute respiratory disease however sars-cov-2 infection may result in symptoms of diseases associated with other tissues such as digestive diarrhea poor appetite nausea and vomiting nervous confusion and headache and cardiovascular palmus chest distress and cardiac injury systems 2 3 in addition some studies have indicated that person-to-person transmission of sars-cov-2 can occur by routes outside of the respiratory tract 4 a study of 99 patients infected with sars-cov-2 showed that females were less susceptible to infection than males and older males with comorbidities were more likely to be infected with sars-cov-2 3 like sars-related coronavirus sars-cov 5 sars-cov-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a host cell receptor 68 a recent study uncovered that ace2-expressing lung cells were more abundant in asian males 9 potentially explaining the elevated susceptibility of males to sars-cov-2 infection nevertheless the findings from that study are not sufficiently convincing due to a small number of samples being analyzedin this study we analyzed the expression of ace2 in various normal human tissues using the datasets from the genotype-tissue expression gtex project 10 and the cancer genome atlas tcga program httpsportalgdccancergov we compared ace2 expression levels across 31 human tissues between males and females and between younger and older persons in these individual tissues furthermore we analyzed the correlations between ace2 expression levels and immune signature enrichment levels in individual tissueswe downloaded the gtex rna-seq gene expression profiling datasets rsem normalized for 31 human normal tissues from the ucsc xena project httpsxenabrowsernetdatapages we downloaded the tcga rna-seq gene expression profiling datasets rsem normalized for 12 human normal tissues from the genomic data commons data portal httpsportalgdccancergov all gene expression values were added to 0001 and then log2-transformed before analysiswe defined the enrichment level of an immune signature in tissue as the mean expression level of marker genes of the immune signature in the tissue we analyzed four immune signatures including cd8 t cells interferon response b cells and natural killer nk cells the cd8 t cell marker genes included cd2 cd247 cd28 cd3d cd3e cd3g cd8a icam1 itgal itgb2 ptprc and thy1 11 the interferon response marker genes included ifit1 ifit2 ifit3 irf7 isg20 mx1 mx2 rsad2 tnfsf10 gpr146 selp and ahr 12 the b cell marker genes included bach2 bank1 blk btla cd79a cd79b fcrl1 fcrl3 hvcn1 and ralgps2 12 the nk cell marker genes included klrc1 and klrf1 12we used pearsons correlation test to calculate the correlations between ace2 expression levels and immune signature enrichment levels in individual tissues we used a students t test two-sided to compare ace2 expression levels between males and females between younger ages  49 years and older ages  49 years persons and between asian and non-asian races in individual tissues the adjusted p value estimated by the benjamini and hochberg method 13 was used to adjust for multiple testsamong the 31 gtex human tissues the small intestine testis kidneys heart thyroid and adipose tissue had the highest ace2 expression levels while blood spleen bone marrow brain blood vessels and muscle had the lowest ace2 expression levels fig 1a in the lungs colon liver bladder and adrenal gland ace2 showed medium expression levels fig 1a these results suggest that ace2 is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues in addition to the lungs
furthermore the human protein atlas hpa database httpwwwproteinatlasorg showed that the ace2 protein had relatively high expression levels in the duodenum small intestine gallbladder kidneys testis seminal vesicle colon rectum and adrenal gland the hpa database also showed that the gastrointestinal tract duodenum small intestine colon and rectum kidney gallbladder and male tissues testis and seminal vesicle had high expression levels of both ace2 gene and proteintaken together these data indicate that i sars-cov-2 may infect other human tissues in addition to lungs and ii males may be more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection than femaleswe further compared ace2 expression levels between males and females in 22 individual human tissues using the gtex datasets and found no statistically significant difference between males and females in any tissue using a threshold of adjusted p value  005 and fold change  15 fig 1b we also compared ace2 expression levels between younger ages  49 years and older ages  49 years populations and did not observe a statistically significant difference between the groups in any tissue with a threshold of adjusted p value  005 and fold change  15 fig 1b likewise in tcga datasets ace2 was not differentially expressed between males and females or between younger and older groups in any tissue fig 1c consistent with the results in gtex in tcga we also compared ace2 expression levels between asian and non-asian races in five normal tissues stomach thyroid breast liver and pancreas and did not find a significant difference between them in any tissue fig 1cwe analyzed the correlations between ace2 expression levels and immune signature enrichment levels cd8 t cells interferon response b cells and nk cells in various male and female human tissues in the skin digestive system esophagus stomach colon and pancreas brain and blood vessels we observed significant positive correlations between ace2 expression levels and cd8 t cell enrichment levels in both males and females pearsons correlation test adjusted p  005 027  r  078 fig 2a in addition in the thyroid lungs adrenal gland liver and kidneys ace2 expression levels showed significant positive correlations with cd8 t cell enrichment levels solely in males 020  r  068 however in the thyroid and lungs ace2 expression levels were negatively correlated with cd8 t cell enrichment levels in females r  -036 in the heart ace2 expression levels had a negative and a positive correlation with cd8 t cell enrichment levels in males r  -023 and females r  032 respectively likewise the interferon response signature had significant positive correlations with ace2 expression levels in the skin digestive system esophagus stomach liver and pancreas brain and blood vessels in both males and females 014  r  075 fig 2a in the thyroid lungs kidneys adrenal gland colon and bladder ace2 expression levels had significant positive correlations with the interferon response signature solely in males 032  r  082 in contrast in the thyroid lungs and colon ace2 expression levels were negatively correlated with the interferon response signature in females -026  r  -020 in the heart ace2 expression levels had a negative and a positive correlation with the interferon response signature in males r  -018 and females r  054 respectively similar results were observed for b cells and nk cells fig 2a collectively these results demonstrate the commonality and distinction in the association of ace2 expression with immune signatures between males and females
we further analyzed the correlations between ace2 expression and immune signatures in younger and older populations in most individual tissues the correlations between ace2 expression levels and immune signature enrichment levels displayed consistent trends between younger and older populations however in the lungs they had a positive and a negative correlation in the older and younger groups respectively fig 2b again these results suggest the potential difference in the host immune response to coronavirus infection between young and old personswe analyzed the expression of ace2 the gene encoding the human host cell receptor of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov in 31 normal human tissues to the best of our knowledge this is the first study investigating ace2 expression across a wide variety of human tissues we found that although the inflammation of the lungs is the primary symptom of patients with sars-cov-2 infection the lungs had moderate expression of ace2 among all tissues this indicates that sars-cov-2 may affect other tissues in addition to the lungs including male tissues testis and seminal vesicle this indication has been confirmed by recent publications 24 for example holshue et al uncovered that stool from a patient infected with sars-cov-2 was positive for sars-cov-2 suggesting that this virus may infect the gastrointestinal tract 5 huang et al reported the virus-related cardiac injury in five patients with sars-cov-2 infection 2 a study of 99 cases of sars-cov-2-related pneumonia revealed the increased susceptibility of males to infection by this virus 3 in fact many cases of sars-cov-2 have reported symptoms outside of pneumonia including diarrhea nausea vomiting confusion headache and cardiac injury 24 in addition the predominant symptoms of patients infected with sars-cov-2 could be attributed to the fact that the respiratory tract is the readiest transmission approach for the viruswe found that ace2 expression levels showed no significant difference between males and females between younger and older persons or between asian and non-asian races this indicates that the infection risk of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov may have no significant association with sex age or race in fact like sars-cov 14 sars-cov-2 can affect males and females equally and can infect young and old persons equally 15 nevertheless the mortality risk for sars-cov-2 and sars-cov infections appears to be associated significantly with sex and age with a higher risk for males versus females and old versus young populations 3 14 16adaptive and innate immune responses play an important role in fighting off invading coronavirus even though they may induce a cytokine storm which is responsible for the immunopathological damage in patients with coronavirus infections 17 interestingly while inflammation of the lungs pneumonia is the most common disease caused by coronavirus the correlations between expression of the ace2 receptor and immune signatures in the lungs differed between males and females and between young and old persons this indicates that the host immune response to coronavirus infection could differ between males and females and between young and old persons partially explaining why males and females and young and old persons have markedly distinct clinical outcomes of coronavirus infections 3 18 in addition it has been demonstrated that lung cells highly expressing ace2 are more readily infected by sars-cov 19 we found that the correlation between ace2 expression and immune signatures was negative in the lung tissue of females and younger persons but it was positive in the lung tissue of males and older persons collectively this means that i if the lungs highly expressing ace2 are infected by sars-cov-2 in females or young persons they will have weaker immune signatures and ii if the lungs highly expressing ace2 are infected by sars-cov-2 in males or older persons they will have stronger immune signatures this suggests that an excessive immune response cytokine storm or immunopathological damage could be more likely to occur in males and old persons with sars-cov or sars-cov-2 infectionthis work provides some basis for our next-step investigation of ace2 expression at protein level to understand the potential mechanism of interaction between sars-cov2 and ace2 we will explore the possible enrichment and viability of sars-cov2 in different tissues alongside different expression level of ace2 we will try to clarify the survival death transfer and transformation of sars-cov-2 in different tissue niches and explore the virus in vivo inactivation in human body during and after epidemic in addition our pilot data suggest that cigarette smoke or nicotine inhalation inhibits the expression of ace2at2r in multiple tissues including the brain heart and lungs thus disrupting the balance within the renin-angiotensin systemour study has several limitations first the findings from the bioinformatics analysis need to be further validated by experimental and clinical data in particular because mrna expression pattern of ace-2 is not necessarily the same as its protein expression pattern across tissues due to some factors probably affecting the mapping from mrna level to protein level such as post-translational modification the validation of our mrna-based findings at protein level is important and worth further investigation second the tissue mrna expression did not capture the mrna expression in individual cell types that would be important for precisely understanding the virus-host interaction an analysis of the single-cell rna-seq data may address this issue however because the single-cell rna-seq data across such a wide variety of human tissues are lacking it is not realistic to perform such an analysis third the comparison of ace2 expression levels between asian and non-asian races in tcga datasets was performed in a small number of samples and thus the associated results need to be verified in larger populations finally our data cannot explain the epidemic divergence between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov in that sars-cov-2 is less virulent but more infectious than sars-cov an in-depth analysis of the genomic and protein structures of both coronaviruses would warrant exploring the mechanism underlying the epidemic divergence between sars-cov-2 and sars-covace2 is expressed in various human tissues in addition to the lungs indicating that sars-cov-2 may infect other tissues aside from the lungs ace2 expression levels have no significant differences between males and females between young and old persons and between asian and non-asian races in various human tissues indicating that sars-cov-2 may infect persons with different sexes ages and races equally the correlations between ace2 expression and immune signatures differ between males and females and between young and old persons in the lungs indicating that the different host immune responses to sars-cov-2 infection may partially explaining why males and females and young and old persons infected with this virus have markedly distinct disease severity this study provides new insights into the role of ace2 in the sars-cov-2 pandemic and insights into understanding the associations of symptoms sex age and race with sars-cov-2 infectionover the past two decades the world has experienced three acute lower respiratory tract outbreaks caused by coronaviruses those were the epidemic severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus cov the epidemic middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and  presently  the pandemic coronavirus infection disease covid-19 or sars-cov-2 initially known as the 2019-novel n-cov mainly prevalent in china and hong kong between 2002 and 2003 sars-cov infection resulted in 8100 cases and more than 770 deaths with a case fatality rate cfr of about 1013 the intermediate host was shown to be the civets4 mers-cov infection on the other hand was predominantly prevalent in the middle east 20122014 and caused over 850 cases resulting in approximately 350 deaths with a cfr of about 385 the intermediate host of mers-cov was identified to be dromedary6 in december 2019 sars-cov-2 infection began to spread from wuhan hubei china and by march 11 who declared covid-19 a pandemic when the number of cases was increased 13 times outside china than the initial number of cases reporting more than 118000 infections and triple the number of countries primarily involved 114 countries with over 4000 deaths7 as of june 16 2020 there were approximately 79 million confirmed cases reported from 210 countries and territories around the world claiming over 450000 lives7 on that date almost one third of the world confirmed cases and death toll were reported in usa alone7 so far the crude cfr is around 65 lower than that of the other two coronavirus pandemics7 although yet to be fully realized the intermediate host of sars-cov-2 is thought to be pangolin8 it is speculated that like sars-cov and mers-cov the natural host is bats9the chinese center for disease control and prevention cdc divided the clinical manifestations of the disease severity into mild non- or mild-pneumonia occurred in 81 of the cases severe dyspnea 30min respiratory frequency 93 blood oxygen saturation andor more than 50 lung infiltrates within 12 days in 14 of the cases and critical respiratory failure septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunction or failure in 5 of the cases10 in addition to the common systemic symptoms eg fever and fatigue covid-19 manifest in respiratory symptoms that range from mild dry cough difficulty in breathing hypoxemia to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome  ards and acute respiratory or multiple organ failure table 1 covid-19 can also cause severe pneumonia with clinical manifestations biomarker profile and lung imaging similar to that observed in sars-cov13 some severe cases experience acute myocardial injury sepsis andor fungal infection1112 severe clinical symptoms may eventually lead to death
this article explores our current knowledge of the common and different characteristics of the coronavirus epidemic sars-cov and mers-cov and pandemic sars-cov-2 infections emerged over the past two decades special emphasis is directed to understanding the pathogenhost interaction in disease symptomatology and severity the development of innate immunity-related hypercytokinemia and the influence of the subsequent inflammation on disease outcome our current understanding of covid-19 together with the knowledge gained from sars-cov and mers-cov infections would permit developing new avenues of approach for disease prevention and treatment and can define effective public health measures to control the spread of covid-19 and other coronavirus-related diseasessars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 are all enveloped positive-sense rna viruses belonging to the coronaviridae family orthocoronavirinae subfamily  genus that mainly cause lower respiratory tract infections in humans1315 sars-cov-2 genome is in 80 homology with sars-cov and 50 with mers-cov but it is 96 homologous with coronavirus isolated from the giant bats in yunnan9 typically the coronavirus genome is 2632 kilobases in length with a highly conservative basic structure sars-cov-2 genome was reported to be 29829 ribonucleotides in length16 in general the coronavirus genome utilizes approximately 67 of the sequence to encode rna polymerase that plays a role in viral protein processing unwinding and replication and blocking host cell protein synthesis91317 the remaining genome however encodes other structural and accessory proteins414 sars-cov-2 has evolved two subtypes a more infectious l-type and the primary s-type18 the different virus subtypes may have a critical role in disease spread and can influence vaccine development and disease therapyin humans coronavirus pathogenesis and infectivity are related to a specific binding between the virus spike s-protein a glycoprotein that exists as a trimer on the surface of the envelope lipid layer and a protease receptor on the human cell surface19 in sars-cov and mers-cov the human cells receptors respectively are angiotensin i converting enzyme 2 ace22021 and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 also known as adenosine deaminase complexing protein 2 or cluster of differentiation 26 cd2622 ace2 is also identified as the cell surface receptor for sars-cov-2 s-protein17 dpp4 the receptor for mers-cov is expressed ubiquitously in many tissues  endothelia and epithelia  including but not limited to kidney liver lung intestine and interestingly also on immune cells eg t cells activated natural killer nk cells and myeloid cells23 dpp4 is known to play a major role in glucose metabolism which may explain the high prevalence of diabetes observed in severe mers-cov cases2425 ace2 the receptor for sars-cov and sars-cov-2 although ubiquitously present in many tissues it is primarily expressed in the epithelial cells of the tracheobronchial tree and respiratory system kidneys digestive tract cardiovascular system and skin26 ace2 is a membrane protein with protease activity that plays a critical role in the regulation of blood pressure by catalyzing the cleavage of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin ii into the vasodilator angiotensin 17 to antagonize the potentiating function of ace127 attenuation of pulmonary ace2 activity was found to impair bradykinin and facilitate lipopolysaccharide lps-induced neutrophil infiltration28 such a process has long been known to be sufficient to induce respiratory symptoms eg airflow obstruction and increased airway hyperreactivity and inflammation eg expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines29 it is apparent therefore that the elevated ace2 expression in lung tissue plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of the acute outcome of infection caused by sars-cov and sars-cov-2 indeed since ace2 is the same receptor for both viral conditions they may share the same target organs pathogenic mechanisms clinical manifestations and  possibly  treatment optionsfollowing the binding of viral s-protein to human cell receptor the viral membrane fuses with the human cell membrane permitting entry of the viral genome to human cells the receptor-binding domain rbd of s-protein determines its binding affinity to the human cell surface receptor an observation that can be employed in vaccine development in the determined effort to develop a sars-cov-2 vaccine the molecular structure of its s-protein has been mapped30 it was found that the predominant state of the trimer has one of the rbds rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation and binds ace2 with higher affinity 10- to 20-fold than does sars-cov s-protein16 such higher affinity between the s-protein and ace2 in sars-cov-2 compared to sars-cov may help explain the elevated infectivity and rapid person-to-person spread of sars-cov-2 relative to sars-cova comparative and systematic genetic analysis of ace2 gene in different populations was conducted recently31 the coding-region variants in ace2 may affect the expression of ace2 receptors this study indicated no evidence of coronavirus s-protein binding-resistant ace2 mutants in different populations however the data of variant distribution and allele frequencies were thought to contribute to the role of ace2 in acute lung injury and lung function31 the study also concluded that east asian populations have much higher allele frequency in the expression quantitative trait loci eqtls the genomic loci that explain variation in mrna expression levels variants associated with higher ace2 expression in tissues this was suggested to influence different levels of susceptibility or response to sars-cov-2 in different populations under similar conditions this observation warrants the need for further population-based genetic epidemiological studies on the potential effect of variants in the functional coding region of ace2 among different populations to characterize its role in the spread of covid-19 disease severity and response to treatmentcoronavirus infections were shown to induce massive synthesis and release of cytokines and chemokines and lead to non-specific activation of mononuclear macrophages that  in a positive feedback loop  further release high levels of cytokines see below such an excessive synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infections and also a number of chronic diseases results in a state of hypercytokinemia also known as cytokine storm32 and can lead to severe outcome eg multiple organ failure33 pneumonia cases from sars-cov and mers-cov were invariably accompanied by extensive inflammatory cell infiltration and hypercytokinemia leading to acute lung injury ards and death34 current evidence suggests that severe covid-19 cases have significantly elevated levels of cytokines  compared to non-severe cases  similar to that observed in sars-cov and mers-cov interleukins such as il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf c-x-c motif chemokine 10 cxcl10 also known as interferon gamma-induced protein 10 ip-10 monocyte chemoattractant protein mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha mip1a and tumor necrosis factor  tnf were particularly and significantly elevated in severe covid-19 cases35 other inflammatory factors such as il-1 il-1ra il-7 il-8 il-9 fibroblast growth factor fgf granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf interferon  ifn platelet-derived growth factor pdgf and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf were also increased35 several studies reported elevated levels of il-6 in non-survival or critically-ill cases compared to survivals or those with a mild outcome113637 furthermore severe covid-19 cases with ards and hypercoagulation leading to thrombosis thrombocytopenia and gangrene had persistent very high levels of erythematosus sedimentation rate esr and c-reactive protein crp accompanied by elevated levels of il-6 tnf il-1 il-8 and il2r38the extensive synthesis of cytokines is known to stimulate massive proliferation of monocyte-macrophages and induce excessive apoptosis of lymphocytes disrupting the immune system to develop a status of immunodeficiency that can lead to secondary infections3439 indeed early stages of covid-19 were shown to be characterized by a decrease in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes that progressively decline as the disease develops into a severe outcome35 similar findings  with comparable lung lesions  were also reported in the severe sars-cov3940 and mers-cov41 hypercytokinemia has been also noted in sars-cov39 and mers-cov41 and was suggested to result in inflammatory lesions in the lungs and extensive inflammatory reactions and necrosis in the spleen lymph nodes and blood vessels such a profile of hypercytokinemia was further suggested to be a major causative factor in exacerbating lung damage and other fatal complications38 the profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines in coronavirus diseases may therefore be a common pathophysiological basis in pneumonias resulting from these infections3442 direct evidence for the role of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the pathophysiology of coronavirus infections was noted however from sars-cov cases3940 where ace2-positive cells were shown to express significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as mcp1 transforming growth factor 1 tgf-1 tnf il-1 and il-6 than ace2-negative or non-infected cells40upon infection the innate immunity-mediated synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines by target cells recruits and activates immune cells including monocytes-macrophages lymphocytes and neutrophils into the site of infection43 based on our understanding of the coronavirus-induced pneumonia the accumulation of these cells in the lung and blood vessel walls mediate inflammatory reactions to clear the infection and further synthesize cytokines to stimulate immunity leading to a state of hypercytokinemia3941 such a local reaction aggravates the lung and vascular tissue injury and may lead to lung exudate pulmonary edema hyaline membrane formation and mucus cell activation to block the airway ultimately manifesting in ards16 early stage of this process is accompanied by extensive lymphocyte apoptotic cell death that attenuates cellular immune system leading to a state of immunodeficiency3941 this complication may culminate to respiratory failure systemic hypoxia multiple organ failure and death such a proposed range of clinical events may permit identifying a set of biomarkers along the innate immunity pathway related to the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines for early prediction of the severe outcome of infection it may also delineate effective avenues for the treatment of early disease stages as well as in critically-ill patients however much is yet to be learned  particularly in the case of sars-cov-2  to introduce such a proposition into clinical practicesinnate immunity-related inflammatory response has long been characterized to play a critical role in the bodys response to infection33 several studies have demonstrated that hypercytokinemia is the principal immunopathological mechanism that contributes to severe clinical presentation in patients with infectious diseases4447 the genes that code for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines responsible for hypercytokinemia include tnf ifn il-1 il-6 il-8 il-9 il-12 il-15 and il-1744 these genes are polymorphic and certain alleles have been associated with susceptibility to a wide range of infectious conditions as well as their severe outcome4546 although these mediators are principally related to immune reactions they can also influence functions of epithelial and endothelial cells smooth muscle and adipose tissue and play a role in sepsis shock ards and responses to toxic medication4748 in general clinical signs and symptoms associated with hypercytokinemia include headaches muscle pain nausea diarrhea vasodilatation and hypotension47several variants in the genes encoding for cytokines eg tnf rs1800750 ga il1b rs16944 ga ccl rs2282691 at and ifitm3 rs12252 tc have been associated with risk of an array of clinical manifestations in infectious diseases3249 furthermore elevated levels of the resultant pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were found in the plasma of patients with ards in response to infection1650 previous studies examining the relationship between infectious diseases and cytokine markers suggest that host genetic factors may indeed influence these biomarkers and the subsequent disease severity5054 this relationship may shed some light on the interindividual differences in response to sars-cov-2 infection and other coronavirus diseases and warrants analysis of the genetic variants in cytokine genes in coronavirus patients linking these genetic polymorphisms to the extent of hypercytokinemia and the individuals response to infection may identify novel approaches related to the risk of disease severity as well as effective measures of prevention and control in this context single nucleotide polymorphisms snps in cytokine genes can be employed to determine whether the patients innate immune status is prone to hypercytokinemia in sars-cov-2 virus infection as proposed in other infectious diseases3244-47 attenuating the effect of these genes ie their role in extensive cytokine synthesis can provide an approach for early intervention in subjects prone to hypercytokinemia upon infection for example we325556 and others57 have proposed a utility of some nutritional factors to impact the expression of cytokine genes as in the early prevention of a number of infectious and chronic diseases furthermore the use of il-6 pathways blockers and other biologic drugs currently prescribed for rheumatology was suggested to be employed in targeting inflammation in patients prone to hypercytokinemia58the systemic nature of coronavirus infection outcomes is perhaps due to the ubiquitous expression of the virus receptors ace2 in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 and dpp4 in mers-cov such an expression may further relate to the common hypercytokinemic responses in the lungs and vasculature characterized in these infections the pathophysiological mechanism of covid-19 and other coronavirus diseases may then relate to this state of hypercytokinemia that both exacerbates the inflammatory lesions in the target tissues and induces massive t cell apoptotic death and a subsequent vulnerability to immune deficiency furthermore the notable higher affinity of sars-cov-2 s-protein to ace2 compared to sars-cov16 where a relatively lesser level of the virus can result in disease manifestation may have influenced the extensive worldwide spread of covid-19 within this context it is important to note that although respiratory transmission was considered as the principal route in the disease spread59 the ubiquitous expression of ace2 receptors in many human tissues and organs suggests that new transmission routes eg aerosols and direct contact should be also taken into considerationthe interindividual differences in response to covid-19 infection may relate to the genetic polymorphisms in genes regulating the virus s-protein binding receptor ace2 gene and those modulating the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines eg tnf ifn il-1 il-6 il-8 il-9 il-12 il-15 and il-17 genes these genes influence both target organ function and injury31 as well as host immune response to infection4546 various combinations of these genes can emerge to differentially determine the infection outcome in different individuals populations and sub-populations this observation underlines the necessity to conduct more systematic population-based genetic epidemiological studies to elucidate the influence of sequence variation in this array of genes on the response to and treatment of viral infection factors that modulate the expression and activity of these markers eg at1 receptor blockers arbs or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists mras for ace26061 or anti-inflammatory factors for cytokines62 may need to be further considered in studies with a systematic population-based approachoverall extensive research is warranted in many areas related to coronavirus diseases particularly covid-19 work needs to be developed in areas related to the transmission route pathological mechanism natural history and prognosis of the disease approaches for effective therapy and vaccine development ultimately the establishment of effective public health measures for disease prevention and control is critical both regionally and globally in this respect  and given the varying rates of disease prevalence among the different world regions there is a need to characterize the effect of health inequities and inequalities within and between countries on public health and healthcare response to covid-19 the rapid and vast spread of the disease substantiate an urgency to develop a global policy coherence and complementation between public health authorities around the world that takes into consideration the well-known influence of socioeconomic status and inter-population differences on healththe most effective protection against infectious diseases involves specific prevention ie vaccination however it could be sometimes ineffective this problem can be solved using immune-stimulating drugs immune-stimulants cause changes in the activity of humoral and cellular components of the immune system thereby strengthening the immune response 1-3 to this end a promising group of immune-stimulating agents includes those based on natural interferons ifns 45in terms of veterinary medicine ifns are of interest due to their antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties ifns can claim a role in the therapeutic and preventive treatment of viral bacterial and mixed bacterial-viral infections moreover they are highly effective immune-modulating and anti-stress agents they can modify the action of other treatment medications for example antibiotics tens of times amplifying their antibacterial effect and neutralizing the negative impact on the immune system 26the successful production of ifn-inducing strains sophisticated methods to refold and purify proteins and new and unique formulations has resulted in a wide range of mono- and multicomponent veterinary preparations to address different issues in veterinary science the main distinguishing feature of all developed drugs is their species specificity corresponding to the species specificity of the ifns included in their composition these are unique preparations their active principle of protective proteins is completely identical to the animals ones thus animals can be treated not with foreign substances but with their protective agents simply increasing their concentration in the body by inducing ifn-based preparations at the right time 47in total there are three groups of veterinary drugs
i monocomponent preparations with ifn as the active ingredientii bicomponent preparations with ifn and an antibacterial agent antibiotic as the active substance to treat mixed bacterial-viral infectionsiii multicomponent preparations with ifn and a complex of vitamins a d3 e and c as the active ingredient in their optimum physiological ratios 7-10
the antiviral effect of ifn appears inside the cell and is associated with suppression of virus reproduction ifn does not act on extracellular viruses and their adsorption 11-13 ifn is not active inside the cell where it is produced it must be secreted and then reabsorbed by the cells where it binds to a corresponding receptor on the cell membrane there are different types of protein receptors after binding to cell receptors the complexes of ifns diffuse and aggregate on the cell surface then they undergo endocytosis which occurs after 1-2 h getting inside the cells they activate processes that result in the antiviral state and determine different effects on metabolism namely there takes place the production of different intracellular proteins with oligoadenylate synthetase and protein kinase being the most important and well-studied these enzyme systems ultimately induce the spread reproduction of the virus in vivo inactivating early viral mrnas it inhibits the synthesis of viral proteins on cell ribosomes during viral nucleic acid replication 1415ifn or an inducer of endogenous ifn activates the absorption of monocytes and tissue macrophages a higher ingestion rate is related to increased activity of macrophage elements it is not accompanied by growth in the number of phagocytic cells 913 disease prevention and treatment with the help of ifns are developed in two directions the introduction of ready-made forms of ifn exogenous interferonization and the stimulation of the ifn production by cells of the body under the influence of inducers endogenous interferonization 13based on the preceding the search and use of ifns and their inducers with a wide range of antiviral and immune-modulating effects are a promising and necessary direction of immune pharmacology meanwhile there are several main directions to use ifns having been outlined in veterinary practice the use of exogenous ifns the use of endogenous ifn inducers and the combined use of ifns with chemotherapeutic drugs and vaccinesthe research aimed to study the effect of ifn-based drugs on calf immunological parameters in the specific prophylaxis of associative infectionsthe study was conducted under the ethical principles approved by the animal experiments ethics committee federal state budgetary educational institution of higher professional education bashkir state agrarian university protocol no 8 of 28032019the research was carried out from 2014 to 2019 on a livestock farm in the chishminsky district of the republic of bashkortostan of the russian federationthe object of research was 45 black motley cows and their calves from birth to 2 months of lifethe animals for research were selected by the analog approach they were fed and kept in the same conditions animals for research were selected identical in age and live weight calves up to two months of age received a daily diet the animals were in a room that meets the zoohygienic requirements for keeping cattlethe work was based on

the mother cows of the first experimental group n15 48 h before vaccination were once injected with an immunostimulant ibr at a dose of 1 mlkg of body weight vaccination was carried out twice according to the instructions they were injected subcutaneously into the neck at a dose of 2 ml 40 days before calving for the 1st time and 20 days before calving for the 2nd time animals of the second experimental n15 group the vaccine was administered according to the same scheme forty-eight hours before vaccination an immunomodulator immunate was injected at a dose of 5 ml per animal the control n15 cows were pregnant vaccinated ones they were not given immunostimulantsthe newborn calves were divided into nine groups following the division of mother cows in the first scientific experiment five animals each the calves from each group of cows were divided into three groups in the first group of calves obtained from cows of the first control group drugs were not used which was a control for the second stage of research furthermore immunostimulating drugs were not used in the fourth and seventh experimental groups of calves obtained from mother cows of the second and third experimental groups the calves of the second fifth and eighth experimental groups were used with an ibr immunostimulant at a dose of 1 ml10 kg of body weight on the 1st day after birth twice with an interval of 48 h the calves of the third sixth and ninth experimental groups were injected with the preparation immunate in a dose of 2 ml per animalthe vaccination of mother cows with the combovac vaccine was carried out twice according to the instructions they were injected subcutaneously in the neck area at a dose of 2 ml 40 days before calving for the 1st time and 20 days before calving for the 2nd time the vaccination of the obtained calves with the combovac vaccine against associative infections was carried out twice one milliliter of the vaccine was injected into the neck area subcutaneously at the age of 30 days with an interval of 20 daysserum and colostrum samples from mother cows were assayed for antibodies to rotavirus diarrhea and coronavirus using the serological methods the testing was carried out before vaccination 40 days before calving 20 days before calving and before calving colostrum samples were taken during the first milk yieldto assess colostral immunity in calves born from vaccinated cows serum samples were drawn before colostrum feeding as well as at 7 14 and 21 days and 1 and 2 months of age serum and colostrum samples from control and experimental animals were assayed for antibodies to rotavirus and vd by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to coronavirus by the hemagglutination inhibition assay the total amount of immunoglobulins a m and g in the blood sera of animals at 25 35 65 and 75 days after birth was determined by quantitative methods such as the radial immunodiffusion the number of immunoglobulins mgml was determined by a calibration curve reflecting the relationship between the logarithm of the concentration of immunoglobulins in serum and the diameter of the precipitation ringthe experimental data were processed with the statistical analysis package for microsoft excel the significance of differences between groups was evaluated using students t-test from p005 to p0001after vaccination there was a significant increase in rotavirus antibody titers in the blood serum of pregnant cows if compared to the initial amount before vaccination figure-1the initial titer of antibodies before vaccination was 58 1og2 by the time of calving it increased in animals of the third group amounted to 94034 p001 in the control group antibody titers in cows before calving were 772025 log2 in animals of the second experimental group the increase in post-vaccination antibodies calving was 26 log2 p001 in the colostrum of the first milk yield in calving cows of the control group the rotavirus antibody amounted to 108031 log2 in the second experimental group the same indicator exceeded the control by 195 log2 in the third experimental group the titers of colostrum antibodies in experimental cows exceeded the control values by 24 log2 figure-1in the first control group the number of coronavirus antibodies did not change significantly during the experiment it slightly decreased by the time of calving figure-2 in the third experimental group there was the highest increase in post-vaccination titer it was 22 1og2 higher than the baselineserum and colostrum samples of the control group non-immunostimulated cows proved that coronavirus antibodies were present in all animals before calving figure-2 on the 2nd day the level of antibodies decreased by 2-3 times and only a small amount of them was found in milk on the 3rd day of lactation in 15-20 of animals in animals of the second and third groups the coronavirus antibody titers were 80015 and 81017 1og2 p001 on the day of calving 6202 and 64022 46024 and 47021 and 18031 and 185029 1og2 p001 on 2 3 and 4 days of lactation respectively by the 5th-7th day antibodies to the indicated antigens were detected in titers of 08013 further the titer of coronavirus antibodies gradually decreases and by the 8th day of lactation they are not detectedbefore vaccination the titer of antibodies to vd in all groups of cows ranged from 51 to 52 log2 figure-3 in the first control group this indicator did not change significantly after the first and second vaccinations it decreased by the time of calving in the group of animals that used the ibr immunostimulant second group the average titer of vd antibodies before calving exceeded the pre-vaccination antibody titers by 05 1og2 in the control group the average titer of vd antibodies before calving exceeded the pre-vaccination titer by 08 1og2 in the third group the titers of humoral antibodies after immunization with the immunate increased by 04 1og2 the difference in antibody titers before calving between the control and the third group was 07 1og2 p005the titers of colostrum secretory antibodies to vd in the second experimental group exceeded the control values by 13 log2 in the third experimental group they surpassed the control values by 14 log2before colostrum intake no calves had rotavirus antibodies in their blood serum table-1as one can see by the end of the 1st week after birth rotavirus antibodies reached their maximum values a month after birth the level of these antibodies slightly decreased in all groups of calves during the 2nd month after birth the titer of humoral antibodies increased in the experimental group and decreased in the control one typically the values of rotavirus-specific antibody titers in the experimental group significantly exceeded those in the control group the maximum difference in this indicator between the experimental and control group was recorded for calves in the sixth and ninth experimental groupsbefore colostrum intake no calves had coronavirus antibodies in their blood serum table-2the dynamics of serum antibodies in calves was as follows antibody titers reached their maximum values by the end of the 1st week of animal life the highest level was indicated in calves of the sixth eighth and ninth groups then the values gradually decreased by the end of the observation period 2 monthsin calves of the control and experimental groups antibodies to vd were absent before colostrum administration table-3by the end of the 1st week of life the titer of humoral antibodies in the experimental groups of calves reached the maximum values the highest deviations from the values of the control group were recorded in calves obtained from mother cows immunostimulated before vaccination during pregnancy these calves were also given immunostimulants after birth in the eighth and ninth experimental groups the indicator had a maximum mark and exceeded the control by 225 and 235 log2 respectively subsequently antibody titers in animals of all groups gradually decreased but the experimental ones steadily exceeded the control indicesdanish scholars 16 also found the correlation between ifn and the increase in antibody titer but their study was devoted to poultry some scientists 1317 conducted studies on farm animals to prevent and treat viral and bacterial infections with the use of ifns and proved their effect positivethe dynamics of immunoglobulins was monitored for 75 days table-4 for all the periods of the study the content of immunoglobulins a m and g in the blood serum of the calves of the control group was lower than similar indicators of calves of the experimental groups the maximum difference between these indicators with control was found in animals of the sixth and ninth groups hence on the 65th day of the experiment in the sixth group the content of immunoglobulins a m and g was higher than the control by 014 018 and 114 mgml in the ninth by 008 031 and 286 mgml respectively however on the 75th day of the experiment a decrease in the number of serum immunoglobulins a m and g was observed in the studied groups of calves the maximum decrease was recorded in the control group in the sixth and ninth groups of calves the smallest decrease in immunoglobulins a m and g was recordedthus during the research it was found that
dosing pregnant cows with an ifn-based drug at 1 mlkg 48 h before vaccination contributes to the accumulation of rotavirus coronavirus and vd antibodies in the colostrum with a titer of 7603 log2 58034 log2 and 44018 log2 respectively it indicates an increase in the antigenic activity of the multivalent vaccineifn-based drugs enhance the protective effect of vaccination against rotavirus and coronavirus enteritis vd and mucosal diseases in newborn calves it is achieved through the increase in the titer of associated antibodies and immunoglobulins a m and g
to sum up the use of ifn-based drugs before vaccination increases the efficiency of vaccination and enhances colostral immunity helping improve the survival of young animalsaa designed the study wrote and revised the manuscript and managed correspondence on applied testing oa collected the results of this test cg and ki collected the results of this test and wrote the manuscript all authors read and approved the final manuscripthow do you pack a lot of information into a small space this is the challenge for all microbes and analysis of viral genomes reveals interesting strategies of genetic economy positive strand rna viruses employ genetic economy by encoding polyproteins that are processed by viral proteases during replication this strategy minimizes genome size by allowing for the expression of multiple protein products from a single open reading frame an additional twist to this genetic economy is that the viral protease itself may be multifunctional ie the protease may act on both viral and host cell proteins hepatitis c virus encodes a polyprotein that is processed by a viral protease ns34a that also cleaves host cell mitochondrial associated viral sensor mavs thus inactivating the innate immune response to viral infection li et al 2005 poliovirus 2a protease processes the viral polyprotein and host cell factor eif4g which shifts the ribosomes from cap-dependent to cap-independent translation whereas 3c protease cleaves polya-binding protein to facilitate the complete host translation shutoff kuyumcu-martinez et al 2004 gradi et al 1998 here we focus on coronaviruses and arteriviruses two families of positive strand rna viruses in the order nidovirales and review recent findings illuminating the mutifuctionality of the papain-like proteases plps encoded in the replicase polyproteins for these viruses plps play a critical role in processing the amino-terminal portion of the replicase polyprotein and are attractive targets for antiviral drug development in addition structural studies have revealed a striking similarity of the viral plps to cellular deubiquitinating enzymes dubs which are involved in regulation of the innate immune response to viral infection this raises the question of the multifunctional potential of nidovirus plps and their role in antagonism of the innate immune response to viral replication in this review we discuss current knowledge on the multifunctionality of plps encoded within coronaviruses and arteriviruses genomes and their potential role in viral pathogenesis summarized in table 1
the coronaviridae is a family of enveloped positive strand rna viruses with very large genomes ranging in size from 28 to 32 kilobases coronaviruses were identified as etiologic agents of respiratory gastrointestinal and neurologic diseases in humans and other animals coronaviruses are now notorious for emerging from animal reservoirs into the human population sometimes with pandemic potential in 2002 the coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars emerged from chinese horseshoe bats and through an intermediate host likely civet cats into humans this resulted in over 8000 infections with 10 mortality perlman and netland 2009 the sars pandemic was controlled by public health measures of isolating infected individuals and their contacts which disrupted the chain of human to human transmission since 2012 a coronavirus designated middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov has been detected in 178 patients with a reported mortality of 43 wwwwhoint 2014 mers-cov-like sequences have been detected in bats suggesting bats as a potential reservoir of the virus memish et al 2013 in addition camels have been implicated as a potential intermediate host since the discovery of mers-cov neutralizing antibodies and infectious virus in dromedary camels reusken et al 2013 haagmans et al 2014 meyer et al 2014 additional endemic human coronaviruses that cause respiratory tract disease include hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 which cause common colds hcov-nl63 which has been associated with croup in children and hcov-hku1 associated with lower respiratory tract infection and pneumonia in the elderly coronaviruses are also important pathogens of livestock and pets including transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev pigs porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv pigs bovine coronavirus cows infectious bronchitis virus chickens feline coronavirus cats and canine coronavirus dogs interestingly we now recognize that bats harbor diverse strains of coronaviruses and these bat viruses may be the ancestors of the species specific viruses lau et al 2013 the identification of a common therapeutic target in the genomes of coronaviruses may allow for the development of a broad spectrum antiviral therapy to existing and potentially emerging coronavirusesall coronaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells through the action of the viral replicase complex the coronavirus replicase is produced upon translation of the incoming rna genome the replicase gene contains two open reading frames orf1a and orf1b which are connected by a frame shift region allowing for translation of the orf1ab polyprotein the replicase polyproteins designated pp1a and pp1ab are processed into 16 non-structural proteins nsps by two or three depending on the coronavirus viral proteases the plps are responsible for the cleavage of the amino-terminal portion of the polyprotein coronavirus plp activity was identified by in vitro transcriptiontranslation studies of genomic rna and the recognition that the polyprotein product was processed by an encoded protease domain denison and perlman 1986 site-directed mutagenesis and deletion studies reveal that for the model coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus mhv there are two plp domains with plp1 processing the polyprotein between nsp1nsp2 and nsp2nsp3 denison et al 1992 baker et al 1989 baker et al 1993 teng et al 1999 further expression studies of mhv orf1a revealed that the plp2 domain processes the polyprotein at the nsp3nsp4 site using a recognition site of lxgg kanjanahaluethai and baker 2000 similar studies of other coronaviruses revealed the existence of either one or two plp domains that were required for processing the amino-terminal region of the replicase polyprotein fig 1
 sars-cov encodes only one plp domain termed plpro within nsp3 which cleaves the replicase polyprotein at the junctions between nsp1nsp2 nsp2nsp3 and nsp3nsp4 through recognition of a lxgg motif harcourt et al 2004 for the recently emerged mers-cov the cleavage sites recognized by the plpro are predicted and await experimental validation van boheemen et al 2012 however kilianski et al 2013 showed that mers-cov plpro can recognize an lxgg motif similarly to sars-cov plpro it has been shown that when two plp domains are encoded within the coronavirus replicase polyprotein the plp2 has similar characteristics to sars-cov plpro and recognizes the lxgg motif fig 1 coronavirus plp2 domains are known to or predicted to cleave between nsp3 and nsp4 whereas the cleavage between nsp1nsp2 and nsp2nsp3 is usually mediated by the plp1 domain interestingly gamma- and deltacoronaviruses encode one plpro domain within nsp2 that is predicted to cleave between nsp1nsp2 and nsp2nsp3the multifunctionality of coronavirus plps was first proposed by sulea et al 2005 from their study of molecular modeling of the sars-cov plpro domain in their study the authors predicted plpro dub activity based on the observations that plpro could be modeled onto the structure of the herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease hauspusp18 which was a known cellular dubdubs are enzymes that can remove ubiquitin modifications from target proteins ubiquitination is a post translational modification of proteins that allows for the addition of ubiquitin molecules to a specific lysine residue within the target protein in an atp-dependent reaction this system is mediated by three enzymes an e1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme an e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and an e3 ubiquitin ligase these enzymes might add one monoubiquitination or several polyubiquitination ubiquitin moieties to a target protein the ubiquitin molecules in the polyubiquitin chain can be covalently linked via any of the seven lysine residues present within ubiquitin several types of polyubiquitination have been characterized reviewed in komander and rape 2012 the form of ubiquitin linkage determines the fate of the modified protein and influences its function three types of polyubiquitination are known to be involved in the regulation of the innate immune signaling pathways lys48-linked ub k-48-ub lys63-linked ub k-63-ub and linear polyubiquitination k-63 linked ubiquitin and linear ubiquitin modifications are associated with activation of proteins in certain innate immune signaling cascades in contrast k-48 linked polyubiquitination is a signal that directs proteins for proteosomal degradation removal of ubiquitin from cellular targets is mediated by cellular enzymes called deubiquitinases dubs komander et al 2009 dubs recognize the rlrgg motif that links ubiquitin chains and remove ubiquitin conjugates from cellular proteinsthe sars-cov plpro dub activity predicted by sulea et al was tested in vitro and in transfected cells by several groups using purified enzyme two groups showed sars-cov plpro dub activity in vitro and that catalytic activity of the protein is required for dub activity they showed that mutation of the predicted catalytic cysteine or aspartic acid residue to alanine leads to loss of dub activity lindner et al 2005 barretto et al 2005 further studies revealed that plpro is capable of processing both k-48-linked diubiquitin and heptaubiquitin as well as k-63-linked heptaubiquitin chains in vitro lindner et al 2007 these in vitro studies were the first to demonstrate the multifunctional nature of the coronavirus plpsstructural studies have contributed to a detailed understanding of sars-cov plpro ratia et al 2006 the structure of sars-cov plpro displays a thumb-palm-fingers architecture resembling cellular ubiquitin specific proteases usps fig 2a ratia et al 2006 structural superposition of sars-cov plpro with usp14 resulted in a pairwise root-mean-square-deviation rmsd of 36  over 198 aligned backbone c although the sequence identity between these two proteins is only around 10 the active site of sars-cov plpro consists of a canonical cys-his-asp catalytic triad which is in a similar position to that of usp14 fig 2a in contrast to some usps including usp14 and hausp whose fingers domains consist of a cys4-type-like zinc ribbon without zinc hu et al 2005 the fingers domain of sars-cov plpro contains a zinc finger with four cysteines tetrahedrally coordinating a zinc atom ratia et al 2006 moreover the zinc-binding ability seems to be essential for sars-cov plpro activity as supported by mutagenesis studies barretto et al 2005 such dependence on zinc seems to be conserved among coronaviral plps as zinc binding has also been observed for other plps including tgev plp1 and hcov-229e plp1 herold et al 1999 wojdyla et al 2010the structure of the plp1 domain of tegv is similar to sars-cov plpro and several cellular usps including usp 2 7 8 14 and 21 wojdyla et al 2010 purified tgev plp1 has dub activity in vitro in addition the authors showed that tegv plp1 has a slight preference for cleavage of k-48-linked over k-63-linked polyubiquitin chains the role of dub activity of tegv plp1 in cell culture or in infected animals remains to be determinedhcov-nl63 plp2 which has only 22 homology to sars-cov plpro has also been shown to act as a dub in vitro and in cell culture expression of plp2 but not plp2 catalytic mutant c1678a leads to a decrease in the level of ubiquitinated proteins in transfected cells in addition purified plp2 can process both k-48-linked and k-63-linked hexaubiquitin chains chen et al 2007 clementz et al 2010similarly to hcov-nl63 pedv encodes two plps in the genome however only plp2 has been shown to have the ability to deconjugate ubiquitin from cellular substrates xing et al 2013 moreover the authors showed that alanine mutants of the active site residues cysteine histidine or aspartic acid led to the loss of dub activity in pedv plp2-transfected cells in addition the authors showed that pedv plp2 can efficiently remove both k-48-linked and k-63-linked polyubiquitin conjugates from cellular proteins specifically the authors showed that plp2 can remove k-63-linked polyubiquitin chains from rig-i and sting two molecules important for induction of innate immunity these results suggest a possible mechanism by which coronavirus plp2 dub activity can block induction of interferon  ifn xing et al 2013dub activity of mhv plp2 has also been reported frieman et al 2009 showed that mhv can deubiquitinate multiple cellular proteins conjugated with ubiquitin in infected cells in addition zheng et al 2008 showed that mhv plp2 is capable of processing both k-48-linked and k-63-linked polyubiquitin chains from cellular substrates further wang et al 2011 determined that mhv plp2 can deubiquitinate k-63-linked tbk1 a kinase required to activate transcription factor irf3 which activates expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as ifn these results suggest that mhv plp2 dub activity may have a role in blocking induction of the antiviral stateof note the plpro domain from the recently emerged highly pathogenic mers-cov has been characterized as a protease dub and inhibitor of innate immune responses including ifn kilianski et al 2013 mielech et al 2014 yang et al 2013 further work is required to determine if the dub activity detected during overexpression of the plpro in transfected cells is also critical for viral replication or pathogenesisthe recognition that coronavirus plps had the ability to recognize the lxgg motif and process both polyproteins and ubiquitin chains led to the hypothesis that plp domains might also process ubiquitin-like molecules such as interferon stimulated gene 15 isg15 isg15 is an interferon stimulated di-ubiquitin-like molecule that can be linked to cellular targets via a mechanism termed isgylation jeon et al 2010 similar to ubiquitination isgylation requires the activity of e1 e2 and e3 enzymes and the process is reversible deisgylation several screens have identified cellular targets of isgylation including molecules important for the activation of innate immune response particularly rig-i jak1 stat1 pkr and mxa reviewed in lenschow 2010 the exact mechanism of how modification with isg15 influences these proteins activity is not well characterized however isgylation is important for protection and clearance of viral infections it has been shown that isg15 knock-out mice are more susceptible to infection with influenza herpes and sindbis viruses than are wild-type mice lenschow et al 2005 lenschow et al 2007 coronavirus encoded plps in addition to dub activity have also been shown to be able to remove igs15 conjugates from cellular targets an activity which might also contribute to virus pathogenesisdeisgylating activity has been demonstrated for several coronavirus plps deisgylating activity of sars-cov plpro and hcov-nl63 plp2 was demonstrated in vitro nicholson et al 2008 in addition clementz et al 2010 showed that hcov-nl63 plp2 has the ability to remove isg15 conjugates from cellular proteins in a catalytically dependent manner moreover the plpro domain from mers-cov has similar properties mielech et al 2014 yang et al 2013 suggesting that deisgylating activity of plps might be conserved between plps from different coronavirus speciesdub and deisgylating activities of the coronavirus plps have been proposed as a mechanism to block induction of the cellular response to viral infection devaraj et al determined that sars-cov plpro can inhibit polyic and sendai virus induced ifn and that plpro catalytic activity is important for antagonism co-expression of plpro with stimulators of interferon ifn activation such as rig-i mavs trif tbk1 or ikk reduced ifn induction in contrast plpro was not able to inhibit ifn induced by expression of a dominant active form of irf3 the authors showed that plpro can down-regulate phosphorylation of irf3 and prevent irf3 dimer formation furthermore the authors were able to co-immunoprecipitate irf3 with transiently expressed plpro and co-localization of irf3 and nsp3plpro during sars-cov infection devaraj et al 2007 subsequently frieman et al also showed that plpro inhibits the ifn response in addition the authors showed that plpro can inhibit nf-b-luciferase activity by stabilizing ib a molecule that has to be degraded in order to release the transcription factor nf-b which activates proinflammatory responses frieman et al 2009 later studies showed that plpro can block tnf-induced nf-b activation and further that this block can be removed when the cells are treated with a plpro inhibitor revealing a possible antiviral strategy clementz et al 2010 furthermore a recent analysis showed that expression of sars-cov or mers-cov plpro decreases endogenous rna levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in activated cells mielech et al 2014the arterivirus family of positive strand rna viruses contains genomes ranging from 10 to 14 kilobases the arterivirus family includes important pathogens such as equine arteritis virus eav that causes disease in horses and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus prrsv that infects pigs and is lethal to piglets these diseases can lead to significant economic loss and there are currently no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs available to treat infected animalsarteriviruses encode at least one plp that is responsible for proteolytic processing of the virus polyprotein fig 1 the arterivirus genome has a similar organization to the coronavirus genome and is composed of 2 large orfs that encode polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab and 811 downstream orfs that encode accessory and structural proteins the amino-terminal region of the orf1 is processed by two or three plp domains the plp encoded within the amino-terminal region of nsp2 termed plp2 or p2 has a similar function as sars-cov plpro snijder et al 1995 and reviewed in snijder and kikkert 2013 the sequence recognized by this protease domain is only partially conserved across the arterivirus species for example eav plp2 recognizes the sequence ligg whereas prrsv p2 can recognize cleavage sites containing either ttgg or psgg the partial conservation of the site cleaved by the arterivirus plp2s and its similarity to motifs recognized by cellular dubs and deisgylating enzymes led to the hypothesis that arterivirus p2s might be multifunctional enzymesexpression of the eav plp2 domain revealed that it indeed exhibits dub activity in cell culture frias-staheli et al 2007 dub activity of the amino-terminal region of nsp2 nsp2n was confirmed in vitro eav nsp2n can deubiquitinate k-48-linked and k-63-linked polyubiquitin chains in a catalytic dependent manner as alanine mutants of the three predicted catalytic residues lost dub activity van kasteren et al 2012 to address the possible role for nsp2n dub activity in the inhibition of innate immunity the authors determined the ubiquitination status of rig-i which requires k-63-linked polyubiquitination for activation studies have shown that dub activity of nsp2n from eav can block rig-i ubiquitination in a catalytic dependent manner van kasteren et al 2012 this led to the hypothesis that eav dub activity might be important for blocking the innate immune response to viral infection to test this hypothesis it was critically important to obtain structural information on how the enzyme interacts with ubiquitin with this information in hand researchers can attempt to generate plp2 mutants that retain protease activity but are impaired for interaction with ubiquitinthe co-crystal structure of eav plp2 with ubiquitin was solved by van kasteren et al 2013 eav plp2 adopts a two-domain fold and shares a -sheet core and two central helices with eukaryotic otus fig 2c structural overlay of eav plp2 with yeast otu1 resulted in a rmsd of 33  over 81 aligned c with only around 9 sequence identity the cys-his-asn catalytic triad of eav plp2 resides in a structurally conserved region of otu dubs fig 2b what is unique about the structure of eav plp2 is the presence of a zinc finger as a part of the otu domain this zinc finger is critical for the structural integrity and catalytic activity of eav plp2 the presence of a zinc finger has not been observed in other known otu-like proteases thus it has been proposed that eav plp2 may represent the first member of a new class of zinc-dependent otus van kasteren et al 2013the co-crystal structure of eav plp2 with ubiquitin revealed interaction sites between the enzyme and ubiquitin that are distal to the active site van kasteren et al 2013 using this structural information the authors were able to successfully separate plp2 protease and dub activities mutation of the ubiquitin-interacting residues of eav plp2 had no evident effect on protease activity but significantly reduced dub activity in overexpression studies to study the effect of the dub mutant on virus replication and innate immunity the authors used reverse genetics to recover two replication competent mutant viruses a single mutant i353r and a triple mutant t312ai313vi353r in the eav plp2 domain and showed that replication kinetics of these viruses were essentially identical to the wild-type virus however the viruses with the mutant plp2 domain had lost the ability to deconjugate ubiquitin from cellular targets in virus-infected cells in addition cells infected with the eav dub mutant viruses generated an elevated innate immune response particularly expression of ifn il8 and mx1 suggesting that dub activity is important for inhibition of the innate immune response van kasteren et al 2013 the eav dub mutant study was the first study to demonstrate that viral protease and deubiquitinase functions can be separated this is an important contribution because it opens the door for the study of viral dub activity in vaccines and as a target for antiviral therapeuticsinterestingly eav is not the only member of arterivirus family for which multifunctional proteasedub activity has been shown prrsv is a well-studied member of the family which causes disease of high economic importance in pigs the proteolytic activity of prrsv p2 has been well-studied han et al 2009 han et al 2010 and p2 has the ability to cleave ubiquitin conjugates from cellular targets frias-staheli et al 2007 sun et al showed that p2 had deubiquitinating activity in vitro and in cell culture the authors showed that prrsv p2 can block sendai virus induced ifn and inhibit nf-b by preventing ib degradation by its deubiquitination in cell culture in addition they generated several mutant versions of p2 that had reduced ability to inhibit nf-b-activation to test if p2 can block nf-b activation in the context of the virus the authors introduced these mutations into prrsv although some of the mutations that altered p2 activity in vitro could not be recovered as viable virus the authors did report two single amino acid p2 mutant viruses that showed decreased ability to inhibit nf-b-reporter activity and a decrease in the level of ib in infected cells sun et al 2010 however the authors did not address whether protease or dub activity was responsible for the effect they observed in infected cells the authors noticed that the mutant viruses had severe replication defects suggesting that p2 protease activity as well as dub activity may have been impaired sun et al 2010similar to studies on coronavirus plp activities groups characterizing arterivirus plp domains investigated their deisgylating activity frias-staheli et al 2007 showed that eav p2plp2 is capable of deconjugating igs15 from cellular proteins in transfected cells furthermore a report by sun et al 2012 showed that prrsv p2 decreases endogenous isg15 protein levels upon sendai virus stimulation and that it has deisgylating activity in cells culture furthermore the authors generated prrsv p2 mutants that had reduced deisgylating activity the first mutant had a 23 aa deletion in nsp2 aa 402424 the second mutant had a 19 aa deletion in nsp2 aa 402420 and the third mutant had the 19 aa deletion and additional point mutation s462a when cells were transfected with those mutants the endogenous levels of igs15 was increased compared to cells transfected with wild-type version of p2 interestingly the processing of nsp2nsp3 was not affected by the deletion or deletionpoint mutations in the p2 domain of the virus the authors were able to recover two viruses 19 aa deletion and 19 aa deletions462a the growth kinetics analysis showed that those two viruses do not replicate as efficiently as wild-type virus which may be due to the inability to efficiently process the nsp2nsp3 site in the replicase polyprotein sun et al 2012 further studies including solving the x-ray crystal structure of the prrsv p2 domain and determining to role of p2 dubdeisgylating mutants on viral pathogenesis in animal models are neededviruses have evolved many different mechanisms to down-regulate innate immune response upon infection the ability of a virus to block or delay the induction of the antiviral state in an infected cell is likely to be an important contributor to pathogenesis nidoviruses encode in their genomes several proteins that are capable of blocking or delaying innate immune signaling one of them is the papain-like protease a multifunctional enzyme that can act as a potent protease dub deisgylating enzyme and antagonist of the innate immune response separating protease and dub activities is needed to fully understand the role of these proteins during virus replication thus far separating protease activity from dub activity has been shown only for the arterivirus eav van kasteren et al 2013 the specific mechanisms and the contributions of arteri- and coronavirus plps to interferon antagonism during virus infection and pathogenesis are an exciting new direction for research that may lead to the development of effective vaccines and novel antiviral therapeuticsin a report from china on 72314 covid-19-positive patients the crude-fatality rate cfr was 23 among infected patients with higher mortality rates among those aged 70 years and older among cancer patients the cfr was 56 10 on the other hand the cfr in the italian population was higher reaching 72 which was attributed to the older age distribution and the different and selective testing strategy mainly for symptomatic patients in a small sample of italian patients 203 had an active cancer as a common comorbidity 11 from another report from the chinese population 18 out of 1590 covid-19 cases had history of active cancer in these patients there was a higher proportion of serious events occurrences defined as the percentage of intensive care admissions with invasive ventilation or death in comparison to those without cancer while older age represented the only risk factor for serious events 7 several strategies have been proposed by the authors to closely monitor cancer patients including postponing chemotherapy or surgery in stable patients and a closer surveillance strategy in the elderly patients and those with multiple comorbidities 7 however these data should be cautiously interpreted due to relatively small sample size also history of smoking should be considered as a predisposing factor in these patients with increased susceptibility to infection with covid-19 since tobacco increases the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 a binding receptor for the sars-cov-2 12 additionally cancer is associated with an overexpression of immunosuppressive cytokines reduced proinflammatory danger signals and enhanced functional immunosuppressive leukocyte population which may induce a blunted immune system and increase the possibility of infectious complications 13on 17 march 2020 the national health service nhs published a report on the management of cancer patients during the coronavirus pandemic in which a large proportion of cancer patients were considered to be at utmost risk of infection by covid-19 these patients were those receiving active chemotherapy or radiation therapy those with hematological cancers or bone marrow transplants as well as those receiving targeted therapy protein kinase or parp inhibitors or immune therapy 14 interestingly patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors icis were considered highly vulnerable if they were to be tested positive for the coronavirus infection since their introduction into the therapeutic arsenal against cancer icis have revolutionized the treatment sequencing in the cancer management 15 these monoclonal antibodies targeting immune checkpoints pd1 and pd-l1 by their role in restoring the antitumor immunity through the reversal of immune escape or evasion have led to a significant antitumor activity with confirmed impact on the duration of tumor response and prolonged overall survival they have earned fast approvals across multiple cancer subtypes including melanoma lung cancer urological tumors breast cancer and other solid tumors 1620 more importantly these agents have earned several indications as monotherapy without association to chemotherapeutic agents thus predisposing cancer patients to a different and more tolerable toxicity profile 16171921 these agents have led to the occurrence of a new spectrum of immune-related adverse events iraes ranging from moderate to severe and life-threatening ones these side effects include a wide variety of adverse events such as endocrine abnormalities thyroid dysfunction adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis gastrointestinal events colitis hepatitis and dermatological or respiratory events interstitial pneumonitis which merit a high index of suspicion with clear therapeutic strategies in order to prevent irreversible outcomes 22during the pandemic phase of the coronavirus there should be careful monitoring of cancer patients undergoing active therapy to prevent irreversible and life-threatening outcomes in fact cancer patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy are at high risk of developing infectious complications mainly due to their impact on the myeloproliferative cells in the bone marrow but also on the rapidly dividing cells including the gut mucosa cells leading to the disruption of the protective barrier 23 therefore patients receiving active chemotherapy will often develop neutropenia and up to 530 of patients might develop febrile neutropenia 23 also patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or receiving chemotherapy for hematologic cancers are at the highest risk of developing prolonged neutropenia or febrile neutropenia episodes 2325 on the other hand data on the hematological iraes secondary to icis seems to be more comforting their occurrence is uncommon with different forms of adverse events including autoimmune thrombocytopenia and neutropenia antibody-mediated hemolytic anemia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 22 these adverse events highlight the crosstalk between the humoral and cellular immunity and the treg-mediated self-tolerance 22 in fact icis might play a role in boosting pathogen-specific immune response in contrast to other immune checkpoints agonists such as abatacept 26 their impact on the immune system may be beneficial in countering the immunosuppressive microenvironment and does not cause immunosuppression by itself 26 few cases have reported on severe ici-related neutropenia mostly secondary to anti-ctla4 agent ipilimumab but the overall rate of grade 35 rate of neutropenia remains low around 094 overall occurrence around 03107 while the incidence of febrile neutropenia was 054 2731 a small series by finkel et al analyzed the characteristics of 32 patients with immune-related neutropenia irn in these patients the median time to onset of irn after the introduction of icis was 60 days with an incidence of febrile neutropenia of 50 ir neutropenia resolved in 84 of cases after a combination of therapeutic agents including oral or intravenous steroids granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and intravenous immunoglobulin 32 that said the incidence of severe neutropenia secondary to icis is very rare and can be controlled with an adapted therapeutic strategy if it occurs moreover the instauration of prolonged immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids in a subset of patients with iraes might predispose to higher risk of infection and should also be closely monitored during the pandemic phase 33 few cases of infections secondary to the treatment of ici-related side effects have been reported since up to 10 and 50 of patients treated with ici as monotherapy or combination therapy might develop iraes 2634 there are also very few nonsolid data in the literature describing viral infections or reactivations as a complication to icis usage regardless of the development of iraes such as varicella zoster infection jc virus hepatitis b cytomegalovirus or epsteinbarr virus 3435with the increasing risk of the covid-19 pandemic the management and selection of anti-cancer therapy in oncology patients including icis must be carefully balanced on a case-by-case scenario with the potential increase in the risk of complications or death from the coronavirus infection data on the immunosuppressive impact of icis in cancer patients are inconclusive but they seem to be more tolerable and reassuring than the heavy burden of hematological toxicities associated with other chemotherapeutic agents since we are not able to consider icis treatment as highly immunosuppressive avoiding it in cancer patients to reduce coronavirus infections could deprive these patients from a highly active class of drugs a special consideration should be given to patients treated for iraes who are exposed to prolonged duration of immunosuppressive agents while the world is preoccupied by the fight against coronavirus adapted strategies and recommendations by the cancer community should be implemented to optimize the management of oncology patients this could be achieved by a careful selection of the most efficacious anti-tumor weaponry with the lower risk of weaning the patients immune system against a potential infection by the covid-19 real-world data from the covid-19 affected areas are eagerly needed to assess the outcomes of oncology patients in order to enhance their therapeutic strategiessevere acute respiratory syndrome sars is a newly emerged disease caused by sars coronavirus scov sars originated in southern china in 2002 and spread to five different continents causing 8000 infection and 700 deaths before its apparent eradication as a human infection in 2004 1 healthcare systems in affected areas were severely stressed and additional economic costs in trade and travel were very high it is not known if the virus will be reintroduced into the human population but ancestral coronaviruses are widely distributed in bats and are thought to have adapted to civets and then to humans in recent time periods 2 3 because emerging viruses tend to reemerge as conditions change 4 it is highly desirable to develop safe and efficacious vaccines andor antivirals to prevent scov infectionsall coronaviruses including scov carry four structural proteins nucleocapsid n protein and three envelope proteins namely spike s protein a type i transmembrane glycoprotein envelope e protein and membrane m protein which has three membrane-spanning domains coronavirus s protein is responsible for virus adsorption to susceptible cells through a specific virusreceptor interaction and induces membrane fusion between viral envelope and host cell membrane 5 s protein is a main player for determining coronavirus tissue tropism host specificity and viral pathogenicity 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 because most coronavirus neutralizing antibodies recognize s protein 1 13 it is not surprising that most of the current scov vaccine candidates are either the s protein subunit itself or those carrying s protein 14 15 16 17 18 19 furthermore prophylactic administration of monoclonal antibodies directed at the scov s protein protects animals against subsequent scov challenge 20 21 22 23 these studies point out that neutralizing antibodies that recognize scov s protein are sufficient to prevent or decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with scov infection by primarily suppressing replication of the challenge viruscoronavirus-like particles vlps are produced from the cells coexpressing the s m and e proteins 24 expression of the latter two proteins are sufficient for vlp production 24 m protein plays a central role in virus assembly while s protein is assembled into coronavirus particles through s proteinm protein interaction 25 26 27 28 further interactions of the m protein with the rna packaging signal of the viral rna 29 and with n protein 29 30 31 32 drive incorporation of the helical nucleocapsid complex which consists of the viral genome and n protein into virus particles vaccinia virus andor alphavirus replicons have been used to express coronavirus proteins to enable generation of vlps 33 34 35 while we have reported production of scov vlps from 293t cells that are co-transfected with four eukaryotic pcaggs-based expression plasmids each of which encodes scov s m n and e proteins 36 others have also reported production of scov vlp from insect cells 37 38 and mammalian cells 39during our studies of coronavirus assembly we found an efficient production of chimeric vlps carrying scov s protein and murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus or mhv m n and e proteins from cells coexpressing those proteins in mice immunized with the chimeric vlps the present study describes elicitation of antibodies that neutralized scov and suppressed challenged scov replication in the lungs these findings suggest that the use of chimeric vlp is an effective vaccine strategy against scov infectionvero e6 cells 293t cells and cho cells were grown in dulbeccos modified minimum essential medium dmem supplemented with penicillin 100 unitsml streptomycin 100 gml 02 sodium bicarbonate and 10 fetal bovine serum fbs the urbani strain of scov was obtained from tg ksiazek at the centers for disease control and prevention atlanta ga and a working stock of this virus was prepared by serially passaging a portion of the seed virus twice in vero e6 cells the culture fluid from infected cells was clarified by low-speed centrifugation and was filtered using a 045 m filter portioned and frozen at 80 c medium from uninfected vero e6 cells was similarly treated and processedthe plasmids pcaggs-mhv-a59s pcaggs-mhv-a59e pcaggs-mhv-a59m and pcaggs-a59n were constructed by inserting the entire region of mhv structural proteins s e m and n respectively into a chicken beta-actin promoter-based expression plasmid pcaggs-mcs plasmid pmh54 40 was obtained from paul masters and used as a template for pcr amplification of mhv structural genes construction of plasmids pcaggs-s expressing scov s protein pcaggs-e expressing scov e protein pcaggs-m expressing scov m protein and pcaggs-n expressing scov n protein was described previously 36for preparation of mhv vlps subconfluent 293t cell cultures in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were cotransfected with 14 g of pcaggs-mhv-a59s 04 g of pcaggs-mhv-a59e 35 g of pcaggs-mhv-a59m and 14 g of pcaggs-a59n using transit-293 reagent mirus at 3 days posttransfection the culture media were collected centrifuged at 1550  
g for 10 min and filtered through a 045-m filter to remove cell debris the mhv vlps were pelleted down through 20 sucrose cushion at 26000 rpm for 3 h by using a beckman sw 28 rotor after the pellets were suspended in nte buffer 100 mm nacl 10 mm trishcl ph 70 1 mm edta the vlps were centrifuged using a beckman sw 28 rotor at 26000 rpm for 3 h on a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 60 50 30 and 20 sucrose the vlps at the interface of 30 and 50 sucrose were collected diluted and further purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 60 50 30 and 20 sucrose at 26000 rpm for 18 h purified and concentrated vlps at the interface between 50 and 30 sucrose were collected diluted and pelleted through a 20 sucrose cushion at 26000 rpm for 2 h the pellets were suspended in nte buffer and kept at 80 c until further use for preparation of scov vlp a mixture of 28 g of pcaggs-s 132 g of pcaggs-e 14 g of pcaggs-m and 28 g of pcaggs-n was cotransfected into 293t cells grown on a 100-mm tissue culture plate chimeric vlps were generated by transfecting 293t cells or cho cells in a 100-mm tissue culture plate with 14 g of pcaggs-s 04 g of pcaggs-mhv-a59e 35 g of pcaggs-mhv-a59m and 14 g of pcaggs-a59n scov vlps and chimeric vlps were purified using the same procedure as described for the mhv vlp purificationthe total protein concentration of vlps was quantitated by bio-rad dc protein assay according to the manufacturers instructions bio-rad cawestern blotting was performed as described previously 36 for detection of mhv s m and n proteins we used anti-mhv serum which was produced by immunizing rabbits with a purified jhm strain of mhv kindly provided by susan baker loyola university of chicago for detection of scov s protein a mixture of purified rabbit polyclonal anti-scov s protein antibody abgent cat no ap6000a and polyclonal rabbit anti-scov s protein antibody imgenex cat no img 541 was used scov n protein was detected by using rabbit polyclonal anti-scov n protein antibody imgenex cat no img 548 and scov m protein was detected by using a mixture of scov pupm antibody-n-terminal abgent cat no ap6008a scov pupm antibody

coomassie stain bio-rad with gentle agitation for 1 h the gel was rinsed extensively with water overnightcarbon-coated 200-mesh copper grids were floated on drops of chimeric vlp for 10 min after washing the grids with water three times negative staining was performed using 2 phosphotungstic acid ph 70 for 1 min after air drying of the grids the sample was examined under a philips 201 transmission electron microscope and pictures were taken at 60 kvsix- to 8-week-old female balbc mice charles river laboratory wilmington ma were housed in cages covered with barrier filters in an approval biosafety level 3 animal facility maintained by the university of texas medical branch at galveston texas all of the mouse experiments were performed using experimental protocols approved by the university of texas medical branch investigational animal care and use committee all of the experiments were carried out following national institutes of health and united states department of agriculture guidelinesmhv vlps chimeric vlps or influenza virus vaccine were adjusted to twice their desired final concentration g01 ml and then mixed with an equal volume of phosphate buffered saline pbs or alum adjuvant imject alum pierce cat no 77161 at day 0 they were administered intramuscularly im using 1-ml tuberculin syringes norm-ject tuttingen germany and 26-g 38-in beveled needles becton dickinson cat no 305110 in control groups mice were inoculated im with vero e6 cell culture fluid a mixture of influenza vaccine and alum or alum alone or they were left untreated mice were inoculated on day 0 and as indicated in the body of the paper a second injection was given on day 28 in most experiments scov was inoculated directly into the nares of mice 40 l that were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane isoflo abbott laboratories north chicago il mice that were inoculated with 1  106 tcid50 of scov at day 0 to provide post-infection immunity did not undergo a second inoculation in most of our experiments immunized mice were challenged by intranasal in inoculation of 1  106 tcid50 of scov at day 56 and they were euthanized at day 58 while in some experiments mice were inoculated with scov at day 28 and they were euthanized at day 30 day 2 post inoculation was chosen because of reports that peak titer occurs at that time 23 and this was confirmed in our laboratorymice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then bled from the retro-orbital sinus plexus after heat inactivation at 56 c for 30 min sera were stored at 4 c the assay for virus-specific neutralizing antibodies was performed on serial 2-fold diluted samples of each serum beginning at a dilution of 15 using 2 fbs-dmem as the diluent in 96-well tissue culture plates falcon 3072 the final volume of the serially diluted samples in each well was 60 l after addition of 120 tcid50 of scov in 60 l into each well the samples were incubated for 4560 min at room temperature then 100 l of these mixtures containing 100 tcid50 of scov were transferred into duplicate wells of confluent vero e6 cells grown in 96-well microtiter plates after 72 h incubation when the virus control wells exhibited advanced virus-induced cpe the neutralizing capacity of individual serum samples was assessed by determining the presence or absence of virus-induced cpe scov-specific neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the last dilution of serum that completely inhibited virus-induced cpetwo days post scov challenge mice were euthanized and their lungs were removed lung lobes including right middle lobe right lower lobe accessory lobe and left lobe were removed and placed in 10 buffered formalin for subsequent histological examination and immunohistochemistry ihc as described previously 41 for virus titration the remaining lobes of the lungs were weighed and frozen at 80 c before being homogenized in pbs10 fbs solution using the tissuelyser qiagen retsch haan germany the homogenates were then centrifuged and scov titers in the clarified fluid were determined in a tcid50 assay in quadruplicate wells of vero e6 cells in 96-well plates titers of virus in lung homogenates were expressed as tcid50gram of the lungs log10 and the minimal detectable level of virus was 23 log10 tcid50gformalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections were subjected to the standard hematoxylin and eosin and ihc staining for evaluating histopathology and detecting scov antigen respectively 41by using a statistical program instat version 3 graphpad software inc san diego ca we performed the kruskalwallis non-parametric analysis of variance anova test to compare arithmetic mean scov lung titers and neutralizing antibody titers undetectable virus titers were assigned a value of 18 the minimal detection limit being 23 log10g lung and undetectable virus-specific neutralizing titers were assigned a value of 10we have previously reported the successful production of scov vlps from 293t cells cotransfected with four pcaggs-based plasmids each of which encodes scov s m n or e proteins 36 without using exogenous viruses for protein expression in the study reported here we varied the amount of each plasmid for cotransfection and were able to generate approximately 13 g of scov vlps from 2  107 293t cells colloidal coomassie blue staining and western blot analysis identified scov s n and m proteins in the purified scov vlps fig 1a likewise transfection of four pcaggs-based plasmids each of which encoded mhv s e m or n proteins resulted in production of mhv vlps fig 1a after optimization we obtained approximately 223 g of purified mhv vlps from 2  107 293t cells demonstrating that the efficiency of mhv vlp production was substantially better than that of scov vlp production because m and e proteins drive vlp assembly and release 24 and coronavirus s protein is incorporated into vlps through ms interaction 25 27 28 42 these data indicated that mhv m and e proteins resulted in more efficient vlp production than did scov m and e proteinswe next tested whether coexpression of scov s protein and mhv e n and m protein could result in the efficient production of chimeric vlps which would contain high concentrations of the scov s protein if scov s protein interacts with mhv m protein then the robust vlp production machinery driven by mhv m and e proteins could result in efficient chimeric vlp production chimeric vlp production indeed occurred from 293t cells that were cotransfected with plasmids each of which expressed scov s protein mhv n protein mhv m protein or mhv e protein fig 1a colloidal coomassie blue staining and western blot analysis of purified chimeric vlp showed the presence of scov s mhv n and mhv m proteins in chimeric vlps with only a low level of host protein contamination negative staining of chimeric vlp revealed a typical spherical coronavirus structure with peplomers fig 1b after optimization approximately 87 g of purified chimeric vlps was produced from 2  107 293t cells the efficiency of chimeric vlp production was about 8 times better than that of scov vlpswe next tested efficiencies of chimeric vlp production from vero and cho cells both of which have been used for the preparation of human vaccines 43 44 45 46 47 by using various dna transfection reagents and combinations of different concentrations of each plasmid for transfection the efficiencies of chimeric vlp production from vero cells were about 10 times lower than those from 293t cells data not shown we found that when we used transit-293 the production of chimeric vlps from cho cells was about one-third of those from 293t cells in repeated experiments data not shown prolonged incubation of transfected 293t cells and cho cells for more than 4 days posttransfection did not improve the accumulation of chimeric vlps in the supernatant data not shownfor assessing the usefulness of chimeric vlps as a scov vaccine candidate we first tested the effects of immunization of mice with chimeric vlps on serum neutralizing antibody production and inhibition of scov replication in the lung six- to 8-week-old female balbc mice were inoculated im once with a mixture of 2 g of chimeric vlps prepared from 293t cells and pbs or 2 g of chimeric vlp mixed with alum as a placebo mice were inoculated im with vero e6 cell culture fluid while another group of mice were inoculated in with 1  106 tcid50 of scov to produce solid post-infection immunity twenty-eight days later the mice were bled for determining the serum neutralizing antibody titers fig 2a subsequently the mice were challenged in with 1  106 tcid50 of scov and the lung virus titers at 2 days post scov challenge were determined fig 2b no scov-specific neutralizing antibodies were detectable in the sera of the mice inoculated im with placebo minimal or no virus-specific neutralizing antibodies were evident in mice inoculated with chimeric vlps mixed with pbs mean titer 10  0 the mean serum neutralizing titers for the groups of mice inoculated with live virus 70  20 or chimeric vlp administered with alum 60  23 were not statistically different from each other but were statistically significantly higher p
  005 than those of the mice immunized with a mixture of chimeric vlps and pbs and the placebo group after challenge the mice immunized with vero e6 cell culture fluid placebo or with a mixture of 2 g chimeric vlp and pbs had high mean virus titers of 65 log10lung and 52 log10lung respectively in contrast no virus was detectable in the lungs of the mice previously administered either live scov or 2 g of chimeric vlp mixed with alum the scov titers in the lungs of these mice two days post virus challenge were inversely proportional to their serum virus-neutralizing antibody titersto study the immunogenicity of chimeric vlps three groups of mice were inoculated im with 05 1 or 2 g mixed with alum other groups of mice received a mixture of 2 g of chimeric vlps and pbs 2 g of mhv vlps and alum 1 g of influenza a virus vaccine and alum vero e6 cell culture fluid live scov or alum alone or the mice received no treatment mean neutralizing titers at 28 days post inoculation in mice receiving 05 1 or 2 g chimeric vlps with alum were 20  10 84  75 and 110  60 respectively fig 3a in the absence of alum 2 g chimeric vlps induced a lower but significant neutralizing antibody response of 125  5 the mice infected with scov had the neutralizing titer of 70  20 the mice inoculated with 2 g of mhv vlp had no detectable virus-specific neutralizing antibodies demonstrating that mhv s protein did not elicit neutralizing antibodies against scov the neutralizing antibody titers at 28 days post inoculation were not investigated in the groups of mice inoculated with influenza vaccine and alum alum alone or in those receiving no treatmentat day 28 these mice except for those untreated and those that had been inoculated with live scov were boosted with the same material then the neutralizing antibody titers at day 56 were determined fig 3b mice injected with chimeric vlps and alum had no increase in titer at the lowest dose but 1- and 2-g doses resulted in marked booster responses animals receiving the highest dose developed titers of 200  977 while those infected with scov had the neutralizing titer of 97  60 a second inoculation of a mixture of 2 g chimeric vlps with pbs efficiently boosted median neutralizing antibody titers to 57  21 which was higher than the titer following 05 g of chimeric vlp mixed with alum 15  57 no neutralizing antibodies were detected at the lowest dilution tested in groups receiving mhv vlp influenza vaccine and alum alum alone or placebo or in those left untreatedall mice were challenged in with live scov on day 56 and sacrificed 2 days later as expected maximal pulmonary virus titers were detected in the groups of mice inoculated with placebo 69 log10
 07 mhv vlps 62 log10
 04 influenza vaccine and alum 75  01 alum alone 73  0 and in those left untreated 85  0 fig 3c partial protection was obtained in groups of mice inoculated twice with 05 g chimeric vlp mixed with alum 55 log10
 06 2 g chimeric vlps and pbs 39 log10
 11 or 1 g chimeric vlps mixed with alum 31 log10
 05 notably no virus was detectable in the lungs of any of the mice given live virus in or two doses of 2 g chimeric vlp mixed with alum the mean lung virus titers for the latter two groups were statistically different from the mean pulmonary scov titer seen in the placebo control group when these means were compared using a non-parametric anova test both p values being 001 overall the virus levels in these animals generally correlated inversely with those of scov-specific neutralizing antibodies present in the sera of the micehistopathological examination of the groups of mice that neither produced neutralizing antibodies nor suppressed scov replication in the lungs ie mice treated with vero e6 cell culture fluid inoculated with a mixture of influenza virus vaccine and alum and with alum alone as well as those left untreated revealed moderate interstitial pneumonia fig 4a and b the bronchial epithelium appeared to be the main affected target with prominent cellular cytoplasmic swelling and blebbing extensive accumulation of cellular debris and necrotic epithelial cells accompanied by inflammatory infiltrates occurred in some bronchioles fig 4a we also observed a moderate infiltration of mononuclear cells around peribronchiolar and perivascular regions of infected tissues and a mild-to-moderate thickening of the bronchiolar interstitial tissues and alveolar walls with mononuclear cell infiltration fig 4b ihc staining demonstrated the presence of scov n protein within bronchiolar epithelial cells but not within cells of alveolar lining fig 4c in contrast to the prominent pathology and viral replication in the lungs of the control animals mild interstitial pneumonia was found upon viral challenge in the mice previously immunized with mixtures of either chimeric vlp and pbs or chimeric vlp and alum and in those infected with live scov fig 4d e g h specifically cytopathology ie swelling and blebbing was rarely observed in bronchiolar epithelial cells despite the presence of some desquamated cells within the airway lumen additionally the thickening of bronchiolar interstitial tissues and the alveolar wall and cellular infiltration were less prominent when compared with those of the control groups there was no big difference in the lung pathology between mice inoculated with vlp and pbs and those inoculated with vlp and alum we noticed that inflammatory mononuclear cells seemed to be the main if not only cellular component of the cellular infiltrates around the peribronchiolar and perivascular regions of mice initially primed with live scovin addition to inflammatory mononuclear cells we observed the infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils around the bronchioles and blood vessels of mice inoculated with a mixture of chimeric vlps and pbs and that of chimeric vlps and alum fig 4d and e counting of the infiltrating cells at the five fields of each mouses lung tissues revealed that infiltrating eosinophils represented 132  96 and 222  99 of all the infiltrating cells in mice inoculated with a mixture of chimeric vlp and pbs and in those inoculated with chimeric vlp and alum respectively in contrast infiltrating eosinophils represented merely 142  142 0 0 and 077  033 of all infiltrating cells in mice inoculated respectively with vero e6 cell culture fluid a mixture of influenza virus vaccine and alum alum alone and in those left untreatedthe present study tested the efficacy of immunization of mice with chimeric vlps for elicitation of anti-scov-neutralizing antibodies suppression of scov replication in the lungs and scov-mediated lung cytopathology although various strategies for scov vaccines including expression of scov s protein in other viruses 18 48 49 inactivated scov particles 50 51 52 53 dna vaccines 17 54 recombinant s protein 55 56 and other approaches 57 58 have been reported to our knowledge this is the first report testing vlps propagated in mammalian cells as scov vaccine candidates it appears that chimeric vlps produced from mammalian cells in this study were more immunogenic than were scov vlps produced by using a baculovirus-expression system 38 immunization of the mice four times with 100 g of the baculovirus-derived scov vlps in each immunization elicited neutralizing antibody titers that were no longer higher than those obtained in the present study use of inactivated scov as a scov vaccine is a similar vaccine strategy that was explored in the present study others reported that immunizing mice twice with 1 g of double-inactivated scov with alum elicited high titers of neutralizing antibodies 50 a major negative aspect of the use of inactivated scov vaccines is that extreme care must be taken to completely inactivate infectious scov in the vaccine preparations in contrast a vlp-based vaccine strategy eliminates this safety concernaccumulated data suggest the importance of the compatibility of the s protein endodomain or a cytoplasmic tail and m protein for assembly of s protein into coronavirus or vlps 40 59 60 in past reports s protein assembly occurred if these two regions are derived from the same virus but not from different coronaviruses accordingly we were surprised to find the efficient production of chimeric vlps carrying scov s protein and mhv-derived n m and e proteins the present data suggest that the endodomain of scov s protein interacted efficiently with mhv m protein and assembled into vlps the endodomain of coronavirus s proteins has two partially overlapping sub-regions a n-terminal 18-residue-long cysteine-rich region and a c-terminal 27-residue-long charge-rich region fig 5
 mhv lacking the very c-terminal 12-amino-acid segment of the s protein endodomain is viable and replicates well in cell culture suggesting that the removal of 12 carboxy-terminal residues does not inhibit interactions between the mutant s protein and the m protein 25 26 in contrast replication is severely impaired in mhv mutants lacking the very c-terminal 22 amino acids or 25 amino acids of the s protein endodomain ie constituting the majority of the charge-rich region 26 furthermore a single point mutation of a charged amino acid to alanine in the charge-rich region of the endodomain has no detectable effect on the incorporation of a heterologous protein containing mhv s endodomain into virions whereas mutants containing multiple charged residues-to-alanine significantly reduce the incorporation of the protein into virions 26 these data suggest that the charge-rich region of the endodomain plays a key role in the selective inclusion of the s protein into the virion we noted that there were 6 charged residues between the transmembrane domain and the c-terminal 12 amino acids in both scov and mhv while only 3 charged residues are found in feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv fig 5 fipv s protein is not assembled into vlps or viruses that carry mhv m n and e proteins 25 accordingly the presence of the same number of charged residues at the region of the endodomain which is considered to be important for s protein assembly into virus particles in both scov and mhv implies that both viruses had a similar structure in this portion of the endodomain allowing them to interact with mhv m proteininoculation of mice with a mixture of chimeric vlps and alum but not that of mhv vlps and alum induced antibodies that neutralized scov fig 3 the lack of heterologous protection confirmed that the scov s protein is the relevant constituent of the chimeric vlps as has been observed in other vlp systems 61 62 the particles themselves are immunogenic after 1 or 2 injections and provided protection when challenge was carried out after the second im injection of only 2 g addition of alum adjuvant enhanced induction of neutralizing antibodies and indeed titers reached those post-infection after two injections of 2 g all vlp groups had significant protection as evidenced by reduction in lung viral titers 2 days after virulent virus challenge the optimum time to detect replication in the balbc mouse 23 higher neutralizing antibody titers correlated with lower virus content and the 2 g plus alum groups had no detectable virus overall our data were in agreement with past reports revealing the importance of scov-specific neutralizing antibodies most of which recognize s protein for curbing scov replication in the lung 21 63 64 65 66 67immunization of mice with venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles encoding scov n protein induced an enhanced immunopathology that included infiltrating eosinophils in the lungs following scov challenge 68 implying the possibility that a scov vaccine lacking n protein expression may be desirable as it would reduce the potential risk of immunopathological changes primed by immunization in this regard chimeric vlps carrying mhv n protein or those lacking n protein unpublished data could eliminate the possible induction of scov n protein-induced immunopathology the efficient production of chimeric vlp from cho cells as we report in this study is promising as a new strategy for preparing vlp-based scov vaccine from mammalian cells its suitability for preparing large quantities of vlp-based vaccine against scov remains to be determined further improvements of chimeric vlp production eg codon-optimization of the scov s gene and mhv n m and e genes in the expression plasmids and development of an inexpensive transfection reagent andor procedure would be required for the substantial enhancement of chimeric vlp productionaccumulated data suggest that antibodies against the fipv s protein fail to protect cats from fipv challenge and enhance virus replication in the host through antibody-dependent enhancement ade 69 70 71 72 73 it has been reported that antibodies that neutralize most human scov isolates enhance entry of a scov isolate from the civet in the cell culture level 74 but it is unclear whether ade occurs in animals that are immunized with scov vaccine candidates we did not observe signs of ade in our study the mice that were immunized with chimeric vlps or initially inoculated with scov efficiently suppressed challenged scov replication s protein in chimeric vlps was derived from a scov urbani strain which was also used as the challenge virus and vlps induced antibodies that readily neutralized scov in vitro in this regard it is worth noting that immunization of mice with a venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon carrying s protein of the urbani strain showed only limited protection against heterologous scov that contained s gene from the human gd03 isolate 68subbarao et al reported mild and focal peribronchiolar mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates and scov antigens in bronchiolar epithelial cells in the lungs of balbc mice at 2 days post scov inoculation 23 staining with scov monoclonal antibody to n protein we also found scov antigen within bronchiolar epithelial cells after challenge of unimmunized mice consistent with the scov titers in the lungs no viral antigen was detected in the lungs of the mice inoculated with chimeric vlps the absence of scov antigen in the lungs of vlp-immunized mice or mice pre-exposed to live virus as indicated by the results of ihc staining fig 4b strongly argue for the efficacy of chimeric vlps in protecting against sars-cov infection scov-induced histopathological changes that were detected in unimmunized mice in our study appeared to be similar or slightly more severe especially with respect to the changes in the bronchioles than those described in the report of subbarao et al 23 after scov challenge the mice immunized with chimeric vlps showed mixed peribronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates and a slight thickening of the peribronchiolar interstitium and alveolar walls these lesions in immunized mice were milder than seen in unimmunized mice demonstrating the effects of chimeric vlp immunization in suppressing scov-induced cytopathological changes in the lungs the mice immunized with a mixture of chimeric vlp and alum had higher neutralizing antibody titers than did those immunized with a mixture of the chimeric vlp and pbs while both groups of the mice showed similar levels of scov-induced lung cytopathology suggesting neither alum nor neutralizing antibody titers were sole determinant of the severity of inflammatory responses possible cellular immune responses against chimeric vlp proteins were suggested by the observation that the mice inoculated with a mixture of chimeric vlps and pbs and that of chimeric vlps and alum but not other groups of mice showed infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils around the bronchioles and blood vessels in contrast it has been reported that immunization of mice with a mixture of inactivated scov with adjuvant mf59 primary elicited humoral immune response 75 further investigation using not only balbc mice but also other scov susceptible mice 41 76 77 and other animal models 78 79 will be necessary to evaluate the implications and impact of cellular immune activities including pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils as well as the utility of chimeric vlps as a scov vaccinecurrent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus is one of the deadliest virus outbursts of a century covid-19 is clinically characterized by difficulty in breathing fever and low blood oxygen level
the chronology of covid-19 infection starts when the initial case series was reported in december 2019 1 from 18 december 2019 through december 29 2019 five patients were hospitalized in hospitals of hubei province china with symptoms of atypical pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by unidentified infectious agent one of these patients succumbed to the disease 2 given the rapidity of its spread and atypical symptoms an outbreak was suspected and contact tracing was done which led the epidemiologists to a wholesale market of seafood and wild animals in wuhan district of the province at that point of time it was assumed to be due to any infective agents virus which was later identified as a new strain of coronavirus this new strain was named as 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov on 12 january 2020 by the world health organization who who officially named the disease caused by this novel virus as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19the current outbreak of the covid-19 virus has caused more than 5598 deaths in india mohfw india and more than 1931076 and 6057853 peoples have suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in india and worldwide respectively till 2nd june 2020 3 4 so far there is no established treatment option or prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to sars-cov-2 and those who develop covid-19 reviewing the documented scientific evidence of past similar viral outbreaks in various parts of the world helped in trying few therapy regimens initially but were not found effective in managing the present pandemic perfectly given that the present virus seems diverse in structure and characteristics 5clinical presentation of the persons infected with novel coronavirus ranges from asymptomatic subclinical infection to mild pharyngitis to severe lower respiratory tract illness fever cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing chills repeated shivering with chills muscle pain headache and sore throat loss of taste or smell are the few known symptoms 4 these symptoms may appear 214 days after exposure to the virus despite advancements in science technology and relentless research by scientific communities all over the world a comprehensive and compelling management of covid-19 is still lackingas the uncertainties in management of covid-19 are growing we started our search on what are novel strategies being explored in management of the covid-19 outbreak thus we have noticed a plethora of case series clinical trials preclinical trials and lab researches aiming to know the new modes of treatment we restricted our search only to studies on stem cell biology based and nucleic acid based vaccines thus we explored various trials registry nih httpsclinicaltrialsgov and httpswwwcoronavirusgov and chinese clinical trial registry httpwwwchictrorgcn and for preclinical trials various university institutions pharmaceutical companys websites and news bulletins portals were checked routinely from 3rd march 2020 to 21st may 2020 the proper phrase with boolean operator and were used for searching in scientific database like stem cell therapy and covid-19 mesenchymal stem cell and corona 2019 virus dna vaccines and covid-19 rna vaccines and covid-19 cell-based therapy with sars-cov-2 and universityinstitutions were used the trials on above stem cells and dnarna vaccines which were cancelled chictr2000030329 chictr2000030300 chictr2000030224 chictr2000029816 and chictr2000029812 and others like repurposing of drugs nano vaccines viral vectors based vaccines other miscellaneous trials of herbs music therapy etc were excluded from the review list the limitations are not so significant as few registered clinical trials have not mentioned their stage of clinical trials as i ii and iii and all trials have variable no of subjects in this review we are discussing and exploring the novel strategies 6 7 specially focussing on stem cell based therapy with and without immune cells rna and dna nucleic acid based vaccine trials so far used or in process of implementations against covid-19 pandemicthis situation is like a new puzzle out in the open for all to solve since the first reported case of covid-19 several anti-viral and antiparasite drugs were used but the efficacy of all such trials are questioned statistically hence we postulate and simultaneously hope for new modalities to have potential to manage this new viral pandemic and in our review this seems quite plausible in the near futurein recent years stem cell therapy has become one of the emerging therapeutic strategies in the treatment of many intractable diseases including viral infections although the development and progression in these cell-based therapies especially pluripotent stem cells are quite slow due to limited sources of its isolation and associated ethical constraints the common cells of choice are mesenchymal stem cells mscs may be due to source prospective or availability a high multiplying rate low invasive procedure and relative less of ethical constraints 8 9advantages of mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy include 1 easy accessibility and isolation from bone marrow bm most preferred site peripheral blood pb and adipose tissues abdominal fat infrapatellar fat pad and buccal fat pad these cells can also be isolated easily from neonatal birth-associated tissues including placenta pl umbilical cord uc warton jelly wj amniotic fluid af and cord blood cb these cells once isolated can then be stored for future possible applications 2 the cells are multipotent stem cells can self-renew by dividing and has ability to differentiate into multiple specialized cells 3 mscs can easily expand to required clinical and scientific volume in relatively shorter time period 4 mscs can be deposited for repetitive therapeutic applications 5 clinical trials of mscs until now have not revealed any severe adverse body reactions to allogeneic msc 6 safety of mscs have been reported in many clinical trials 8besides the availability storage and safety the efficacy of mscs in viral diseases is also to be well explained theoretically it is well established that during viral infections of high replicative and virulence the innate and adaptive immunity defense get impaired orchestrated immune players especially apcs antigen presenting cell dendritic cells macrophages etc fail to engulf process and present antigens to adaptive immune players t cells and b cells the above failure in innate and ultimately in the adaptive immune system provides green signals to proliferate viruses and aggravate their infections consequently the inflammation due to imbalance in cytokine milieu occurs like other infective diseases and cancer etc 1013studies have shown that covid-19 triggers mounting of aggravated cytokine storms which is mainly projected due to a large number of inflammatory factors-interleukins and immune cells 13 14 the cytokine storm generated ultimately impairs the apcs and adaptive immune cells thus nowadays the researchers as shown in table 1 are in a way to develop mscs therapy with either natural apcs or with artificial apcs to mount an appropriate immune responseas per previous studies on other viral diseases and few also on covid-19 it has been shown that mscs retains immune-regulatory potential by modifying immune responses with the help of proliferation and function of numerous immune cells like inhibiting differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells dcs changing the cytokine profiles of dcs with upregulation of regulatory cytokines and suppression of inflammatory cytokines mscs are also known to induce tolerant phenotypes of naive and effector t cells constraining antibody production by b cells and suppressing nk cell proliferation and nk cell-mediated cytotoxicity 1519 these immunomodulatory activities are mediated by both cellcell communications and secreted cytokines including interferon-ifn-  indoleamine 23-dioxygenase ido transforming growth factor-tgf-  interleukin il- 6 il-10 and prostaglandin e2 1923 with these suggested advantages and in hope of successful management of this pandemic several trials are underway on mscs by the united states china israel iran italy and iraq etc to combat the outbreak of covid-19 as shown in table 1in a case report of a 65-year-old female patient diagnosed with covid-19 hospitalised in critical condition had a neutrophilia increase of 87 and an associated lymphocytopenia decrease of 98 was treated with antiviral drugs such as lopinavirritonavir ifn- and oseltamivir but the vital signs kept on worsening as a trial of treatment patient was started on umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells uc-mscs with 1 thymosin 5  107 cells three times each and close monitoring of vitals done serum parameters revealed that after the second injection serum albumin crp and altast gradually reduced along with improvement in vital signs thereafter the patient was weaned off gradually from life supporting devices on investigations the number of total white blood cells and neutrophils returned back to a normal level while the number of lymphocytes increased to their normal level further assessment revealed a significant increase in numbers of cd3 t cell cd4 t cell and cd8 t cell radiological evidence of improvement was noted after a third dose of cord stem cells ultimately the patient was discharged from the icu ward this case report strongly recommended that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells alone or in combination with other immune modulators should be explored as a treatment option for acute covid-19 patients 24recently researchers from china beijing shanghai and hubei completed a study in which they successfully transplanted human mscs trial depicted in table 1 the study showed improvement in the outcome of 7 recruited and treated patients with covid-19 pneumonia in beijing youan hospital china from jan 23 2020 to feb 16 2020 the clinical results as well as alterations of inflammatory expressions immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 registered patients were evaluated for 14 days after msc injection mscs transplant significantly improved the symptoms and signs of all seven patients without any adverse effects the pulmonary function tests of these patients were significantly better 2 days post msc transplantation after the transplant the increase in peripheral lymphocytes counts was noticed and the c-reactive protein infection and inflammatory marker decreased additionally exaggerated levels of cytokine secreting immune cells cxcr3 cd4 t cells cxcr3 cd8 t cells and cxcr3  nk cells seen initially vanished in 36 days post treatment further a group of cd14  cd11c cd11 and regulatory dendritic cells population was also increased along with these the level of pro-inflammatory tnf- was seen to be decreased and anti-inflammatory il-10 levels were increased significantly in msc based treated group compared to the control placebo group thus this very first study of intravenous transplantation of mscs has opened a new vista as it was reported safe and effective for treatment in patients with covid-19 pneumonia 25further one more trial of mscs in marchapril 2020 is reported by pluristem therapeutics inc nasdaq psti tase psti haifa israel a leading regenerative medicine company has claimed successful treatment of patients suffering from covid-19 complications in the united states the treatment was as per the us food and drug administrations fda single patient expanded access program also called a compassionate use program which is part of the us coronavirus treatment acceleration program ctap an emergency program for that allows quick trials of all possible promising and available modalities in effective management of the pandemic before treatment with plx the patient was reported as critically ill with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and was on life support facilities for 3 weeks as per company news bulletin plx cells are allogeneic mesenchymal-like cells that possess immunomodulatory properties and are able to induce the immune systems natural regulatory t cells and m2 macrophages and thus may check or reverse the hazardous aggravation of the immune system so plx cells may potentially reduce the incidence andor severity of covid-19 pneumonia and pneumonitis leading hopefully to a better prognosis for the patients now the company is planning to work with the bih center for regenerative therapy bcrt and the berlin center for advanced therapies becat at charite university of medicine berlin to explore plx cell products candidates for covid-19as per the report on 8th may 2020 the company registered a phase ii trial after getting clearance from fda titled a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre parallel-group phase ii study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intramuscular injections of plx-pad for the treatment of severe covid-19 they proposed to treat 140 adult patients that are intubated and mechanically ventilated and are suffering from respiratory failure and ards due to covid-19 the primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the number of ventilator-free days during the 28 days from day 1 through day 28 of the study 26the initial result of the above phase of trial was made available on may 14 2020 in which the company claimed 875 survival rate of patients who were admitted with invasive mechanical ventilation out of these 75 of patients no longer require any mechanical ventilation further 625 of the patients were discharged from the hospitalin conclusion the above trials of mscs-based therapy in covid-19 patients suggest that this is worth exploring option for treatment of novel coronavirus or any other similar outbreaks in the futureit has been reported that during viral infections including covid-19 the dysregulated cytokine storm with enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory and downgraded expression of anti-inflammatory is a common phenomenon in an animal-based study it is documented that leukaemia inhibitory factor lif plays an essential role in neutralizing the cytokine storm in the lungs during viral pneumonia 27 mscs are known to release lif as per requirements but the cost burden of processing and maintaining it is on a higher side for the general patients answer to this comes with the invention of lifnano which is a result of application of nanotechnology principles on generation of synthetic stem cells that has shown a thousand times more potency than soluble lif 28 29although only a single finding of lifinano ie nanotechnology-based synthetic stem cells against experimental allergic encephalomyelitis eae a preclinical model of multiple sclerosis has been claimed where treatment with lifnano reversed paralysis within 4 days a timeline in accord with that reported for beneficial effects in covid-19 pneumonia using msc therapy this study has shown that lif is particularly important for the activation of epithelial stat3 which is required for proper functioning of lung alveoli and the treatment with exogenous lif or lif over-expression can limit pulmonary inflammation in response to lps or hypoxia 29 thus lifnano has a cutting edge technology and it could be utilized as an alternative to cell-based therapy to cater the need for a high volume and off-the-shelf therapeutic agents thus this therapy may be able to rejuvenate injured tissues and suppress the cytokine storm in atypical pneumonia of covid 19 patientsin the last 3 decades an innovative approach of vaccination has been developed which involves the direct introduction of a plasmid encompassing the dna sequence encoding the antigens into appropriate tissues in which an immune response is required this method provides several prospective benefits over conventional approaches such as the stimulation of both b- and t-cell responses enhanced vaccine stability the absence of any infectious entity and the feasibility of large-scale productionas evidence of the principle of dna vaccination immune reactions in animals have been assessed using genes from a diverse class of infectious agents including influenza virus hepatitis b virus human immunodeficiency virus rabies virus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus malarial parasites and mycoplasmas in a few studies protection from disease in animals has also been achieved though the worth and benefits of dna vaccines must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and their relevance will be determined by the nature of the agent being immunized against the nature of the antigen and the type of immune response required for protectionthe arena of dna vaccination is evolving rapidly vaccines presently being developed utilizes not only dna but also encompasses an accessory segment that supports dna to enter precisely into targeted cells or that may work as adjuvants in exciting or directing the immune response the earliest dna vaccines approved for marketing are likely to use plasmid dna derived from bacterial cells there are many gene-based vaccines permitted for use in veterinary practice for targeting canine melanoma merial west nile virus wyeth fish hematopoietic necrosis virus novartis and swine growth hormone-releasing hormone inovio now diverse strategies are in process to execute with rnas as well as with complexes of nucleic acid molecules and other entities 30it is recognized that the development and application of nucleic acid vaccines are evolving rapidly currently during the covid-19 outbreak several dna and rna vaccines trials as depicted in tables 2 and 3 are also in progress few are in clinical phase i and ii trials while others are in the pre-clinical validation stage by various institutions and pharmaceutical companies like initial initiative in feb 2020 as dna vaccine was taken by applied dna sciences usa subsidiary linearx and takis biotech italy by establishing a joint venture to develop a linear dna vaccine as a treatment for coronavirus the vaccine development utilizes polymerase chain reaction pcr-based dna manufacturing technology to develop the vaccineanother clinical trial of dna vaccines has been initiated by inovio pharmaceuticals usa in collaboration with coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi norway the current open-label phase i trial has been initiated in 40 participants to evaluate the safety tolerability and immunological profile of ino-4800 administered by intradermal id injection followed by electroporation ep using the cellectra 2000 device in healthy adult volunteerssimilarly a rna based vaccines phase i trial is in the process by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid united states registered trial as safety and immunogenicity study of 2019-ncov vaccine mrna-1273 for prophylaxis of sars-cov-2 infection covid-19 on 105 participants recently entos pharmaceuticals usa is developing fusogenix dna vaccine by using the fusogenix drug delivery platform to prevent covid-19 infections fusogenix drug delivery platform is a proteo-lipid vehicle that introduces genetic payload directly into the cells entos is working on developing an optimized payload containing multiple protein epitopes derived from sars-cov-2 proteins which will stimulate an immune response in the body to prevent covid-19 infection similarly zydus cadila india declared the pre-clinical trial to develop a vaccine for covid-19 using two novel approaches the first approach includes the development of a dna vaccine against the viral membrane protein of the virus while a live attenuated recombinant measles virus rmv vectored vaccine will be developed in the other further several preclinical trials on dnarna based vaccines have been started globally by reputed instituteuniversity like karolinska institute sweden waterloo university canada fudan university china shanghai jiaotong university china to pharmaceutical company like zydus cadila india bionet asia immunomic therapeutics thai-french privately-held biotech company etc and many more as shown in tables 2 and 3 these institutionsuniversities and pharmaceutical industries are in the process of developing suitable dnarna based vaccines against the covid-19 virus at the earliest 31the results of these on-going clinical trials on new therapeutic options have brought in hope in controlling the spread of novel coronavirus and sufferings of patients with covid-19 not only this the success of such trials may prove the best utilization of the technological advances and their integration with health sciences rna and dna vaccines offer us the potential for more rapid vaccine development because synthetic rna and dna are easier to construct and are relatively purified from contaminants improving safety with immense potential of scaling up the volume of production in comparison to the traditional vaccines as mentioned in text the phase i and phase ii clinical trials of pluristem therapeutics inc nasdaq psti tase psti haifa israel working on mesenchymal stem cells for treating covid-19 patients has shown higher recovery rate and less mortality paving the way to explore this treatment strategy for the large number of patients affected with severe forms of covid-19 all over the world mscs are well known in downgrading the inflammation and activation of antigen presenting cells but there is no evidence of their role in the activation of b cells and t cells which is well-known role of dna and rna based vaccines so both mscs and nucleic acid based vaccines in a synergistic way or with immune-engineered modification may produce better results in combating with this virus 32 33 thus utilization of such novel vaccines might be a better way for mitigation of the current covid-19 pandemic the finding that mesenchymal stem cells and dnarna vaccines are safe and can reverse severe critical disease with high potency is a key breakthrough representing an entirely new biological approach to treatment of such deadly viral diseases given the pressing needs to keep mortality as low as possible such treatments need to be researched and developed promptlyremarkably after 3 decades of discovery of dna vaccines and after few unsatisfactory human clinical trials of first-generation vaccines dna vaccines are now undergoing advancement with the introduction of more competent designs isolations of bio-molecules characterizations and better delivery technologies including electroporation like the past of monoclonal antibody vaccines development programme initially went through a highly negative phase but now has emerged as pharmaceutical blockbusters this also has scalable potential over the others now it is believed that dna vaccines have passed their darkest phase and thereby will soon be ready to emerge as commercially viable products most likely in the area of antiviral vaccines similarly the msc platform has the potential to express hundreds of peptides thereby generating a broad array of epitopes with precise post-translational processing mimicking natural infection thus by inducing immunity to a combination of epitopes and complimentary determining regions cdrs it may be possible to develop prophylactic and even therapeutic vaccines against current pandemic disease covid-19 where traditional vaccination approaches have failed to solve the puzzle we hope that these innovative vaccine strategies may open new vistas in the management of covid-19 and soon whole humanity would be free from the current covid-19 viral outbreakfeline infectious peritonitis fip was first described as an important disorder of cats by holzworth in 19631 at the angell memorial animal hospital boston and a clinico-pathologic conference on this disorder was published in the following year2 the disease was thought to be infectious but no specific etiologic agent was identified at the time wolfe and griesemer3 were the first to propose that fip was caused by a virus zook et al4 observed virus particles in the tissues of experimentally infected cats but were unable to characterize the agent ward5 recognized the close similarities of fip virus fipv in tissues to members of the family coronaviridae in 1972 montali and strandberg6 were the first to report that fipv infection could be either granulomatous dry parenchymatous or effusive wet non-parenchymatous the close genetic relationship of fipv to coronaviruses of dogs and swine was first reported by pedersen et al in 19787 fully virulent fipv was first propagated in vitro in autochthonous macrophage cultures from experimentally infected cats8 and later in tissue culture9 10 it was also replicated in the epithelium of intestinal ring cultures11 a strain of fipv fipv-ucd1 was first propagated in continuously passsaged felis catus whole fetus-4 fcwf-4 cells and shown to be virulent when inoculated into cats12 the fcwf-4 cells were later found to be of a macrophage type13 the existence of two serotypes feline coronavirus fcov-like and canine coronavirus ccv-like of feline coronaviruses was first reported in

the sudden appearance of fip in the late 1950s was documented by long-term and meticulous necropsy records at the angell memorial animal hospital boston1 15 therefore its existence as a significant disease entity prior to this time is questionable a reference to a cat with a disease resembling fip was published a half century earlier jakob16 as quoted in de groot and horzinek17 but whether this was fip is uncertain given the absence of reports of a similar condition in the intervening decades there was a steady increase in the incidence of the disease in the 1960s onward and it is currently one of the leading infectious causes of death among young cats from shelters and catteries the reason for the sudden emergence of fip is not known but there are at least three possible explanations first coronaviruses may have speciated into cats within the last half century it is noteworthy that fip appeared within a decade of the initial descriptions of transmissible gastroenteritis tge of pigs in north america18 the causative virus of fip is closely related to the tge virus of pigs and ccv7 although they are still genetically distinguishable19 however recombinants between these three viruses are known to occur14 20 21 22 at least one strain of ccv can induce mild enteritis in cats and enhance a subsequent infection with fipv indicating a special closeness to feline coronaviruses23 therefore ccv may be a more likely parent of fecv in this scenario recombination events are favored by the ease with which transcription units rnas can be gained or lost during the divergent evolution of coronaviruses24 secondly the fip mutation may be selective to a variant fecv that appeared in the 1950s this variant could also have arisen because of the intra- and inter-species mutability of coronaviruses in general and in this case fcov in particular a third explanation may involve changes in how cats were viewed as pets and their husbandry in this modern era there was a dramatic shift in the status keeping and breeding of cats as pets after world war ii the numbers of pet cats greatly increased purebreeding and cattery rearing became increasingly popular and more cats and in particular kittens found themselves in shelters these large multiple cat indoor environments are known to favor feline enteric coronavirus fecv infection and fip reviewed by pedersen et al 200825 interestingly feline leukemia virus felv infection also became rampant among indoor multi-cat households during this period and felv infection was a significant cofactor for fip until it was pushed back into nature with testing eliminationisolation and eventual vaccination in the 1970s and 1980s26
fipv is a virulence form biotype of the fecv27 28 29 the generic name fcov has been loosely applied to all serotypes and biotypes of feline coronaviruses using this nomenclature fecv is technically an enteric biotype of fcov while fipv is an fip biotype unfortunately the widespread use of the generic term fcov has led to confusion when reviewing the worlds literature because it is often difficult and sometimes impossible to determine which virus biotype is being discussed or even studied to avoid confusion this review will attempt to decipher the various authors meaning when the generic term fcov has been used and to use fecv to refer to the ubiquitous enteric biotype of fcov present in most healthy cat populations and fipv when referencing the virulent biotype that causes fip in individual catsthe fipv is somewhat unique from other viruses because it is infrequently spread from animal to animal in a horizontal manner yet it is highly infectious when extracts of affected tissues or fluids are inoculated into nave cats by a number of routes see discussion on experimental infection in this regard fipv resembles the infectious acute sarcoma-inducing retroviruses of cats where the mutant form is found only in tumors and is not horizontally transmitted in nature but the parent felv is shed in various excretions and secretions and horizontally spread30 therefore fipvs are strongly cell and tissue bound and shedding in feces or urine would be possible only under special circumstances such as if lesions efface the renal collecting ducts or intestinal wall and are shed in urine or feces the infectivity of urine has been reported at least once in the literature31
the genomic structure of all feline coronaviruses is similar their genomes are incorporated into a single rna strand made up of around 29000 nucleotides there are 11 putative open reading frames orfs or genes including a non-structural replicase with two large orfs four structural orfs encoding the spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid proteins and five accessory orfs 3ac and 7ab the 7a gene is not essential for virulence based on identification of field strains of both fecv and fipv that lack a functional 7a gene32 likewise small deletion mutations in the 7b gene were found in 832 isolates associated with both enteric and infection and fip33 however the functionality of the mutated 7b genes was not mentionedthe fipv like fecv also exists in two serotypes based on virus neutralizing antibodies type i and type ii14 34 serotype i virus has a distinctively feline spike protein while the spike protein of type ii serotypes is a recombinant between feline and canine enteric coronaviruses35 type i fecvsfipvs predominate throughout the world14 36 37 but type ii strains make up more than 30 of isolates in certain countries such as japan38 type ii strains appear to be more adaptable to tissue culture however type i strains may be more likely to cause clinical fip37
in addition to the two serotypes fecvs and their fipv biotypes exist in numerous strains defined by distinct single nucleotide polymorphisms snps and insertiondeletions indels differences are small between isolates within the same group of cats seldom more than 12 but can be up to 20 between isolates from geographically distinct regions mutations are found in all genes to some extent or the other but tend to be concentrated in the nine accessory and structural genes rather than in the two genes comprising the large replicase functional mutations in several of the accessory genes including 3c and 7b do not appear to prevent replication either in vitro39 or in vivo29 40 there is no evidence that certain strains of fecv are more likely to mutate to fipvs but this needs to be more thoroughly studiedthe mutation responsible for the fipv biotype is consistently found in the 3c gene which encodes a small protein of unknown function nc pedersen uc davis 2009 manuscript submitted29 the mutations are usually snps causing premature stop codons or deletion mutations that negate or significantly truncate the 3c gene product the specific deleterious mutation in orf 3c can differ even between affected kittens in the same litter nc pedersen uc davis 2009 manuscript submitted again supporting internal mutation and auto-infection rather than cat-to-cat transmission as the primary route of exposure loss of 3c gene function does not prevent replication in vivo or in vitro but is thought to drastically alter cell tropism by enhancing internalization and replication of fipvs in macrophages41 42 in contrast the parent fecv is more tropic for mature apical epithelium of the bowel27 however this may be simplistic because fecv infection does have a systemic as well as intestinal phase and may be present in monocytes and phagocyte rich organs during primary infection43 the question however is to what extent fecv replicates in these non-intestinal cells and organsthe fecv  fipv mutation is more likely to occur during primary infection and in kittens because both conditions lead to a higher level of fecv replication and the latter to a decreased resistance to the mutation once it occurs25 the fipv mutants occurred in 20 of primary fecv-infected cats in one study28 however fecv infection is often recurrent and there is some evidence that fip may also occur as a consequence of these recurrent bouts of virus replication addie et al44 followed 56 cats deemed to have recurrent fecv infections based on decreasing and rising antibody titers 356 animals subsequently developed fipthe internal mutation theory of the fecv  fipv conversion has been recently questioned by dye and siddell45 they compared the full length genomic sequence of viruses found in two different tissues of a cat with classical fip this study was based on earlier findings of addie et al46 which showed that many cats with fip shed a coronavirus presumably fecv in their feces their fipv was from lesional tissues liver while their putative fecv was obtained from a segment of jejunum they found no differences in sequence between the two viruses and suggested that this called the internal mutation theory into question however the sequences from viral genomes present in the two tissues showed extensive mutations in the 3c7b region which occur in fipvs but not in true fecvs the jejunum is a known site for fecv replication during acute infection27 which is in the ileum the colon and the rectum47 furthermore we have recently documented that a portion of coronaviruses isolated from feces of cats with fipv are much more likely to resemble the fipvs in the tissue than the parent fecv this means that only fecal coronaviruses that have an intact 3c gene can be designated as an fecv therefore the two viruses being compared by dye and siddell45 were identical fipvsseveral studies have implied that whether a cat develops fip after fecv exposure is determined by how the host responds to the virus and not from differences in biotype48 49 50 51 another study suggested that fip results from the systemic spread of fecv from the gut into blood monocytes43 however there should be no doubt that fecv and fipv are genetically distinct in a minor but crucial manner and that this difference is essential for causing fip furthermore immunity to fecv infection does not confer immunity to fipv infection and differences in immunity to the two viruses are qualitative and not merely quantitative however host and environmental factors admittedly play a role in whether or not fip is clinically manifested28 52 53
fip is mainly a disease of domestic cats it has also been recognized in the african lion mountain lion leopard cheetah jaguar lynx serval caracal european wild cat sand cat and pallas cat54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 an almost identical infectious peritonitis has been described in interferon-gamma deficient mice64 65 66 and in ferrets67 infected with their respective species of coronavirusfip occurs wherever fecv is found27 44 53 58 68 and is therefore worldwide and ubiquitous among virtually all cat populations thus the epizootiology of fip is closely linked to that of fecv shedding of fecv can be transient recurrent or chronic over periods of months or years25 69 259 the fecv is present in virtually all catteries and shelters with more than six cats and is shed by 60 or more of pet cats from multi-cat households one-third of older cats and 90 of kittens and juveniles presented to shelters in sacramento ca usa were shedding fecv at the time of entry70 a significant proportion of these cats were from the feral population so it is fair to say that fecv is enzootic among both indoor and outdoor cat populations similar findings have been reported for most but not all other countries bell et al71 72 found the seroprevalence of fecv to be 34 among pedigree cats in the sydney area and non-existent in feral cats tested they confirmed that the number of cats per household had a significant influence on the infection rate and that certain breeds had a higher incidence of seropositivity than othersextensive studies have been undertaken on both natural27 73 74 and experimental fecv infections25 27 the infection is spread by the fecaloral route and viral shedding in feces occurs within a week of exposure25 this shedding occurs from the ileum the colon and the rectum47 shedding of fecv can be persistent for up to 18 months or more be persistent for 46 months and intermittent for months thereafter or cleared within 68 months studied and reviewed by pedersen et al 200825 however immunity in recovered cats is tenuous and reinfections resembling primary exposure often occur the same strain tends to persist in all cats within a given cattery or region however an occasional cat in a group may be infected with more than one strain or a different strain73 259 virus shedding is somewhat associated with coronavirus antibody titer levels groups of cats with indirect fluorescent antibody titers of 1100 or much more likely to have coronavirus shedders than groups of cats with titers of 12525
most deaths from fip occur in cats 316 months of age and are uncommon after 5 years15 53 in one study fip was the most common single cause of disease in cats younger than 2 years of age while cancer was the most common single disorder in the 28 years age range75 the incidence of fip in a veterinary medical teaching hospital from 19861995 was 1200 among new feline visits 1300 among total cat accessions and 1 of 100 accessions at diagnostic laboratories76 the incidence of fip is significantly higher among kittens and younger cats originating from purebreed catteries and shelters an average of 15 of young cattery or shelter cats in the us will die from fip with loses in catteries higher than from shelters enzootics with 10 mortality were noted at least once in 5 years among young cats and kittens originating from four typical catteries that were studied53 cave et al77 studied the causes of death among 274 sheltered and privately owned pedigreed and non-pedigreed kittens from 19862000 twenty-five percent of all kitten mortality was due to feline parvovirus fpv the main viral infections in 1538 day-olds were feline herpesvirus and feline calicivirus fip caused the death of 17203 kittens in the postweaning 35112 days of age period with an incidence of 84the fip losses occur as enzootics or epizootics with the former being more common the fip losses are sporadic unpredictable and infrequent in the enzootic form catteries with enzootic fip may not have any deaths for years followed by several cases in rapid succession the disease may then disappear only to reappear months or years later overall mortality from enzootic disease over a 5-year or longer period is usually 15 however epizootics of 349 have been observed in groups of kittens raised in one cattery over a 4-year period and similar explosive outbreaks have been seen in several other catteries58 78 epizootics of fip seldom last for more than 612 months before returning to an enzootic state enzootic fip is usually associated with persistence of the same or similar strains of enteric coronaviruses within a population while epizootics are multifactorial and reflect increased population stresses usually associated with overcrowding and high kitten production the unintentional use of genetically predisposed breeding stock possible bouts of horizontal transmission or the introduction of a new strain of fecvseveral risk factors for fip have been identified in catteries53 in this study fip was not significantly associated with particular catteries mean cat number mean age gender cattery median coronavirus antibody titer husbandry and quarantine practices caging and breeding practices or prevalence of concurrent diseases however individual cat age individual cat coronavirus titer overall frequency of fecal coronarvirus shedding and the proportion of cats in the cattery that were chronic fecv shedders were associated with increased risk of fip deaths from fip were more frequent in fall and winter and on the basis of analysis of cattery records the number of deaths varied yearly epizootics 10 mortality rate were reported at least once in 5 years among the four catteries studied one of the most significant factors appeared to be genetic susceptibility which accounts for up to 50 of the incidence52 multi-cat households that have not personally experienced fip loses but which relocated or sold cats that later develop fip were no more likely to experience fip over a 6-year period than households that had experienced no prior fip loses or catteries that had lost cats to fip79 thus every cattery with enzootic fecv infection is at risk of losing cats from fip if they breed enough kittens over a long enough time the risk of developing fip appears to decrease over periods of 3 years in groups of cats indicating an increase in population resistance79
the incidence of fip in shelters seems to be directly correlated with the numbers and density of young cats and the length of time that they are held before adoption greater and longer being much worse k hurley uc davis unpublished findings 2008 reports from the us and europe indicate an increased risk for young cats purebreds and intact males and a decreased risk in spayed females76 a report of 42 confirmed fip cases from australia between 1990 and 2002 has shown fip to be over-represented in certain pure breeds burmese australian mist british shorthair and cornish rex and under-represented in other breeds domestic shorthair persian and a more even distribution across the age spectrum80 the breed incidence of another veterinary teaching hospital was analyzed over a 16-year period and the breed gender and reproductive status of affected cats were compared to the general cat population and to mixed breed cats evaluated during the same period81 as with previous studies sexually intact cats and purebreed cats were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with fip males and young cats also had a higher prevalence of disease abyssinians bengals birmans himalayans ragdolls and rexes had a significantly higher risk whereas burmese exotic shorthairs manxes persians russian blues and siamese cats were at decreased risk such studies indicate that the incidence of fip among breeds can vary greatly between countries and regions and fip loses are probably more related to bloodlines within a breed than to breeds themselvesfip refers to the more common effusive wet non-parenchymatous form of the disease a transmissible inflammatory condition of the visceral serosa and omentum with exudation into the abdomen3 a second form of the disease is characterized by granulomatous involvement of parenchymatous organs such as the kidneys mesenteric lymph nodes bowel wall liver central nervous system cns and the eyes6 15 granulomatous fip is called dry parenchymatous or non-effusive because there is no inflammatory exudation into body cavitiesthe most common form of fip is wet or effusive although the proportion of cats with dry fip appears to be rising over the last few decades cats rarely manifest both forms of the disease at the same time and if they do it is usually a transition stage from wet to dry or dry to wet under experimental conditions cats that develop dry fip often have a brief episode of effusive disease at the onset while some cats with dry fip may become more effusive in the terminal stages of their illness however these transitions are much less noticeable in naturethe incubation period time from infection to disease of effusive fip is 214 days under experimental conditions12 82 83 84 the incubation period for experimentally induced dry fip is several weeks longer however the actual incubation period in natural infections is unknown but there is evidence the infection may smolder in a subclinical state for weeks months and even years before overt signs are noticed in retrospect the clinical onset of fip may be preceded by a long history of vague ill health and stunted growth co-infections with other feline pathogens may lower resistance to fipv or may complicate the disease picture see preceding discussionthe earliest signs of overt fip besides a failure to thrive in young cats include a progressively worsening malaise fluctuating fever inappetence and weight loss other signs of disease are superimposed on these basic disease signs depending on the form and organ distribution of the inflammation table 1
 abdominal distension is the most common physical finding in wet fip and ranks higher than cardiovascular disease neoplasia hepatic or renal disease as causes of ascites in cats85 fig 1
 the abdomen besides being greatly enlarged is often doughy feeling and painless on palpation and a fluid wave is easily induced on percussion upon opening the abdomen is found to contain up to a liter of a yellow-tinged slight to moderately cloudy mucinous fluid fig 2
 dyspnea can be a feature of cats with pleural involvement and thoracic effusions table 1 clinical signs due to ocular and cns involvement are seen in less than 9 of cat with the wet form of fip table 1there are several uncommon features of effusive fip that warrant mention intact males frequently develop scrotal enlargement due to extension of the peritonitis to the tunics surrounding the testes and edema fig 1 a syndrome of hepatic lipidosis and extreme skin fragility has been described in one cat with wet fip86 in-utero fipv infections have been observed in kittens born to queens that developed effusive fip during pregnancy pneumonia pleuritis and hepatitis were the principal lesions in affected kittens87 many cats with fip have a generalized synovitis due to immune complexing or the migration of infected macrophagemonocytes into the synovium a cat with fip may present therefore with signs of fever and lameness this can be mistaken for another type of infection or an immune-mediated polyarthritis however the more classic signs of fip usually develop soon after making the cause of the lameness apparentas the name dry fip implies thoracic and abdominal effusions are either absent or too scant to be detected other than at necropsy involvement of the eyes andor cns predominates in 60 of the cats with dry fip table 2
 signs referable to abdominal involvement are seen in 40 of animals either with or without ocular and cns disease table 2 the abdominal lesions of dry fip are much larger fewer in number and less widespread than the lesions of wet fip lesions of dry fip tend to extend downward from the serosal or pleural surfaces into underlying parenchyma hence the alternative name parenchymatous fip abdominal lesions are frequently found in the kidneys fig 3
 and mesenteric lymph nodes fig 4 fig 5
 and somewhat less frequently in the liver and hepatic lymph nodes fig 5 involvement of the wall of the caecum and colon with associated caeco-colic lymphadenopathy is a specific form of dry fip fig 6
 associated with signs typical of an ulcerative colitis ie soft blood and mucus laden stools88 89 abdominal lesions are often evident on palpation and sometimes associated with local pain about 10 of cats with dry fip will have thoracic involvement but chest lesions are usually localized and only one part of a more systemic infection small granulomas may involve the pleura and underlying lung parenchyma fig 7
 involvement of the pericardium has been described and can lead to fluid distention of the pericardial sac cardiac tamponade and heart failure90
cns involvement is frequent in cats with dry fip table 2 over one-half of cats with inflammatory disease of the cns have fip as well as one sixth of the total number of cats showing cns signs from any cause91 fip is also the most common disease of the spinal cord in cats less than 2 years of age and is one of the three leading causes along with lymphosarcoma and vertebral neoplasia of spinal disease among cats of all ages75 most cats with cns fip are less than 2 years of age and often originate from large multiple cat households92
cns involvement in cats with dry fip is varied in its clinical expression depending on what other organs are involved table 2 its exact localization in the nervous system and severity signs referable to spinal cord involvement such as posterior paresis incoordination hyperesthesia seizures and palsy of the brachial trigeminal facial and sciatic nerves have all been reported15 75 93 94 95 96 97 98 hydrocephalus secondary to disease of the choroid and ependyma has also been documented92 99 100 101 and can lead to dementia personality changes aggression rage hidingwithdrawal etc or convulsive disorders cerebellarvestibular signs such as nystagmus head tilt or circling have also been caused by fipocular involvement like cns disease is much more likely to occur in cats with dry than wet fip table 1 table 2 uveitis and chorioretinitis are the predominant ocular manifestations of dry fip96 102 103 104 105 106 fig 8 fig 9
 fip is also the most frequent cause of uveitischorioretinitis in cats with less common causes being felv-associated lymphosarcoma trauma toxoplasmosis and lens-induced uveitis107 108 ocular disease in dry fip occurs solely or in association with lesions in the cns or peritoneal cavity table 2 a change in the coloration of the iris is a frequent early sign of ocular fip fig 8 keratic precipitates on the caudal aspect of the cornea are characteristic of fip and are due to accumulations of fibrin macrophages and other inflammatory cells fig 9 focal lesions akin to the granulomas of parenchymatous organs may be apparent in the iris and distort the shape of the pupil fig 8 fig 9there are several uncommon but interesting manifestations of dry fip granulomatous involvement of the peripheral tissues resulted in priapism in a castrated cat109 chronic fibrinous and necrotizing orchitis may cause the scrotum and testicles to appear enlarged110 111 and scrotal enlargement may be one of the primary presenting complaints miscellaneous sites for lesions in non-effusive fip include the nasal passages tongue and distal small intestine syringomyelia has been caused by involvement of the fourth ventricle in one cat112 cutaneous lesions of a granulomatous type have been reported in a feline immunodeficiency virus fiv infected cat with fip the lesions were thought to be due to a coronavirus induced vascultis113 toxic epidermal necrolysis has also been observed in a cat with dry fip nc pedersen uc davis unpublished observation 2008 non-puritic slightly raised intradermal papules over the neck and chest walls were observed in the terminal stages of a cat that had non-effusive progressing to effusive fip114 the fipv was identified in skin lesions by immunohistochemistrythe lesions of dry fip have also been mistaken for cancer in particular lymphoma94 115 one felv negative cat with fip subsequently developed a myeloproliferative disease116 monoclonal gammopathies have been observed in four cats with fip117 and a fifth cat with fip was observed to convert from a polyclonal- to monoclonal-gammopathy hurvitz 1982 as quoted in pedersen 1987119
fip has many interesting interactions with other infectious agents these agents may affect immunity to fipv such as felv infecton alternatively fipv may induce an immunosuppression that encourages opportunistic type pathogens concurrent felv infection was seen in one-third to one-half of all fip cases that were tested in the 1970s and 1980s15 120 infection with felv seems to have a specific interfering effect on the ongoing immunity to fipv cats that failed to develop fip after experimental infection developed fip within 616 weeks after becoming felv viremic indicating that many fip recovered cats maintain residual infections119 mimicking the situation in the field fip also appears after natural exposure to both viruses119 121 with the virtual elimination of felv from pet cat populations in westernized countries this relationship has become much less common affected kittens with subclinical or clinical fip are more susceptible to upper respiratory infections caused by mycoplasma chlamydophila or herpesvirus indicating that their resistance is not normal it is also known that cats with advanced fiv infection are more susceptible to fip when exposed to fecv28 systemic toxoplasmosis a relatively rare clinical infection of cats has been described in two cats with fip one report was from 1966122 and a second report from 1995123 the occurrence of systemic toxoplasmosis in these two cats was probably associated with reactivation of encysted organisms left from a much earlier self-limiting infection fip is frequently associated with a lymphopenia which is a non-specific finding indicative of immunosuppression we have also noticed an increase in bacterial infections in cats with fip some manifested as terminal sepsis or more chronic local infections of internal organs nc pedersen and p pesavento uc davis unpublished observations 2008 one young cat had a chronic bacterial infection of the reproductive tract that was manifested early as a purulent vaginal discharge and terminally as a suppurative infection of the ovary and fallopian tube while a second cat had a secondary bacterial pneumonia the stresses of pregnancy and parturition surgical procedures such as spaying neutering and declawing have also increased the incidence of fip in young cats suggesting that stresses occurring at a time when the young cats are fighting an fipv infection may tip the balance against the host15
the fipv enters target macrophagemonocytes by first binding to the cell surface and than being internalized by a clathrin and caveolae independent and dynamin dependent endocytosis124 dewerchin and coworkers125 added upon these findings and suggested that viral antigen-antibody complexes in fip were not internalized through any of the previously described pathways the internalization process was independent from phosphatases and tyrosine kinases but did depend on serinethreonine kinases once internalized viral antigen-antibody complexes pass through the early endosomes and accumulate in the late endosomes the complexes left the late endosomes within 3060 min but were not degraded in the lysosomesbinding involves specific attachment sites on the spike protein and corresponding cell-surface receptors the cellular receptor appears to be aminopeptidase-n which was first identified as the receptor for tge coronavirus of swine126 aminopeptidase-n is a cell-surface metalloprotease on intestinal lung and kidney epithelial cells however this interaction may be host species specific because non-permissive cell lines genetically engineered to express porcine aminopeptidase-n become permissive to transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev but not to feline and canine coronaviruses126 the species specificity of the aminopeptidase-n receptor has also been shown by testing intraspecies chimers of the protein127 determinants on aminopeptidase-n responsible for binding of porcine feline and canine aminopeptidase-n to their respective host coronaviruses are found on its c-terminus128 hohdatsu et al129 noted differences in receptors for serotype i and ii fipvs using the blocking effect of specific mouse monoclonal antibodies their findings suggested that feline aminopeptidase-n is a receptor for type i fipv but not necessarily type ii fipv interestingly although neither porcine nor human aminopeptidase-n will act as a receptor for fipv a chimer of both is able to act as a receptor for fipv130 all of these findings suggest that subtle differences in certain regions of aminopeptidase-n can radically change species and even serotype tropismsthe acquisition of macrophage tropism appears to be an essential step in the evolutiontransformation of an fecv to an fipv and from a largely non-pathogenic and localized enterocyte pathogen to a highly virulent and systemic monocytemacrophage pathogen the relationship between virulence and macrophagemonocyte tropism has been firmly established in the literature attachment and internalization of fipv by monocytes by endocytosis has been compared for two fipv strains fipv-79-1146 being internalized much more efficiently than fipv-black131 strains of fipv such as wsu-79-1146 are more macrophage tropic than tissue culture-adapted and non-virulent strains such as wsu-79-1683 the former virus is assumed to be a prototypic fipv while the latter is assumed to be the prototype of an fecv40 however the assignment of these isolates as prototypic may have been premature both are serotype ii viruses unlike most field strains of fecvs and fipvs both are tissue culture-adapted to non-macrophage cell lines and fipv-wsu-79-1146 unlike a number of serotype i fipvs is exceptionally virulent by every common route of infection table 3
 the same doubts apply to wsu-79-1683 as a prototypic fecv it lacks most of the 7b gene which is present in non-tissue culture-adapted strains of fecv132 and all other attempts to adapt additional field strains of fecv to tissue culture have so far failed we have also noted that wsu-79-1683 has a deleterious mutation in its 3c gene indicating that it may have originated from an fipv nc pedersen uc davis personal observation 2008 however wsu-79-1683 does behave as an enteric biotype when compared to fipv-wsu-79-1146 in its dependence on cathepsin b and cathepsin l activity and low ph for entry into host cells133 it also causes an inapparent to mild enteritis when infected into laboratory kittens targets appropriate tissues and does not cause fip40 nevertheless without more bonified tissue culture-adapted fecv strains grown on appropriate host cells comparisons of macrophage versus enterocyte tropisms of fecvs and fipvs in vitro using these two fcov biotypes should be interpreted with some caution studies with fecvs have been undertaken in nature but they have dealt more with systemic spread than intestinal tropism for instance fecvs may be detected in the blood during the course of natural infection43 but at much lower levels than seen with fipvs134 therefore the affinity of the enteric biotype for the intestinal epithelium fig 10
 and the fip biotype for macrophages may be more quantitative than qualitativethe genetic basis for differences in macrophage tropism between fecvs and fipvs is not fully understood it would be logical to assume that the differences are due to characteristic functional mutations in the 3c gene however some research suggests that the acquisition of macrophage tropism by fipvs is determined by mutations in the spike protein42 unfortunately this study also compared wsu-79-1683 and wsu-79-1146 which do not appear to be typical for either of their respective biotypes mutant viruses of the fipv phenotype have been detected in as high as 20 of primary fecv infections28 indicating that macrophage tropic mutants occur with great frequency however only a fraction of mutants may actually produce a progressive disease28 52 these abortive infections are thought to be associated with a strong and rapid cellular immune response and are probably contained within the mesenteric lymph nodes in the unfortunate cats mutant viruses are allowed to proliferate unchecked within macrophages and are carried by these cells to specific sites in the body135 many of these tissues and organs appear to be fed by the cranial mesenteric artery and are rich in phagocytic cells targets are the mesenteric lymph nodes serosal surfaces of the gut and to a lesser extent the pleura and the omentum some virus also appears to reach the meninges especially on the posterior-ventral surfaces of the brain the ependyma surrounding the ventricles the dura mater of the spinal cord and the uveal tract and retina of the eyesthe issue of whether different variants of fipv can exist in the same cat was raised by battilani et al136 who analyzed quasispecies composition and phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses in cats with naturally acquired fip using single-strand conformational polymorphisms in the nucleocapsid and 7b genes they found a high degree of heterogeneity especially in the nucleocapsid gene which correlated directly with the seriousness of the clinical disease sequences also varied according to geographical origin the existence of quasispecies in cats with fip has recently been confirmed in the authors laboratory two of four sibling cats that died of fip were found to have two distinct variants in their tissues and two or more variants in their feces at the same time nc pedersen and h-w liu uc davis personal observation 2008 a recent published immunohistochemical study on brain lesions from 15 cats with the dry form of fip used two different monoclonal antibodies directed against unrelated epitopes of ccv to search for variants137 these authors also used a myeloid-histiocytic marker mac387 to identify infected macrophages double immunostaining demonstrated macrophages that were positive for either the ccv-monoclonal antibody alone or for both the ccv- and fipv-monoclonal antibodies the conclusion was that there were two cohorts of phagocytes both containing virus with the ccv-epitope but differing by the presence or absence of the fipv epitope unfortunately the strength of reactivity of the two monoclonal antibodies differed and the authors did not consider that various macrophages contained different amounts of antigen giving the impression that there was differential staining given the origin of fipvs it is not surprising that a similar phenomenon was observed in cats infected naturally and experimentally with fecvs138 most cats shed fecv in feces throughout the experiment without disease signs sequences from the nucleocapsid and 7b genes were amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr from the cerebral cortex dura mater pancreas lungs third eyelid and the heart muscle in four cats viruses differed between organs in whether or not they expressed the 7b gene and in their nucleocapsid gene sequencesvirus replication in macrophages appears to be very slow during the first 2 weeks or so a dramatic increase in the levels of macrophage infiltration macrophage infection virus replication and viral spread occurs around 1021 days after primary infection in experimental infections coincidental with the appearance of virus specific antibodies139 140 recovery when it occurs probably takes place sometime during this initial quiescent period antibodies are virus neutralizing in vitro but appear to have a disease facilitating effect in vivo the failure of the antibody response to neutralize or prevent virus spread in vivo can be explained in at least two ways first antibody binding to virus may block aminopeptidase-n receptors and prevent virus-to-cell attachment but enhance virus uptake by macrophages through their complement binding fc receptors this antibody-mediated enhancement is specific for feline antibodies and feline macrophages and may involve antibodies to both virus spike and membrane proteins141 second viral antigens may not be arrayed on the surface of infected macrophages thus limiting virus spread to intimate cell-to-cell contact142
the hallmark of the antibody phase of the infection is a rapidly spreading serosalomental centered inflammation associated with expanding cycles of macrophage infection virus replication virus release from dying infected macrophages and yet more virus bound by yet more macrophages this reaction is centered on small venules and the result is a lesion called a pyogranuloma pyogranulomas form around small venules in target tissues and are surrounded by an influx of protein-rich edema fluid and a sprinkling of lymphocytes neutrophils and plasma cells this reaction has been likened to arthus-type hypersensitivity13 143 144 cytokines and other inflammatory mediators released by macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes undoubtedly add to the character and intensity of the lesionscomplement activation and vascular damage results in a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy dic145 which is not usually clinically appreciated cats by their nature are much less likely to develop overt hemorrhages when in dic but dic may contribute to the mucinous nature of the fip exudate the yellowish or bluish tinged fluid serum and urine which are often found in cats with fip are also due to microhemorrhage and red cell damage resulting from vasculitis complement and clotting factor activation and dic red blood cells that leak into the tissues or manage to make it to the spleen in a damaged state are destroyed by phagocytes an attempt is made to recycle hemoglobin by breaking it down to biliverdin and bilirubin the carrier proteins of both biliverdin and bilirubin are rapidly saturated in cats allowing them to build up to detectable levels in the exudate serum urine and tissuesthe occurrence of two forms of fip effusive wet non-parenchymatous and non-effusive dry parenchymatous has long been intriguing observations with experimentally and naturally infected cats show that dry fip is often preceded by a brief episode of wet fip the lesions of dry fip are therefore remnants of an initial surface orientated infection dry fip may also become effusive in the terminal stages of disease when the immune system collapses the dry form of fip is presumed to result from a state of partial protective immunity protective immunity to fipv is largely cell mediated and involves a change in the way infected macrophages respond to virus and vice versa if infected macrophages receive proper signals from the host they gain the capacity to destroy virus rather than to act as virus incubators and disseminators the host also comes to view infected macrophages as foreign and will attempt to destroy them as well if the cellular immunity develops early in the course of infection and has sufficient strength clinical signs of disease will not occur and virus replication will be checked some virus may persist in a subclinical or latent state most likely within macrophages in organs such as the mesenteric lymph nodes for months or even years if humoral immunity occurs but cellular immunity fails to develop the resulting disease is effusive or wet however an intermediate stage of immunity can also occur with strong humoral immunity and weak cellular immunity virus is contained to a much greater extent than in the effusive form of the disease but is not fully eliminated a tug of war between virus replication and virus destruction follows resulting in the non-effusive or dry form of fip this form of the disease is characterized by more classic granulomas unlike the pyogranuloma which is filled with virus laden macrophages and a few scattered neutrophils and lymphocytes the granuloma contains small foci of macrophages in the center many of which contain no or small amounts of viral antigen surrounded by broad bands of lymphocytes and plasma cells granulomatous lesions of dry fip are less common and much less widespread than pyogranulomas of wet fip and tend to extend down from the surfaces of organs into the underlying parenchyma this surface orientation of granulomas is consistent with their origin as pyogranulomas the organ distribution of the lesions of dry fip can also be explained by a state of partial or weak immunity during the initial stage of fipv infection virus reaches the brain and eyes via infected monocytes but immunity has difficulty penetrating these areas due to the blood-brain barrier if protective immunity is strong virus and virus-infected cells will be easily cleared from organs on both sides of the blood-brain barrier however if protective immunity is weak it will be more effective in handling virus and virus-infected cells in the core of the body than it will be in the eyes and brains therefore lesions in the brain and eye will be more likely to persist than lesions in the abdomen or other sites thus providing an explanation as to why ocular and cns lesions predominate in the dry form of fipthe diagnosis of fip should be relatively simple given its affinity for younger cats its strong tendency to involve catteries and shelters the typical physical and historical findings and numerous characteristic laboratory abnormalities nonetheless it somehow remains one of the most difficult of diagnoses for many veterinarians the truth is that veterinarians have little trouble in placing fip high or at the top of their diagnostic list but have great difficulty and even reluctance in confirming their diagnosis however it is not only the veterinarian that has difficulties but the owners as well are reluctant to give up without a definitive diagnosis it must be remembered that a diagnosis can be based on cumulative odds rather than a single simple definitive test result a young cat from a cattery or shelter with chronic uveitis andor neurologic signs high serum proteins hyperglobulinemia and hypoalbuminemia fluctuating antibiotic unresponsive fever leukocytosis with a lymphopenia and an anemia of chronic disease can have no other disease than dry fip based on odds alone likewise the same cat with similar history and laboratory findings but with a yellow-tinged mucinous inflammatory ascites instead of uveitis or neurologic signs is highly unlikely to have any other disease than wet fip results from a test that is incorrectly touted as being definitive or highly indicative of fip will only confuse the issue and induce doubt when the diagnosis should not have been in doubt ultimately fip must be diagnosed by applying a workable knowledge of the disease with sensible weighing of signalment history clinical signs clinicopathologic findings serology and ante- or post-mortem examination of affected tissues by histopathology and immunohistochemistryhemograms of cats with fip often demonstrate several abnormalities which tend to be similar regardless of the form of disease a low-grade to moderately non-responsive anemia with hypoalbuminemia is typical of chronic disease other common hematologic changes include a leukocytosis with an absolute lymphopenia and neutrophilia and hyperproteinaemia15 146 147 148 serum total protein elevations are associated with increased levels of globulin and decreased levels of albumin cats with virus positive lymph nodes at necropsy were purportedly more likely to have globulin elevations147
hypergammaglobulinemia is not directly related to fcov antibody titers146 suggesting that non-specific antibody globulins andor complement factors are important contributors to the globulin elevation an albumin globulin ratio 06 is considered diagnostic for an inflammatory process and most commonly fip149 the most consistent changes shown by serum protein electrophoresis were increases in 2- and -globulins15 146 148 haptoglobin makes up most of the increase in 2-globulins150
abdominal and pleural effusions of fip have characteristics that are as definitive as any other single test almost one-half of all effusions in cats are due to fip149 therefore the odds of fip are 5050 by the presence of an effusion alone if the effusion have the features of fip the odds are even greater if the cat is younger the odds are greater still if the cat is from a shelter or cattery the odds go up even more etc fip effusions are usually a light to dark yellow and occasionally green-tinged due to elevated levels of bilirubin or biliverdin respectively the fluid is mucinous in character and when a drop on a slide is touched with a needle tip and then pulled away a string will often form the fluid ranges from somewhat clear to cloudy and often contains visible fibrin tags the protein content of the effusions ranges from 39 to 98 mgl with the globulins comprising 5082 of the total148 cell counts can range from 1600 to 25000 per l macrophages non-toxic neutrophils and lymphocytes predominate fluid effusions particularly from the pleural cavity may be tinged with red cells effusions will often form partial clots when allowed to sit in an anticoagulant free tube the electrophoretic pattern of the effusions will be similar to that of the corresponding serum146 antibody titers higher than those of the corresponding serum have often been detected in the effusions146 but like comparative antibody titers in serum and cerebrospinal fluid csf92 151 the significance of this finding has not been determined a definitive diagnosis can be made by direct immunohistochemical examination of cells in the fluid for viral antigens146 152 immunofluorescence is several times more sensitive than immunoperoxidase real-time rt-pcr analysis of cells from fip effusions will demonstrate high levels of viral rnahyperbilirubinemia and less commonly hyperbiliverdinemia frequently without jaundice are common in cats with fip especially the effusive form in fact fip is the most common cause of an icteric serum or plasma in cats under 3 years of age the urine is also yellow-tinged due to a hyperbilirubinuria a greenish hue to the urine and serum is less common and due to high levels of biliverdin the increased level of bilirubin or biliverdin in the blood is usually not due to liver involvement per se but rather to microhemorrhage into tissues and extravascular destruction of red blood cells by phagocytic cells as part of the vasculitis and dic heme from destroyed red cells is then recycled as biliverdin and finally bilirubin cats are deficient in carrier systems to remove these hemoglobin breakdown products from the blood hence their tendency to accumulate in effusions lesions or serumaqueous humor and csf in cats with ocular or cns disease also show similar but more variable increases in proteins and leukocytes typical csf findings in cats with fip include a protein concentration of greater than 200 mgdl and a white cell count of over 100 cellsl consisting predominantly of neutrophils153 in contrast the csf of cats with other viral disease usually has a protein concentration of less than 100 mgdl and a total white cell count of less than 50 cellsl singh et al154 defined an inflammatory csf as having a total nucleated cell count greater than 5 cellsl or one in which the total count was normal but the differential count was abnormal gender degree of csf inflammation neuroanatomical location and systemic signs provided were not helpful in determining whether the inflammation was due to fip or other diseases such as cryptococcus lymphoma or trauma synovial fluid from cats with effusive fip is frequently inflammatory in charactermany serum antibody tests have been used for the diagnosis of fip including indirect immunoflourescent antibody ifa virus neutralization and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa155 156 157 some feel that elisa is the most sensitive procedure157 but this author feels that most antibody tests are equivalent if done properly the most common test is an ifa assay using tge virus37 or fipv156 infected swine or cat cells as a substrate titers are usually read in distinct multiples of serum dilutions 15 125 1100 1400 11600 16400  they were originally reported as being helpful in diagnosing cats that had fip or were suffering from other illnesses156 unfortunately coronavirus antibodies do not differentiate between cats infected with fecv and fipv and although very high titers 11600 are highly suggestive of fip and negative titers tend to rule out fip149 156 the overlap in titers between healthy coronavirus-exposed and diseased cats is so great that it has little definitive diagnostic value in individual animals58 68 146 148 titers appear to rise progressively in many cats as they go from a subclinical to clinical stage of disease119 however progressive monitoring of titers is rarely done and titers are usually measured when disease signs appear and titers levels have already plateaued moreover titers may also fall dramatically at the end especially in cats with fulminating effusive fipthe sensitivity and specificity of so-called fip serology has been repeatedly questioned hematology antibody titers and serum protein electrophoresis from 48 cats 34 effusive and 14 non-effusive forms affected with fip were studied and compared with those of 20 healthy cats148 in the effusive form antibody titers and protein electrophoresis in the effusions were analyzed seropositive animals antibody titer  1100 were present among both the fip infected 73 and healthy cats 70 sparkes et al148 also compared serologic data from 65 cats in which fip was considered as a differential diagnosis but ended up having another disease they found that the presence of multiple abnormalities compatible with fip increased the specificity ie decreased false positives but decreased the sensitivity of the diagnosis ie increased false negatives however there is no doubt that cats with very low or negative 125 fcov antibody titers are less likely to have fip while cats with very high titers 11600 are more likely given these limitations this author recommends that fip serologic tests only be used as an aid in ruling in or out the possibility of fip the diagnosis of fip should never be made on antibody titers alone a recommendation made by others72 158
there have been many attempts to improve the specificity and sensitivity of antibody based tests for fip one commercial test measures antibody titers to the 7b protein of fcov based on the presumption that a prototypic fecv wsu-79-1683 lacks a 7b protein while a prototypic fipv wsu-79-1146 has an intact 7b protein in theory cats with fip should have antibodies to the 7b protein while cats exposed to the common fecv would not have such antibodies unfortunately the lack of 7b protein in wsu-79-1683 is an artifact of that specific isolate and field strains of fecv have an intact 7b gene39 therefore the 7b antibody test is no more specific or sensitive than the indirect ifa test and this has been substantiated by published studies72 159
because of the vagaries of fip serology fip antibody testing should also not be used as a means to control or eliminate fip from catteries vast amounts of money are spent each year by cattery owners on fip testing in almost all cases the results are non-interpretable even by the veterinarians ordering the testing virtually all catteries having six to eight cats and an active breeding program will have fecv in their cattery and 5080 or more of their animals will have titers of 1100 or greater usually 12511600 cattery testing usually confirms what is already known that fecv is enzootic in the cattery antibody titers do not answer the critical questions 1 do any of the cats actually have fip 2 are any of the cats subclinically infected with fipv 3 will a particular cat develop fip in the future and 4 which cats are shedding fecv over- and mis-interpretation of various coronavirus antibody tests result in considerable mortality from senseless euthanasia of healthy cats and undue emotional and financial stressserology has also been applied to the diagnosis of the neurologic form of fip foley et al92 observed what they believed to be specific fcov antibody production within the cns they found that the most useful ante-mortem indicators of neurologic fip were positive igg anti-coronavirus antibody titer in the csf high serum total protein concentration and magnetic resonance imaging mri findings suggesting periventricular contrast enhancement ventricular dilatation and hydrocephalus the diagnostic value of positive anti-coronavirus antibody titers in csf was later questioned by boettcher et al151 they collected csf from four clinical groups 1 cats with fip involving the cns n
  10 2 cats with fip not involving the cns n
  13 3 cats with cns disorders caused by diseases other than fip n
  29 and 4 cats with diseases other than fip and not involving the cns n
  15 csf was evaluated for concentrations of erythrocytes leukocytes and total protein anti-coronavirus igg was measured in csf and serum by indirect ifa csf igg 13214096 was detected in 12 cats including six cats with neurologic manifestation of fip four cats with fip not involving the cns and two cats with brain tumors csf igg was detected only in cats with correspondingly high serum igg titers 14096116384 and significantly correlated with serum igg titers in another attempt to measure local cns antibody production in cats with fip steinberg et al160 used an albumin quotient and igg index to determine whether proteins in the csf were of blood or local origin neither the albumin quotient nor igg index identified a pattern consistent with intrathecal igg synthesis in cats with the cns form of fip the conclusion of these various studies is that coronavirus antibodies will enter the csf when they are at very high levels in the serum high serum titers are likely to be associated the dry form of fip15 most neurologic cases of fip are of the dry type table 2 therefore positive fcov antibody titers in the csf are likely to be associated with fiptests for the presence of fipv rna have been developed but suffer from many of the same weaknesses as serology some of the more popular pcr based tests are based on the lack of the 7b gene in the fecv prototype wsu-79-1683 and its presence in the fipv prototype wsu-79-1146 as mentioned above the lack of the 7b gene in this one isolate is an artifact probably of tissue culture adaptation therefore pcr tests based on genetic differences between wsu-79-1146 and wsu-79-1683 are invalid moreover pcr tests are notoriously susceptibility to laboratory contamination with the dna products of amplification many commercial laboratories do these procedures in an uncontrolled manner in an attempt to increase specificity and sensitivity a pcr was developed that would only detect forms of the viral rna that were present during it replication stage161 the rationale was that replicating forms of the viral rna would only be found in the blood of cats with fip the test was designed to amplify subgenomic mrna of the highly conserved m gene the test was applied to 424 healthy and 651 cats suspected of having fip almost one-half of the diseased cats were positive for the replicating form of fcov mrna in their peripheral blood cells whereas only 5 of healthy cats tested positive seventy-five of 81 cats 93 with post-mortem confirmed fip tested positive whereas 17 non-fip cases all tested negative such optimistic results were not found when the same test was applied to another group of cats in this study 26 blood samples were collected from 25 healthy cats and one cat with clinical signs suggestive of fip namely fever weight loss enlarged abdomen and ascites134 blood samples were then tested for replicating fcov messenger rna by the procedure of simons et al161 fourteen 54 of the cats were positive for fcov including the cat with clinical disease but a high rate of positivity was also observed among healthy cats suggesting that feline coronaviruses may be present in the blood samples from healthy cats as well as cats with clinical fip this suggestion has been confirmed for healthy cats by others43 138 these conflicting findings call into question the value of pcr for testing of blood however rt-pcr has accurately differentiated fip effusions from effusions of other causes158 the problem of laboratory contamination with pcr products can be virtually eliminated by using a technique called real-time pcr taqmansome clinicians and cattery owners will test for fcov in feces by pcr in an attempt to identify fecv carriers within groups of cats and eliminate shedders from the environment as a means to prevent fip losses the fecv is shed at high levels in the feces but the carrier rate is 4080 or higher in many multi-cat populations and shedding is intermittent and infections recurrent reviewed by pedersen et al 200825 pcr inhibitors have been described in feces so it is important to purify viral rna using certain methods162 such testing is expensive and only a few laboratories can do it reliably on a commercial basis however in the final analysis it is virtually impossible to maintain a group of cats free of the virus even if the infection can be eliminated without strict quarantine facilities and measures as well restricting the movement of cats and people between cat populations see treatment and preventionrivaltas test has touted for the diagnosis of wet fip158 a test tube is filled with distilled water and one drop of 98 acetic acid is added followed by a drop of the peritoneal or pleural effusion if the drop dissipates in the solution the test is negative and if the drop retains its shape the test is positive a negative rivaltas test is reportedly 97 accurate in ruling out fip while a positive test is 86 accurate in ruling in fip this author sees no improvement in diagnostic value of this test over routine gross microscopic and biochemical analysis of the fluid but it is a simple and cheap supportive testseveral indirect tests usually based on the levels of certain inflammatory proteins or byproducts acute phase reactants have been used to detect inflammatory conditions in cats and in particular fip reviewed by paltrinieri et al50 alpha-1-acid glycoprotein agp is an acute phase protein that increases in concentration in infectious and inflammatory conditions the serum and peritoneal fluid concentrations of agp has been found useful in the diagnosis of fip163 164 amyloid a and agp both increase a few hours after the inflammatory stimulus and remain elevated for as long as the inflammation persists and have been evaluated in cats serum agp levels have also been used to study fip in groups of cats165 serum agp concentrations were observed to fluctuate over time in clinically healthy cats from catteries with the highest prevalence of fip and significantly increased just before an outbreak of fip although increased levels of agp and other inflammatory proteins are particularly common in cats with fip164 they are not specific levels of agp are usually high in cats with fip and other inflammatory diseases moderate serum agp levels 152 mgml can discriminate cats with fip from other diseases that have a low pretest probability while high serum agp levels 153 mgml are not usually seen in cats with diseases other than fip164 166 however the specificity of increased agp levels has been questioned by others166 the potential value of raised levels of the acute phase reactants agp and haptoglobin in the diagnosis of fip was examined in cats with confirmed fip and in cats with other conditions levels of agp greater than 15 gl in serum plasma or effusion samples were found to be of value in distinguishing field cases of fip from cats with similar clinical signs and differentiated these two groups of cats more effectively than the albuminglobulin ratio the concentration of haptoglobin was higher in cats with fip than in the group of healthy cats but not sufficiently to be of diagnostic value serum samples from fiv-infected cats also had significantly elevated levels of agp and haptoglobin illustrating that raised levels of these inflammatory proteins are not pathognomonic for fip modifications of agp have also been tested to increase its specificity167 agp in humans is heavily glycosylated and undergoes several modifications of its glycan moiety during acute and chronic inflammatory processes using human test modifications feline agp had very little l-fucose residues on its surface and its branching degree was very low in normal and in several pathological conditions in contrast feline agp underwent several modifications during acute fip including decreased expression of both  26-linked and  23-linked sialic acid 76 and 44 respectively when compared to non-pathological feline agp the possible role of some acute phase inflammatory proteins and immunoglobulins in both the pathogenesis and diagnosis of fip was also reported by giordano et al168 serum protein electrophoresis and the concentration of haptoglobin hp serum amyloid a saa agp igg and igm were evaluated in healthy coronavirus-exposed cats and cats with fip the highest concentration of acute phase proteins was detected in affected cats confirming the role of these proteins in supporting a clinical diagnosis of fip interestingly healthy coronavirus-exposed cats also had increased acute phase proteins at the same time that members of the group developed fip appeared in the group however this increase persisted only in cats that developed fip it is apparent from these various studies that levels of agp as well as other inflammatory proteins change dramatically in fip but that none of these changes are definitive in their own rightmri has proven useful in confirming the presence of inflammatory neurologic disease indicated by csf analysis169 fourteen cats with inflammatory diseases affecting the cns were reviewed including eight cats with fip and two cats with toxoplasmosis abnormalities affecting the cns were observed in mr images in 1014 71 cats intracranial lesions appeared as slightly hypointense foci in t1-weighted images in two 14 cats as hyperintense foci in t2-weighted images in seven 50 cats and as hyperintense foci after intravenous administration of a gadolinium-based contrast medium in 10 71 cats in six cats with lesions in t1- andor t2-weighted images additional lesions were visible in t1-weighted images obtained after gadolinium-based contrast medium administration in three cats lesions were visible only after contrast medium administration the mri in this study did not detect all cases of cns inflammation in a population of cats with inflammatory csf however it did add information on the location of lesions which can be important in differentiating fip from other inflammatory conditions this substantiated the conclusions of an earlier mri study on cats with neurologic fip92 sixteen domestic cats with confirmed neurologic fip and eight control cats with non-neurologic fip were studied pre- and ante-mortem the mri imaging demonstrated periventricular contrast enhancement ventricular dilatation and hydrocephalus in cats with neurologic fipthe present gold standard for fip diagnosis is immunohistochemistry on effusions or lesions containing infected macrophages monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies that are highly fcov specific and that will react well with formalin fixed tissues have been used170 sections of lesions or cell pellets from ascetic or pleural fluids can be directly examined for virus using fluorescein or horseradish peroxidase polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies detection of coronavirus antigen in fip effusions is very specific but less sensitive than detection of viral antigens in characteristic fip parenchymal lesions hirschberger et al149 identified antigen in 3449 confirmed fip effusions whereas 50 effusions due to other causes were negative the specificity of immunohistochemistry is a factor of the poly- or monoclonal antibodies used and the characteristic localization of fipv antigen within macrophages146 170 the sensitivity of the test depends on having infected macrophages in the tissues or exudate cells on the slides for this reason random biopsy of liver or kidney of cats with fip often fail to yield fipv antigen by immunohistochemistry171 and the same would be true of real-time pcr sensitivity is five to 10 times greater with fluorescein than horseradish peroxidase staining but the latter has the advantage of using formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissues while the former requires frozen sections of tissues both can be used with equal ease on slides of cells harvested from effusions and acetone fixedvirus isolation in tissue culture has not been yet possible for fecvs and is difficult for most field strains of fipv serotype ii fipvs seem to grow better in tissue culture and will often grow on both crandell feline kidney crfk and fcwf-4 cells the latter cell line is of macrophage lineage13 and is the preferred cell line for the isolation of serotype i fipvs12 84 the cost and low yield of cell culture isolation prohibits its routine application to clinical diagnosisfollowing the introduction of tests for detection of felv infection one-third or more of cats with fip were found to have concomitant felv infections120 172 with elimination of felv from many catteries and pet cat households and the steady decline in the incidence of felv in the entire cat population the proportion of cats with fip and concurrent felv infections has greatly decreased at the present virtually all cases of fip in purebred cattery-bred cats are felv negative and felv infection is detected in 10 or less of domestic pet cats with fipthe principle lesion of effusive fip is the pyogranuloma3 135 173 and the infection has been characterized as a distinct form of vasculitis ie phlebitis174 the pyogranulomas of wet fip are particularly prevalent in the abdomen and can literally cover the serosal surfaces of abdominal organs fig 11
 they range from microscopic to several millimeters in size and can sometimes become confluent as a fibrinous sheet fig 12
 the pyogranulomas of effusive fip tend to follow the course of the cranial mesenteric artery and are therefore concentrated in the omentum and on serosal surfaces of the abdominal viscera table 1 the omentum is often thickened with edema inflammatory infiltrate and necrosis and retracted into a compact mass fig 12 lesions are less common in the thorax and are centered on the pleura and pericardium table 1pyogranulomas are made up of central aggregates of macrophages adjacent to small venules and surrounded by a rich inflammatory exudate containing mainly neutrophils and macrophages with a scattering of plasma cells and t-lymphocytes175 fig 13
 almost all macrophages within pyogranulomas of cats with wet fip contain viral antigen at a high concentration fig 14
 considerable amounts of fibrin and protein-rich fluid are also deposited within and around the lesions and necrosis is often evident135 though the pyogranulomatous process is usually surface oriented focal lesions of phlebitis and a mixed inflammatory-cell infiltrate may be seen deep in underlying muscle or organ parenchymathe lesions of dry fip have been also referred to as pyogranulomas but they more closely resemble classical granulomas in their outward appearance especially those in the abdomen fig 3 fig 4 fig 5 fig 6 lesions of dry fip typically contain foci of macrophages around vessels reminiscent of the lesions of effusive fip however these foci are surrounded by dense infiltrates of lymphocytes mainly b-cells and plasma cells that extend into surrounding tissues as seen in classical granulomas fig 15
 edema hyperemia necrosis fibrin deposition and protein exudation are not as pronounced as in the pyogranulomatous lesions of effusive fip175
abdominalpleural lesions of dry fip have been described as extraperitoneal6 but probably originated in the serosa or pleura and invaded along vessels into the underlying parenchyma granulomas especially in the abdomen can vary in size from microscopic to several centimeters in diameter and larger lesions can be mistaken outwardly for cancers such as lymphoma6 115 similar to the pyogranulomas of wet fip the granulomas of dry fip are also most apt to occur in the abdomen kidneys mesenteric lymph nodes liver caecumcolon and are uncommon in the chest cavity table 2 fig 3 fig 4 fig 5 fig 6 fig 7 lesions in the eyes and cns are much more frequently seen in cats with dry than wet fip and may occur in the absence or presence of abdominalthoracic lesions lesions within the brain spinal cord and eyes tend to be smaller than those found in the abdomen and are more similar in nature to the lesions of effusive fip cns lesions are centered in the meninges and ependyma and also extend down into the underlying brain spinal cord or spinal nerves lesions are particularly common in the posterior-ventral aspect of the brainocular lesions of fip have been well studied108 the most common morphologic feature is a lymphocytic and plasmacytic anterior uveal infiltrate which is either diffuse or nodular this is manifested grossly by swelling and discoloration of the iris with foci of granulomatous involvement sometimes observed keratic or mutton-fat precipitates are common on the back sides of the cornea fig 9 these precipitates are made up mainly of macrophages other inflammatory cells and fibrin that have exuded from the inflamed uveal tractlymphoid lesions are common in effusive and non-effusive fip splenic enlargement may be due to histiocytic and plasmacytic infltration of the red pulp hyperplasia of lymphoid elements in the white pulp necrotizing splenitis with fibrin deposition and polymorphonuclear cell infltrates more common in wet fip or by more organized pyogranulomatous reactions more common in dry fip gross lymph node enlargement is usually limited to thoracic and abdominal nodes with lesions resembling those described for the spleen kipar et al115 176 reported on lymphoid organ lesions in cats with fip and cats that had resisted experimental infection in cats with fip the precardial mediastinum including site of the thymus and mesenteric lymph node parenchyma were often affected by granulomatous-necrotizing processes in general lymphoid tissues showed t- and b-cell depletion often including massive to complete thymic involution or atrophy in some cases the number of apoptotic lymphocytes was increased in lymphoid follicles as well as in t-cell zones the number of macrophages was increased in the splenic red pulp in contrast the fipv-exposed cats without fip generally showed lymphoid hyperplasiafluorescent or immunoperoxidase antibody staining of tissue sections from cats with both forms of the disease shows fipv in the lesions139 175 in effusive fip a large amount of viral antigen is contained in phagocytic cells that make up a large part of the pyogranulomas fig 1412 135 175 177 less viral antigen is present in lesions of non-effusive fip fig 16
 and more in lesions of effusive fip fig 14175 lesions associated with necrosis mainly pyogranulomas therefore contain more virus than lesions without necrosis mainly granulomas175 some plasma cells within lesions are found to be producing coronavirus specific antibodies175 lesions especially pyogranulomas of effusive fip also demonstrate large amounts of bound complement and ig indicating their arthus-like nature fig 17 fig 18
experimental infection studies were initially concentrated on highly virulent strains of fipv such as 79-1146 -nor15 and -df2 are identical to 79-1146 studies with such strains give the impression that virtually all cats infected with fipv will develop disease and die table 3 however fipv-79-1146 is atypical not only in its virulence but because of its ease of growth in non-macrophage type cells such as crfk fibroblast cells and its ccv-like spike protein the most virulent serotype i isolates are fipv-ucd1 and fipv-tn406 but they are still less virulent than fipv-79-1146 interestingly outbreaks of fip with extremely high morbidity and mortality are very uncommon in nature suggesting that such highly virulent laboratory strains as fipv-79-1146 -ucd1 and -tn406 are atypical this is borne out by experimental infection studies with yet other isolates of fipv table 384 oral po infection is least likely to cause disease intratrachealintranasal itin infection is intermediate while intraperitoneal ip is the most efficientthe first experimental evidence of the relationship between fecvs and fipvs came from studies of enzootic fecv infection in a colony of conventional cats used for felv research119 121 the presence of an fcov among this colony of cats did not become evident until cats were horizontally exposed to felv by natural contact and began to die of fip119 121 the presence of two virtually indistinguishable coronaviruses among these cats one infecting the gut and causing little disease and another capable of causing fip was later reported by pedersen et al27 this study resulted in the isolation of fecv-ucd this relationship was given further credence by an inadvertent introduction of an fecv named fecv-rogers-morris or fecv-rm into a barrier contained research colonies of specific pathogen-free spf cats178 a few cases of fip over several years among hundreds of kittens was the first indication that the colony was infected the fecv  fipv mutation was further confirmed by infecting cats with long-term fiv infections and a cohort of non-fiv-infected siblings with fecv-rm28 it was hypothesized that an fiv immunocompromised host would replicate fecv at higher levels and lead to a greater chance of mutation and that the mutant virus would be more likely to manifest itself in an immune suppressed host the fecv-rm did replicate to higher levels in the fiv-infected cats and about 20 died of fip within 810 weeks no deaths from fip were seen in a cohort of non-fiv-infected siblings this study established that the fipv mutation is frequent during primary fecv infection and that the immune status of the cat is important in determining the clinical outcome of this mutationconclusive studies on age susceptibility have not been undertaken while most studies have used kittens or younger cats there is no direct evidence that kittens are more susceptible to infection there is however indirect evidence cats vaccinated before 16 weeks of age with an attenuated live fip vaccine were apparently more susceptible to challenge-exposure and less responsive to vaccination nc pedersen uc davis personal observation 2008 as deduced from christianson et al 179 and gerber et al180 sixteen weeks is also a time when the immune system of cats has reached a near-adult level of maturation to this and other infections181
tissue culture-adapted strains of fipv are often mixtures of viruses and the predominant virus may not be the most virulent variants may arise while in culture or may be present in the cat prior to culturing nc pedersen unpublished observation 2008 three fipv strains from japan kuk-h m91-266 and m91-267 were examined for biologic properties and virulence182 both large and small plaque forming viruses were identified in culture for each isolate non-plaque purified virus of each strain induced fip in 50 67 and 89 of cats respectively interestingly only 29 of kittens inoculated with the large plaques from one of these isolates kuk-h developed fip while 80 of cats inoculated with the small plaque form succumbed to fip the tn406 strain of fipv exists in a low and high passage form the low passage form is very virulent while the high passage form is non-virulent83 this same reversion to non-virulence occurred in a culture of fipv-ucd1183 the virulent form in vivo may also not be the predominant form in vitro for instance it is difficult to re-isolate fipv-ucd1 in a form that will grow in tissue culture even though the cats were inoculated with tissue culture-adapted virus nc pedersen uc davis personal observation 2008 we have also studied cats with naturally acquired fip that have had two genetic variants in their tissues at the same time nc pedersen uc davis personal observation 2008the incubation period and clinical outcome of fipv infection depends both on the strain of the virus and immunologic responsiveness of the host experimental studies using serotype i strains of fipv of low to moderate virulence best reflect what happens in nature tissue culture strains of this type include fipv-ucd1 and fipv-blacklow passage fipv-tn406 which are moderately virulent12 83 and strains such as fipv-ucd2 -ucd3 -ucd4 and -ucd8 that are even less virulent table 384 183 even though low virulence laboratory strains of fipv exist most experimental studies are with high virulence serotype i strains such as fipv-ucd1 or serotype ii strains such as fipv-79-1146 almost all cats inoculated with high virulence isolates regardless of route develop an initial fever spike at 2472 h followed by a second and prolonged fever starting 1021 days or longer after inoculation at the time antibody appears the subsequent disease course is almost always of the effusive type and animals are in a terminal stage within 13 weeks the sites of early replication of fipv were studied following oral inoculation of spf cats with the wellcome strain of fipv grown in cell cultures a moderately virulent serotype i virus184 viral antigen was first detected by immunofluorescence in the tonsils and small intestine within 24 h of inoculation and was later found in the caecum colon mesenteric lymph nodes and liver virus was recovered from the oropharynx and the feces from as early as the second day after inoculation and shedding continued until euthanasia however histological changes in the gut did not appear until relatively late in the course of infection histological changes appeared to correlate with the appearance of outward signs of disease which is often 2 weeks later than the appearance of virus in the feces and oropharynx185
the appearance of a sustained fever usually coincides with the appearance of detectable levels of fipv antibodies by the indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique135 139 177 which in nave cats is 1016 days after infection early studies with fipv strains such as fipv-ucd1 demonstrated a phenomenon of immune enhancement cats previously infected with an fecv a non-disease causing fipv or cats passively given fcov antibodies from healthy or fip-diseased cats developed a fever within 4872 h and rapidly died139 140 the fipv antigen in antibody primed cats was present in macrophages and large mononuclear cells in the tracheobronchial lymph nodes lungs and trachea on postchallenge-exposure day pcd 2 in the liver and spleen on pcd 3 in the kidneys and omentum on pcd 4 and subsequently in the nasal turbinates thoracic and abdominal lymph nodes thymus bone marrow parotid salivary gland eyes and brain135 177 initial antiviral immunofluorescence on pcd 2 coincided with the onset of viremia and vascular lesions systemic lesions characterized by perivascular necrotizing pyogranulomatous inflammation phlebitis and thrombosis fibrinous serositis and generalized lymphoid necrosis developed on pcd 3 and 4 coronavirus-like particles were observed by electron microscopy in the cytoplasmic vacuoles or the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of degenerating macrophages in inflammatory lesions the timing of viremia was delayed in kittens that were seronegative at the time of fipv infection antiviral immunofluorescence in tracheobronchial lymph nodes was first detected on pcd 5 and viremia occurred on pcd 6135 177 systemic necrotizing lesions comparable with those observed in seropositive kittens on pcd 3 or 4 did not occur in seronegative kittens until pcd 13 or 16 in both groups of kittens initial viral infection in regional lymphoreticular tissue was followed by viremia and infection of macrophages in reticuloendothelial organs liver spleen lymph nodes and perivascular locationsexperimental studies of fipv infection have been recently advanced by the development of molecular clones of the virus as in studies with other viruses infectious clones allow genes to be altered switched and deleted to study their effects on infectivity virulence and other disease propeties molecular clones have been constructed mainly by a process called reverse genetics and at least three cloned viruses presently exist186 187 some of these cloned fipvs such as one derived from the highly virulent fipv-79-1146 strain retain their virulence when inoculated into experimental cats186
it must be stated at the onset that no treatment has proven effective in curing cats of fip in spite of the claims cats that develop fip inevitably die of their disease in days weeks or months the reason for these numerous false claims is uncertain but spontaneous remissions may account for at least some reports and misdiagnosis for the remainder cats with ocular signs and no other systemic manifestations of fip have occasionally gone into remission with just symptomatic treatment cats with chronic fever enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes that were histologically compatible with fip and high coronavirus titers have gone into remission without treatment some cats without overt signs of fip have demonstrated fibrous lesions on the spleen and liver when necropsied for other reasons indicating a previous bout of fip small quiescent lesions in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes have also been found in otherwise healthy cats upon routine ovariohysterectomies therefore spontaneous remissions occur and at least some of these natural responses may have fortuitously coincided with various treatments cures were first reported with tylosin and prednisolone188 sparking a decade of tylosin use for treatment of fip however tylosin has no effect on fip interestingly a significant proportion of cats with fip are still treated with an antibiotic of one type or the other some cats have gone into remission after use of prednisolone and phenylalanine mustard or cyclophosphamide15 another cat was successfully treated with prednisolone and phenylalanine mustard116 no immunosuppressive drug regimen has withstood the test of timea number of other equally dubious non-specific treatments have been used for fip almost all with insufficient patient numbers inadequate documentation of infection or lack of essential placebo controls and double blinding189 the fipv is very sensitive to human  and  interferons in vitro190 feline interferon omega also will inhibit fipv in vitro and is commercially available in many countries191 feline interferon omega reportedly induced complete or partial remissions in two thirds of cats with fip192 however in a larger and double blinded study this treatment was found to be totally ineffective193 various immunosuppressants such as glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide have been used but these drugs may prolong life but do not alter the fatal outcome189 immunostimulants megadoses of vitamins and numerous nutriceuticals have also been advocated but found to be without merit pentoxyfiline a tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf- inhibitor194 has been used on cats with fip based on its benefit in treating some types of human and feline vasculitis195 the tnf- is upregulated in fip183 and fip is basically a vaculitis however this treatment has not proven beneficial on its own and has fallen from use we have treated one fip cat with feline ifn- and a tnf- inhibitor pentoxyfiline with no beneficial affecteffective vaccines have been as elusive as effective treatments pedersen196 hypothesized that the ideal fipv vaccine should contain a live virus that would persist in the body in a subclinical state inducing a state of premonition immunity however a successful vaccine against fip has not been developed even though most have been based on this hypothesis cats that survive infection with a progressively increasing dose of virus starting with sublethal levels appear to develop a type of immunity83 however this approach is not clinically applicable because as many cats die as become immune and immunity appears to be tenuous some cats that appear to have resisted disease have developed fip months or years later indicating the persistence of subclinical infections this finding was supported by a subsequent study by baldwin and scott197 they first immunized cats intratracheally with a sublethal dose of virulent fipv followed by a high dose of temperature attenuated virus cats demonstrated immunity to an aerosol challenge with highly virulent fipv but residual lesions were found upon necropsy examination suggesting that immunity was either partial or of the premoniton type early attempts to use an attenuated live fipv strain fipv-blackhigh passage to induce immunity failed to provide protection and even caused immune enhancement a similar finding was reported later for a virulence attenuated strain of fipv-ucd1183 the phenomenon of fipv vaccine induced enhancement has been recently reviewed and is a common theme in many vaccine approaches198
a temperature sensitive mutant of fipv-79-1146 administered intranasally was later developed and corporate studies showed a high degree of efficacy against challenge with highly virulent fipv-79-1146179 180 immunity was ascribed to a local iga response and systemic cellular response measured by fipv-induced lymphocyte proliferation this vaccine is given as two intranasal doses 3 or more weeks apart starting at 16 weeks or older presumably efficacy could not be shown for cats vaccinated andor challenge-exposed at a younger age this commercial vaccine was studied in the field in a large single building shelter housing a thousand or more cats199 200 five hundred fivfelv negative fcov antibody negative cats were divided into two groups prior to being put into this environment one-half got the intranasal live vaccine and one-half was sham vaccinated the cats were than followed for 16 months overall deaths in both groups were the same however two cats in the vaccinated group developed fip during the 16 months and eight non-vaccinated cats succumbed to the disease protection in this study was not convincing and the validity of using the vaccine only on coronavirus negative cats and measuring protection over a limited period of time were questioned201 hoskins et al202 vaccinated 20 spf cats intranasally at 16 and 19 weeks of age and added 20 non-vaccinated controls all 40 cats were then challenge-exposed orally at 23 weeks of age with fipv-df2 ie fipv-79-1146 one vaccinated and five non-vaccinated cats developed effusive fip and were euthanased however six of the remaining vaccinates and 12 of the remaining controls had histologic evidence of fip when necropsied 8 weeks later wolf 201 criticized this study for using a homologous challenge strain and for only following the cats for 8 weeks in a second field study the vaccine failed to prevent fip in cattery kittens immunized in the presence of pre-existing fecv antibodies203 the issues of serotype specificity ie the vaccine is against serotype ii while most field isolates are serotype i interference with maternal antibodies the need to withhold vaccination until at least 16 weeks and the relatively poor efficacy are serious limitations this vaccine is still marketed and is used by some veterinary practitioners it has proven safe over a long period of use and does not appear to enhance disease200 however its degree of effectiveness in the general cat population where the incidence of fip is very low and in catteries and multi-cat households where virtually all 16 week olds are already seropositive and therefore non-responsive is highly questionable serotype cross-reactivity is also an issue cross protection between closely related viruses such as tge virus or ccv and fipv either does not occur or is weak204 205 206 cross protection between various isolates of the same serotype may also vary207 cats infected with fipv-ucd2 neither became ill nor developed protective immunity against challenge-exposure with more virulent strains the fipv-ucd3 recovered cats tend to be immune to challenge with fipv-ucd1 while fipv-ucd4 recovered cats do not have good protective immunity to fipv-ucd1 these are all serotype i fipvsthere have been a number of different potential vaccines based on recombinant technology described in the literature since 1990 a genetically engineered vaccinia virus expressing the envelope protein of fipv has been tested208 it enhanced virulent fipv infection rather than protecting cats wasmoen et al209 developed a recombinant raccoon poxvirus that expressed the gene encoding the nucleocapsid protein of fipv and used it as a vaccine cats were parenterally or orally vaccinated twice 3 weeks apart and then infected orally with fecv to sensitize them to virulent fipv three weeks later the cats were orally challenged with fipv 45 80 of the non-vaccinated controls succumbed to fip while 05 cats vaccinated subcutaneously with the raccoon recombinant poxvirus developed fip one of the five cats in this latter group died following a second fipv challenge suggesting immunity was of the premonition type vaccination induced serum antibody responses to fipv nucleocapsid protein but they were not neutralizing this suggested that the protective immune response involved a mechanism other than neutralizing antibodies to the spike glycoprotein or that fecv boosting was important for immunity the subsequent fate of this vaccine approach is unknown in another study the spike gene of fecv-79-1683 was cloned into vaccinia virus and used as an expression vector vaccine210 vaccinated cats developed neutralizing antibodies but kittens vaccinated with the recombinant vaccinia virus died earlier than animals vaccinated with native vaccinia virus alone a plasmid vaccine containing the membrane m and nucleocapsid n genes failed to protect kittens against a challenge infection with fipv211 while a vaccinia virus expressing the m protein of fipv failed to protect cats against fipv-79-1146212 a vaccine made up of a cell lysate of recombinant baculovirus-expressed fipv-ku-2 nucleocapsid protein protected 68 vaccinates versus 18 of cats immunized with a control antigen213 haijema et al214 reported successful vaccination of cats against a homologous virus challenge of cats with a live fipv that has been attenuated by deletion of the 3ac and to lesser extent 7ab gene clusters no follow-up research has been reported on these latter two vaccine approachesantiviral drug therapy has become increasingly important in a number of viral diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus and human influenza virus ribavarin which is strongly inhibitory of fipv in vitro215 is not effective in vivo216 this dichotomy between in vitro and in vivo inhibition is mirrored by recent experience with the human severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cornavirus217 sixteen different compounds were subsequently tested for their ability to inhibit fcov replication in vitro six of the compounds were found to reduce the virus titers by 0401 to 0833 log10 p
  005 using cytopathic effect as the endpoint218 the 50 effective dose ed50 levels for these six compounds was pyrazofuin  6-azauridine  3-deazaguanosine  hygromycin b  fusidic acid  dipyridamole respectively compounds that had no statistically significant effect on fipv in the same assay were caffeic acid carbodine 3-deazauridine 5-fluoroorotic acid 5-fluorouracil dglucosamine indomethacin d-penicillamine rhodamine and taurine no subsequent in vivo studies were reported on the compounds that were inhibitory in vitro the more recent appearance of sars in humans has greatly increased interest and knowledge of other potential anti-coronaviral drugs a wide variety of pyridine n-oxide derivatives have been found to be inhibitory against fcov fipv strain and human sars-cov frankfurt strain-1 in crfk and simian kidney vero cell cultures respectively219 the most selective compounds were active at a high microgram per liter range and non-toxic at 50100 mgl one of the most active and selective compounds tested was shown to inhibit fcov replication at the transcriptional level balzarini et al220 also demonstrated inhibition of fip and human sars coronaviruses by semisynthetic derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics including vancomycin eremomycin teicoplanin ristocetin a and da-40926 the 50 effective concentrations ec50 for the most active derivatives were in the lower micromolar range the ec50 values differed between fipv and sars-cov indicating considerable differences in species specificity no in vivo studies on any of these fcov inhibitory compounds have been reported to date indomethacin has recently been found to have a potent inhibitory effect on replication of both sars coronavirus and ccv but no studies were done on feline coronaviruses by this group221 however an earlier study found indomethacin to be ineffective against fipv218
the incidence of fip within catteries can be decreased by proper management222 mortality tends to increase as the population of animals especially kittens increases the effect of overcrowding on fip incidence has been particularly evident in animal shelters the losses caused by fip inevitably increase when shelters are overwhelmed with cats usually during kitten season and decrease when overcrowding is controlled longer shelter stays compound the situation k hurley uc davis unpublished information 2008 losses from fip are also proportional to the severity of other kittenhood diseases including those caused by herpesvirus calicivirus chlamydophila mycoplasma dermatophytes and numerous other bacterial viral fungal protozoal and parasitic skin upper respiratory and enteric infections kittens kept in crowded catteries or shelters with a large number of other young animals suffer greatly from concurrent diseases these diseases stress the kittens immune system and cause a decrease in growth rate and an increase in susceptibility to disease in general felv infection a bane of many catteries shelters and other multi-cat environments in the past was once the single most powerful potentiator of fip in cats fortunately felv infection has been pushed back into nature in most westernized countries by an aggressive campaign of testing eradicationisolation of shedders and vaccination and is no longer a problem in most multi-cat environments26 genetics also play an important role in fip genetic resistancesusceptibility factors also affect fip incidence and obviously have their strongest influence in catteries death losses from fip can sometimes be traced to certain breedings and further breeding of pairs that produced affected kittens should be avoided toms that produce litters that suffer from fip should be especially avoided because a given male affects far more litters and individuals than a queen52 breeding practices in catteries often result in an abundance of younger breeding animals the incidence of fip in a static multi-cat household is known to decrease over 3 years44 this may be associated with age resistance to chronic or intermittent fecv shedding an immunity of sorts develops over a period of many months or years25 age resistance over this period of time is seen with several chronic type infections such as herpesvirus feline calicivirus felv and ringworm this is why catteries or shelters that keep mainly older cats have much less infectious disease problems than catteries with younger breeding or sheltered animalsthe practice of isolating queens and early weaning of kittens has been advocated for the control of fip in catteries79 260 and is widely practiced cattery kittens are not infected with fecv until around 910 weeks of age25 if queens are isolated just prior to parturition kept in strict quarantine from other sources of fecv exposure removed from their kittens at the earliest possible time 46 weeks after birth and kittens maintained thereafter in isolation it is possible to prevent kittens from becoming infected with fecv and hence prevent fip however this practice works best on small catteries and requires very elaborate quarantine facilities and strict control of exposure gross and microscopic litter dust contains high levels of virus such litter dust is omnipresent and easily spread through the air caging pans accessories and on clothing therefore strict quarantine involves separate quarters and care givers separate litter food and water pans separate air space and change-inchange-out protective clothing including shoesshoe coversboots foot baths etc isolation facilities cannot consist of just another room in a home with no other special precautions if specifically designed isolation rooms are not available an alternative would be to transfer kittens at early weaning to distant facilities or homes devoid of other cats the problems with the isolation of pregnant queens and early weaning program are several fold first the level of quarantine required to prevent contamination requires expensive facilities and great costs to operate them second what should be done with coronavirus free kittens once they are produced infection with coronavirus is almost assured once these kittens are reintroduced into the normal environment and expected to carry out normal activities such as relocation to new homes showing and breeding however there remains one advantage of a successful isolation and early weaning program and that is to delay infection until after the kittens are 16 weeks of age or older this is a time when the immune system began to attain adult levels of activity and when kittens become more resistant to clinical disease of all sorts including fipcatteries that undertake isolation and early weaning programs should determine whether it is working given their facilities and level of husbandry if kittens coming out an early weaning program are found to be seropositive at 16 weeks of age andor shedding fecv from their feces the program has failed given costs and logistical problems this author does not highly recommend isolation and early weaning programs especially for larger catteries over six breeding cats the most cost-effective means to control fip losses are fivefold 1 eliminate overcrowding and if possible maintain no more than six breeding animals 2 maintain a larger proportion of older cats 3 years of age and older 3 manage feces to mouth spread by properly managing litter boxes litter replacement and gross and microscopic spread of litter and litter dust 4 be highly selective in the breeding program and produce a minimum number of litters and 5 control genetics by not using any tom at a minimum that has produced kittens that have developed fip or preferably use neither toms nor queens that have produced kittens that died from fip these steps are far more effective than improperly conducted isolation and early weaning programs and can be easily implementedimmunity to fipv infection is a fascinating topic for two reasons first it appears that humoral immunity is not important in protection but may actually participate in the disease process second protective immunity appears to be largely cell mediated and may be of an infection or premonition type third the type and strength of immunity appears to determine the form that fipv infection will take it is reasonable to assume that strong humoral immunity with very weak or non-existent cellular immunity will lead to effusive fip humoral immunity with intermediate cellular immunity will manifest as non-effusive fip and humoral immunity with strong cellular immunity will prevent the disease although these are mainly working hypotheses there is considerable evidence for eachantibodies to fipv antigens participate in two different immune processes neither of which correlates with immunity the first process is an arthus-type hypersensitity reaction centered on small venules while the second process is an antibody-mediated enhancement of viral uptake and replication by macrophages all three components of an arthus-type reaction antigen complement and antibody are present at high levels within lesions especially in those cats with the effusive fip fig 14 fig 17 fig 18 arthus reactions are characterized by vasculitis edema inflammatory-cell migration and necrosis antibody-mediated enhancement of disease was first described by pedersen and boyle139 and confirmed by weiss and scott140 they noted that the appearance of antibodies and disease signs were always linked seronegative nave cats developed the earliest signs of fip within 1016 days or more after experimental infection and the timing of disease always coincided with appearance of antibodies healthy fcov antibody positive ie fecv exposed cats were then challenge-exposed with fipv fever and disease signs occurred within 2472 h instead of the usual 1021 days or more if coronavirus seronegative cats were then passively immunized with fecv induced antibodies in the form of serum or immunoglobulin they also manifested accelerated disease when challenge-exposed with fipv the phenomenon of antibody-mediated enhancement was later confirmed to involve antibodies to specific epitopes on the spike protein these antibodies also functioned as neutralizing antibodies in vitro223 224 macrophage infection was greatly enhanced in vitro by the addition of immune serum225 226 this led to a plausible theory in which antibody and complement coated viral particles were taken up through fc receptors on macrophages by a process of endocytosis224 this placed the fipv in its host cell of choice and from then on the virus is spread to other places of the body by macrophage migration antibody-mediated enhancement of macrophage infection appears to be serotype specific ie antibody to serotype ii fipvs only enhance macrophage infection with serotype ii fipvs226
the antibody-mediated immunopathogenesis in effusive fip and the role of macrophages in disease appears similar to that described for the dengue hemorrhagic shock syndrome227 228 229 230 231 232 the hallmark of dengue hemorrhagic fever and effusive fip is an arthus-type reaction viral laden macrophages viral particles and viral proteins accumulate around small venules these localized sources of antigen as well as antigens in the blood can react with complement to form immune complexes in turn immune complexes deposit around small venules and trigger the release of specific macrophage factors that cause tissue damage13 135 139 143 144 177 225 paltrinieri et al146 also demonstrated that fip lesions contained many virus-infected macrophages and that extracellular viral antigens were also detectable in the foci along with necrosis necrosis is one hallmark of arthus-type vasculitisalthough a great deal has been made of antibody-mediated enhancement in fip it may not be as important in nature as in the laboratory44 furthermore the phenomenon has been described mainly between certain fcov isolates such as fipv-ucd1 and fecv-ucd139 fipv-ucd1 and unknown fecv strains140 and fipv-ucd8 and fecv-rm183 we have not observed this phenomenon with other field strains of fipv and fecv-rm nc pedersen uc davis personal observation 2008 in general it appears that the more virulent the fipv isolate the more likely it is to respond to antibody enhancementantibodies to the spike protein may also not always be harmful western blot antibody responses against the three major structural proteins have been measured in cats naturally infected with fecv and compared to disease outcome ie recovery chronic asymptomatic carrier state or fip233 the cats with chronic asymptomatic infections developed a spike glycoprotein relative to anti-m glycoprotein antibody response that was at least 30-fold higher than cats with chronic asymptomatic or symptomatic infections it was concluded that antibodies to the spike protein favored clearance of the virus after natural infection and were not a risk factor for the establishment of a chronic infectionalthough many studies support the special role of antibodies in fip and in the form it takes there are relatively few mechanistic studies on actual b-cell responses in fip takano et al234 demonstrated five factors associated with b-cell activation in fip they found that the ratio of peripheral blood sig cd21 b-cells was higher in cats with fip than in spf cats that the albumin-to-globulin ratio has negative correlation with the ratio of peripheral blood sig cd21 b-cell that cells strongly expressing mrna of the plasma cell master gene b-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 blimp-1 were increased in peripheral blood in cats with fip that mrna expression of b-cell differentiationsurvival factors il-6 cd40 ligand and b-cell-activating factor belonging to the tnf family baff were enhanced in macrophages in cats with fip and that mrnas of these b-cell differentiationsurvival factors were over-expressed in antibody-dependent enhancement ade-induced macrophages in this scenario virus-infected macrophages overproduce b-cell differentiationsurvival factors which in turn act to promote b-cell differentiation into plasma cells this same group235 also investigated key steps in ade in fip such as involvement of the virus receptor and the requirement for acidification of the endosome for cellular invasion they concluded that aminiopeptidatse n was not required for antibody enhancement however acidification of the endosome was necessary for cellular invasion by fipv regardless of the presence or absence of antibodiesif humoral immunity does not protect cats against virulent strains of fipv what then is the nature of fipv immunity it has been postulated that immunity to fipv is largely cell mediated83 reasons for this assumption include the following 1 the non-effusive form of fip resembles tuberculosis and deep mycotic infections of humans and animals and immunity to these infections is known to involve mainly cellular mechanisms 2 the lesions of dry fip resemble type iv hypersensitivity reactions with central macrophages containing relatively small amounts of virus and surrounded by dense infiltrates of plasma cells and cd4 lymphocytes236 while the pyogranulomas of wet fip are aggregates of macrophages stuffed with virus and surrounded mainly by neutrophils and edema 3 the clinical incidence of fip can be increased greatly by concurrent felv infection119 121 172 237 and felv infection is a potent suppressant of cellular immunity and t-cell mediated humoral immunity237 4 immunity to fip cannot be transferred passively with hyperimmune serum regardless of whether the serum is taken from fecv-infected cats or cats that survived an fipv challenge83 139 5 a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to fip antigens can be evoked in the conjunctiva of fip immune cats and peripheral blood lymphocytes of recovered cats respond in vitro to fipv antigen119 and 6 cats are known to carry fipv as a latent or sequestered infection and this infection can be reactived by infecting such carriers with felv but not with methylprednisolone acetate119 a carrier state of the latter type is known to exist in infections like tuberculosis blastomycosis histoplasmosis and coccidoidomycosis and immunity is sustained in these situations by the persistence of small numbers of organisms in mesenteric or bronchial lymph nodes this type of immunity called premonition or infection immunity persists only as long as intracellular pathogens persist in a reactivatable form119 this same phenomenon may have been observed with cats immunized with a virulence modified live fipv197 immunized cats showed no outward signs of disease when challenge-exposed with virulent fipv over 4 months later but residual lesions of fip were found histologically stoddart et al185 studied virus shedding and immune responses in eight spf cats inoculated orally or intraperitoneally with cell culture-adapted fipv virus was recovered from both feces and oropharyngeal swabs for approximately 2 weeks after inoculation and before clinical signs of disease developed all eight cats showed a profound suppression in their peripheral blood lymphocyte blastogenic responses to con a which recovered to pre-inoculation levels in only two of the cats one of which survived both con a reactive cats also had lymphocyte blastogenic responses to fipv antigen on the 21st day after infection with the greatest response being in the survivor cats dying of fip after 1618 days developed no response to fipv antigen antibody titers measured by immunofluorescence and by virus neutralization rose rapidly to very high levels in all cats regardless of the route of inoculation this study also supported the role of cell mediated immunity rather than antibodies in fipdegroot-mijnes et al238 put forward a unified concept of t-cell responses in fip they postulated that virus-induced t-cell depletion and the antiviral t-cell response are opposing forces and that the efficacy of early t-cell responses critically determines the outcome of the infection if the virus wins out fip will result while if the host wins out no disease will develop they observed a consistent rise in the levels of viral rna in the blood of cats with end-stage fip indicating fatal disease is directly related to a loss of immune control and unchecked viral replication paltrinieri et al239 analyzed lymphocte subsets cd5 cd4 cd8 cd21 markers by flow cytometry cats that were recently infected with fecv that did not develop fip had a transient increase in t-cells the fecv-infected cats with a high prevalence of fip had a moderate and persistent decrease in t-cell subsets while cats with fip had severe decreases in all lymphocyte subsets of course it can be argued in a chicken or egg manner that it is the level of viremia that determines the outcomethere are additional studies that support a role for cellular immunity possibly of the premonition type in fip resistance and susceptibility it is possible to immunize cats against fipv by starting with small subinfectious doses of virus and gradually increasing the dose over time83 cats immunized in this manner can eventually resist infection with dosages of virus that would be lethal to nave cats however this immunity can be overcome with time and by very large amounts of virulent virus moreover one cat immunized in this manner and repeatedly immune to over 1000 cat infectious doses of virulent fipv over 3 or more years eventually succumbed to non-effusive fip nc pedersen uc davis personal observation 2008 the author also observed a naturally infected cat that responded to non-specific treatment and went into a sustained remission only to re-develop fip 2 years later and die premonition immunity may also be passed from fipv immune queens to their kittens119 kittens born to such queens frequently showed a typical antibody pattern of both maternal immunoglobulin transfer and maternal infection maternal antibodies to fcov were noted in kittens blood shortly after birth and declined over the next several weeks and than spontaneously increased the first peak of antibodies corresponded to the acquisition and loss of maternal antibodies while the second peak resulted from an active immune response by the kittens five of six kittens that were challenged with fipv at 810 weeks of age resisted fipv-ucd1 challenge-exposure while 35 of these surviving kittens succumbed to an accelerated form of effusive fip when infected at 22 weeks of age119 fip was reactivated by a secondary felv infection in almost all cats within the first 2 months after resisting disease from a primary fipv infection but not after 46 months119 this situation resembles that seen in latent felv infections240 latency in felv infection is merely an extension of the recovery process and usually resolves within 6 months of the disappearance of viremia this appears to be characteristic of many infectious diseases in which cellular immunity is important for recovery the longer the period after recovery the more difficult it is to demonstrate persistence of the agent immunity to many infections including fip must be a slow ongoing process that takes weeks months or years in some individuals the agent may persist for a lifetimeseveral studies of fip have attempted to link the occurrence of disease to certain th1 profiles of cytokine expression kiss et al183 in a small pilot type study suggested that cats that developed either wet or dry fip after experimental infection expressed high levels of mrna for tnf- and low levels of mrna for interferon gamma while cats that resisted disease had the opposite response the negative role of tnf- in fip was supported by studies that linked tnf- released from macrophages to apoptosis of cd4 and cd8  t-cells and the resultant lymphopenia241 the tnf- may also upregulate the feline aminopeptidase-n receptor in feline macrophages242 making them more susceptible to infection a similar type study on wet fip measured the cellular expression of interferon gamma by various types of lesional inflammatory cells243 cells within lesions included b-cells and plasma cells as well as cd4 and cd8  t-cells however the macrophage seemed to be the key cellular element in both wet and dry forms of fip interferon-gamma expression was upregulated within macrophages in the inflammatory lesions suggesting a local activation dean et al244 attempted to correlate histologic changes in lymphoid tissues such as lymphoid hyperplasia lymphoid depletion histiocytosis and granuloma formation with cytokine expression viral rna was found in 76 of mediastinal lymph nodes spleen and mesenteric lymph node as compared to 27 of popliteal lymph node cervical lymph node and femoral bone marrow all tissues positive for virus replication also demonstrated lymphoid depletion affected tissues had lower levels of il-4 and il-12-p40 mrna and higher levels of il-10 mrna but no differences in ifn- or tnf- mrna the tnf- protein expression was greater in affected tissues and associated with a shift in the source of tnf- from macrophages to lymphocytes therefore fipv replication lymphocyte depletion in tissues and alterations in cytokine transcription and translation were co-localized to the same tissues a possible role for tnf- in the previously described fipv-induced lymphocyte apoptosis was also suggested cytokine responses have been compared between cats with neurological focal or generalized fip on the rationale that localized neurologic disease is more homogeneous ie stereotypic than generalized fip245 il-1 il-6 il-12 il-18 tnf- macrophage inhibitory protein mip-1 and rantes showed no up-regulation in the brains of control cats moderate up-regulation cats with neurologic fip and high up-regulation in cats with generalized fip ifn- gene transcription was upregulated in cats with generalized fip and slightly down-regulated in cats with neurologic fip variance was high in cats with generalized fip and much lower in cats with neurologic fip a large component of the variance 917 was accounted for by il-6 mip-1 and rantes levelsin another cytokine study a group of 8-week-old kittens were pre-immunized with two recombinant fipv spike proteins and then challenged intranasally with fipv-79-1146246 all of the kittens developed confirmed fip the recombinant proteins induced little or no specific antibody response prior to challenge and failed to enhance or inhibit the course of disease compared to controls mitogen stimulated pbmcs collected after 1 week showed small increases in the expression of il-6 and interferon-gamma mrna which correlated with an initial febrile response thereafter the expression of il-6 mrna remained unaltered until signs of fip developed at this point mrna levels of il-2 il-4 il-10 il-12 and interferon gamma were markedly depressedkipar et al51 compared cytokine mrna levels in various lymphoid tissues of cats with exposure to fecv with or without developing fip they noted that lymphoid tissues were normal or hyperplastic in healthy fecv exposed cats but that both b- and t-cell depletion was present in cats that developed fip therefore they compared functional changes in bone marrow and mesenteric lymph nodes in healthy fecv exposed cats and cats that developed fip the fecv-infected cats that did not develop fip exhibited significantly higher il-10 levels in the spleen and significantly lower levels of il-6 g- and m-csf in mesenteric lymph nodes in contrast il-12-p40 levels were significantly lower in lymphatic tissues in cats with fip compared to fecv-infected cats without fip cats with fip had significantly higher il-1 levels and lower tnf- levels in mesenteric lymph nodes and lower m-csf levels in the spleen they concluded that fecv exposed cats that do not develop fip are able to make protective immunity and avoid excessive macrophage activation and fip possibly by up-regulation of il-10 the development of fip may also be associated with a lack of il-12 production which inhibits an effective cellular immune response and allows for monocytemacrophage activation rapid activation of the p38 mapk pathway has been demonstrated in fipv infected blood mononuclear cells from spf cats247 the mapk activation led to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-1 the tnf- production was inhibited by pyridinyl imidazole inhibitorsrecent studies also measured the concentration of interferon gamma in fecv exposed cats that developed fip49 they found that healthy fecv exposed cats living in catteries with a high incidence of fip had the highest serum interferon-gamma concentrations however serum concentrations of interferon gamma were not significantly different in cats that developed fip than in healthy fecv exposed cats in catteries with a low prevalence of fip the concentration of interferon gamma was significantly higher in the effusions than in the serum of cats with fip probably due to interferon-gamma production within lesions a similar study measured cytokine mrna248 when compared with spf cats cytokine production was upregulated in non-symptomatic fecv exposed cats in catteries with no fip the appearance fip in the cattery was associated with an increased expression of cytokines in particular there was an increased production of il-1 and interferon gamma suggesting that these cytokines helped protect against fip this hypothesis was supported by the low levels of interferon gamma recorded in blood from cats with fip the most compelling corroborative evidence for the role of interferon gamma in protection against fip in cats comes from interferon-gamma gene knockout mice kyuwa et al65 66 described granulomatous peritonitis and pleuritis virtually identical to that of fip in knockout mice infected with a laboratory strain of mouse hepatitis virus a murine coronavirus an identical disease was observed in this same strain of knockout mice that were naturally exposed to a field strain of murine coronavirus64
both genetic52 and host28 factors appear to have a strong influence on resistance of susceptibility to fipv in nature studies of fip in a number of purebred persian catteries showed that susceptibility is heritable and accounts for about 50 of the disease incidence52 addie et al48 attempted to link disease susceptibility to certain alleles within the drb gene of the feline mhc feline leucocyte antigen or fla individual cats were shown to have between two and six fla-drb alleles but no specific allele appeared to be associated with either the development of fip resistance to fcov in general or to fecv carrier status however this was only a pilot study and lacked the numbers of cats or breadth of study to conclude that genetic differences within the fla complex are not involved in fip kipar et al249 reported that cats that developed fip after natural fcov exposure had a significantly higher rate of viral replication or a reduced capacity for virus clearance than cats that were exposed but did not develop fip suggesting a host factorthe felv is a potent potentiator of fip thirty-five cases of fip were observed among 500 conventional non-spf except for felv cats that had been experimentally infected with felv by natural contact or experimental infection119 121 deaths due to fip occurred within a relatively short time after they became felv viremic and only one cat in a similar cohort of non-felv exposed cats died of fip antibody titers to fipv began to raise progressively after the cats became viremic for felv and reached high levels prior to death from fip119
fipv is a naturally occurring infection of domestic and wild felidae people are not hosts for the virus dogs and swine can be experimentally infected with fipv one of the first commercial ccv vaccines for dogs may have actually consisted of fipv hundreds of dogs died of severe neurologic and pancreatic disease before it was recalled250 a mild to moderately severe tge-like syndrome occurs in baby pigs251 however it is doubtful that fipv is a cause of naturally occurring disease in these speciesthe comparison of feline coronaviruses in particular fipv and the human sars coronavirus is noteworthy the coronavirus found in palm civet cats a mustelidae and not a felidae has over 99 homology to the human sars coronavirus and is apparently well adapted to its host species252 however this virus was able to geneticially adapt to humans252 with effects that were potentially devastating a coronavirus with 92 or more homology to the sars coronavirus exists in the horseshoe bat 252 253 suggesting that coronavirues have adapted species by species over relatively short to long periods of time this ability to mutate through recombination insertiondeletion mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms and change host species is reminiscent of the close relationships between canine porcine and feline coronaviruses7 14 18 19 20 21 22 23 the human sars coronavirus also has an interesting 29 nucleotide deletion in one of its accessory genes orf 8a that is not present in its host species254 damaging mutations within an accessory gene of fecv orf 3c are known to be associated with the fecv  fipv mutation in cats29 the participation of both host and virus factors are important for the development of sars in a rat model with increased virulence in old compared to young rats as in humans255 both host and virus factors are involved in fip in cats diseases closely resembling fip of cats and caused by species related coronaviruses have been described in both ferrets256 257 258 and mice64 65 66
coronaviruses are viruses belonging to the family of coronaviridae 1 they are large single-stranded rna viruses that often originate from bats and commonly infect mammals while the majority of coronavirus infections cause mild symptoms some can cause severe symptoms such as pneumonia respiratory failure and sepsis which may lead to death 2 3coronavirus zoonosis constitutes a serious health risk for humans indeed in recent history transmissions of three types of coronaviruses to humans have led to varying numbers of deaths the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic which is caused by the sars coronavirus sars-cov originated in guangdong china in 2002 and led to nearly 800 deaths 4 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov outbreak which emerged in saudi arabia in 2012 similarly caused about 800 deaths although with over 8000 cases nearly four times as many cases were reported 4 finally coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is currently causing a pandemic on 1 may 2020 the world health organization reported over 3 million confirmed cases and over 220000 patients to have succumbed to covid-19 around the world 5 however the factual number of deaths is probably considerably higher 6 in addition this figure is still soaring on 1 may 2020 at a rate exceeding 6400 deaths per day 5to infect target cells coronaviruses use their spike s glycoprotein to bind to receptor molecules on the host cell membrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 has been identified as the main sars-cov-2 entry receptor on human cells 7 8 while the serine protease tmprss2 or potentially cathepsin b and l are used for s-protein priming to facilitate host cell entry 7 sars-cov-2 s-protein has a 10 to 20-fold higher affinity to human ace2 than sars-cov s-protein 9 moreover ace2 expression proportionally increases the susceptibility to s protein-mediated coronavirus infection 1012 hence increased expression of ace2 is thought to increase susceptibility to covid-19 1315epithelial cells of the respiratory tract including the lung are thought to be primary sars-cov-2 target cells 1618 these cells can sense viral infection via pattern recognition receptors prrs prrs including toll-like receptors and nod-like receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps 19 upon prr activation a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are produced and released in order to activate the hosts immune system interferons ifns in particular type i and type iii ifn are among the principal cytokines to recruit immune cells 19 20six types of leukocytes have been implicated in detecting and responding to viral infections in the lung a major site of sars-cov-2 infection which also presents with severe covid-19 symptoms the cytotoxic activities of cd8 t cells and nk cells can facilitate early control of viral infections by clearing infected cells and avoiding additional viral dissemination 21 22 dendritic cells specialize in sensing infections including by viruses and inducing an immune response 23 cd4 t cells contribute to viral clearance by promoting production of cytokines and interactions between cd8 t cells and dendritic cells 24 m1 macrophages interact with pulmonary epithelial cells to fight viral infections in the lung 25 finally neutrophils may contribute to clearance of viral infections through phagocytosis of virions and viral particles however their precise role is uncertain 26sars-cov-2 is considerably more efficient in infection replication and production of infectious virus particles in human lung tissue than sars-cov 17 strikingly despite this sars-cov-2 initially does not significantly induce type i ii or iii ifns or various other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in infected human lung cells and tissue 17 27 when this does occur it may in fact promote further sars-cov-2 infection as ifns directly upregulate expression of the sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 28 these observations suggest that the baseline levels of leukocytes which already reside in the lung prior to infection may be important in mounting a rapid immune response against sars-cov-2 infectionthe efficiency of s protein-mediated coronavirus infection increases with elevated host lung cell-specific ace2 expression levels suggesting that this is a predictor of increased susceptibility to covid-19 1015 in addition the levels of leukocytes residing in the lung prior to infection may be particularly important for eliciting a rapid sars-cov-2-specific immune response thus we investigated the relationship between ace2 expression and the levels of seven leukocyte types implicated in anti-viral immune response in human lung tissuefirst we used bulk rnaseq gene expression data from the 578 human lung tissues present in the genotype-tissue expression gtex database 29 30 using an established in silico flow cytometry pipeline 31 we estimated the levels of cd8 t cells resting and activated nk cells m1 macrophages dendritic cells cd4 t cells and neutrophils in these tissues fig s1ac next we compared these to ace2 expression levels in these lung tissues this revealed that ace2 expression is negatively correlated with the levels of cd8 t cells resting and activated nk cells and m1 macrophages p  8106 pearson correlations fig 1ad however there are no statistically significant correlations between ace2 expression and the levels of cd4 t cells dendritic cells and neutrophils p  005 fig 1eg thus the levels of a majority of leukocytes involved in anti-viral immune responses are significantly reduced in lung tissues with elevated ace2 expression levelsit is possible that some of above observations are linked to phenotypic characteristics such as sex age body mass index bmi race or smoking status to test the robustness of our findings we applied multivariable regression analysis that includes these five covariates table s1 as well as the levels of the seven above leukocyte types or states this showed that only 4 of the 12 variables significantly contribute to predicting ace2 expression levels specifically the levels of cd8 t cells resting nk cells activated nk cells and m1 macrophages table 1 notably none of the five added phenotypic covariates showed statistically significant contributions consistently we found limited statistically significant correlations between these variables and ace2 expression in univariate analyses irrespective of whether they were analyzed as continuous data or binned into discrete ordinal categories fig s2aj thus the levels of four types of leukocytes that respond to viral infection in lung tissue are reduced with elevated ace2 expression independently of phenotypic covariatesfinally we tested whether above observations could be validated in an independent cohort of individuals for this we used the to our knowledge largest publicly available lung tissue dataset the laval university university of british-columbia groningen university lug dataset includes microarray gene expression data of 1349 human lung tissues following determination of ace2 expression levels and estimation of the levels of cd8 t cells resting nk cells activated nk cells and m1 macrophages fig s1ac we found that three of the four also negatively correlated with ace2 expression in this independent dataset p  2108 fig 2ad with a correlation coefficient of r  0096 only m1 macrophages did not correlate with ace2 expression in this dataset fig 2dtaken together our observations indicate that three types of cytotoxic lymphocytes specifically cd8 t cells resting nk cells and activated nk cells are robustly and consistently reduced in lung tissue with elevated expression of the sars-cov-2 receptor ace2we investigated the baseline expression levels of the sars-cov-2 host cell entry receptor ace2 and the levels of seven types of leukocytes in 1927 human lung tissue samples although sars-cov-2 cellular tropism is broad 1618 we focused on lung tissue in addition to epithelial cells elsewhere in the respiratory tract alveolar epithelial cells are thought to be a primary sars-cov-2 entry point 16 28 consistently the sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 is expressed in these cells at the mrna and protein levels 28 3234 moreover in severely affected covid-19 patients the lungs are among the few organs that present with the most life-threatening symptoms cytokine storm-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome ards widespread alveolar damage pneumonia and progressive respiratory failure have been observed 35 36 these indications frequently require admission to intensive care units icus and mechanical ventilation and may ultimately be fatalearly after infection rapid activation of the innate immune system is of paramount importance for the clearance of virus infections infected cells typically do so through release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in particular type i and iii interferons 19 20 notably however several studies have highlighted multiple complexities related specifically to sars-cov2 and innate immune system activation at early stages first unlike sars-cov sars-cov-2-infected lung tissue initially fails to induce a range of immune cell-recruiting molecules including several interferons 17 27 suggesting that leukocytes are ineffectively recruited to infected lung shortly after infection second the host cell entry receptor ace2 has been identified as an interferon target gene 28 thus even when interferons are upregulated in order to recruit immune cells concomitant upregulation of ace2 expression may in fact exacerbate sars-cov-2 infection 28these findings suggest that the levels of immune cells that already reside in the lung prior to infection are more critical for dampening sars-cov-2 infection at early stages than they are for fighting infections of other viruses consistently cytotoxic lymphocytes are markedly reduced in both numbers and functionality in covid-19 patients 37 notably cytotoxic lymphocytes including cd8 t cells and nk cells are key early responders to virus infections and these are the cells whose baseline levels we here identify as significantly reduced in lung tissue with elevated ace2 expression therefore our results suggest that individuals with increased baseline susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection in the lungs may also be less well equipped from the outset to mount a rapid anti-viral cellular immune responseseveral observations indicate that these cytotoxic lymphocytes are critically important for effective control of sars-cov-2 infection recent studies showed that cd8 t cells in peripheral blood are considerably reduced and functionally exhausted in covid-19 patients in particular in elderly patients and in severely affected patients that require icu admission 3739 reduced cd8 t cell counts also predict poor covid-19 patient survival 38nk cells are the first immune cells to respond to viral infections they can recognize and eliminate virus-infected cells following cytokine stimulation or antibody-mediated activation 22 however they can also do so when infected cells express so-called induced-self ligands or viral antigens 22 40 this is probably exceedingly important during the initial stages of covid-19 pathogenesis as sars-cov-2-infected lung fails to significantly induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines early after infection 17 27 in line with this at later stages during covid-19 progression the total numbers of nk cells in peripheral blood are substantially lower compared to healthy individuals 37 moreover they are functionally exhausted 37we found that the five phenotypic parameters sex age bmi race and smoking history did not statistically significantly contribute to variation in ace2 expression in human lung tissue neither in univariate nor in multivariate analyses this is consistent with some studies but inconsistent with others 36 4143 these paradoxical observations may be partially explained by varying gender age and race distributions within each study cohortfurther research will be required to elucidate the precise mechanisms of sars-cov-2-induced activation of the innate immune system early after infection however the link that we identified between high baseline ace2 expression and reduced cytotoxic lymphocyte levels in human lung tissue prior sars-cov-2 infection is striking it suggests that increased susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection in the lungs may be accompanied by a poorer ability to mount a rapid innate immune response at early stages this may predict long-term outcome of individuals infected with covid-19 given that cd8 t cell and nk cell counts in peripheral blood are low in covid-19 patients 3739 finally it may contribute to the substantial variation in covid-19 clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic to severe respiratory and other symptomsgene expression data and corresponding phenotype data from human lung tissues n578 were obtained from the genotype-tissue expression gtex portal

 coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 caused by sarscov2 has become pandemic most covid19 patients show mild or moderate symptoms severe cases of covid19 might eventually develop acute respiratory distress syndrome septic shock multiple organ failure bleeding and coagulation dysfunction

 and is featured by pneumonia lymphopenia exhausted lymphocytes and elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines characterized as a cytokine storm

 therefore the host immune system is thought to have participated in the pathogenesis of covid19 the importance of innate and adaptive immunity in the defense against sarscov2 needs to be urgently determined
5
 to fulfill the pressing need we examined antibody generation and virus clearance in 26 patients with sarscov2induced covid19specimens from sputum stool and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected throughout the illness from 30 january 2020 to 5 april 2020 viral rna was extracted from clinical specimens and realtime reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction was performed to test the presence of sarscov2 using novel coronavirus 2019ncov nucleic acid detection kit shanghai biogerm medical biotechnology co ltd china the serum was collected at distinctive time points and sarscov2specific antibodies were detected using new coronavirus 2019ncov antibody detection kit innovita china this study was approved by the ethics commissions of jinan infectious disease hospital shandong chinaa total of 26 patients from 5 to 72 years old were determined to be sarscov2 rnapositive by sputum stool or nasopharyngeal swabs the clinical characteristics of the patients and chest computed tomography ct scans were also examined all of them are nonsevere covid19 patients table 1

specimens from patients 2 8 13 and 16 who had been confirmed to be immunoglobulin g iggpositive still tested positive for sarscov2 nucleic acid after an additional 35 days table 1 indicating that sarscov2 can coexist with its specific antibodies in the human body for an unexpectedly long time 3650 days according to the data collected from patient 2 igg can be produced at least as early as the 7th day post illness the average number of days for igg to be first detected in the four patients was 15 thus the early production of antibodies does not mean early elimination of this virus perhaps the specificity and titer of antibodies are more important to our knowledge to date this is the longest period 3650 days to observe the coexistence of sarscov2 with its specific igg antibodies in covid19 patients how this virus can circulate in the presence of specific igg antibodies for such a long time is an interesting question whether sarscov2 can act like hepatitis c virus that have developed strategies to subvert humoral immunity and persists in the body is worth further investigation

patient 26 a 5yearold female was sarscov2 nucleic acid testingpositive in a stool sample after 46 days of illness but became nucleic acid testingnegative in specimens of sputum stool and nasopharyngeal swabs on day 47 post illness table 1 no sarscov2specific igg and igm antibodies were detected in the patients serum until the last sample collection day which was the 66th day post illness although we did not collect data about virusspecific cellular immunity it is known that cellular immunity is generated concomitantly with humoral immunity so we could preliminarily exclude the potential role of cellular immunity in sarscov2 elimination in this case thus this is the first report to state that innate immunity plays an essential role in sarscov2 clearance which highlights the importance of innate immunity in sarscov2 clearance moreover innate immunity alone might be enough to clear the virus further studies are required to determine which factors or signaling pathways of innate immunity contribute to this process a broadly protective and universal vaccine for sarscov2 would take a long time to develop
7
 
8
 boosting innate immunity by drugs that mimic viral rna may contribute to sarscov2 clearance
9
 therefore vaccine combined with innate immune stimulators may be more effective for fast sarscov2 clearance we propose that the importance of innate immunity should be investigated further and that the titer and specificity of sarscov2specific antibodies are important and should be seriously considered in vaccine development this case may also indicate that some individuals may not generate specific igg or igm antibodies after infection with sarscov2 thus only testing sarscov2specific antibodies is not a good standard to determine infection but the combination with the nucleic acid testing method may improve the accuracy of sarscov2 detectionpatient 25 another 5yearold female was found to be iggpositive on the 10th day post illness and the patients turned sarscov2 nucleic acid testingnegative on the 23rd day post illness we also observed that a 9yearold female patient patient 12 produced igg antibodies on the 14th day post illness and this patient turned sarscov2 nucleic acid testingnegative on the 29th day post illness these two cases may reveal that children may not show any defects in antibody production and sarscov2 elimination compared with adultsthe disease severity and fatality were increased with age in covid19 patients which may be explained by the augmentation of proinflammatory responses and the reduction of antiviral cytokines in elder individuals

 in our study the younger patients clear sarscov2 faster thus whether the antiviral immunity such as type i interferon responses were maximized and proinflammatory responses were minimized in these patients is of great interest and the molecular mechanism involved in the process would be fundamental to our understanding of the immune systemtaken together we showed that sarscov2 could coexist with virusspecific igg antibodies in covid19 patients for an unexpectedly long time and without adaptive immunity innate immunity may still be powerful enough to eliminate sarscov2 the longterm coexistence of igg with sarscov2 in the human body raises the question of whether patients with antibodies are still at risk for reinfection which may make covid19 immunity passports unfeasible our followup studies may answer this question and would therefore be beneficial to vaccine developmentthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsxmj and phw conceptualized the study and analyzed the data cm contributed to reagent and manuscript preparation bw lw xk jg and dx performed the experiments phw wrote the first draft of the manuscript all the authors contributed to revision of the manuscript and read and approved the final version for publicationavian infectious bronchitis virus ibv causes an acute and highly contagious viral disease of chickens and leads to huge economic losses in poultry industry worldwide ibv is an enveloped rna virus and its virus particle morphology is spherical with a 80120 nm in diameter ibv contains four viral structural proteins membrane protein m spike protein s envelope protein e and nucleocapsid protein nthe m protein contains a short amino-terminal ectodomain with 2 glycosylation sites and is 2335 kda with varying degrees of glycosylation homotypic interactions among m proteins and interactions with the s protein and the other structural proteins are required for virus particle formation thus the m protein plays an important role in coronavirus assembly 1 2 3 4 ibv m protein is found in the cis-golgi network and cis-golgi complex when expressed alone 5 and cannot be released into the supernatant unless ibv e is present 6 in contrast studies of other coronaviruses suggested that the m protein was observed in the golgi area and plasma membranes of a variety of cells when expressed alone 7 and can form sedimentable particles and release from infected cells 8the s protein forms projections on the surface of the virion and generates two subunits s1 and s2 through posttranslational cleavage the s1 protein contains epitopes that can induce neutralization hemagglutination inhibition hi and serotype-specific antibodies 9 10 11 12 13 14 obviously the s protein is the main immunogenic protein and will be a target protein when designing new ibv vaccines the s protein is transported to the plasma membrane when expressed alone 15 incorporation of spikes into coronavirus particles is effected by interactions between the s protein and the m protein and governed by the carboxy-terminal domain of the s protein 16numerous vlps assemble in an in vitro expression system contain the major structural viral proteins and mimic the conformation and organization of authentic native viruses without the viral genome 17 for ibv vlps some researchers have reported that e proteins are sufficient for formation but the efficiency is extremely low 6 other researchers have described that interactions between the e and m proteins and the membrane bilayer probably played an important role in vlp formation and virus budding 18nowadays ibv is controlled using live attenuated and inactivated vaccines but ibv frequently outbreaks in endemic areas thus the development of new vaccines is urgent in the present study we assembled ibv vlps containing m and s proteins using a baculovirus expression system and we further evaluated the vlps immune responses in mice and chickens

  005 were considered statistically significantthe supernatant culture media and cell lysates from the recombinant baculovirus-infected sf9 cells were harvested and analyzed using western blot the results showed that m and s proteins could be expressed in the sf9 cells fig 2
 interestingly when m protein was expressed alone it could be detected in the sedimentable particles of the culture media a lane 2 but s protein could not be detected when it was expressed alone b lane 2 more importantly when s protein was expressed together with m protein s protein could be detected in the sedimentable particles of the culture media c lane 2 the expressions of m and s proteins were further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining analysis sf9 cells were first infected with rb-m rb-s or rb-s-m respectively and then stained with m- or s1-specific primary antibodies and fitc- or cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies the results showed that both m and s proteins were mainly expressed near the plasma membranes and m and s proteins were co-localized fig 3
the detection of s protein in the sedimentable particles when it was co-expressed with m protein strongly suggested that ibv vlps could be generated using m and s proteins only sf9 cells were infected with rb-s-m and supernatant culture media were harvested and then the sedimentable particles were subjected to sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation fractions were collected and analyzed by western blot data not shown the fraction collected from the interface between 30 and 40 showed the co-expression of m and s proteins where a distinct protein band of roughly 2335 kda corresponding to the m protein and a 170 kda band corresponding to the s protein fig 4a and b using em analysis we could see a spherical morphology particle with a diameter of about 100 nm fig 4cwe investigated the immunological characteristics of ibv vlps both in mice and chickens ibv-specific antibody in the sera of immunized mice was detected using indirect elisa the results indicated that 2 weeks after the primary vaccination day 14 serum igg titers could be detected in vlps and inactivated h120 groups and the titers continued to increase following the second and third immunizations days 28 and 42 fig 5
 the vlps and inactivated h120 groups had significantly higher igg titers p
  001 than the pbs group as for the vlps and h120 groups the vlps group after the first and second immunizations had lower igg titers than the inactivated h120 group and the vlps group after the third immunization had higher igg titers than the inactivated h120 group but they were not statistically different p
  005we further researched the immunogenicity of ibv vlps in chickens the results showed that 2 weeks after the primary vaccination day 14 both of vlps and inactivated h120 groups could not detected serum igg titers and the differences between these and pbs groups were not statistically significant p
  005 but following the second immunization day 28 the igg titers of the vlps and inactivated h120 groups increased fig 6
 and were significantly higher p
  001 than the pbs group the differences between vlps and inactivated h120 groups were not statistically significant p
  005 although the vlps group had a slightly lower igg titers after the second immunizationantisera from vaccinated mice and chickens were analyzed using a neutralization assay to detect functional antibodies with neutralization activity against the h120 virus the ibv-specific neutralization antibodies in mice were detected at 42 days after the primary immunization and in chickens the antibodies were detected at 28 days after the primary immunization the results showed that vlps and inactivated h120 groups had statistically significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers p
  001 than the pbs group fig 7
 the differences between vlps and inactivated h120 groups were not statistically significant p
  005 although the vlp group had a slightly higher neutralizing antibody titercellular immunoresponses were evaluated through detection of the number of cells secreting ifn-r and il-4 after h120 virosome stimulation of the single-cell suspension splenocytes from vaccinated mice using the elispot assay the results revealed that the levels of ifn-r and il-4 in mice which inoculated with vlps were significantly higher than in those which inoculated with inactivated h120 and pbs p

the molecules required for the formation of coronavirus vlps varied in different reports ho et al showed that m and e proteins were required for the assembly of human sars coronavirus-like particles in sf21 cells 22 but m e and n proteins were required for the formation of sars-cov vlp as demonstrated by siu et al in vero e6 cells 23 and nakauchi et al in 293t cells 24 liu et al found that influenza m1 protein and sars s protein could assemble chimeric sars-cov vlps in sf9 cell 25 for mouse hepatitis virus mhv-a59 vennema et al showed that transfection of ost7-1 cells with vaccinia virus encoding m and e proteins resulted in the vlp formation 26 these reports strongly suggested that m and e were the minimal molecules required for the coronavirus-like particles regardless of virus types and cell lines used in the studies in contrast our results showed for the first time that ibv m and s proteins were efficient assembled into vlps in sf9 cells with a single recombinant baculovirus encoding m and s proteins this might not be a complete surprise as for ibv corse and machamer reported that while the presence of e protein could enhance the release of m proteins in the sedimentable particles from the culture supernatants m protein alone was capable of being released in the sedimentable particles from the culture supernatants in ost7-1cells with a vaccinia-t7 polymerase expression system 18 particularly fig 6 in addition the native envelope trimeric s glycoprotein is not necessary for particle formation but is incorporated into vlps when present 22 and incorporation of spikes into coronavirus particles is mediated by the s proteins carboxy-terminal domain and effected by interactions between the s protein and the m protein 16 the showing of ibv vlps formed by m and s proteins demonstrated a simple strategy for production of coronavirus-like particles for coronavirusess protein is a main antigen for coronaviruses 9 12 in line with previous literatures our results showed that ibv vlps induced humoral antibody responses ie serum ibv-specific igg antibodies and ibv-specific neutralization antibodies in a level comparable to that of the inactivated ibv vaccines in mice and chickens and both ibv vlps and inactivated ibv vaccine induced significantly higher humoral antibody responses p
  001 for the cellular immune responses the ifn-r and il-4 were detected using the elispot assay the results revealed that ibv vlps elicited high levels of ifn-r and il-4 but the inactivated h120 vaccine only induced il-4 at a significantly lower level p
  001 the results demonstrated that ibv vlps could elicit both th1- and th2-type cellular immune responses but inactivated h120 only stimulated th2-type cellular immune response previous studies showed that vlps could elicit more effective antibody responses than proteins in their non-native forms 27 28 the reason for the results that the inactivated h120 vaccine used in this study had slightly lower neutralizing antibody titers and a significantly lower level of cellular immune responses than vlps might be that a portion of s molecules lost their native forms during inactivation with formalin our results demonstrated that the ibv vlps mimic the conformation and organization of authentic native viruses and their immunogenicities were reservedin summary we have successfully generated ibv vlps carrying m and s proteins and shown that the generated ibv vlps could effectively elicit humoral immune responses both in mice and chickens and more importantly ibv vlps could induce significantly higher cellular immune responses than inactivated ibv vaccine in mice as the results taken together demonstrated a simple strategy for generating coronavirus-like particles and provided a candidate vaccine against the infection of ibv for future developmentcoronaviruses a genus of the coronaviridae family are enveloped viruses with a large plus-strand ribonucleic acid rna genome 1 the genomic rna is 2732 kb in size capped and polyadenylated coronaviruses were identified in several non-human species including rats mice chickens cattle turkeys swine cats dogs rabbits and horses in these species coronavirus infection often causes devastating epizootics of respiratory or enteric diseases several coronaviruses such as hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 were identified since the mid-1960s prior to the sars-cov outbreak coronaviruses were only thought to cause mild self-limiting respiratory infections in humans commonly referred at as colds these viruses are endemic among the human populations causing 1530 of respiratory tract infections each year rarely these viruses can cause lower respiratory tract infections especially in neonates in the elderly and in individuals with underlying illnessessars-cov a novel coronavirus was identified in 2002 as the pathogenic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak that occurred in in the guangdong province of china 2 so far sars is the most severe human disease caused by a coronavirus recent evidence confirmed that the sars-cov virus originated from a mutation occurring in a non-human host probably bats gains the ability to affect humans luckily the transmission of sars-cov was relatively inefficient since its spread occurred only through direct contact with infected individuals with negligible infectivity during incubation state the outbreak was largely contained within households and healthcare settingsa novel human coronavirus named middle east respiratory syndrome-cov mers-cov emerged in the middle east in 2012 as the causative agent of a series of highly pathogenic respiratory tract infections in saudi arabia and other countries in the middle east 3 in the early stages of the outbreak a high mortality rate of 50  was reported but the outbreak did not accelerate through 2013 and by the end of 2014 it was largely controlled also for this virus a zoonotic origin is suspected since dromedary camels may be its natural hostsin early december 2019 several pneumonia cases of unknown origin were observed in wuhan china the pathogen was identified as a novel enveloped rna  coronavirus that was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 4 the virus showed phylogenetic similarities to both sars-cov and mers-cov viruses in view of its similarities to bat coronaviruses it was postulated that bats could have been the primary hosts of sars-cov-2 this hypothesis suggested that the infection originated via transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the huanan seafood wholesale market on january 30th 2020 the world health organization who declared coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern and on march 11th who director general referred to covid-19 as a pandemic as of may 5th 2020 the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 has exceeded 3 million worldwide with more than 250000 covid-19-related deaths the epidemic has put public health systems under severe strain both in western countries and in the developing world sars-cov-2 displays a more efficient transmission pattern when compared with sars-cov and mers-cov 5 retaining a high transmission rate also in the asymptomatic incubation period 6 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 syndrome varies remarkably going from asymptomatic forms to acute bilateral pneumonias requiring hospitalization common presenting symptoms include fever fatigue and dry cough while laboratory tests often show lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels chest computed tomographic scans show a typical pattern of bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity a significant percentage of cases requires admission to intensive-care-units icu due to acute respiratory distress syndrome that requires mechanical ventilation support a subgroup of patients with severe covid-19 can experience the so-called cytokine storm syndrome characterized by a fulminant and fatal hyper-cytokinemia associated with multi-organ failurethe term cytokine storm has become increasingly used not only by authors of scientific articles but also by popular media it is likely that the widespread use of this term is related with its rather immediate meaning which actually recalls the role of the immune system in producing an uncontrolled and generalized inflammatory response 7 it seems not casual that the term cytokine storm was first employed in describing the events modulating the onset of the graft-versus-host disease 8 a condition characterized by an impressively powerful activation of the immune system cytokine storms characterize a wide spectrum of infectious and non-infectious diseases and since 2005 it was associated to the avian h5n1 influenza virus infection 9 apart from the immediate significance of the term cytokine storm the biological and clinical consequences of this immune system hyperactivity are by far less known making it worthwhile to be briefly overviewedthere are several similarities in the clinical features between covid-19 and previously identified beta-coronavirus infections shared clinical findings include that most patients present with fever dry cough dyspnea and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest ct scans 10 however the physiopathology of the mechanisms through which sars-cov or mers-cov sustain high pathogenicity are yet to be completely unveiledsince the first reports on covid-19 disease it appeared clear that acute respiratory distress syndrome ards accounted for a significant number of deaths among infected patients and that ards should be regarded as the hallmark immune-mediated clinical consequence in sars-cov-2 similarly to what described for sars-cov and mers-cov infections11 acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is a devastating event with an estimated mortality of approximately 40 defined as the presence of bilateral lung infiltrates and severe hypoxemia ards can occur in a variety of clinical situations including pneumonia sepsis pancreatitis blood transfusion ards pathogenesis involves inflammatory injury to the alveolocapillary membrane which results in increased lung permeability and the exudation of protein-rich pulmonary edema fluid into the airspaces leading in the end to respiratory insufficiency 12as shown by previous data in the literature increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines eg interferon  interleukin il- 1b il-6 il-12 and chemokines cxcl10 and ccl2 are associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung involvement in sars patients similarly to what happens in mers-cov infection 13 as far as covid 19 infection is concerned huang et al recently reported that infected patients also show high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 4 the demonstration of increased levels of il-1b ifn cxcl10 and ccl2 strongly pointed toward an activation of t-helper-1 th1 cell function more importantly the so called cytokine storm emerged as a main factor driving a more severe clinical course this concept originated from the observation that covid-19 patients requiring icu admission displayed higher concentrations of cxcl10 ccl2 and tnf as compared to those in which the infection was less severe and did not require an icu admission to further complicate the issue it should be highlighted that in patients with sars-cov-2 infection at difference from sars-cov infection there is also an increased secretion th2-immune-oriented cytokines such as il-4 and il-10 whose main effect is to suppress inflammation14taken together these data clearly indicate that in sars-cov infection ards is the ultimate result of a cytokine storm in this scenario the release by immune effector cells of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn ifn il-1 il-6 il-12 il-18 il-33 tnf tgf and chemokines cxcl10 cxcl8 cxcl9 ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 precipitates and sustains the aberrant systemic inflammatory response 4131516 the cytokine storm is readily followed by the immune system attacking the body which in turn will cause ards and multiple organ failure the final result being death at least in the most severe cases of sars-cov-2 infection 11the cytokine storm and the consequent ards results from the effects of a combination of many immune-active molecules interferons interleukins chemokines colony-stimulating factors and tnf-alpha represent the main components involved in the development of the cytokine storm and will be briefly overviewed- interferons a family of cytokines with a central role in virus-directed innate immunity binds specific receptors and result in the expression of genes encoding protein with anti-viral or immunomodulatory properties this sequence of events supported the therapeutic use of ifns in some viral diseases such as chronic hepatitis but also in non-viral conditions including leukemia and lymphoma melanoma and multiple sclerosis 1718- tumor necrosis factor  tnf is a pyrogen cytokine released from immune cells in the acute phase of inflammation and infection it is a central cytokine in viral diseases and is associated with a number of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 19- colony-stimulating factors csf these proteins are associated with inflammatory conditions and are components of an amplification cascade which ultimately increases cytokine production by macrophages at sites of inflammation this effect perpetuates the inflammatory reaction 20- interleukins are a family of cytokines involved in immune cells differentiation and activation they mediate the traffic of immune cells to the site of the infection induce the increase of the acute phase signaling activate epithelial cells and mediate the production of secondary cytokines 21 among them interleukin-6 il-6 deserves a more extensive discussion in view of its involvement in the coronavirus-induced cytokine storm il-6 is crucially involved in acute inflammation due to its role in regulating the acute phase response 21 it is produced by almost all stromal cells and b lymphocytes t lymphocytes macrophages monocytes dendritic cells mast cells and other non-lymphocytic cells such as fibroblasts endothelial cells keratinocytes glomerular mesangial cells and tumor cells 22 the production of this cytokine is increased by il-1 and tumor necrosis factor tnf- 23 il-6 may also be responsible for the activation of t helper 17 th17 cells in the dendritic cell-t cell interaction 24 in covid-19 affected patients a high th17 cells activation could result from a virus-driven increased production of il-6 by the immune system il-6 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the cytokine storm owing to its pleiotropic properties several studies showed that the serum levels of il-6 are increased in covid-19 patients and that its circulating levels are positively related to disease severity 142526 for this reason high serum il-6 levels were suggested as predictors for disease severity 2728 indeed in animal models of sars-cov infection the inhibition of the transcription factor of il-6 and in turn of its production was associated with reduced mortality 29during the present covid-19 pandemic the use of tocilizumab as a therapeutic agent was proposed tocilizumab is a humanized anti-il-6 receptor igg1 monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases 14 by blocking the il-6-receptor interaction tocilizumab inhibits the il-6-mediated signal transduction although clinical data on the use of tocilizumab in covid-19 patients derive from small series some authors recommend its use in critically ill covid-19 patients with significantly elevated il-6 levels 14
-chemokines are a large family of cytokines characterized by a powerful chemotactic effect chemokinesact as chemo-attractants in the migration of the immune system cells but they are also involved in several other processes including the development and function of innate and adaptive immune system embryogenesis and cancer metastasis 3031 they are promptly secreted by a variety of cells in response to viral or microbial infections 32chemokines act as powerful chemoattractants which recruit inflammatory cells to migrate from the intravascular space across the endothelium and epithelium into the inflammation site according to a chemokine gradient33 the role of one specific chemokine cxcl10 previously referred to as interferon- inducible protein of 10 kda or ip-10 has been highlighted in ards in both experimental models and in patientsindeed in a mouse model of il-2 induced ards an up-regulation of the mouse cxcl10 analogue mob-1 mrna was observed at initiation of lung injury 34 several studies also showed that the intratracheal injection of mob-1 in mice induced pulmonary migration of leukocytes in the alveolar space with massive recruitment of neutrophils especially monocytes this event was rapidly followed by microvascular injury and pulmonary edema typical of ards 3536 cxcl10 signaling appears to be a critical factor for the onset of ards as shown in mice models of ards induced by either acid aspiration or by viral infection with influenza h5n1 virus briefly ichikawa et al demonstrated that wild-type mice developing ards had increased levels of cxcl10 mainly due to an increased secretion by infiltrating neutrophils which induced an autocrine loop mechanism on the chemotaxis of inflamed neutrophils leading to fulminant pulmonary inflammation on the contrary cxcl10 andor its receptor cxcr3 knock-out mice showed decreased lung injury severity and increased survival in response to both viral and non-viral lung injury 37 moreover cxcl10 expression in the lung was significantly up-regulated after induction of ards with lipopolysaccharide lps in a mouse model of lung injury and the neutralization of cxcl10 with anti-cxcl10 antibody lead to amelioration of lung injury38cxcl8 also referred at as il-8 is another chemokine considered as a potential prognostic bio-marker for ards clinical course 39 indeed cxcl8 levels were found to be elevated both in plasma 40 41 42 43 and in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid 44 45 46 of patients with ards a direct role of cxcl8 in the progression of ards was proven in rabbit with acid-induced ards lead to a 10-fold increase in cxcl8 levels in the alveolar fluids of note pre-treatment with an anti-cxcl8 antibody prevented the development of the typical acute lung injury47although chemokines are crucially involved in the regulation and maintenance of immune responses their role in the onset of the coronavirus-induced cytokine storm is still poorly investigatedbefore addressing the specific relationship between chemokines and coronavirus infections it is mandatory to briefly overview the general role of chemokines in viral infections and how viruses contrast the actions of chemokinesviruses are infectious agents of small size and simple composition that can multiply only in living cells of animals plants or bacteria all viruses contain a nucleic acid either -dna deoxyribonucleic acid or -rna ribonucleic acid and several proteins viruses should not even be considered organisms since they are not free-living ie they require a host cell thus viruses need to elude the host immune defense to infect its cells in order to reproduce and survive 54the chemokinechemokine receptor-related immune defenses are the main obstacles to be by-passed by viruses some chemokines play a direct anti-viral effect by inducing an array of phenomena that lead cells to determine an anti-viral state these phenomena include activation of apoptosis or direct killing of infected cells by activated immune cells chemokines also recruit immune cells to the site of infection which will fight against the intruder 55 viral infections are associated with enhanced expression of several chemokines in particular the interferons-inducible ones interferons which can be produced by any mammalian cell are involved in the rapid and efficient host innate response against viruses a powerful ifn response triggered by the first contact with a virus can slow down viral multiplication and buy time for the organism to establish a more efficient adaptive immune response 56 ifns can stimulate surrounding cells to express potent antiviral proteins including enzymes transcription factors cell surface glycoproteins cytokines and chemokines 5758 moreover they can inhibit cell proliferation regulate apoptosis and modulate the immune response 59 among interferons-induced molecules the chemokine cxcl10 is currently regarded as a main player in the organism anti-viral response 60 and particularly in respiratory tract infections several studies demonstrated that cxcl10 levels as evaluated in serum bronchial-alveolar washing fluid or nasal secretions consistently correlate with the severity and duration of acute respiratory tract infection due to viral infections 60 61 62also the chemokine cxcl8 is involved in inflammation and immune cell trafficking in the context of viral infections cxcl8 plays a major role in the initial control of respiratory tract infection due to its chemotactic activity for neutrophils and monocytes 63 cxcl8 levels in the nasal washing fluid correlate with symptoms severity during acute respiratory tract infections 64 although in the majority of cases a strong chemokine action can efficiently contrast viral infections some viruses acquire the capacity of escaping this surveillance system furthermore viruses can use the chemokine system network for their own favor by several strategies-some viruses mimic the components of the chemokine system by producing molecules that are very similar to chemokines and can interact with their receptor these molecules generate an incongruous signal leading to a disorganized immune response to viruses 65-inhibition of the interferon-induced anti-viral response several viruses do impair the intracellular receptors devoted to pathogen recognition such as toll like receptors and intracellular rna sensors 66
taken together the above data indicate that viruses can interfere with the chemokinechemokine-receptors system using their own properties to modify intracellular signaling with the final result to further disseminate the infectionsince the first reports of sars it seemed clear that the severe clinical manifestations of the disease could not be ascribed only to the viral activity per se but that an immune-mediated mechanism rather than a direct virus-induced damage would drive the clinical progression 67 indeed from the physio-pathology point of view the most interesting observation was the demonstration that viral titers seemed to paradoxically diminish during the most severe phase of the disease both in humans and in several animal models 1 data coming from patients series described during the 2003-2004 epidemics clearly suggested that complex alterations in the chemokine system were related to the outcome of sars-cov infection fig 1

in vivo studies showed that several circulating chemokines cxcl8 ccl2 and cxcl10 and inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 and il-12 were elevated in patients with sars-cov 6869 cxcl10 was also considered an excellent prognostic marker for sars disease progression 7071 in particular jiang et al showed that cxcl 10 serum levels were significantly increased during the early stage of sars and remained elevated until resolution moreover persistently elevated cxcl10 serum levels during follow-up were predictive of a worse outcome of the infection 71these findings prompted further in vitro studies aimed at investigating the relationship between sars and the chemokine system spiegel et al demonstrated that in addition to its direct effect on epithelial lung cells sars-cov could also enter macrophages and dendritic cells 72 this appeared crucial as viral entrance in these cells lead to an abortive infection eg the virus enters the host-cell but cannot successfully complete replication yet the virus elicited the secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines by dendritic and macrophages cells 73 this finding was confirmed in vivo because the serum levels of a wide spectrum of cytokines and chemokines produced by dendritic cells and macrophages were elevated in sars-cov infected patients 74 furthermore the infection with sars-cov of human primary myeloid-derived dendritic cells was followed by an impaired defensive ifn response which was paralleled by a moderate up-regulation of pro inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- and il-6 and a much more significant up-regulation of inflammatory chemokines such as cxcl10 ccl3 ccl5 and ccl2 75 the authors suggested that the lack of response to antiviral interferons in the presence of chemokine up-regulation could represent a further mechanism of immune evasion by sars-cov 73 in line with this hypothesis the direct exposure of lung epithelial cells 76 or peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs 75 coming from sars infected patients to viral proteins such as s-protein and n-protein induced a prompt release of several chemokines including cxcl8 and cxcl10 in vitro gene-expression studies also reported that pbmc from normal healthy donors inoculated with sars-cov showed an early enhancement in the expression of several chemokines belonging both to the cc family ccl4 ccl20 ccl22 ccl25 ccl27 and their receptors ccr4 ccr7 and of the cxcl family cxcl8 and il-17 77 additional data came from animal models of sars-cov infection in mice infected with sars-cov the clinical features of the syndrome showed an age-dependent increase in severity similarly to what observed in humans which was related to an increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines paralleled by a reduction in t-cell responses 78 another study showed that in mice infected with sars-cov robust virus replication accompanied by delayed type i interferon secretion caused a rapidly fatal pneumonia this delayed type i-interferon signaling promoted the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages with resulting increase in cytokine il-6 and chemokine ccl2 lung levels vascular leakage and impaired virus-specific t cell responses 79these data suggest that coronaviruses and in particular sars-cov have a peculiar ability to counteract the antiviral ifn response pointing toward the fact that the severity of disease might be due to immune dysregulation rather than to the level of viremia this dysregulation would be characterized by an insufficient type i interferon response too little and too late paralleled by an aberrant pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion by alveolar macrophages dendritic cells and pneumocytes 6680
in vitro data suggest that this class of viruses and in particular sars-cov uses several strategies to avoid type i ifn response both passive and active 5659-passive mechanisms include the induction of double membrane vesicles dmv at perinuclear sites within the cytoplasm where rna synthesis takes place this strategy may help to hide and protect rna replication intermediates from being sensed by intracellular rna-sensors thus avoiding the activation of the ifn cascade 8182-active mechanisms include a direct action of viral proteins on transcription factors and intracellular signaling molecules that regulate the ifn cascade in particular the sars-cov protein orf6 is able to inhibit the action of interferon regulatory transcription factor-3 irf-3 a transcription factor of the ifn genes 8384
the fact that sars-cov infection would upregulate the transcription of cxcl10 while significantly down-regulating ifns signaling could seem paradoxical however transcriptional enhancement of cxcl10 could be due to a direct effect on the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells nf-kb 85 triggered by sars-cov86 even if other authors did not confirm this early observation 87 similarly the up-regulation of the cxcl8 gene expression could be due to a direct effect of the virus at the cellular level indeed intestinal and lung cells lines infected by sars-cov promptly increase their secretion of cxcl8 88 this observation would fit with the notion that the expression of cxcl8 is dependent on the transcription factor activator protein 1 ap-1 which was shown to be strongly up-regulated by sars-cov 8689during the mers-cov epidemics several studies were aimed at understanding the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the severe and often fatal pneumonia were performed available data suggest that mers-cov infection shares some immunological aspects of sars-cov infection in terms of involvement of the chemokine system first an increase in the serum levels of cxcl10 when compared to controls was observed also in mers-cov patients more importantly a persistent cxcl10 increase was associated with disease severity 90in this regard the case of two paradigmatic patients diagnosed with mers-cov is worth noting one had a fatal outcome and experienced an impaired ifn response together with a relevant increase in serum cxcl10 levels the other one with a favorable outcome displayed an up-regulation of ifns and irf3 and a less pronounced increase of serum cxcl10 levels 91
in vitro studies also support the relevance of chemokines in mers-cov patients a 2013 study evaluated the expression of several chemokines and cytokines in cell lysates of polarized airway epithelial cells infected with mers-cov or sars-cov the results showed that cxcl8 was up-regulated to a greater extent by mers-cov infection as compared with sars-cov at difference ccl2 and cxcl10 were more strongly up-regulated by sars-cov than mers-cov 92 in addition in dendritic cells infected with mers-cov a significant down-regulation of ifn response paralleled by a striking elevation of cxcl10 was observed 93 a strong induction of cxcl10 secretion was observed also in monocyte-derived macrophages infected with mers-cov 9495 interesting data come also from an experimental mouse model of mers-cov infection in which a significant increase in cxcl8 expression was observed in lung and brain tissue after infection with mers-cov 96data regarding the relationship between covid-19 and chemokine dysregulation are still scanty but are increasingly being reported although preliminary the available data provided by both clinical and in vitro studies suggest possible similarities between what was observed after sars-cov and mers-cov infection overall an increased production of pro-inflammatory chemokines mainly cxcl10 and cxcl8 seems to characterize also covid-19 infectionthere are few in vitro studies regarding sars-cov-2 infection published so far the results of a study comparing sars-cov-2 and sars-cov viruses behavior in the lung tissue should be overviewed briefly the inoculation of the two viruses in ex vivo human lung tissue explants showed that sars-cov-2 was more capable as compared with sars-cov in both infecting and replicating in human lung furthermore sars-cov-2 infection was less able to trigger the expression of any ifns suggesting that sars-cov and sars-cov-2 might differ in their ability to modulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as an example it could be worth highlighting that sars-cov infection upregulated 11 out of the 13 pro-inflammatory factors evaluated while sars-cov-2 upregulated only five of them namely cxcl10 il6 ccl2 cxcl1 cxcl5 interestingly cxcl8 transcription was up-regulated only by sars-cov but not sars-cov-2 infection while the opposite was observed for cxcl10 97the potential involvement of the chemokine system during sars-cov-2 infection was already evident from the first covid-19 series described by chinese physicians in early january 2020 it was reported that several pro-inflammatory cytochines and chemokines including cxcl10 cxcl8 ccl2 tnf and ifn were higher in the plasma of covid-19 patients as compared to healthy controls more importantly among infected patients cxcl10 ccl2 and tnf circulating concentrations but not those of ifn were found to be significantly higher in patients requiring admission to intensive care units as compared to patients experiencing a less severe clinical course 4chen et al recently characterized the immunological features of covid-19 patients with different severity of the disease briefly the 11 patients with severe disease displayed significantly higher serum levels of il-6 il-10 and tnf- and lower absolute numbers of t lymphocytes cd4  t cells and cd8  t cells as compared with the 10 patients with moderate disease of note severe cases were characterized by a lower expression of ifn- by cd4  t cells as compared with moderate cases 98xiong et al performed a transcriptome sequencing analysis of several pro-inflammatory genes in both pmcs and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of patients with covid-19 compared with samples form healthy donors the authors reported that covid-19 patients showed up-regulation of genes encoding for several immune-regulatory molecules in particular cxcl10 in pbmcs whereas no up-regulation of cxcl10 gene was observed in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid moreover an up-regulation of several genes involved in apoptosis and p53 signaling pathways in pbmc was observed leading to the hypothesis that this process could be the underlying cause of lymphopenia commonly observed in covid-19 patients 99 another study by wang et al including 65 sars-cov-2-positive patients showed that the absolute numbers of cd4  t cells cd8  t cells and b cells progressively decreased in relation with increasing severity of illness 100 in this view the findings recently reported by yang et al appear of potential clinical relevance indeed several cytokinechemokine levels were measured and found to be elevated in patients with different clinical severity of the covid-19 among them cxcl10 ccl7 and il-1 receptor antagonist were the ones significantly related to disease severity and even more importantly cxcl10 levels were the only one to be positively and significantly correlated with the viral load yang et al 2020sars-cov-2 and its related syndrome covid-19 have been known to the scientific community since less than 5 months clearly much is yet to be understood and the challenge for the next future will be to increase our understanding the physiopathology of this novel infectious disease hopefully the advances in our comprehension of the mechanisms sustaining the clinical course and patients-related factors driving the final outcome will be helpful in developing effective preventive strategies andor therapeutical options based on current knowledge the cytokine storm appears as one of the most dangerous and potentially life-threatening event related to covid-19 sustaining its major clinical consequences the immune mediated events related to the response to sars-cov-2 infection and the role of the chemokinechemokine receptor system will be further and more extensively characterized with the final goal to identify targeted therapeutic strategies although lessons from the previous sars and mers epidemics can be drawn there is still much to do in order to conclude whether sars-cov-2 virus behaves in the same way of its predecessors or if it is characterized by peculiar specificities clearly the hide-and-seek challenge between the virus and our immune defenses will also help us understanding the extremely variable spectrum of clinical manifestations of covid-19 which appears to range between asymptomatic cases to possibly lethal bilateral pneumonia with
