coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 an emerging infectious disease is a serious threat to human health 13 in december 2019 the outbreak of covid-19 in wuhan city hubei province china was suspected to be related to the seafood market and the chrysanthemum head bat was suspected to be the host of the new coronavirus 47 patients with covid-19 show manifestations of respiratory tract infection such as fever cough pneumonia and in severe cases death 8 9 according to a recent survey the mortality rate of the viral disease is estimated to be approximately 24 8 10 by feb 29 2020 more than 80000 people were confirmed to be infected around the world with most of them found in china at present there are different numbers of infected people in different provinces of china with hubei province being the most seriously affected one and the signs of an infectious outbreak are obvious in addition more than 40 countries around the world have also seen new cases of covid-19 1115 therefore covid-19 is a great challenge to human health 10 16little is known about covid-19 as it is a novel infectious disease therefore currently there is no specific treatment available for covid-19 to date no clinical intervention trial has been completed and reported owing to the urgent need for treatment prevention and control of the disease it is necessary to develop effective intervention methods for covid-19 to facilitate disease control since the outbreak of covid-19 many researchers in china have performed clinical research trials aiming to develop strategies for the treatment prevention and diagnosis of covid-19 however to date a systematic appraisal of the registered clinical trials for covid-19 is lacking therefore we conducted a systematic review of the clinical trials for covid-19 to analyze their characteristics and highlight any existing problemsthis review was performed according to the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions 17 and presented based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines 18the inclusion criteria of this study were patients with covid-19 clinical trials with a protocol trials on the diagnosis prevention and treatment of covid-19 trials with clear and specific end-point outcomes and trials with any type of study designthe exclusion criteria of this study were animal trials theoretical research and unregistered clinical trialsthe literature retrieval was independently performed by two researchers the databases from the chinese clinical trial registration center and clinicaltrialsgov were used to search for relevant articles no language limitations were specified for the search and the search deadline was february 9 2020 the following key words were applied new coronavirus

novel coronavirus pneumonia chest imaging confirmed lung involvement participants were willing to be assigned to any designated treatment group randomly and participants agreed not to participate in another study until completion of the present study most studies were limited to subjects with mild disease and a few studies included patients with severe diseasethe common exclusion criteria were patients with critical covid-19 pregnant and lactating women patients allergic to the studied medicine patients with tumors or serious heart brain kidney or hemoglobin-related disease or other diseases patients with a history of mental disorders drug abuse or substance dependence subjects who did not provide informed consent and subjects not considered suitable for the study by the researcherthe main intervention methods of registered clinical trials included treatment with western medicine 4000 traditional chinese medicine 3467 and integrated traditional chinese and western medicine 2533 the main outcomes of treatment observation included clinical rehabilitation time incidence of using mechanical ventilation incidence of intensive care unit admission mortality and all kinds of complications and virological detection indicators the main methods of administering treatment included oral injection atomization and inhalation the medication time was generally more than one weekoutcomes were generally assessed more than 24 weeks after treatment the controls were treated either with placebo or routine treatmentamong the registered clinical trials 30 40 focused on western medicine-based treatments and the methods of intervention mainly included i antiviral drugs such as chloroquine hydroxychloroquine abidol fabiravir chloroquine phosphate ankylosaurus asc09ritonavir compound tablets lopinavirritonavir coriolus emtritabine ftctenofovir darunavir and cobicistat baloxavir darunavircorbis etutabinepropofol tenofovir and ribavirin ii antiviral drugs in combination with biological agents such as aslucotinib combined with mesenchymal stem cell therapy recombinant cytokine gene-derived protein injection combined with abidol or lopinavirritonavir recombinant virus macrophage inflammatory protein for aerosol inhalation injection or lopinavirritonavir tablets combined with thymosin a1 ribavirin  lpvr combined with interferon alpha-1b and lopinavirritonavir combined with interferon-2b iii biological agents products such as uterine blood stem cells interferon cord blood mononuclear cells cord mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium recombinant cytokine gene-derived protein and immunoglobulin and iv steroid therapy for example methylprednisolone and glucocorticoids intervention in critical patientsthere were 26 3467 registered clinical trials using traditional chinese medicine treatment traditional chinese medicine treatments were mainly various kinds of chinese herbal medicines decoctions capsules granules etc such as feiyanyihao qingfeijiedutang xinguanyihao and lianhuaqingwen capsules the main ingredients of these drugs included antiviral and immunomodulatory chinese herbal formulas in addition traditional chinese medicine treatment also involved certain traditional chinese medicine injections such as xuebijin injection shuanghuanglian injection and tanreqing injectionthere were 19 2533 registered clinical trials using a combination treatment of chinese and western medicine and the intervention included a combination of the above-mentioned chinese herbs and western antiviral drugsthe outcomes included clinical symptoms mortality chest computed tomography findings viral nucleic acid detection body temperature clinical improvement critically ill patients  lung function time for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 rna negativity in patients time for lung recovery mechanical ventilation time length of stay in hospital time for body temperature recovery inflammatory cytokines sepsis-related organ failure assessment score st georges respiratory questionnaire modified barthel index and incidence of adverse events additionally some other laboratory tests for sars-cov-2 including routine blood tests routine urine tests c-reactive protein procalcitonin erythrocyte sedimentation rate muscle enzyme troponin myoglobin d dimer blood gas analysis coagulation routine sars-cov-2 nucleic acid test t cell subgroup analysis and hospitalization period were also selectedthe follow-up period of the outcome measure was mostly 24 weeks but some studies did not provide a planaccording to the cochrane bias risk assessment results fig 3 the quality assessment of the interventional study methodology is generally uncertain most trials reported randomization while some trials had a high risk of bias in the randomization 17 trials did not mention randomization and six trials were judged to be non-randomized trials few trials conducted distribution concealment only nine trials implemented blinding of participants personnel and outcome assessment none of the 63 trials clarified drop-outs or follow-up bias further other bias risks such as the risk of conflicts of interest among drug manufacturers were unclearthe nos scores of the observational trials ranged from 4 to 6 additional file 5 most of the observational trials had a high risk of bias in the outcome assessment follow-up of outcomes and adequacy of follow-up of study cohorts fig 4 therefore the overall quality of registered observational trials was lowcovid-19 a new and poorly understood infectious disease has no recognized effective treatment strategy the coronavirus outbreak has caused great harm to china and seriously threatened peoples health 2123 to deal with the disease many intensive clinical trials have been performed the database search results indicated that current studies were mainly from china involved treatment with traditional chinese medicine western medicine and the combination of traditional chinese and western medicine and the primary sponsors were mainly chinese hospitals however the median sample size of the trials was 100 iqr 60200 and most trials had a small sample size hence the future evidence level of these studies is lowaccording to the summary results only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients and none of the registered clinical trials have been completed of them 34 trials were early clinical exploratory trials or at a pre-experiment stage thirteen were phase iv trials and some drugs that have been licensed for other diseases such as chloroquine phosphate abidol fabiravir asc09ritonavir compound tablets lopinavirritonavir hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were used in registered clinical trials of potential treatments for covid-19 four studies were phase iii clinical trials with remdesivir darunavir and cobicistat and hydroxychloroquinethe main methods of intervention included traditional chinese medicine in 26 trials western medicine in 30 trials and integrated traditional chinese medicine and western medicine in 19 trials at present conventional treatment strategies for covid-19 primarily involve the use of antivirals improving patients immunity intervening autoimmune damage against immune storm caused by cytokines and symptomatic treatmentthere were 26 registered clinical trials of traditional chinese medicine treatment and 19 registered clinical trials using a combination treatment of chinese and western medicine suggesting that traditional chinese medicine is a popular therapeutic candidate for covid-19 at present the combination of chinese and western medicine qingfeipaidutang and chloroquine phosphate abidol lopinavirritonavir is considered a better treatment strategy by experts and has been listed in the protocol of prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia however clinical verification is required in the futureexisting preliminary evidence suggests that the antiviral drug remdesivir phase iii clinical trials for patients with mild moderate and severe disease expected to end on april 27 2020 has promising application prospects the reasons are as follows i in vitro and in vivo cell test results indicated that even very low concentrations of the drug have an antiviral effect 24 25 ii animal trials have proved the drug safe for use 26 iii clinical tests indicate that the drug is effective against ebola virus 27 28 and iv clinical case reports of its efficacy 29 in addition some of the validation drugs such as chloroquine phosphate abidol darunavir and lopinavirritonavir coriolus versicolor have been proven safe and have shown strong antiviral potential in vitro 25 however these drugs urgently need further validation in clinical trialsin this review we found that many trials used biological agents for immunotherapy in light of the experience and lessons from severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 30 31 steroid therapy has been used cautiously in the treatment of covid-19 therefore we found only few studies of steroid therapyfrom the perspective of inclusion and exclusion criteria some populations were excluded such as children and adolescents pregnant women and patients with serious liver and kidney damage therefore there is a lack of clinical evidence in these populationsthe outcomes of clinical trials included clinical observation findings physical examination findings and laboratory test results however some outcomes were subjective leading to potential measurement biasbased on the cochrane risk of bias items and nos we evaluated the quality of interventional trials and observational trials respectively the evaluation results showed that the overall quality of registered clinical trials was low indicating that most registered clinical studies had a greater risk of bias and the level of evidence will be relatively low in the future which reduces the practical significance of the research we believe that it is difficult to obtain reliable and high-quality evidence in the near future the main reasons for the low quality of the registered clinical trial protocols could be i insufficient clinical research ability of the researchers and ii researchers lack of experience in dealing with sudden health eventswe believe that it is necessary to improve the quality of research and registered clinical research programs in strict accordance with the guidelines for clinical trials 3235 in addition the current clinical trials conducted by different hospitals spontaneously are not effectively organized or coordinated some drugs that have not been tested in vitro or whose safety is of great concern are also being tested in clinical trials which increases the risk to patients in these clinical trialsfrom these registered clinical studies we found that most registered clinical research did not consider timeliness and still followed the conservative traditional study design paradigm the median length days of the studies was 179 d iqr 94366 d which is highly unfavorable in the current critical situation we believe that in the current situation the timeliness factor should be given importance in the design of clinical trials so that the research does not lose its social significance therefore in this critical situation it is better to use sequential design for clinical trials sequential design not only requires small sample sizes but also significantly shortens the research period therefore it is very conducive to the screening and discovery of drugs with significant efficacy 36 37 in addition a significant problem is the treatment of patients with severe and critical covid-19 for these patients we suggested that based on the compassionate use drug principle conducting staged small batch and single-arm clinical trials with safe and obvious potential antiviral drugs is feasible we believe that compassionate use drug can not only meet the special needs of patients but also be used in clinical effectiveness observation research and analysis both enhancing the efficiency of research and benefitting the patients 3842 moreover the large number of clinical cases that have accumulated information and using available existing data for statistical analysis with the help of new statistical methods such as clinical data-mining 4345 and real-world study 4648 can help in quickly obtaining very valuable information and save research timein brief under the current circumstance where a large number of cases can be selected using various clinical trial designs and performing data analysis scientifically and efficiently using a variety of clinical research designs and statistical analysis methods is of great value for the treatment and prevention of covid-19intensive clinical trials of covid-19 using traditional chinese medicine and western medicine are ongoing or will be performed in china however based on the uncertain methodology quality small sample size and long duration we will not be able to obtain reliable high-quality clinical evidence regarding covid-19 treatment in the near future improving the quality of study designs prioritizing promising drugs and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for clinical trials for covid-19emerged in december 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has caused an international outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome and spread rapidly to over 100 countries in the world on january 21 2020 the chinese government regarded covid-19 as the class b infectious diseases and took prevention and control measures as class a infectious diseases on february 11 2020 the novel coronavirus pneumonia was named covid-19 by whoworld health organization in late may 2020 the number of covid-19 confirmed cases was over 5000000 worldwide and the number of death was over 3000001 in fact this is not the first time of a serious infectious disease caused by coronavirus both the sars-cov in 2003 and the mers-cov in 2012 belong to the coronaviridae family 2 due to the strong infectivity high fatality rate and the absence of specific medicine for sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 each outbreak of the coronavirus has brought heavy burden to the societycoronavirus is a positive strand rna virus with enveloped structure which have the corona like protuberances on its envelope and look like a crown 3 this kind of virus can be traced back to 80 years ago and isolated from chicken embryos 4 up to now approximately 15 different coronavirus strains have been discovered and can infect a variety of mammals and birds 5 among these coronavirus strains only sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 can infect human and cause fatal pneumonia 5 the clinical features of these three coronaviruses are similar and can range from asymptomatic or mild disease to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multi-organ failure 5coronavirus mainly relies on its envelope structure to invade host cells there are three kinds of proteins on its envelope including spike proteins protein envelope protein and membrane protein 6 s protein plays a key role in recognizing and binding to host cell surface receptors and mediating the fusion of virus envelope with cell membrane 7 the cleavage and activation of s protein of sars-cov-2 is mediated by transmembrane protease serine subfamily member 2 tmprss2 8 the s protein of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 recognizes the same host receptor namely ace2angiotensin-converting enzyme 28 9 10 thus inhibitors of tmprss2 or ace2 could have the potential for the treatment of sars-cov-2the virus enters the host cell via endocytosis forms lysosomes and then releases virus rna regulated by related protease and ph 11 the endosomal acidification inhibitors such as chloroquine and membrane fusion inhibitors such as arbidol can also be used for the clinical study of covid-19 therapy afterwards the rna completes the transcription and translation of virus proteins and rna replication occurs in the cytoplasm these processes can be blocked by the nucleoside analogues such as remdesivir protease inhibitors such lopinavirritonavir sars-cov-2 3clpro proteasefor processing of polyproteins translated from the viral rna inhibitors such as pyridine-containing -ketoamides12 13 14 finally the protein shells combine with rna to generate new coronavirus particles which are secreted to extracellular environment through golgi apparatus and infect new cells 7with a better understanding of the structure the infection mechanisms of sars-cov-2 and the clinical symptoms of covid-19 patients many drugs had been used for the clinical practice of covid-19 up to now the therapeutic options for covid-19 can be classified into small molecules peptide inhibitors traditional chinese medicines and biologics summarized in table 1
 in late may 2020 over 1600 clinical trials have been registered to find the effective treatments for covid-19 from clinical trial registry platforms httpclinicaltrialsgov and httpwwwchictrorgcn the most widely used therapeutic drugs include abidol ribavirin favipiravir interferon- chloroquinehydroxychloroquine kaletralopinavirritonavir remdesivir gs-5734 sars-cov-2-specific neutralizing antibodies and so on besides the newly discovered small drugs peptides and vaccine are also under pre-clinical or clinical researches in this paper we systematically introduced the safety clinical efficacy and the progress of antiviral researches of these drugs hoping to provide some ideas for the therapeutic options of covid-19 worldwide and better understand the antiviral strategies prepared for the life-threaten virus diseases in the futurethis review was conducted according to the studies which were randomized controlled trials rcts prospective cohort retrospective cohort studies and so on performed among adult patients with covid-19 and evaluated the efficacy and safety of anti-coronavirus agents the studies were excluded if they lacked a control group or target quantitative outcomes the primary outcomes included mortality virological eradication and clinical improvement the secondary outcomes included improvement of symptoms time to become afebrile improvement of chest radiography results utilization of mechanical ventilation intensive care unit admission and adverse events all the date was searched from pubmed embase china national knowledge infrastructure cnki and wanfang data was performed without language restriction unpublished trials were also identified from clinical trial registry platforms httpclinicaltrialsgov and httpwwwchictrorgcn preprint articles were retrieved from the websites medrxiv httpswwwmedrxivorg and biorxiv httpswwwbiorxivorgin the phase i clinical trial of remdesivir 3-225 mg intravenous injection of single dose hill climb test was conducted the subjects showed good tolerance and all the adverse reactions were grade 1 or grade 2 with aspartic transaminase ast or alamine aminotransferase alt increasing but no abnormality in total bilirubin alkaline phosphatase alp or albumin and no effect on renal function 16 according to a recently randomised clinical trial rct of covid-19 66 102155adverse events of remdesivir treatment were observed compared to the 645078 in placebo treatment 17remdesivir has not yet been approved for antiviral therapy and is currently used for the phase iii clinical trial of covid-19 in china the dosage form of remdesivir used in clinical trials is freeze-dried powder injection and the designed administration mode is as follows on the 1 st day 200 mg loading dose of remdesivir was provided by intravenous dripping and then 100 mg maintenance dose of the drug was provided by intravenous dripping every day for 9 days from international clinical trials registry platformwho ictrpremdesivir had previously shown inhibitory effect on coronaviruses such as sars-cov mers-cov and covid-19 in vitro or in vivo 18 19 20 the cell-based experiments showed that remdesivir can inhibit intracellular replication of covid-19 with ec50 of 077 m 20 indicating that remdesivir may be a promising candidate for the treatment of covid-19 since the first american covid-19 patient treated with remdesivir got obvious clinical benefits numbers of clinical trials of remdesivir were preformed to investigate the efficacy and safety in patients with covid-19 21 a short-term study with 53 covid-19 patients showed that after 18 days remdsivir treatment 47 patients 2553 had been discharged from hospital total mortality was 13 overall clinical improvement was 68 however this uncontrolled respective study makes outcomes lack strong evidence 22 in this situation the first double-blind randomized clinical trial of remdesivir was conducted in severe covid-19 patients in wuhan china the results indicated that remdesivir treatment had clinical improvement in severe covid-19 patients with symptom duration no more than 10 days 17 the outcomes of another multicenter rct of remdesivir in covid-19 patients has present a significant shorten in duration of discharge from hospital without significant difference in mortality 17 according to these studies we still do not know the benefit or harm of remdesivir treatment in severe covid-19 patients however further studies of remdesivir in patients with covid-19 in higher dosage or combination with other antivirals agents might help us to better understand its potential mechanism and clinical efficacythe reproductive toxicity and the hemolytic anemia is the most serious side effects of ribavirin some cohort studies of ribavirin showed that patients on therapy with loading dose of ribavirin experience significant toxic and side effects such as hemolytic anemia 25 in another retrospective study among the 126 patients who received loading dose of ribavirin2000 mg treatment the mainly adverse drug reactions included hemolytic bleeding bradyarrhythmia14 and elevated transaminase40 26 thus the dose of ribavirin need to be carefully adjusted to treat patients with covid-19ribavirin is only approved by fda for hepatitis c human respiratory syncytial virus rsv and some hemorrhagic fevers in combination with pegylated interferon in china ribavirin is used for the patients with covid-19 which is mentioned innovel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment schemetrial edition fifth issued by the chinese government 27 it is recommended to use ribavirin in combination with interferon or lopinavirritonavir the dosage for adults is 500 mg per time 23 times per day by intravenous infusion and the course of treatment is no longer than 10 daysthe clinical studies in hong kong have shown that ribavirin couldnt improve clinical outcome of patients with sars-cov 28 in 20 mers-cov infected patients a combination treatment of ribavirin and ifn- showed significantly improved survival at 14 days but not at 28 days 29 although ribavirin has shown a certain effect on mers-cov it is still controversial 3031 in china ribavirin was chosen for patients with covid-19 in combination with ifn or lopinavirritonavir according to the clinical guidelines 27 a clinical trial showed the significantly antiviral effect of combination treatment of ribavirin and ifn- on patients with mers-cov 32 but the adverse reaction of decreasing hemoglobin in infected patients reduces its potential antiviral agent against covid-19 take consideration of limited efficacy of ribavirin against coronaviruses and toxicity in vivo some medical team stop ribavirin treatment and related studiesthe most serious side effect of favipiravir is teratogenicity in the phase iii of a japanese and international multi-center clinical trial with 501 patients the main adverse reactions including rising uric acid24 cases 479 diarrhea24 cases 479 neutropenia9 cases 180 increased ast9 cases 180 and increased alt8 cases 160 34 in a randomized clinical trial of favipiravir with 240 patients with covid-19 the most common adverse events were liver enzyme abnormalities psychiatric gastrointestinal symptoms and serum uric acid elevations0001 35 the overall adverse reactions were mild symptoms but pregnant woman should not be treated with favipiravirfavipiravir is approved in japan for treatment of new or recurrent influenza favipiravir was approved for treatment of covid-19 on february 15 2020 in china and also became the first approved drug for covid-19 the recommended mode of administration in china is 1200 mg400 mg with 1200 mg every time on the first day twice a day and 400 mg every time from the second to fifth days twice a dayin 2014 favipiravir was urgently used to treat ebola virus and achieved good results 3637 in 2020 favipiravir showed cytotoxicity in vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov-2 at ec50 of 6188 m 20 a recent randomized clinical trial revealed that favipiravir had a clinical recovery rate of day 7 and led to shorter latencies to relief for both pyrexia difference 170 days p  00001 and cough difference175 days p  00001 compared to arbidol 35 an open-label control study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of favipiravir in the treatment of covid-19 was conducted with 80 patients 38 the favipiravir arm had a shorter viral clearance time versus the control arm median 4 days vs 11 days p  0001 and also had a higher rate of improvement in chest imaging 9143 vs 62 p  0001 in addition patients with covid-19 have been recruited to evaluate the efficacy of favipiravir plus interferon-chictr2000029600 chictr chinese clinical trial register favipiravir plus baloxavir marboxil chictr2000029544 favipiravir plus tocilizumabchictr2000030894 and favipiravir plus chloroquine phosphatechictr2000030987 etc the clinical trials registered indicate that the combination therapy of favipiravir with other drugs may be a promising option for covid-19 patientsa retrospective analysis with kaletra for 60 weeks showed that diarrhea nausea and vomiting are the main adverse reactions 40 a retrospective study with 417 patients with covid-19 revealed that the use of lopinavirritonavir lead to increased odds of liver injury or from 444 to 503 both p  001 41 another study revealed that lopinavirritonavir has an uncertain antiviral effect and even some potentially severe side effects in solid organ transplant recipients with covid-19 42 lopinavirritonavir have a synergistic effect on tacrolimus resulting in higher trough blood concentrations of tacrolimus and cause severe liver and kidney dysfunction and also greatly damage the function of the immune system 43kaletra was previously approved by fda for aids in 2000 in 2020 kaletra was chosen as clinical candidate for the treatment of covid-19 in the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment scheme trial edition fifth issued by chinese government the medication for adult patients with covid-19 is lopinavir 400 mgritonavir 100 mg twice a day for no less than 10 days 27 the dosage for children is adjusted according to body weight 12 mgkg for 7-15 kg and 10 mgkg for 15-40 kg with the maximum dose of 400100 mg per timeas early as 2003 kaletra was considered as a clinical option for the treatment of sars and it indeed showed antiviral effect on sars both in tissues and patients 44 one clinical research in hong kong showed that kaletra reduced the mortality rate of sars-cov from 156 to 23 but it mainly exhibited good effect on patients with mild symptoms 45the in vitro study revealed that lopinavir had antiviral effect in vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov-2 with ec50 of 2663 m 46 a recently published research showed that no benefit was observed with kaletera treatment in patients with severe covid-19 as compared with standard supportive care alone 47 a multicenter prospective open-label phase 2 trial with 127 covid-19 patients revealed that triple combination of interferon beta-1b lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate covid-19 48 a randomized controlled open-label trial with 199 covid-19 patients revealed that no benefit was observed with lopinavirritonavir treatment beyond standard care however the secondary outcomes of this trial showed that the 28-day mortality was numerically lower in the lopinavirritonavir group than in the standard care group and the lopinavirritonavir group had shorter stay in the intensive care unit icu 49 it seems that the combination of lopinavir-ritonavir with interferon -1b and ribavirin or other drugs could have better effect than lopinavir-ritonavir alonethe therapeutic and toxic dose of cqhcq is narrow the main toxicological outcomes initiated by cq and hcq reported are related to retinopathy neuromyopathy and cardiomyopathy after long term use 51 the doses used for covid-19 are often much higher than the treatment of chronic rheumatic diseases 52 thus the improper use of cq or hcq can easily cause serious side effects a phase iib clinical trial with 81 covid-19 patients showed that creatine phosphokinase ck and creatine kinase-mb ckmb levels were elevated in 13 of 33 patients 394 and 10 of 26 patients 384 respectively hemoglobin decrease was observed in 11 of 42 patients 262 and creatinine increase was observed in 16 of 38 421 no apparent hematological or renal toxicity were seen among these patients 53cq is a widely used drug for malaria and autoimmune diseases and it has been used for over 70 years in 2020 cq was recommended for the therapy of covid-19 in the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment scheme trial edition sixth issued by chinese government 54 cq phosphate is applicable to patients aged 18 to 65 the administration mode for patients weighing over 50 kg is 500 mg per time twice a day with 7 days treatment for those weighing no greater than 50 kg is 500 mg per time twice a day for the first and second days and 500 mg per time once a day for the third to seventh days with 7 days treatmentit was reported in 2004 that chloroquine can effectively inhibit sars coronavirus at the cellular level 55 in 2020 chinese researchers revealed that chloroquine had the ec90 of 690 m for vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov-2 20 a chinese clinical trial with more than 100 covid-19 patients found that chloroquine had superior to the control group in reducing symptom duration exacerbation of pneumonia including radiological improvement and promoting virus-negative seroconversion without any severe side effects 56 another randomized clinical trial with 81 adult patients suggested that the higher cq dosage 600 mg cq twice daily for 10 days should not be recommended for critically ill patients with covid-19 because of its potential safety hazards 53 a retrospective multicenter cohort study of 1438 hospitalized covid-19 patients revealed that treatment with hydroxychloroquine azithromycin or both compared with neither treatment was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality 57 a comparative observational study with 181 covid-19 patients suggested that hydroxychloroquine should not be recommended to be used in covid-19 patients who require oxygen 58 multinational registry analysis of cq and hcq for 96032 covid-19 patients revealed that cqhcq independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality 59 despite many observational studies have been performed to evaluate the efficacy of cqhcq we cannot exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors making it difficult to judge the therapeutic effect of cqhcqin an systematic review including 8 studies116 patients of mers-cov treatment by interferon interferon- combined with ribavirin caused adverse reactions two patients had increase in pancreatic enzyme and one patient had obvious hemolysis after the treatment of interferon-2a combined with ribavirin 60interferon- ifn- is generally used for the treatment of malignant tumors and the prevention and treatment of virus through improving the immune function of human body 61 the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment scheme trial edition seventh issued by chinese government recommended that ifn- aerosol inhalation can be used for antiviral treatment of covid-19 62 the administration mode for adults is 5 million u or equivalent dose with 2 ml sterile water for injection by aerosol inhalation twice a daythe in vitro study showed that both ifn- and ifn- exhibited antiviral effect on mers-cov and sars-cov 6364 ifn in combination with ribavirin showed better antiviral effect than ribavirin alone in the renal cell line of rhesus monkey infected with mers-cov 65 a clinical study compared the clinical effects of ifn- combined with glucocorticoid and glucocorticoid alone in the treatment of sars-cov patients 66 the results showed that the symptomatic relief time in pulmonary imaging of interferon- group was shortened by 50 p  0001 and the oxygen saturation was significantly improved a recent triple therapy study of interferon beta-1b lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin presented that remarkable differences were observed in symptom alleviation shorten the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in combination group 48 however more clinical benefits and potential anti-cytokine approaches of ifn are still under investigated for covid-19the overall adverse effect of arbidol is mild the commonly adverse drug reactions was nausea abdominal discomfort nausea with headache and leucopenia increased akp and increased total bilirubin the retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of arbidol treatment for covid-19 patients revealed that no apparent side effect was observed during the therapy 67arbidol was first approved in russia in 1993 for the treatment of influenza now the drug is marketed in china and russia for the treatment of upper respiratory infection caused by influenza a and b viruses arbidol is recommended for the treatment of covid-19 in the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment scheme trial edition sixth 54 the administration mode for adults is 02 g per time 3 times a day with the treatment lasting up to 10 daysin 2019 arbidol received extensive attention due to the outbreak of covid-19 early studies have shown that arbidol has an effect of inhibiting the early replication of sars virus in vitro 68 recent study reported that arbidol efficiently inhibited sars-cov-2 infection in vitro with ec50 of 411 m which suggested arbidol might have potential for the treatment of covid-19 patients 69 a retrospective study was performed to evaluate the antiviral effects and safety of lopinavirritonavir and arbidol in 50 covid-19 patients which indicated that arbidol group had a shorter viral load compared to those in the lopinavirritonavir group p  001 and may have better antiviral effect than lopinavirritonavir 67 another retrospective study with 81 covid-19 patients revealed that arbidol group had longer hospital stay than the control group and the median time for turning negative was similar with the control which suggested that arbidol might not improve the prognosis or accelerate sars-cov-2 clearance 70 however one research with 69 enrolled covid-19 patients revealed that arbidol had tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate 71lianhuaqingwen lh is mainly used to treat influenza which showed antiviral activity and clinical improvement on series of influenza viruses the relieved symptoms include fever or hyperpyrexia aversion to cold muscular soreness nasal obstruction running nose cough headache and so on the recommended dosage for adults is 4 capsules per time 035 g powercapsule three times a daysince the outbreak of covid-19 pandemic chinese doctors have used lh to treat patients with common and severe covid-19 as a potential treatment agent against sars-cov-2 lh showed excellent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity on novel coronavirus in vitro 72 another human rct presented that standard antiviral therapy combined with lh can significantly improve the symptoms of covid-19 such as fever cough and fatigue in most of common covid-19 patients relieve the pneumonia symptoms and significantly shorten the duration of pneumonia symptoms without observed serious adverse events 73 this provides a preliminary evidence of the antiviral activity of lh for covid-19 lh and other traditional chinese medicines have also played a positive role in antiviral efficacy against sars-cov-2 during pandemicat present convalescent blood products are mainly used for acute and severe virus infections without available vaccine or specific therapy such as sars-cov mers-cov ebola etc the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment scheme trial edition seventh recommended convalescent plasma therapy for serious and extreme cases of covid-19 62in 2015 a systematic analysis of the treatment of sars-cov with convalescent plasma and hepatitis b immune globulin was reported 75 evidences continuously proved that convalescent blood products can reduce the total mortality of sars-cov especially in the early stage of symptoms the clinical trials of convalescent plasma are undergoing for the treatment of patients with severe covid-19 a case series study of convalescent plasma showed that the clinical symptoms were significantly relieved within 3 days of treatment suggesting that the plasma was effective in treating severe covid-19 patients 76 the convalescent plasma is considered to have possible source of specific antibodies for pathogen however it can also be challenging due to the limited serum with sufficiently high antibody and small sample size convalescent plasma therapy could be a valid option for severe covid-19 patients when a specific treatment is not availablemesenchymal stem cells mscs are multipotent cells isolated from diverse mesenchymal tissues such as bone marrow umbilical cord adipose tissue 77 mscs can enlarge the proportion of regulatory t cells and decrease pro-inflammatory factors such as il-6 and tnf- which have a great potential to improve the outcome of covid-19 patients 78 the immunomodulating effects of mscs have been proven on avian influenza viruses 79 more than 10 clinical trials had been registered to estimate the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells for covid-19 patients in the world a clinical study significantly improved functional outcomes without obvious adverse effects in 7 covid-19 patients 80the vaccine could be urgently needed to protect against covid-19 worldwide recently scientists played great efforts for the development of covid-19 vaccine with safety and efficacy as of june 242020 there are 16 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation which are composed of dna rna non-replicating viral vector inactivated virus and recombinant proteins81 the first sars-cov-2 mrna vaccine mrna-1273 encoding s protein launched phase i nct04283461 clinical trial which 15 participants seroconverted by day 15 and 8 participants all developed neutralizing antibodies 82 ad5-cov vaccine was viral vector vaccines chictr2000030906nct04313127 developed by chen wei group which the neutralizing antibodies increased significantly at day 14 and peaked 28 days post-vaccination83 protein vaccines such as nvx-cov2373 nct04368988 usually had high cost low immunogenicity but high safety and scalability despite great efforts have been made for vaccine development completion dates for early clinical trials have not been estimated and it may still take longer before a vaccine is licensed for use globallybesides the drugs introduced above there are many promising drugs registered with the intention of discovering effective treatments triazavirintzv is a broad spectrum antiviral drug the clinical trial to test the efficacy and safety of triazavirin for covid-19 was performed in chinachictr2000030001 but the outcomes of this trial have not been reported danoprevir is a potent hcv protease ns34a inhibitor approved by cfdachina food and drug administration to treat chronic hepatitis c patients a clinical study showed that danoprevir ritonavir could significantly improve respiratory symptoms and obvious lung absorption of covid-19 patients 84 oral ll-37 antiviral peptide cas001 was another promising candidate and had been used for clinical trial with 11 covid-19 patients the preliminary result showed that cas001 had definite effect in the improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and is possible to have effects in improving the systemic symptoms and respiratory symptoms of covid-19 85 baloxavir marboxil is a recently developed antiviral prodrug whose metabolite selectively inhibits the cap-dependent endonuclease of the influenza virus polymerase acidic protein a randomized controlled trial showed that baloxavir marboxil had antiviral activity in vitro with ec50 of 548 m but lacked of virological effect and clinical benefits partly due to insufficient concentrations or the poor antiviral effect in vivo 86 danorevirritonavir was the first protease inhibitor-based single-tablet regimen str available for the treatment of adults and adolescents aged  12 years with hiv-1 infection this drug was also used for clinical trial to assess the efficacy for the treatment of covid-19 but the results have not been reported 87 many other promising drugs were also under clinical trials for covid-19 patients such as emtritabine ftctenofovir alafenamide fumarate tablets tafchictr2000029468 azvudine ganovoritonavirchictr2000030000 asc09ritonavirchictr2000029603 tranilastchictr2000030002 et al further studies of their efficacy and safety for inhibiting sars-cov-2 in humans needs to be investigatedthe pandemic of covid-19 has made an unprecedented crisis for public health and economy both in china and other countries scientists worldwide struggle to seek efficacious covid-19 treatments to control the morbidity and mortality of covid-19 numerous drugs have been used in clinical practice to estimate their efficacy and safety for covid-19 patients the various clinical trials in patients with these drugs may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefitas diagnosis and treatment program of covid-19 developed rapidly the therapeutic strategies are quite different in many counties as the most attractive and promising antiviral agents lopinavirritonavir remdesivir and cqhcq have presented potential antiviral activities against covid-19 for patients with severe or mild covid-19 no benefit was observed with lopinavirritonavir treatment beyond standard care 4788 however the triple combination of interferon -1b lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin was safe and superior to lopinavirritonavir alone for patients with mild to moderate covid-19 patients indicating the combination therapy may increase the efficacy and safety of lopinavirritonavir 48 a result of rct indicated that remdesivir alone had clinical improvement in severe covid-19 patients with shorten duration of hospital stay but no statistically clinical benefits and difference in mortality were observed however some scientists gave hope to the combination of remdesivir with other drugs such as tocilizumab thus further studies of combination treatment with stronger evidences are needed the therapeutic and toxic dose of cqhcq is so narrow that the improper use of cq or hcq can easily cause serious side effects many european countries approved cqhcq only for clinical trials but not for the treatment for covid-19 patients because of the unsatisfied efficacy and the potential toxicity of cqhcq however a cause-and-effect relationship between drug therapy and survival should not be inferred too early according to the observational studies according to anti-coronaviruses activity and better coronaviruses clearance of favipiravir double- and triple-therapy include favipiravir is recommended for mild or moderated covid-19 patients as it is associated with cardiovascular reaction and hepatotoxicity that ribavirin is not recommended for mild covid-19 traditional chinese medicine such as lh played an important role during this epidemic for patients both in fangcang shelter hospital and covid-19 designated infectious disease hospitals the combination treatment of lh and standard antiviral agents could somehow relieve symptoms and reduce the time of recovery with mild patientsother old drugs are under pre-clinical and clinical study for the treatment of covid-19 such as triazavirin danorevir baloxavir marboxil darunavircobicistat emtritabine ftctenofovir alafenamide fumarate tablets taf etc but few of them had solid evidence to support their efficacy and safety for covid-19 patients meanwhile the development of new drugs for covid-19 are still ongoing for instance the small peptides targeting ace2 small molecule interrupting the interaction of sars-cov-2 mpro 3clpro protease with other drugs 14 these new drugs displayed obvious antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo but their efficacy for covid-19 patients need to be further investigated biologics are considered to be the most promising drugs in the future due to their high specificity and efficacy biologics such as mesenchymal stem cells sars-cov-2-specific neutralizing antibodies vaccines have been used for clinical practice of covid-19 patients with the further clinical trials the safety and efficacy will be revealed for the rational options for the treatment of covid-19despite many clinical trials have been conducted for the treatment of covid-19 no drug has been verified to be really effective for covid-19 to find the specific drugs for covid-19 multicenter clinical trials should be performed with enough enrolled patients to carefully analysis the clinical outcomes on the other hand new drugs such as small inhibitors ace2 peptide inhibitors or vaccines specific for sars-cov-2 are new hope for the treatment of covid-19 we believe that the numerous experiences reviewed in this paper will promote the development of effective drugs for covid-19 patientsno potential conflict of interest was reported by the authorsin early december of 2019 a novel coronavirus associated with atypical pneumonia emerged from wuhan china zhu et al 2020 since the past 5 months it has affected over 84000

attention to a novel mechanism of cysteinyl cathepsin l catl activity in coronavirus surface spike protein proteolysis and propose a promising possibility of a protease inhibitor cocktail therapy to target host cell surface transmembrane serine protease 2 tmprss2 and catl on cell surfaces and inside the endosomes
clinical trials and anti-viral drug candidates
since the outbreak of covid-19 in china and then worldwide the drug treatments offered to covid-19 patients have shown inconsistent outcomes most drugs were administered based on the anti-coronavirus effects demonstrated in previous in vitro and patient studies
1 registered clinical trials

fig 1
summarizes current registered covid-19-associated trials through may 5 2020 from various clinical trial registry sites there are 2118 trials in total and the majority of which are registered at clinicaltrialsgov from the united states national library of medicine at the national institutes of health n  1076 and from the chinese clinical trial registry chictr database n  653 fig 1a of these 2118 trials 1273 were intervention studies to test the efficacy of medications with proper placebo or standard treatment controls there are 756 observational trials in which researchers do not intervene but monitor participant disease progress for the purpose of information collection the remaining registered trials include diagnostic tests expanded access epidemiological inquiry health service research basic science prevention meta-analysis and studies of prognosis fig 1b although most trials were not applicable without defined phases there were 824 trials covering from phases i  iv others include 117 retrospective studies and 6 new treatment trials for small sample pilot studies fig 1c from all listed trials 1067 were involved in pharmacologic interventions whereas 1051 concerned other medical interventions such as mechanical ventilation continuous renal replacement therapy mental status evaluation diagnostic studies and biomarker research of the pharmacological intervention trials 873 were controlled and 194 lacked control arms controlled trials included 697 randomized and 176 non-randomized studies fig 1dthe 1067 medication intervention trials include 34 drugs among which choloroquine and traditional chinese medicine have the highest numbers of trials and patients table 1

2 top drug candidates
the announced results from in vitro tests and clinical feedback from case studies and news reports suggest possible efficacy of at least 4 drugs including remdesivir chloroquine lopinavirritonavir and arbidol although detailed clinical trial data are pending fig 1 and table 1 all these drugs have been reported previously to be effective in clinical use or in vitro tests against sars-cov or mers-cov agostini et al 2018 chu et al 2004 khamitov et al 2008 vincent et al 2005remdesivir a small molecule adenosine analogue was proved effective at the stage of post sars-cov-2 entry wang et al 2020a chloroquine a 70-year-old anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drug can block virus infection in vitro at both the entry and post-entry stages of sars-cov-2 infection wang et al 2020a these two drugs worked at low m concentrations and showed high selectivity indices si in vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov-2 wang et al 2020a arbidol a broad-spectrum anti-influenza ab drug inhibited the activity of novel coronavirus at 1030 m concentrations from in vitro assays yet many of these observations remain preliminary clinical reports have suggested a few drugs with possible efficacy for covid-19 patients a case report in the united states anecdotally indicated the effectiveness of remdesivir on a covid-19 patient holshue et al 2020 a recent cohort of 53 patients hospitalized for severe covid-19 from the united states canada and japan showed 68 improvement in oxygen saturation but with a mortality rate of 18 after 10 days of remdesivir grein et al 2020 four patients with mild or severe covid-19 pneumonia admitted to shanghai public health clinical center showed significant improvement of symptoms after both the anti-viral treatment with lopinavirritonavir kaletra arbidol and shufeng jiedu capsule a traditional chinese medicine for 615 days together with antibiotics treatment and supplemental oxygen wang et al 2020b yet a recent trial of 99 adults hospitalized with severe covid-19 from china did not show significant clinical improvement after 14 days of lopinavirritonavir treatment compared with 100 patients with standard-care cao et al 2020 no firm results are available regarding these drugs from larger cohorts of patient trials
catl mediates coronavirus infection and replication
the high structural similarity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov or mers-cov and their similar clinical presentations suggest that sars-cov-2 sars-cov and mers-cov will respond similarly to therapeutics targeting coronavirus spike protein processing we review here related studies from the past 10 years and propose that catl is an attractive therapeutic target to protect covid-19 patients from host cell virus entry and intracellular virus replication while leaving the host adaptive immunity unaffected
1 coronavirus infection and replication
sars-cov-2 and most other coronaviruses such as sars-cov share similar viral structures and virulence mechanisms simmons zmora gierer heurich  pohlmann 2013 the spike glycoprotein s glycoprotein on the coronavirus surface is synthesized as a  1300 amino acids precursor that consists of a  700 amino acid n-terminal signal subunit s1 685 amino acids for sars-cov-2 and a  600 amino acid c-terminal transmembrane subunit s2 588 amino acids for sars-cov-2 li 2016 while the s1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain rbd that mediates the binding of coronavirus on to the host cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the s2 contains a hydrophobic fusion peptide and two heptad repeat regions that mediate virus fusion with the host cells belouzard millet licitra  whittaker 2012 simmons et al 2013 song gui wang  xiang 2018 protein sequence analysis of the 71-amino acid receptor binding motif within the rbd domain in the s1 subunit indicates that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share 58 amino acid identity and form congruent 3d structures while the s2 subunit of sars-cov-2 shares 99 identity with sars-cov hoffman et al 2020 shang yang rao  rao 2020 yan et al 2020 the entry of sars-cov-2 into human lung type-ii alveolar atii epithelial cells employs the host cell surface ace2 as does sars-cov hoffman et al 2020 lu et al 2020 zou et al 2020 fig 2
provides a simplified diagram of the sars-cov-2 infection pathway from initial cell surface ace2 binding endocytosis membrane fusion intracellular virus replication to the release of newly packaged sars-cov-2
2 tmprss2 and catl in coronavirus infection
the binding of coronaviruses on to the lung atii cell surface ace2 receptor may facilitate virus surface s1 subunit proteolysis by plasma membrane-bound serine protease tmprss2 and catl fig 3a hoffmann et al 2020 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 this process may continue during virus endocytosis fig 3b hu dammer ren  wang 2015 wang et al 2008 the serine protease tmprss2 functions at neutral ph meyer et al 2013 but loses its activity under acidic conditions we recently reported that catl complexes with tgf- receptor-1 on the kidney epithelial cell surface a function of catl that does not depend on its proteolytic activity zhang et al 2019 therefore tmprss2 may play a major role in virus s1 subunit proteolysis on the host cell surface although membrane-bound or released catl should also target the same substrate zhang et al 2019
3 catl activity in coronavirus replication
once the sars-cov-2 reaches intracellular endosomes however catl becomes the major protease that cleaves the virus s1 subunit as this cysteinyl proteinase has an acidic ph optimum fig 3c chapman riese  shi 1997 ou et al 2020 indeed sars-cov viruses have been considered ph-sensitive viruses and their intracellular trafficking requires an acidic environment chu mcelroy chu bauman  whittaker 2006 while the serine protease tmprss2 acts locally at the host cell plasma membrane and possibly during endocytotic vesicle trafficking glowacka et al 2011 catl continues s1 subunit degradation in the acidic endosome and lysosome compartments this sequence of events explains the observations that the tmprss2 inhibitor camostat mesylate or a non-selective cysteinyl cathepsin inhibitor e64d could partially limit the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection of human epithelial cells combined use of both inhibitors fully blocked the infection of these coronaviruses hoffmann et al 2020 although not tested in hofmanns study we hypothesize that combined use of tmprss2 inhibitor camostat mesylate and a catl inhibitor will blunt substantially coronavirus infection of human cellshuman cysteinyl cathepsins are the major proteases that reside in endosomes this family composes 11 members that display acidic ph optima liu et al 2018 among this family of proteases catl cleaves the virus spike glycoprotein at the position of t678 vayt-m bosch bartelink  rottier 2008 close to the predicted s1 and s2 boundary region of the sars s protein sars-s fig 3c after cleavage the sars-s s1 subunit is released from the s2 subunit a fusion peptide on the s2 subunit inserts into the endosome membrane then the heptad repeats in the s2 subunit fold back and form a six-helix-bundle structure simmons et al 2013 subsequently viral and endosome membranes coalesce and eventually fuse fig 3d coronaviridae then release their rna into the cytoplasm of the host cells fig 3e as a single-stranded positive sense rna virus coronavirus has its own genetic material the viral rna can function as messenger rna directing the synthesis of viral proteins by host cell ribosomes without entering the nucleus fig 2 positive stranded rna virus replication viralzone httpsviralzoneexpasyorg1116 therefore catl inhibition provides two sequential blocks for coronavirus infection on the host cell surface to block virus entry and inside the host cell endosomes to block viral material release and replication before we discuss the potential advantage of catl inhibition in maintaining human adaptive immunity we will discuss the status of current catl inhibitory drug development
catl inhibitors possess anti-coronavirus activity
based on the mechanisms proposed in fig 2 fig 3 a catl-inhibitory molecule can exert substantial anti-viral activity several compounds display catl inhibitory activity as summarized in earlier reviews li fang  ao 2017 yet no currently available drug can specifically inhibit catl dana  pathak 2020 in 2003 the outbreak of sars brought academic attention to catl inhibitor development over the past decade seven catl inhibitory compounds have demonstrated anti-coronavirus activity these compounds include dec-rvkr-cmk k11777 small molecule 5705213 mdl28170 ssaa09e1 est and oxocarbazate table 2

all seven catl inhibitors have been tested on the infection of coronavirus pseudotypes and demonstrated inhibition of virus entry into host cells although their pharmacology and toxicity varied k11777 showed the lowest ic50 in sars infection inhibition zhou et al 2015 among all 7 listed inhibitors in table 2 although not all assays were performed in a single study k11777 a vinyl sulfone cysteine protease inhibitor selected from screening of a library of proximately 2100 cysteine protease inhibitors using the dual-envelop pseudotype dep assay zhou et al 2015 it exhibited the inhibition of sars-cov infection at ic50 of 068 nm with cc50  10 m and mers-cov infection at ic50 of 46 nm through the cytopathic effect cpe inhibition assay three potent k11777 analogs smdc256122 smdc256159 and smdc256160 also showed strong anti-viral activity towards sars-cov pseudotypes with ic50 at 004 nm 007 nm and 008 nm respectively the anti-viral infection activity of k11777 smdc256159 and smdc256160 was validated on replication of competent sars-cov at ic50  005  0 nm cc50  1056  593 m si  2112 ic50 065  081 nm cc50  1092  498 m si  168 ic50  008  005 nm cc50  506  267 m si  6325 respectively furthermore k11777 and its analogs have already proven safe in several parasitic infections in animals compatible with the feasibility of k11777 for clinical uses doyle zhou engel  mckerrow 2007 engel doyle hsieh  mckerrow 1998the other six compounds possessed various potencies as virus infection inhibitor and for cytotoxicity the most recently studied dec-rvkr-cmk showed inhibitory effects on mers-cov entry at noncytotoxic concentrations 25 to 100 m matsuyama et al 2018 with a decrease in the number of green fluorescent protein gfp-positive cells by 60 with vsv-ggfp-mers-s infection tested in human epithelial cell lines lovo cells and calu-3 cells a high-throughput library chembridge diverset library screening using self-synthesized virus peptides identified a small molecule compound 5705213 elshabrawy et al 2014 it showed a relatively weaker capacity on sars-cov ic50  90 m entry into the host 293ft cells compared with k11777 although it showed dose-dependent inhibition of sars-cov entry and the cc50 was of 400 m leading to a low si cc50ic50 of 267 ssaa09e1 selected from the maybridge hitfinder chemical library using the sarshiv-luc pseudotyped virus infection assay exerted inhibition on virus entry of ace2-expressing 293 t cells at ec50 of 67  04 m cc50  100 m si  16 adedeji et al 2013 est was reported as a cysteine protease inhibitor including catl it showed strong inhibition on sars-cov entry when administered together with serine protease inhibitors such as camostat mesylate kawase shirato van der hoek taguchi  matsuyama 2012 oxocarbazate pubchem cid 23631927 was initially designed based on the knowledge of the previously reported thiocarbazate chemotype myers shah diamond huryn  smith 3rd 2008 shah et al 2010 it inhibited sars-cov infection at ic50 of 273  49 nm in cultured human aortic endothelial cells oxocarbazate did not display cytotoxicity at up to 100 m shah et al 2010 mdl28170 also known as calpain inhibitor-iii or z-val-phe-cho was first reported in 2005 simmons et al 2005 it inhibited the infection of sars-cov pseudovirus at ic95 of 20 mdetailed catl inhibition efficacy information is only available from three of the seven compounds listed in table 2 mdl28170 was selected from a library of pharmacologically active compounds it showed potent catl inhibition at ic50 of 25 nm simmons et al 2005 oxocarbazate pubchem cid 23631927 originally selected from a catl assay in 2010 inhibits catl activity at ic50 around 69 nm and acts as a slow-on slow-off inhibitor shah et al 2010 ssaa09e1 was initially reported in 2013 to inhibit catl activity with an ic50 of 533  061 m adedeji et al 2013 results showed that oxocarbazate had a similar inhibitory potency to mdl28170 but 1000-fold more potent than ssaa09e1 although no specific ic value was obtained from k11777 it was considered the most potent catl inhibitor among the screened protease inhibitors zhou et al 2015 the other 3 compounds dec-rvkr-cmk est and 5705213 were also selected from validated catl inhibitors but their specific potencies remained incompletely reported
2 catl inhibitor drug candidates
the pharmacological details in table 2 identify k11777 and oxocarbazate as the most attractive candidates for anti-coronavirus drugs the available potency and safety assays identify catl inhibitor k11777 as an efficacious drug candidate human pre-clinical trials are underway for k11777 as a potential treatment for patients with chagas disease chaparro et al 2018 and the dose ranging and safety data from these trials may greatly shorten the preclinical and drug safety test time towards a novel therapeutic agent for covid-19 patients however k11777 is an irreversible covalent inhibitor of catl and this irreversibility often entails unacceptable toxicity in contrast oxocarbazate is a reversible inhibitor of catl and acts at a low concentration shah et al 2010 which meets the requirement for a potent selective and low toxicity candidate for human use detailed assays of oxocarbazates activity against sars-cov-2 and relevant animal experiments should be conducted urgently
fda-approved drugs targeting catl in coronavirus infection
although several potential therapeutic catl inhibitor candidates exist to date such as k11777 and oxocarbazate the ubiquitous expression of catl raises concern for unwanted adverse effects of catl inhibition therefore we examined the inventory of the united states food and drug administration fda-approved drugs that may be effective in treating sars-cov-2 infections and listed ten currently fda-approved drugs that exhibit catl inhibitiory activity in table 3
 in which we sorted the list of drugs by type including antimicrobial antimalarial immunomodulatory agents and others these already approved drugs may be redeployed to treat sars-cov-2 infection
1 antimicrobial drugs
several antimicrobial drugs inhibit catl activity in human cells furthermore these antimicrobial drugs can be classified as antibiotics teicoplanin anti-tuberculous drugs rifampicin anti-leprosy clofazimine and anti-hiv agents saquinavir glycopeptide drugs such as teicoplanin can potently inhibit catl activity in a dose-dependent manner zhou et al 2016 these drugs are usually used in the clinic to treat gram-positive bacteria especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus s aureus mrsa and s pneumoniae with low toxicity and relatively low safety concern bacterial superinfection commonly complicates viral pneumonitis particularly in patients who require endotracheal intubation chertow  memoli 2013 rice et al 2012 the teicoplanin family glycopeptide antibiotics merit particular consideration in this situation due to their anti-catl activity notably glycopeptide drugs such as teicoplanin can inhibit the infection of ebola mers sars and sars-cov-2 viruses by inhibiting catl zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2016 a recent study from china published in biorxiv suggested that teicoplanin can block sars-cov-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner in a549 cells hek293 t cells and huh7 cells zhang et al 2020 these encouraging findings support our hypothesis that targeting catl can treat sars-cov-2 infection rifampicin and clofazimine inhibited catl competitively or non-competitively respectively kamboj et al 2003 saquinavir prevented vascular damage by inhibiting catl activity cai et al 2017
2 antimalarial drugs
the antimalarial drug chloroquine can efectively block sars-cov-2 infection in cultured cells wang et al 2020a this drug inhibits lysosomal cathepsins nonspecifically by increasing endosomal ph tang et al 2018 shivanna kim  chang 2014 wang et al 2020a chloroquine also affects the cdpcux transcription factor at neutral ph indicating that it can directly affect protease synthesis goulet et al 2004 although chloroquine could have short-term benefit to covid-19 patients by inhibiting catl activity it remains unproven and can predispose to cardiac arrhythmia tonnesmann kandolf  lewalter 2013 non-selective inhibition of endosomal proteases including cathepsins may cause unwanted effects in patients as we will discuss further
3 immunomodulatory drugs
some immunomodulatory drugs have a proven role in inhibiting catl dexamethasone inhibits catl in muscle cells astaxanthin a potential immunomodulatory antioxidant agent can suppress catl activity in both syrian hamster embryo cells and muscle cells shibaguchi et al 2016 many individuals with advanced sars-cov-2 infection have cytokine storm often a harbinger of fatal outcome this uncontrolled elevation of cytokines can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ system failures chertow  memoli 2013 rice et al 2012 in survivors the long-term consequences of cytokine storm may lead to pulmonary fibrosis causing functional disability and reduction in quality of life chertow  memoli 2013 rice et al 2012 interrupting of this exaggerated inflammatory response should be a priority to this end trials discussed in table 1 are evaluating anti-cytokine therapy glucocorticoids and interferon- treatment for covid-19-infected patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome ards and cytokine storm
4 others
clenbuterol and heparin weakly inhibit catl and may have adjunctive value in the certain situations in covid-19 disease pneumonia can induce bronchospasm goncalves et al 2012 higgins fox kowalski nielsen  worrall 2010 clenbuterol an inhaled selective 2-adrenergic agonist can limit catl mrna levels goncalves et al 2012 covid-19 patients have a high risk of deep vein thrombosis and those in need of anticoagulant therapy heparin merits consideration as it may accelerate catl inhibition by serpins higgins et al 2010 although not us fda-approved some chinese medicine extracts can also inhibit catl activity and broadly used among patients mol736 also called aurantiamide acetate that inhibits catl activity may relieve cough and reduce sputum production wang et al 2007 the water and ethanol extracts of drynariae rhizoma also showed significant catl inhibitory activities jeong et al 2004 numerous clinical trials underway will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of these traditional chinese medicines on covid-19 table 1 those preparations that exhibit catl inhibitory properties may have particular potential as drug candidates for covid-19
protease inhibitor cocktail therapy for covid-19
development and validation of a therapy for covid-19 presents a major and imminent challenge to society and medicine although several drugs show efficacy in inhibiting sars-cov-2 replication or infectious activity in vitro clinical trials will require many months compassionate use of remdesivir in the first confirmed case in the united states and a recent study of 53 patients showed possible efficacy grein et al 2020 holshue et al 2020 but the clinical effectiveness and safety of such agents requires validation in rigorous controlled clinical trialsin 2013 bertram et al proved that catl-selective inhibitor mdl-28170 table 2 completely blocked the entry of hcov-229e when the same dose 10 m of mdl-28170 was used together with 1 m of tmprss2 inhibitor camostat mesylate equivalent or significantly more potent than the inhibitory activity from 100 m camostat mesylate alone depending on the host cell types bertram et al 2013 suggesting a synergic role of catl and tmprss2 in cellular penetration of coronavirus hcov-229e fig 3a a recent report tested the efficacy of tmprss2 inhibitor camostat mesylate in sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infection hoffman et al 2020 camostat mesylate reduced the entry of these viruses into host cells that express tmprss2 and the pan-cathepsin inhibitor e64d blocked virus entry independent of tmprss2 expression again combined use of e64d and camostat mesylate showed complete inhibition of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 entry into either tmprss2-positive or negative host cells hoffman et al 2020 although none of these studies used camostat mesylate combined with a catl inhibitor in studying specifically sars-cov-2 infection these prior findings provide encouragement with regard to covid-19 treatment first camostat mesylate has been successfully and safely used to treat patients with chronic pancreatitis in japan and a randomized controlled trial has recently been completed in the unites states ramsey nuttall hart  team 2019 use of these market drugs will help offset our potential side effect or toxicity concerns second sars-cov-2 infection not only infects the respiratory tract but also affects other organs in which not all cells express tmprss2 hoffman et al 2020 sungnak et al 2020 a protease inhibitor cocktail approach using camostat mesylate together with a catl inhibitor listed in table 2 or even a fda-approved catl inhibitory drug listed in table 3 might offer clinical improvement for covid-19 patients by not only preventing lung epithelial cell infection but also reducing the risks of sars-cov-2-induced damage in other cell types and organs with even much lower doses for each inhibitor than using camostat mesylate or catl inhibitor alone
protease inhibitor cocktail versus chloroquine
while the combined use of tmprss2 inhibitor camostat mesylate and hydroxychloroquine has been included in two clinical trials nct04355052 nct04338906 catl inhibition should merit immediate consideration here we discuss the advantages of catl inhibitor and camostat mesylate dual therapy versus of camostat mesylate or catl inhibitor monotherapy and potential concerns of chloroquine treatment the known molecular and cellular mechanisms of each of these drugs will help interpret the observations for the upcoming clinical data from the 4 on-going camostat mesylate trials nct04355052 nct04338906 nct04353284 nct04321096 and 180 on-going chloroquine trials table 1 and underscore the rationale of our proposed tmprss2 and catl inhibitor cocktail therapy
1 three beneficial functions of dual protease inhibitor therapy
we propose three beneficial functions of catl inhibition in sars-cov-2 infections blocking the virus entry on the host cell surface together with tmprss2 serine protease inhibition eg camostat mesylate fig 3a blocking virus membrane fusion in the endosome essential for release of the virions genetic material and replication fig 3c-3e while not interfering with other essential protease activities of normal immune responses such as t-cell activation and anti-viral antibody production when endosomal catl activity in thymocytes and splenocytes is required for cd4 positive selection honey nakagawa peters  rudensky 2002 nakagawa et al 1998 cathepsin s cats is the major endosomal protease responsible for peripheral immune responses and antibody production beers et al 2005 riese et al 1996 shi et al 1999 the proposed dual protease inhibitor therapy could combat sars-cov-2 infections not only at the entry point on the plasma membrane of the host cells but also in the endosome serial steps in viral pathogenesis in addition to preserving adaptive immunity
2 chloroquine nonspecifically impairs epithelial cell immunity
recent rudimentary clinical evidence suggested the efficacy of antimalarial chloroquine and its analogs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate in covid-19 patients to date no registered clinical trial has supported this conjecture chloroquine affects ace2 terminal glycosylation vincent et al 2005 which affects by turn coronavirus host cell attachment this mechanism could contribute to the reported efficacy of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine phosphate in covid-19 patients fox 1993 yao et al 2020 a further mechanism of chloroquine relative to the catl function discussed here is its activity in raising endosomal ph al-bari 2017 thereby non-selectively inactivating all endosomal proteases including catl whose optimal activity requires an acidic environment by raising the endosomal ph chloroquine blocks the proteolysis of virus surface spike protein s1 subunit in the endosomes and reduces the viral genetic material release however increased endosomal ph could interfere with all endosomal proteases including cats and catl which process and present viral antigens to activate t cells and to enhance antibody production fig 4
 left side it is presently unknown whether covid-19 patients showed altered cytotoxic t-cell activity or anti-viral antibody titers after chloroquine treatment versus other therapies we hypothesize here that chloroquine and congeners could impair adaptive immune responses although detailed mechanisms remain unknown numerous cases of covid-19 patients have become viral positive and relapsed after hospital discharge shi et al 2020 this scenario could result from defective adaptive immunity in this regard catl inhibitors or the proposed protease inhibitor cocktail therapy could have advantages over chloroquine patients or cells treated with catl specific inhibitors with or without camostat mesylate unlike those treated with chloroquine should not display a reduction in the favorable activity of the other endosomal proteases these proteases including cats beers et al 2005 degrade viral proteins generate antigenic viral peptides and assist mhc class-1 and mhc class-ii antigenic peptide loading and presentation in the endosomes fig 4 right side therefore host cell mhc-i- and mhc-ii-mediated antigen presentation and cd8 and cd4 t-cell activations would remain unaffected earlier studies showed that catl or cats can mediate invariant chain proteolysis and antigen presentation in thymic and intestinal epithelial cells while cats cleaves invariant chain involved in antigen presentation by professional antigen presenting cells apcs beers et al 2005 nakagawa et al 1998 shi et al 1999 likewise bronchial and alveolar type-2 epithelial cells constitutively express mhc class-i and mhc class-ii molecules corbiera et al 2011 gereke jung buer  bruder 2009 wosen mukhopadhyay macaubas  mellins 2018 maintenance of endosomal protease activity in lung epithelial cells to maintain or enhance cytotoxic t-cell activity and antibody production may prove salutary during and after coronavirus infection in contrast chloroquine and its derivatives will raise the endosomal ph and inactivate all endosomal proteases including catl and cats chloroquines potential for limiting coronavirus infection might come at the cost of impairing the adaptive immune responses a mechanism by which these drugs may benefit autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus figueroa-parra gamboa-alonso de-leon-ibarra  galarza-delgado 2019 although lung epithelial cells are not the major cell type responsible for t-cell activation and antibody production chloroquine and congeners could mute the antigen processing and presentation functions in the endosome fig 4 left side
3 chloroquine nonspecifically impairs apc functions
professional apcs such as b cells and dendritic cells initiate specific cytotoxic t-cell activation and antibody production prior studies showed that coronavirus infection reduces the expression of mhc class-i and mhc class-ii molecules and associated molecules josset et al 2013 menachery et al 2018 thereby reducing anti-viral cytotoxic cd8 t-cell liu et al 2010 and cd4 t-cell activation yang et al 2009 chloroquine-mediated endosomal ph increase will result in apc loss-of-function because of endosomal protease inactivation fig 5
 left in contrast catl inhibitors eg teicoplanin and oxocarbazate will not affect the activities of cats and other endosomal proteases necessary for viral antigen processing and presentation in apcs therefore these agents unlike chloroquine will not affect the apc functions in cd4 and cd8 t-cell activation and anti-viral antibody production fig 5 rightas illustrated in fig 4 fig 5 catl inhibition either with its selective inhibitor or in a protease cocktail with the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate proposed in this manuscript might protect covid-19 patients from coronavirus infection without affecting the adaptive immunity this beneficial function of catl inhibition is implicated in three significant ways first catl inhibition blocks coronavirus surface spike protein s1 subunit cleavage on host cell surface as a mechanism to block coronavirus initial infection second catl inhibition blocks virus membrane fusion in host cell endosomes as a mechanism to block coronavirus replication third catl-selective inhibition leaves other endosome proteases active for coronavirus protein processing and antigen presentation in epithelial cells apcs and other non-professional apcs for t-cell activation and anti-viral antibody productionthe worldwide and severe covid-19 pandemic calls for treatments before and even after vaccines become available this article highlights the importance of catl in coronavirus infection particularly sars-cov-2 and proposes a hypothesis for treament of covid-19 by targeting catl activity this publication also aims to bring to light existing catl inhibitor compounds particularly fda-approved drugs that may potentiate treatments for the current covid-19 pandemic these fda-approved catl inhibitory drugs provide a covid-19 antiviral therapy that may be appropriate for patients depending on their current medical conditions especially for those newly exposed to the virus or who test positive for the virus but are asymptomatic when the early infection may be more clinically manageable therapeutic applications of catl inhibitors including some currently fda-approved employed alone or more preferably together with the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate may emerge from both basic and clinical studies to as proving value in covid-19 treatment as camostat mesylate has broad use among chronic pancreatitis patients and a number of drugs that can inhibit catl already have fda approvals we advocate testing of this protease inhibitor cocktail approach for management of covid-19 patients we also point out how chloroquine and analogs may impair the human adaptive immune system ability to fight virus infection in contrast the proposed protease inhibitor cocktail approach may both inhibit virus infection and activate adaptive immunity we advocate testing the combined inhibition of catl and the serine protease tmprss2 as a novel treatment for covid-19 patientsin the absence of clinical trials for our proposed dual protease inhibitor therapy we can merely speculate regarding its efficacy in covid-19 patients and cannot predict possible adverse effects of this approach as discussed catl inhibition may impair cd4 t-cell thymic selection honey et al 2002 nakagawa et al 1998 we recently showed that chronic use of cathepsin inhibitors may associate with tissue fibrosis fang deng benadjaoud yang  shi 2020 zhang et al 2019 pulmonary fibrosis during the healing of acute lung injury due to covid19 infection could be a concern these possible adverse effects may be avoided as cats is the major endosomal proteases that mediates antigen presentation and antibody production beers et al 2005 shi et al 1999 and short-term use of catl inhibitors for acute coronavirus infection should not affect tissue fibrosis appreciablycamostat mesylate from bio-japannet is relatively inexpensive 100100 mg tablets list at 3990 six pills a day for chronic pancreatitis treatment costs about 200 for patients with organ infections a maximum of 6001000 mg teicoplanin per day intramuscular administration rybak 1993 is recommended depending on creatinine clearance targocid from sanofi aventis is currently not used in the united states but widely in europe asia and south america it costs about 2200 each 400 mg for injection or oral dose based on ndrugscom or 4400 per day this article proposes urgent consideration of collaborators physicians covid-19 patients and medical centers to explore this promising possibility to fight for covid-19 and possible mutants that may develop

world populations are currently facing an unprecedented health crisis caused by the spread of an infectious virus the coronavirus-induced pneumonia known as the novel coronaviruses disease covid-19 which has seriously affected human health worldwide 1 patients infected with this virus suffer from potential damage to vital organs especially the lungs heart liver and kidney 2 3 furthermore this infection poses a considerable risk to patients due to the high frequency of pneumonia fever and dry cough 4at present a limited number of antiviral treatments are available to treat this infection most of which display very limited efficacy in combating covid-19 unfortunately newly emerging viruses rarely provide time for the development of potent and effective vaccines that can be rapidly implemented in therapeutic settings prior to covid-19 a number of infections have affected world populations including the plague pandemic of 1855 which started in china and spread into india 5 the spanish flu 19181920 which infected 500 million people around the world 6 the cholera pandemic 18171824 which spread across india 7 the swine flu 20092010 the anh1n1 and ah5n1 which caused significant mortality rates 8 the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-coronavirus sars-cov 2003 the middle east respiratory syndrome mers mers-cov 2012 9 and sars-cov2covid-19 2019 10 antivirals drugs are currently available for all of these viral families excluding covid-19 additionally many vaccines are often not affordable in developing countries and their production is hard to scale up in short times which further contributes to the severity of the pandemica few treatment trials have been conducted since the emergence of covid-19 in an effort to contain and restrain its effects with limited success so far for instance a recent trial chictr2000029308 investigating lopinavirritonavir showed no significant benefit for sars-cov-2 infection 11 earlier it was proven that transfusion of convalescent blood products cbp especially convalescent plasma transfusion cpt might be useful against a variety of pandemic outbreaks including influenza ebola virus sars mers by reducing the hospital stays and improving patient survival 12the latest pilot study on cp therapy shows a potential emergent therapeutic effect and low risk in covid-19 patients 13 as we know since covid-19 is a novel infectious disease scientists and doctors still lack the in-depth understanding of its mechanisms of transmission infection and action that would permit the development of effective vaccines or therapies to date not a single clinical intervention trial of cp in covid-19 has been completed highlighting the necessity for conducting thorough research and meta-analyses to uncover novel treatments that will allow disease control and prevention in order to palliate the lack of updated clinical trial reviews assessing the existing challenge and its potential clinical solutions we have endeavored to summarize all clinical trials of covid-19 patients treated with cp in an effort to provide updated evidence for the effectiveness and efficacy of this strategy in treating covid-19all registered clinical trials studies that were published from 1 january 2020 to 14 april 2020 were identified from chinese clinical trial registry chictr european union clinical trials database euctd clinicatrialgov pubmed national library of medicine nlm using the keywords cp and novel coronavirus 2019 cp and covid-19 comorbidities clinical manifestation immunotherapy vaccine and sars cov-2 eligible studies were extracted by electronic searching of databases and an additional search was performed using the international clinical trials registry platform who ictrp to identify ongoing trials the last analysis was executed on 14 april 2020two investigators selected the eligible studies independently inclusion criteria were 1 case-control with covid-19 patients 2 clinical trials with a cp protocol 3 published full-text with maximum detail on covid-19 therapy 4 any type of study design interventional and observational 5 studies involving the treatment of covid-19 with cp and 6 studies written in english were preferred exclusion criteria were 1 studies with duplicate data 2 studies with no specific control group and 3 unclear theoretical research and unregistered clinical trialsthe quality evaluation of all registered clinical studies and data extraction of each literature was critically appraised and discrepancy between investigators was resolved by dialogue all studies were tabulated and summarized narratively and grouped by the treatment strategy we categorized the table depending on trial numbers furthermore we classified results as type of study title of study sponsor recruitment status intervention age phase date enrollment study type country and the number of patients included in that studysearches were performed until 14 april 2020 using euctd chictr and nih clinical trailsgov and 25 registered clinical trials of covid-19 were retrieved with active and recruiting status subsequent screening of headings and abstracts allowed us to exclude withdrawn clinical trials overall 22 studies used cp alone one study used pc with combinations hydroxychloroquine azithromycin one trial used umbilical cord blood plasma and one investigation used igg antibody testing kit for clinical trials summaries of detailed studies were presented in table 1 most of the registered trials have cleared ethical statements some of the studies are still in the recruiting stage 10 trials have started to the recruitment of patients finally remaining trials showed an active status and it will start recruiting patients upcoming daysduring the pre-antibiotic era infectious diseases had high morbidity and mortality plasma antibody was developed against a variety of infectious diseases because there were no alternative therapeutic options plasma antibody uses a potential therapeutic strategy initially obtained from immune survivors of an infectious disease that was formally introduced in 1910 for poliomyelitis in animal model 14 subsequently plasma therapy was tested in human patients with acute poliomyelitis treated with cp from polio survivors and showed promising results 15 cp was later introduced as a primary drug against several infectious diseases including influenza pneumonia chicken pox measles and mums 16 17 transfusion of cp has been shown to reduce viral load serum cytokine response and mortality in severe h1n1 influenza patients 18 recently mair-jenkins et al have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of cp serum or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for the treatment of sars coronavirus infection severe influenza h1n1 h5n1 and ebola virus disease evd their results revealed that cp therapy significantly reduced mortality without causing any severe adverse effects 19 20the us food and drug administration fda have recently approved the use of plasma therapy from recovered covid-19 patients to treat critically ill patients as per fda recommendations the plasma must be collected from a donor who showed no symptoms for the last 14 days and had negative recent covid-19 results 21 22 the first pilot cp treatment study was conducted in three participating hospitals for 10 severe covid-19 patients using a single dose of 200 ml cp and revealed that patients significantly increased or maintained the neutralizing antibodies at a high level while clinical symptoms rapidly improved within 3 days 13 after covid-19 was declared a global pandemic many scientists suggested that cp could be used as a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate the infections symptoms 2325 a china-based study demonstrated that the inflammatory cytokine il-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill covid-19 patients indicating that the viral load was strongly associated with a cytokine storm and can be used to predict poor covid-19 prognosis 26 another case report study in five patients reported that maximal supportive care and administration of antiviral agents with cp transfusion neutralizing antibody titers 1640 could potentially improve clinical outcomes without severe adverse effects 27 furthermore zhang et al showed that after 11 days of cp infusion patients did not require mechanical ventilation and were moved to the general ward with better outcomes 28 additionally six more confirmed covid-19 patients showed better improvement after treatment with cp in wuhan china 29based on these preliminary results usa-based john hopkins university is currently leading a randomized trial phase 2 on 150 older participants undergoing cp treatment with a titer of neutralizing antibody  164 for post-exposure prevention 30 a mayo clinic-sponsored phase 2 trial investigating cp treatment with a titer  164 is also currently recruiting 31 another study analyzing results from 173 patients traced the dynamics of antibody responses during disease progression periodic antibody detection revealed that the appearance of antibodies was 40 among patients in the first week of covid-19 infection then rapidly increased to 100 ab 798 igg and 943 igm respectively since 2nd week after infection onset highlighting the importance of routine testing in the context of covid-19 infections 32 furthermore it was noticed that the average igg antibody level was higher in female patients than in male patients particularly in severe cases which could account for the differences in covid-19 outcomes between genders 33 previous studies on the duration of the serological response profile in patients infected with earlier strains of the sars coronavirus revealed that igm was still detectable after 7 months of postinfection hence a suitable donor could donate 200  3 times single dose of plasma during a period of 6 months 34 based on these findings many pharma companies such as israeli company kamada are collecting plasma in different facilities from people who have recovered from this viral disease 35 as the various results summarized in this section indicate cp administration seems to reduce viral load and is a safe treatment strategy with minimal side effects a cp collections workflow and protocol are presented in fig 1in this paper we have summarized the current registered clinical trials on cp initiated following the onset of the covid-19 pandemic outbreak despite the potential utility of cp treatments there have been few concerted efforts to use them as initial therapies against pandemic the main contraindications to cp therapy are an allergic reaction to plasma protein as in many other trials examining clinicalpathological symptoms observed during viral or bacterial infections thrombosis multiple organ failure as well as pregnant or lactation schedules are also contraindicationsthe advantages and disadvantages of human plasma therapies are often related to conventional antiviral drugs however abs are specific in their modes of action in diverse therapeutic classes anti-covid-19 plasma differs from regular human plasma only by the presence of antibodies against the coronavirus donor selection criteria are the same as outlined by fda guidelines therefore the risks to transfusion receivers are likely to be same as those of standard plasma therapyone of the major challenges and concerns with plasma therapies is ensuring the prevention of transfusiontransmitted infections tti recent pathogen inactivation pi technologies combined with nucleic acid testing nat of an individual donor may represent a good option to reduce the risk of additional ttis at present due to globalization regulatory systems may require further tests to ensure additional transfusion safety for instance one uk based study suggests that blood donors are not screened for hev infections although this infection is widespread in english populations in fact it was reported that after cp transfusion 10 recipients developed prolonged or persistent hepatitis e virus infection 36 although this does not preclude covid-19 with cp from being therapeutically utilized in the uk these risks should be considered in clinical trials at the individual patient levelthere are also some non-infectious risks linked with cpt such as allergic transfusion reactions and transfusion associated circulatory overload taco another major concern is transfusion-related acute lung injury trali an immune-mediated transfusion reaction that can cause severe complications or even death previous reports have shown that female donors with a history of pregnancy have higher risk of trali 37 38 trali is particularly challenging in patients presenting with severe covid-19 symptoms given the potential priming of the pulmonary endothelium male donors are the first choice to further decrease the risk of transfusing human leukocyte antigen hla antibody from parous women recent covid-19 data show that female patients display higher igg levels 39 in certain cases the presence of specific antibodies may account for antibody-dependent enhancement ade before this phenomenon is noticed for dengue virus 40 this virus-specific antibody enhancement could theoretically increase covid-19 virus entry in monocytes or macrophages cells and increase its severity in this context ade infection could pose major concerns during vaccination however the identification and characterization of viral epitopes are important before cpt for covid-19 41a recent study of six covid-19 patients with respiratory failure that received cpt after 215 days of first viral detection indicated that they all tested negative for covid-19 by 3 days after infusion and five died in due course these findings suggest that cp treatment may reduce covid-19 rna shedding but cannot decrease mortality rates in critical patients 42 deploying cp therapies against the covid-19 patients provides an unprecedented opportunity to perform clinical research and gather evidence of the effectiveness of this treatment against viral infection at present both academic researchers and industry groups have started to investigate the effectiveness and clinical usefulness of cp therapies for covid-19 if clinical trials results clearly establish the effectiveness and potential benefit of cp the usa and other countries that have exponential growth of coronavirus deaths may consider a national campaign to provide plasma treatment although a logistical challenge may be one an evidence-based approach to protect particularly high-risk populationsbased on the current study and available clinical trial results we unable to make a definitive conclusion on cpt as a treatment option for covid-19 due to some limitations first insufficient clinical trial evidence most of these trials are still ongoing and their result has not been published yet second it is unclear if patients would have improved with cp or other medication because at present it is not clear that the administration timing of cp after admission third whether cp treatment strategy would reduce mortality rates of covid-19 patients is still unknownplasma therapy from recovered covid-19 patients is anticipated to be safe and potentially useful for treatment based on the available data in the current situation covid-19 requires urgent development of effective treatment modalities the use of cp may be the first potential option to consider during this pandemic while antiviral drugs are being tested developing successful therapies will require the engagement and coordination of several different entities such as blood banking specialists virologists hematologists and other health care workers to ensure the proper interpretation of disease severity it also requires ethical statements and controlled hygiene to ensure optimal safety to both donors and recipients in the context of the public health emergency posed by covid-19 the fda has issued a special guidance 24 march 2020 on exploring the use of cp treatment against covid-19 the released guidelines introduce measures for assessing the safety and efficacy of cp in clinical trials to monitor the success rates of the therapy and evaluate its safety and suitability in the clinical setting as most countries are beginning to recover from the outbreak and ease lockdown measures we recommend that while the medical community still awaits the results of current randomized controlled trials of cp hospitals can nonetheless consider the emergency use of cp to treat critically ill covid-19 patients under the current challenging circumstances posed by the pandemicnot applicableall the authors have

knowledge gaps in the epidemiology transmission dynamics investigation tools and management of covid-19 khot and nadkar 2020 a specific drug or vaccine has not been approved to treat it hence covid-19 management is a major challenge for clinicians and researchers worldwidethe first clinical trial of covid-19 was registered on 23 january 2020 huang 2020 since then an increasing number of clinical trials of covid-19 have been registered using regimens based on traditional chinese medicine tcm and western medicine wm as of march 18 2020 585 protocols were searched from all the databases of international committee of medical journal editors icmje-accepted platforms of clinical-trial registriespreviously we found several problems regarding the protocols of clinical trials of covid-19 eg unclear study objectives heterogeneity of outcome choices and small sample size zhang et al 2020 that may reduce the value of clinical trials in the meantime clinicians understanding of covid-19 characteristics has been changing because they are treating many more patients than before the diagnosis and management plan of covid-19 also keeps changing we believe that certain inappropriate outcomes may be chosen by researchers to improve the consistency of outcomes and include more clinical trials in systematic reviews development of a core outcome set cos for covid-19 is cruciala cos is an agreed standardized set of outcomes that should be measured and reported as a minimum in all clinical trials in specific areas of health or healthcare comet when researchers report outcomes in a cos they can also report other outcomesthis cos was based on i a population with confirmed covid-19 cases of mild ordinary severe or critical types ii interventions that include tcm and wm and iii the cos being applied in randomized controlled trials rcts and observational studiesthis cos has been registered on the core outcome measures in effectiveness trials comet database shang and qiu 2020 this

spreading rapidly in china many clinicians have been trained to face emergencies irrespective of whether they are on the frontline of the battle against covid-19 more than 40000 clinicians and nurses from other areas of china moved to hubei province to support the local medical system not all of these clinicians and nurses were trained in respiratory medicine or critical care to obtain perspectives on a larger scale we used snowball sampling to extend the sample size we invited members from the clinical research information association of china and the information association for traditional chinese medicine and pharmacy to participate in the delphi survey we asked them to send the questionnaire to their colleagueswe believe that the perspectives of patients and the public are important hence we sent the questionnaire via social media wechat tencent to invite the public to participateto obtain patients perspectives frontline clinicians of dongzhimen hospital beijing university of chinese medicine beijing china invited and helped patients who consented to complete the questionnairethe stakeholders in the consensus meeting were tcm clinicians wm clinician nurse

criteria exclusion criteria study identification data extraction and rejectedcombined outcomes are described in the systematic review of protocols of clinical trials of covid-19 qiu et al 2020the questionnaire for professionals and the public was sent by smartphone it included individual outcomes in different outcome domains and scoring at the end of the questionnaire of the first round of delphi survey there were two open-ended questions i which outcomes do you think are important but were not included in the questionnaire ii what is your opinion of this questionnairethe questionnaire for patients was sent by smartphone too it included outcomesoutcome domains that were understood readily by patients patients were asked to vote on which outcomesoutcome domains were important to them there was one open-ended question which outcomes do you think are important but were not included in the questionnairethe questionnaire for professionals and the public employed a nine-point scoring system which has been used in previous cos studies qiu et al 2018 qiu et al 2019 a score of 13 denoted that the outcome was not important for inclusion in the cos 46 meant the outcome was important but not critical for inclusion in the cos 79 denoted that the outcome was critical for inclusion in the cos an outcome scored as 7 by 50 of participants for all stakeholders was removed from the next consensus process the outcomes recommended by participants were added in the second round of the delphi survey after discussion by the steering groupfor the delphi survey administered to professionals and the public the consensus definitions were i consensus in 70 of participants in all stakeholders scored the outcome as 79 and 15 of participants in all stakeholders scored the outcome as 13 ii consensus out 50 of participants in tcm experts and wm experts scored the outcome as 79 iii no consensus anything elsethe voice of patients should be considered hence for the patients survey the consensus definition was outcomes that were voted by 50 of patientsfor the consensus meeting the consensus definitions were i consensus in outcomes that were voted by 70 of participants ii consensus out outcomes that were voted by 70 of participantsthe consensus meeting was held by teleconference the contents of the consensus meeting covered i the reporting background and methods of the research ii reporting the results of the delphi survey of professionals and the public and the results of the patients questionnaire iii discussing the candidate outcomes and their instrumentsdefinitions and iv voting on the outcomes and reaching a consensusthe entire project is part of a clinical trial of covid-19 which was approved by the ethics committee of dongzhimen hospital dzmec-ky-2020-09 because of the special circumstances of the covid-19 pandemic participants who completed the questionnaire were assumed to have provided consent for their data to be usedwe had incentive measures to improve the response of the delphi survey randomized rewards after completing and submitting the questionnaire the time planned for round 1 of the delphi survey was from 4 march to 12 march 2020 as of march 9 2020 176 participants had completed the questionnaire after review 51 questionnaires were found to be invalid on march 8 and 9 2020 5 questionnaireday were completed and almost all of them were invalid most of the invalid questionnaires had been completed by the public within 5 min it was not possible for people who were unfamiliar with covid-19 to complete the questionnaire or who had chosen the same score for all outcomes after discussion with the steering group we decided to stop the delphi surveyfinally 125 valid questionnaires were evaluated the characteristics of participants in the round 1 of the delphi survey are shown in table 1 the number of outcomes that achieved consensus and no consensus in different stakeholders are shown in table 2 the list of outcomes is shown in supplement 1only 15 15125 12 participants were in hubei province however the internet protocol ip address that the electronic questionnaire obtained showed that 30 30125 24 participants were in hubei province only one person 1125 08 was from outside of china canada the regions of participants are shown in figure 1more than 20 participants provided outcomes or significant proposals for round 1 of the delphi survey after discussion with the steering group six of them were added to round 2 of the delphi survey there are some consensus out outcomes in different stakeholders but no consensus out outcomes by all of the stakeholders were noted so we did not delete any outcomes in the round 2 of delphi surveyaccording to the significant proposals from participants in round 1 of the delphi survey the steering group decided to add more personal information to reduce the risk of invalid questionnaires participants would receive a random reward if the completed questionnaire was considered to be valid participants were also asked if they agreed to be mentioned in the acknowledgements section when the research was published computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the hip were grouped as hip imaging there were 150 individual outcomes in round 2 of the delphi surveythe feedback from participants in round 1 of the delphi survey showed that scoring for some outcomes was difficult hence in round 2 of the delphi survey participants had the opportunity to choose unclear for any outcome that was difficult to determine the median score of each outcome from each stakeholder group was shown in round 2 of the delphi survey the steering group wanted more people to participate in the delphi survey hence the questionnaire was sent to potential participants irrespective of whether they completed round 1 of the delphi survey and they were asked to invite colleagues who might be interested in this research round 2 of the delphi survey was conducted from 11 to 13 march 2020a total of 110 questionnaires were completed but seven of them were invalid so 103 valid questionnaires were assessed the characteristics of participants in round 2 of the delphi survey are shown in table 3the ip address that the electronic questionnaire obtained showed that 28 28103 272 participants were in hubei province the regions of participants are shown in figure 2 the number of outcomes that achieved consensus and no consensus in different stakeholders are shown in table 4 the list of outcomes is shown in supplement 2after the results of round 2 of the delphi survey had been reviewed by the steering group outcomes that achieved consensus out by tcm experts and wm experts were excluded outcomes that achieved consensus in from stakeholders were grouped and presented according to the classification of disease and interventions they were presented to consensus-meeting participants with no consensus outcomes before the consensus meeting was heldresults suggested that nurses and the public may find it difficult to score outcomes because they may misunderstand the terminology hence we developed a simple questionnaire with understandable language for patients there were 43 outcomesoutcome domains in the questionnaire the list of outcomes is in supplement 3 patients were recruited by frontline clinicians in our team on 12 and 13 march 2020 finally 10 cured patients agreed to participate in the survey they were asked to choose which outcomes were important to them the characteristics of patients are shown in table 5 more than 50 of patients care about outcomes of pulmonary imaging lung function respiratory symptoms such as cough and dyspnea fever sars-cov-2 nucleic acid tests recovery and mental statethe consensus meeting was held on 18 march 2020 and was a video conference six frontline clinicians one from a wm hospital and five from tcm hospitals as well as one frontline nurse one methodologist and one researcher who participated in the design of clinical trials of covid-19 were invited to attend the consensus meeting the participants were from shanghai one beijing five tianjin two and guizhou one and all were voting participants all clinicians and nurses had worked in hubei province after the covid-19 outbreak two additional participants one coordinator and one staff member from the chinese clinical trial registry attended the meeting but did not participate in the discussion or votingafter reporting the results of the delphi survey and patients survey participants discussed some outcomes they believed shouldshould not be measured in clinical trials after discussion voting participants were invited to vote on which outcomes should be included in the cos of covid-19 the outcomes voted by 70 of participants were included in the cos the voting results are shown in supplement 4 the cos of covid-19 is shown in table 6this cos was conducted rapidly and rigorously to report on an emergency in a specific environment it can be used for any type of disease intervention and design there is a specific outcome for tcm clinical trials clinical symptom score researchers can measure the clinical symptom score according to different tcm syndromes for some individuals there are several measurements because there is no evidence to show which measurement is the best one we hope researchers of clinical trials can use this cos to reduce heterogeneity in outcome reporting furthermore our cos may help decision-makers to approve new agents for covid-19 if researchers report important outcomes however researchers can report other outcomes according to the purpose of their researchour study had four main limitations first due to the highly infectious nature of sars-cov-2 patients and the public did not participate in the design or development of the preliminary list of outcomes but they participated in the process of delphi survey second the preliminary list of outcomes was developed from protocols of clinical trials when there were knowledge gaps in the prevalence therapy prognosis and clinical characteristics of covid-19 with the research progression new important outcomes may be reported hence the cos must be updated in the future third the number of patients was small and all of them were from hubei province so their perspectives may not reflect those of other regions in china or overseas fourth almost all stakeholders were from china though one participant in round 1 of the delphi survey was from canada hisher opinion reflected a chinese perspective because the questionnaire was written in chinesethe data is from public databases and does not include identifiable patient data all of the primary data was searched from different registry databases before it was analyzed and the results

 however many clinical trials about coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 are undergoing to find effective treatment in china which has not been reportedon 15 march 2020 we used novel coronavirus or coronavirus disease 2019 or covid19 in chinese language to search in the chinese clinical trial registry database without time limitation httpwwwchictrorgcnindexaspx we analyzed these records according to the date geographical distribution the objective of study study type and design and sample size to reveal the current situation of the clinical trials about covid19 in china434 registered clinical trials about covid19 were enrolled the first record was from wuhan jinyintan hospital on jan 23 where has been the core battlefield to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 in the early stage it was a randomized openlabel blankcontrolled trial for the efficacy and safety of lopinavirritonavir and interferonalpha 2b in hospitalization patients with covid19 two thirds of the total records occurred from feb 12 to mar 3 with a mean speed of 12  4 records per day figure 1a the number of the registered records trended to decrease since 4 march a total of 130 49 37 and 35 records located in hubei guangdong shanghai and sichuan respectively turning to be the top four provinces figure 1b furthermore the top five cities belonged to wuhan shanghai beijing chengdu and guangzhou with the records of 117 37 32 31 and 29 respectivelywe unfolded the objectives of trials according to cell therapy 19 records biological therapy 34 records western medicine 71 records chinese medicine 99 records and others 211 records mesenchymal stem cells mscs were the most popular seed cells with 14 records followed by nk cells and mononuclear cells with 3 and 2 records respectively as for the biological therapy 16 clinical trials focused on anticytokine storm occurring in severe patients like recombinant interferons recommended by the national health commission of china antitumor necrosis factor antiinterleukin6 and antigmcsf seven clinical trials were going to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antisarscov2 inactivated convalescent plasma in the treatment of patients with covid19 of the 71 records related to the western medicine remdesivir captured the publics attention very much

 the other antiviral medications involved phosphoric chloroquine 23 records and lopinavirritonavir 17 records which were also clinically used in the treatment now many kinds of chinese traditional medicine or methods were under evaluation the others were mainly about mental health of the patients doctors nurses college students the public and the other kinds of diagnosis methods like the lung ultrasound none of specific vaccines are in the clinical trial stageas for the study type 221 of the 434 records belonged to the interventional research 121 clinical trials were observational studies 18 trials aimed to the diagnostic tests researchers were exploring several kinds of diagnostic methods including new highthroughout detection of sarscov2 nucleic acid 4 records plasma immunoglobulin mimmunoglobulin g detecting 3 records chest computed tomography imaging 3 records lung ultrasound 2 records sputum or throat swab sample collecting 2 records screening of peripheral blood biomarkers 2 records screening of micrornas as early diagnostic markers of covid19 viral infection 1 record and magnetic resonance imaging for myocardial damage diagnosis 1 record the top four kinds of study design were parallel sequential design nonrandomized control and single arm with the number of 168 110 31 and 27 records respectively the sum of the samples of all clinical trials about covid19 was 254635 however despite 202842 objects without covid19 themselves 51 793 patients with covid19 will be enrolled into the related 327 clinical trialswe also used 2019ncov or sarscov2 or novel coronavirus or coronavirus disease 2019 or covid19 in english language to search in the httpclinicaltrialsgov 94 records were obtained and most of them are the same as those registered in the chinese clinical trial registry database 16 records were from out of china mainland namely france 5 records united states 3 records namely 2 for remdesivir and 1 for vaccinemrna1273 south korea 3 records namely 2 for remdesivir and 1 for lopinavirritonavir hong kong 2 records thailand 1 record and italy 1 recordthe chinese doctors and researchers showed great power to respond to an urgent health problem by setting 434 clinical trials in 52 days however a strict designed protocol is a guarantee for the believable result especially for the parallel randomized trials of the 221 interventional trials only 19 trials 85 have a good designed protocol according to the standard protocol items recommendations for interventional trials
3
 compared with the trials set outside of china mainland another problem is that 551 of the 434 trials did not claim to use the right data management system including a paper case record form and an electronic data capture meanwhile a big concern occurs that is 10 817 patients are receiving treatments in hospital and only few new cases are diagnosed nowadays figure 1c while 51 793 patients with covid19 are needed in the trials further analysis showed that 209 trials were recruiting 201 trials were not yet recruiting 13 trials were suspended because of lack of patients and only 11 were completed none of the completed trials belonged to interventional study the possible solution is to integrate the similar trials and meanwhile select some trials of top priority considering to the pathogenic mechanism of sarscov2

 we deemed carefully that the antisarscov2 inactivated convalescent plasma mscs transplantation
6
 remdesivir and tocilizumab
7
 are the most four promising alternatives currently in the treatment of the patients with covid19 especially for the severe and critically severe types furthermore we have primarily demonstrated that transplantation of ace2 mscs improves the outcome of patients with covid19 pneumonia by revering the lymphocyte patten and regulate the cytokine storm

research and development program of china 2016yfa0101000 2018yfe0114200since its identification in china in late 2019 the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly with all countries and territories reporting cases by april 20201 although knowledge of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemics true epidemiology has been constrained by the limited availability of testing and surveillance as of 4 june 2020 over 6 million cases had been confirmed around the world with over 380 000 deaths2the impact of the pandemic as well as uncertainty regarding its future course has unleashed a wave of biomedical research to identify safe and effective treatments for covid-19 while new molecular entities are under investigation many therapies previously approved by regulators for the treatment of other diseases are also being evaluated for repurposing for viral suppression or for lessening the inflammatory consequences of infection3 there is also interest in assessing the use of convalescent plasma to treat covid-194both media5 and industry6 7 reports have characterised products being assessed for therapeutic activity against covid-19 we sought to complement these with a rigorous appraisal of early efforts around the world to identify safe and efficacious treatments to address the pandemic in addition to identifying investigational therapies we also characterised the sponsorship critical design elements and specified outcomes of each registered clinical trial while our analysis represents an early snapshot of a continually evolving area it nevertheless provides timely and globally important information for researchers policy makers and the general publicwe used information from the whos clinical trials registry network and clinicaltrialsgov clinicaltrialsgov is a registry of public and privately funded clinical trials conducted around the world maintained by the us national library of medicine on behalf of the national institutes of medicine the who registry network includes clinical trials from countries including australia brazil china south korea india cuba european union germany iran japan lebanon thailand netherlands pan africa peru sri lanka and the uk each participating country sends their data to the international clinical trials registry platform ictrp maintained by the who8 both the who registry9 and clinicaltrialsgov10 require that registered trials meet specific criteria for content quality and validity accessibility unique identification technical capacity and administration and requirements of the international committee of medical journal editorswe downloaded all covid-19 trials provided by the who in a microsoft excel spreadsheet11 the who curated all covid-19 trials published on the ictrp database in an excel file therefore no search strategy was applied to the ictrp database we also performed a manual search of each of the whos 17 network registries such as eu clinical trials register to identify additional trials yielding 21 additional studies we combined these data with information from the clincialtrialsgov registry12 all searches were last updated on 26 march 2020 to identify trials registered in the usa we searched the clinicaltrialsgov registry for trials related to the 2019 novel coronavirus using keywords coronavirus or covid-19 or covid19 or 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov or sars-cov-2 online supplementary etable 1 in order to assess whether there were omitted trials we also searched major medical journals such as lancet new england journal of medicine and jama and websites from the who us centers for disease control and prevention and media aggregators these searches did not reveal any additional trials to be included in the analysisfor each product that was approved by regulators we searched for information from the european medicines agency ema13 and us food and drug administration fda14 describing mechanisms of action and approved indications we searched the pharmaceutical manufacturers websites and other online sources for information about drugs that were not approved in the european union or the usawe included all studies conducted on patients diagnosed with covid-19 first we selected interventional clinical trials based on the study type variable online supplementary efigure 1 this variable contains values such as interventional trials observational studies expanded access diagnostic test basic science prevention prognosis epidemiological research health services research and screening interventional studies are studies that prospectively assign human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes15 16 to be inclusive of all trials on drugs and plasma we did not limit our inclusion criteria to randomised trials second we included studies where drugs or plasma was the primary intervention since there was not standardised information about the components of each intervention two individuals km mt or hm independently reviewed each interventional study to identify any trials of a drug or plasma any disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer gca because study focus was on evaluating drugs or plasma treatments we excluded trials of stem cell transplants devices diagnostic tests traditional chinese medicinesherbal medicine rehabilitation dietary supplements and psychological interventions we did not limit any studies based on the outcomes they evaluated we also excluded one trial with implausible information regarding its study design a single-arm randomised controlled trialwe extracted the following information from each trial unique trial number trial registry source who network registry country or the usa registration date recruitment status recruiting not yet recruiting withdrawn or cancelled recruitment country phase 0 1 2 3 4 12 23 not applicable and missing anticipated enrolment lead sponsor allocation status randomised or non-randomised intervention model single arm parallel cross-over factorial platform trial or sequential blinding open single double triple or quadruple primary outcome surrogatebiomarker clinical scale and clinical outcome and a website address trials that reported recruitment status of completed active or enrolling by invitation were grouped as recruiting we used the country address of each facility ie a site that can potentially enrol participants to identify recruitment countries enrolment number reflects the estimated total number of participants to be enrolled or the actual total number of participants enrolledwe used the primary sponsor and collaborators fields from the us registry and primary and secondary sponsor fields from the who registry to identify the probable lead sponsor we classified sponsorship as follows 1 the lead sponsor was considered to be a pharmaceutical company if the primary sponsor was a pharmaceutical company or a known funding body like the national institutes of health was neither a primary sponsor or collaboratorssecondary sponsor and at least one collaborator was a pharmaceutical company 2 the lead sponsor was a known government research funding agency if identified as such or at least one collaborator was this funder 3 the lead sponsor was a hospital if so stated 4 all others were classifies as other for some trials the study design or blinding was unclear in such cases two reviewers hm and se independently reviewed the registry record in detail and extracted the information if after in-depth review study design was still unclear n37 we used the following rules to assign intervention model and blinding 1 trials with a single group were considered as non-randomised and open-label17 2 trials that reported more than one group were considered having a parallel group design and 3 trials were considered open label if blinding was not reported and could not be inferred we grouped parallel cross-over factorial platform and sequential intervention trials as multiarm 2 trial armstwo reviewers hm and tm independently reviewed primary outcomes of all trials and assigned them as surrogate or biomarker clinical scale or clinical outcomes surrogate or biomarker included any measure of sars-cov-2 or any blood test clinical scales included measures of oxygenation sequential organ failure assessment score national early warning score 2 score lung injury score or any measure of pulmonary harms and clinical outcomes included symptoms clinical improvement scores intubation hospitalisation or death reviewer disagreement was resolved by discussion and consensuswe identified drugs under investigation for covid-19 from the experimental andor control arm of each trial including multiple drugs when they were studied in combination because the trial registries did not record drugs in a standardised format two pharmacist reviewers hm and ss independently extracted this information converting brand names were scientific names and correcting minor spelling errors we used the whos anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system to classify drugs in major therapeutic or pharmacological subgroups for the 18 drugs eg remdesivir that were not included in the whos atc algorithms we used product information from the ema us fda or the companies websites to characterise the productwe used descriptive statistics to analyse the extracted data we summarised the characteristics of all included trials using frequency and percentages we listed unique drugs under investigation and the number of registered clinical trials for each product we plotted the number of cumulative trials by their registration date all data were extracted and stored in an open-access google sheet document httpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1p229olyi7ft6mclyxds4-dkkszjnaisnlrvo68olk8edituspsharing we used sas v9 for all analyseswhile we did not directly involve patients in the design or conduct of our investigation our analyses were motivated by a belief that it is important for patients and the general public to have accessible high-quality information regarding the structure and outcomes of clinical trials assessing therapeutics targeting covid-19overall 201 clinical trials were registered for testing the therapeutic benefits of 92 drugs or plasma including 64 in monotherapy and 28 different combinations table 1 although the trials were initiated in more than 17 countries or regions 100 498 were registered in china and 78 378 were in the usa of

21 antiviralinterferon combinationour analysis was limited to a cross-sectional review of trials registered early in the pandemic with one-half the studies registered in the previous month many of these studies appeared to be exploratory and not explicitly powered to test a specific drug effect on a prespecified primary endpoint in addition our assessment was limited to drugs and plasma rather than other treatment modalities under investigation we did not include trials from health canadas clinical trials database because this database does not provide relevant details on trial characteristics however if trials are reported in us or who database they are included in our study we did not apply standard protocol items recommendations for interventional trials guideline to evaluate overall quality of clinical trials protocol future research can evaluate quality of clinical trials for covid-19 finally our analysis is only as good as the data that it is based on the ictrp gathers information from more than a dozen contributing countries and despite its value there remain opportunities to improve the consistency and quality of submitted data from both this platform22 and clinicaltrialsgov23the global pandemic has galvanised the worlds research community and there are signs of remarkable scientific activity24 in this review of clinical trials registered early in course of the pandemics first wave we found evidence of rapid clinical investigation of existing antivirals antimalarials immunosuppressants and oncology treatments for repurposing against covid-19 despite this many registered trials lack features to optimise their scientific value global coordination and increased funding of high-quality research may help to maximise scientific progress in rapidly discovering safe and effective treatmentsviral respiratory infections such as influenza and measles which can cause severe acute respiratory symptoms have been responsible for many epidemics in the spring of 2003 an outbreak of severe acute respiratory infection sari spread globally123 the world health organization who coined the acronym sars severe acute respiratory syndrome for this sari and subsequently named the causative coronavirus sars-cov in the summer of 2012 another sari broke out in saudi arabia which was found to be caused by a new coronavirus the who named this respiratory disease middle east respiratory syndrome also known by the acronym mers and called the causative coronavirus mers-cov in the winter of 2019 another sari outbreak occurred in wuhan china which very quickly spread around the world the culprit was identified as another novel coronavirus which the who named as sars-cov-2 due to similarities to sars-cov and the disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 sars-cov-2 is a newly emergent coronavirus closely related to sars and mers4 covid-19 is a respiratory tract infection that causes mild symptoms in the majority of cases but can also lead to mortality and morbidity current reports suggest that covid-19 causes milder symptoms in children including fever and cough but co-infection has also been observed45 however covid-19 is associated with severe outcomes in the older population immunocompromised patients and those with chronic cardiovascular or respiratory conditions4at present no pharmaceutical products have been shown to be reliable safe and effective for treating covid-196 in the midst of the current global pandemic many research groups around the world are actively developing treatments against this disease to reduce morbidities and mortalities in the long term the goal is to develop a vaccine to prevent further infections and future outbreaks however an effective vaccine may take years to develop and to manufacture on a global scale furthermore it is unknown if newborns and patients already recovered from covid-19 will need to be vaccinated it is also uncertain if such a vaccine can protect individuals from this novel coronavirus in the future in this narrative review we summarise the latest body of evidence and ongoing research on the development of pharmacological therapies for covid-19 the aim is also to review the suggested pathophysiology prophylactic treatments and therapeutic modalities for covid-19articles were retrieved using pubmed clinical queries with the search term coronavirus covid-19 regardless of the date of publication there were 88 articles under clinical study categories category therapy scope broad and 11 systematic reviews the discussion is based on but not limited to these search resultssevere acute respiratory syndrome is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by sars-cov the sars outbreak between november 2002 and july 2003 resulted in 8098 cases and 774 deaths in 29 countries around the world giving a case-fatality rate of 9678 treatments for sars during the outbreak were mainly supportive as there were no known effective antiviral agents the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections was the main treatment regimen9 ribavirin a broad-spectrum purine nucleoside analogue was empirically used as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent10 human immunodeficiency virus hiv protease inhibitor lopinavirritonavir were also used as it was found to have weak in vitro antiviral activity on the prototype sars-cov1011 other therapies included immunomodulators eg corticosteroid convalescent plasma and pentaglobulin interferons and traditional chinese medicine tcm912 the development of vaccines was underway by the end of the epidemic but no effective vaccine has since emergedmiddle east respiratory syndrome caused by mers-cov may have been transmitted to humans through infected camels the mers outbreak between september 2012 and january 2020 was reported to have caused 2519 laboratory-confirmed cases and 858 associated deaths globally giving a case-fatality rate of 34413 as of 2019 there is still no effective vaccine or treatment for this disease although a number of antiviral medications have been investigated14 a 2019 systematic review of therapeutic agents against mers-cov showed that there is still no general consensus on the optimal treatment strategy for mers-cov infection15 the miracle trial mers-cov infection treated with a combination of lopinavirritonavir and interferon-1b was the first randomised controlled trial to assess the feasibility efficacy and safety of a combination of lopinavirritonavir and interferon-1b in hospitalised patients with mers1617 the trial was started in july 2016 and enrolled 194 participants although results have yet to be published1617 at present only three potential mers-cov vaccine candidates have progressed to phase i clinical trials it is very likely that no mers vaccine will be available in the near future18the recent covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-219 is suggested to have originated in bats and transmitted to humans via an unknown intermediate host possibly pangolins2021 sars-cov-2 first emerged in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 after a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes was reported the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan quickly spread around the world within a very short period of time there are 55 million confirmed cases of covid-19 and 347587 covid-19 related deaths worldwide up to 27 may 2020 giving a crude case-fatality rate of approximately 722 supportive treatment is the mainstay of management as no antiviral therapy has been clinically proven to be effective against sars-cov-2 and no standard pharmacological treatment guidelines have been recommended by who4sars-cov mers and sars-cov-2 are all zoonotic -coronaviruses that have crossed from animals to humans23 the origin of sars-cov is still a mystery and remains a controversial topic sars-cov is closely related to civet and bat covs but it is phylogenetically divergent from other coronaviruses associated with human infections including oc43 nl63 229e and hku19 the full-length genome sequence of sars-cov-2 shows that it is similar to sars-cov sharing 796 sequence identity24 both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov use the same cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme ii ace2 receptor to enter into host cells24the pathophysiology of covid-19 has yet to be confirmed but it is likely to involve inflammatory processes that can trigger a massive cytokine storm the cytokine profile of critically ill patients revealed increased levels of interleukin il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor interferon- inducible protein 10 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1- and tumour necrosis factor-25 histopathological examination of the lungs of patients with covid-19 revealed immunopathological changes including diffuse alveolar damage desquamation of pneumocytes pulmonary oedema hyaline membrane formation and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates26 according to the limited number of reports of biopsyautopsy results of patients with covid-19 the pathological features resemble those seen in sars and mers virus infections2628the similarities between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 suggest that the development of potential prophylactics and therapeutics for covid-19 could be based on research on sars312192932 an important strategy would be to possibly control the viral replication using an effective antiviral agent to minimise the subsequent inflammation and tissue damage due to high viral loads immunomodulators could play a rescue therapy role as pathological findings suggest that there is immunopathological damage926 although the sars-cov-2 s protein receptor-binding domain has higher affinity than the sars-cov s protein receptor-binding domain development of vaccines against sars-cov-2 could still be based on research on sars-cov3335the majority of covid-19 patients especially children are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and will likely recover by managing their own symptoms without the need for hospitalisation36 according to the report by the who-china joint mission on coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 out of 55924 patients in china with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 only 138 had severe symptoms including dyspnoea respiratory frequency 30minute blood oxygen saturation 93 pao2fio2 ratio 300 andor infiltrates 50 of the lung field within 2448 hours whereas 61 were critical including respiratory failure septic shock and multiple organ dysfunctionfailure37 at present there is no proven effective therapy against sars-cov-2 however patients who are severely or critically ill might consider experimental therapies at the time of writing there are 1135 registered covid-19 clinical trials of which 657 are intervention studies using new therapies but only about 260 trials are beyond phase i38 the who has also launched the solidarity international clinical trial which is investigating effective treatments and is currently comparing four of the most promising treatment options remdesivir lopinavirritonavir lopinavirritonavir plus interferon -1a and hydroxychloroquine39 over 90 countries have joined the solidarity international clinical trial39 in the following discussion we summarise the latest evidence and research progress from the literature with focus on pharmacological therapies table 1empirical antimicrobials should be started within 1 hour after the detection of sepsis based on clinical diagnosis and local epidemiology4 for critically ill covid-19 patients intensive care treatment can include oxygen therapy noninvasive mechanical ventilation invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation40 in addition to the standard management for acute respiratory distress syndrome the literature also suggests lower intubation threshold early prone positioning and cautious fluid status management considering that the incidence of myocardial dysfunction in covid-19 patients is high41 further discussion on the intensive care management of covid-19 patients is beyond the scope of this reviewremdesivir gs-5734 is a nucleoside analogue prodrug that inhibits viral rna polymerases and was developed by gilead science in response to the ebola outbreak in 20174244 it is considered to be one of the most promising broad-spectrum antivirals for treating covid-19 in vitro antiviral activities of remdesivir have been demonstrated in sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-24546 in early april a preliminary report describing the clinical outcomes of a cohort of 53 hospitalised covid-19 patients who received remdesivir 68 of patients showed improvement of their oxygen-support status but 60 of patients reported adverse events during follow-up42 subsequently a double-blinded randomised controlled trial in 237 adult patients with severe covid-19 showed that remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits whilst adverse events were reported in 66 of patients47 separately the results of an interim analysis of the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial involving 1063 patients are more encouraging as it indicated that patients who received redmesivir had a 31 faster time to recovery than those who received placebo median time to recovery was 11 versus 15 days48 more recently a phase 3 simple clinical trial demonstrated that patients receiving a 5-day and 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvements in clinical status49 common adverse events reported in the preliminary studies included elevated hepatic enzymes diarrhoea constipation hypoalbuminaemia rash renal impairment anaemia thrombocytopenia and hypotension4247 potential drugdrug interactions with other medications metabolised through the cytochrome p450 system were also reported the safety profile of this drug needs to be further evaluated randomised controlled trials on remdesivir are still ongoing and two studies are in phase iii of clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir5053lopinavirritonavir is a combination therapy used to treat hiv ritonavir is an inhibitor of cytochrome p450 and is used to increase the plasma half-life of lopinavir54 lopinavir is a protease inhibitor that has been demonstrated to have antiviral effects against sars mers-cov and sars-cov-2 in vitro5455 several trials have been investigating the efficacy of lopinavirritonavir compared with other drugs as a treatment for covid-19395658 nevertheless the results so far indicate that lopinavirritonavir treatment has little benefit as a standalone therapy against sars-cov-2 infection in a clinical trial involving 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection lopinavirritonavir treatment was not associated with any clinical improvements compared with standard care54 furthermore lopinavirritonavir treatment caused gastrointestinal adverse events and nearly 14 of the recipients could not complete the full 14-day course of treatment54 other adverse effects included gastrointestinal intolerance hepatotoxicity pancreatitis and qt prolongation the use of ritonavir can cause severe drugdrug interactions in medications metabolised through the cytochrome system the tolerance of the side effects might limit the dosage needed as the concentration necessary to inhibit viral replication is relatively high54 other clinical trials have been testing lopinavirritonavir combined with different drugs and different combinations such as ritonavir and interferon 1b3956 early use of lopinavirritonavir as an additional treatment to ritonavirmethylprednisolone for sars-cov was associated with a reduction in the overall death rate and intubation rate when compared with a matched cohort59 a clinical phase ii trial has been investigating the use of lopinavirritonavir combined with interferon -1b as a treatment for mers since 2016 but the trial is ongoing and results have yet to be published60ribavirin is a guanosine analogue that interferes with the replication of rna and dna viruses61
in vitro antiviral activities of ribavirin have been demonstrated in sars-cov and mers-cov6162 from the experiences of sars-cov the use of ribavirin as a monotherapy was limited as it required high concentration to inhibit viral replication and ribavirin usage was associated with dose-dependent haemolysis and liver toxicity6364 in the treatment of sars and mers ribavirin is used in combination with interferon or lopinavirritonavir1165 the use of ribavirin in combination with interferon or lopinavirritonavir is recommended in the latest chinese national treatment guidelines for covid-1966 a recent multicentre randomised phase 2 trial showed triple antiviral therapy of lopinavirritonavir ribavirin and interferon -1b was superior to lopinavirritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild-to-moderate covid-1967chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are widely used for the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune diseases these drugs have an established safety profile and are readily available at relatively low cost hydroxychloroquine sulphate has been demonstrated to be less toxic than chloroquine phosphate in animal studies68 both these drugs have been reported to have antiviral effects against sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in vitro their potential mechanisms of action include blocking viral entry into cells by inhibiting glycosylation of host receptors reducing viral replication and blocking the export of newly constructed virions4569 a trial in china involving more than 100 patients with covid-19 showed that chloroquine was better able to inhibit exacerbation of pneumonia and improve lung imaging findings compared to the control treatment70 a recent small open-label nonrandomised clinical trial showed patients given daily hydroxychloroquine had significantly reduced viral load measured by nasopharyngeal swab on day 65 however the results in this study may have been confounded by other factors as some patients also received azithromycin71 the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin should be used with caution in patients at risk for qt prolongation the use of chloroquine alone is also a risk factor for qt prolongation a phase iib clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of high-dose chloroquine was terminated early due to prolonged qtc 500 ms and high lethality in the high-dose group compared to the low-dose group72 a recent analysis of a multinational registry of 96032 hospitalised covid-19 patients revealed that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine was associated with decreased in-hospital survival mortality of 111 versus 93 and increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmia73 however concerns have been raised about the veracity of data and analyses in this study and has led to retraction of the article74 other adverse effects of chloroquine include retinopathy rash nausea glucose fluctuation and diarrhoea and use of chloroquine is contraindicated in patients with porphyria chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine should not be used to treat covid-19 until they have been tested in clinical trials to determine the optimal dosage to balance efficacy and safety chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has been suggested as candidate prophylactics for covid-19 in populations at high risk of covid-19 infections such as italy and new york75other antiviral treatments for covid-19 currently undergoing clinical trials include protease inhibitors nelfinavir camostat mesilate ritonavir danoprevir darunavir flavopiridol relacatib nucleoside analogues galidesivir fusion inhibitors umifenovir rna polymerase inhibitors favipiravir and neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir76corticosteroid therapies such as intravenous methylprednisolone are currently being tested as a treatment for covid-1977 methylprednisolone has already been used in covid-19 patients in combination with antibiotics oseltamivir and oxygen therapy25 long and colleagues reported that corticosteroid therapy using methylprednisolone dexamethasone and hydrocortisone was beneficial in treating sars-cov patients78 and significantly prolonged survival time in clinical cases78 however other studies reported the use of corticosteroids in early stages of sars infection increased the viral load79 furthermore studies on the use of corticosteroids as an adjuvant therapy against mers-cov infection were unable to prove efficacy because all patients died80 based on the recommendation by frontline chinese physicians and local clinical experience during the sars epidemic a short course of corticosteroids at a low-to-moderate dose is probably justifiable for critically ill patients6681 corticosteroids are effective in treating the autoinflammatory cytokine activation syndrome reported side effects such as osteonecrosis are concerning but data are still conflicting and recent recommendations against the use of corticosteroids are based on circumstantial evidence routine use of corticosteroids is not recommended as corticosteroids may prolong or worsen the disease and were found to prolong viral shedding in mers and sars based on the current body of evidence corticosteroids may be justified for certain medical indications ie acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis at the discretion of the physician in chargeconvalescent plasma might be promising as a postexposure prophylaxis for covid-19 and as a potential treatment after infection as it was also used as a salvage therapy in the sars and mers epidemics8284 considering the huge number of people exposed to covid-19 use of convalescent plasma for post-exposure prophylaxis may not be justifiable but could still be a treatment option an observational study during the sars epidemic showed a lower mortality rate in those receiving convalescent plasma as a treatment for sars82 studies on the clinical effects and outcomes of critically ill covid-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma have so far shown encouraging results although it should be noted that these studies were based on small case series8586 furthermore studies on the use of convalescent plasma in sars patients did not report any significant side effects8287 randomised trials on convalescent plasma therapy are still needed to eliminate the effects of other treatments and to investigate the safety and efficacy and optimal timing of administration highly purified preparations of neutralising antibodies against sars-cov-2 would be preferable as it would be safer and have higher activity but it might be technically difficult to mass produce84 several pharmaceutical companies are starting to develop hyperimmune immunoglobulins against covid-198889the use of tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody against il-6 has recently been suggested as a treatment for covid-19 patients at risk of cytokine storms90 tocilizumab is an il-6 inhibitor that may be effective in treating covid-1991 the level of il-6 was found to be correlated with the severity of covid-19 and levels of c-reactive protein lactate dehydrogenase d-dimer and t cells90 a retrospective study of 20 covid-19 patients receiving tocilizumab found that 75 of them had decreased oxygen requirement92 according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol from the china national health commission and state administration of traditional chinese medicine tocilizumab can be used in patients with extensive pulmonary lesions and in patients with increased il-6 levels66 clinical trials on the efficacy of intravenous tocilizumab as a treatment for covid-19 are ongoing9394 however serious adverse effects have been reported including gastrointestinal perforation anaemia hepatitis and infusion reactiontcm employs phytotherapeutic formulations and cultural concepts that originated more than 5000 years ago95 the use of tcm as a coadjuvant therapy in the early stage of the sars infection epidemic was reported to increase oxyhaemoglobin arterial saturation95 a cochrane review found that chinese herbs combined with western medicines in sars patients could improve symptoms quality of life and absorption of pulmonary infiltration as well as decrease the corticosteroid usage96 specific components such as glycyrrhizin baicalin and mol376 were shown to have anti-sars activities in vitro9799over 85 of sars-cov-2 patients in china received tcm which has been reviewed by yang and colleagues100 the use of tcm was included in the chinese national treatment guidelines for covid-19 patients and was recommended for different stages and severity of disease table 266 however the effectiveness of tcm in treating covid-19 patients still remains unclear well-designed large-scale randomised double-blinded and placebo-controlled studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy of tcm before making any recommendations on their use in the management of patients with covid-19other complementary therapies such as high doses of vitamins acupuncture and exercise have been suggested to promote health however there are no reports of specific targeted effects on coronaviruses and there are no randomised trials of complementary therapies as treatments for covid-19several case series reported that combination therapy could be effective in treating patients with covid-19 patients101 a single-centre case series of 89 hospitalised patients with covid-19 54 non-icu and 35 icu patients treated with a combination therapy of moxifloxacin lopinavir interferon and methylprednisolone given to only icu patients showed good treatment effects and the mortality rate was less than 1101102 in another study of 51 covid-19 patients 10 196 patients treated with a combination of traditional chinese medicine interferon-a-1b lopinavir ritonavir and short-term 35 days corticosteroids had good treatment results and only one patient died103 in a case report of a 45-year-old woman with covid-19 treated with thalidomide 100 mg orally once a day and methylprednisolone 40 mg intravenously bid for 3 days then reduced to once a day for 5 days she had overall improved status increased oxygen index decreased symptoms of nausea and vomiting and lower cytokine levels101 however we cannot draw any definitive conclusions from this single case report as there was no controlalthough the development of vaccines started towards the end of the 2003 sars epidemic as of 2020 there are still no approved vaccines for sars-cov the main obstacle to the development of a vaccine is funding many vaccines that show promising results at the preclinical stage require further investments from governments or the private sector to progress to clinical trials as sars has largely disappeared since 2004 and mers is primarily confined to saudi arabia and korea there is little urgency in developing vaccines for these coronaviruses and it would not be in the best interest of investors104 there were 33 candidate vaccines targeting sars-cov and 48 candidate vaccines targeting mers-cov but most only reached preclinical stages so far only two sars-cov and three mers-cov vaccines have reached the clinical trial stage105 nevertheless the previous sari outbreaks pale in comparison to the current covid-19 pandemic if vaccines for these previous coronaviruses had been successfully developed we could have tested their efficacy and safety for covid-19 investments in vaccines for coronaviruses might now seem minuscule compared to the economic and social fallout of the current pandemic the who has launched an international randomised trial of candidate vaccines against covid-19 at the time of writing there are 115 covid-19 vaccine candidates and at least five candidate vaccines have reached phase i clinical trials105106many tcm could be used as alternative preventive treatments for covid-19 based on previous prevention studies in populations at high risk from sars and h1n1 influenza107 the use of tcm to prevent infectious disease epidemics has also been described in the ancient chinese medicine text huangdi neijing which was compiled over 2000 years ago the main principles of tcm are to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens disperse wind and discharge heat and resolve dampness prospective studies are needed to verify the efficacy and safety of tcm for the prevention of covid-19107all the coronaviruses are similar in nature and have defined clinical presentations the lower prevalence of coronavirus diseases in children might be accounted for by the lower exposure and relatively mild clinical presentation in the paediatric population many of the mild and asymptomatic cases are often overlooked and therefore go undiagnosed comparing the immunopathology of sars-cov-2 infection between children and adults could reveal the pathology of the disease and might lead to possible treatment strategies for recurrent novel coronavirus infections there is currently no approved antiviral treatment for patients suspected of or confirmed with covid-19 research on the sars and mers epidemics and data from in vitro studies show that antiviral therapy may be beneficial antiviral therapies and adjunctive treatments should therefore be considered in covid-19 patients with the unstable clinical condition or clinical deterioration or in patients with comorbidities as the covid-19 situation develops we will learn more about the safety and efficacy of specific treatments and treatment recommendations are likely to change to reflect the latest evidenceat the time of writing the most urgent issue is to curtail the spread of covid-19 vaccines could be the answer to this crisis but vaccines are likely many months away and will take time to scale-up and manufacture on a global scale in the meantime public health officials should be focusing on nonpharmaceutical interventions measures such as personal hygiene wearing masks in the general population social distancing surveillance programs for testing suspected cases early quarantine vigilant contact tracing and preventing healthcare-related transmission are key factors to stopping the covid-19 pandemic108although a safe and effective treatment has yet to be found the sheer number of clinical trials that have started since the beginning of the epidemic is nothing short of impressive combining advanced technologies in the field of genomics and computer science potential treatments could be identified through machine learning complex molecular dynamics and artificial intelligence with the joint efforts of research communities around the world we are hopeful that an effective treatment or vaccine for covid-19 can be developed in the near future109 this pandemic should also raise the awareness in governments and pharmaceutical companies on the importance of continued funding for research in this area at the same time healthcare systems and infrastructures should be reviewed for suitability and preparedness in dealing with future pandemicssars-cov-2 is the third re-emergence of a coronavirus in the past two decades and has abruptly put a halt to most social and economic activity around the world the consequences of which are immeasurable122 this pandemic will undoubtedly change our daily habits and social routines and should serve as a huge wake-up call that has shown the vulnerability of the human race for now the global battle against covid-19 continues and together we will inevitably defeat the coronavirus hard lessons will be learned that will better prepare us for the next pandemicsince mid-december 2019 and as of early february 2020 the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov originating from wuhan hubei province china has infected over 25000 laboratory-confirmed cases across 28 countries with about 500 deaths a case-fatality rate of about 2 more than 90 of the cases and deaths were in china 1 based on the initial reported surge of cases in wuhan the majority were males with a median age of 55 years and linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market 2 most of the reported cases had similar symptoms at the onset of illness such as fever cough and myalgia or fatigue most cases developed pneumonia and some severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome 3the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov a betacoronavirus forms a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus of the orthocoronavirinae subfamily 4 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are also betacoronaviruses that are zoonotic in origin and have been linked to potential fatal illness during the outbreaks in 2003 and 2012 respectively 56 based on current evidence pathogenicity for 2019-ncov is about 3 which is significantly lower than sars-cov 10 and mers-cov 40 7 however 2019-ncov has potentially higher transmissibility r0 1455 than both sars-cov r0 25 and mers-cov r0 1 7with the possible expansion of 2019-ncov globally 8 and the declaration of the 2019-ncov outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostics vaccines and therapeutics to detect prevent and contain 2019-ncov promptly there is however currently a lack of understanding of what is available in the early phase of 2019-ncov outbreak the systematic review describes and assesses the potential rapid diagnostics vaccines and therapeutics for 2019-ncov based in part on the developments for mers-cov and sars-cova systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases pubmed embase and cochrane library to identify published studies examining the diagnosis therapeutic drugs and vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelinesthere were two independent reviewers each focusing on sars mers and 2019-ncov respectively a third independent reviewer was engaged to resolve any conflicting article of interest we used the key words sars coronavirus mers 2019 novel coronavirus wuhan virus to identify the diseases in the search strategy the systematic searches for diagnosis therapeutic drugs and vaccines were carried out independently and the key words drug therapy vaccine diagnosis point of care testing and rapid diagnostic test were used in conjunction with the disease key words for the respective searchesexamples of search strings can be found in table s1 we searched for randomized controlled trials rcts and validation trials for diagnostics test published in english that measured a the sensitivity andor specificity of a rapid diagnostic test or a point-of-care testing kit b the impact of drug therapy or c vaccine efficacy against either of these diseases with no date restriction applied for the 2019-ncov we searched for all in vitro animal or human studies published in english between 1 december 2019 and 6 february 2020 on the same outcomes of interest in addition we reviewed the references of retrieved articles in order to identify additional studies or reports not retrieved by the initial searches studies that examined the mechanisms of diagnostic tests drug therapy or vaccine efficacy against sars mers and 2019-ncov were excludedgiven the rapidly developing and commercial nature of information regarding these developments google search results from the first five pages of each search term were scanned for relevance relevant articles were further identified through snowballing including a search of press releases and grey literature on vaccine manufacturers official websites table s2 a list of potential commercial kits was also provided on 29 january 2020 by dr kim j png personal communication this list was compiled by dr png from web searches and review of latest business news the list served to verify and supplement our teams own search above for review clinical trials was also searched via httpsclinicaltrialsgov to supplement the review of the diagnostics vaccine and therapeutics of 2019-ncov sars-cov and mers-covan initial search identified a total of 1065 articles from pubmed embase and cochrane library there were 236 236 and 593 articles related to diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines respectively figure 1 after reviewing for inclusion and exclusion and the removal of duplications a total of 27 studies were used for the full review figure 1a google search for 2019-ncov diagnostics as of 6 february 2020 table s2 yielded five webpage links from government and international bodies with official information and guidelines who europe cdc us cdc us fda three webpage links on diagnostic protocols and scientific commentaries and five webpage links on market news and press releases six protocols for diagnostics using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr from six countries were published on whos website 9 google search for 2019-ncov vaccines yielded 19 relevant articleswith the emergence of 2019-ncov real time rt-pcr remains the primary means for diagnosing the new virus strain among the many diagnostic platforms available 10111213141516171819 table s3 among the 16 diagnostics studies selected one study discussed the use of rt-pcr in diagnosing patients with 2019-ncov 11 table 1 the period and type of specimen collected for rt-pcr play an important role in the diagnosis of 2019-ncov it was found that the respiratory specimens were positive for the virus while serum was negative in the early period it has also suggested that in the early days of illness patients have high levels of virus despite the mild symptomsapart from the commonly used rt-pcr in diagnosing mers-cov four studies identified various diagnostic methods such as reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp rt-insulated isothermal pcr rt-iipcr and a one-step rrt-pcr assay based on specific taqman probes rt-lamp has similar sensitivity as real time rt-pcr it is also highly specific and is used to detect mers-cov it is comparable to the usual diagnostic tests and is rapid simple and convenient likewise rt-iipcr and a one-step rrt-pcr assay have also shown similar sensitivity and high specificity for mer-cov lastly one study focused on the validation of the six commercial real rt-pcr kits with high accuracy although real time rt-pcr is a primary method for diagnosing mers-cov high levels of pcr inhibition may hinder pcr sensitivity table 1there are eleven studies that focus on sars-cov diagnostic testing table 1 these papers described diagnostic methods to detect the virus with the majority of them using molecular testing for diagnosis comparison between the molecular test ie rt-pcr and serological test ie elisa showed that the molecular test has better sensitivity and specificity hence enhancements to the current molecular test were conducted to improve the diagnosis studies looked at using nested pcr to include a pre-amplification step or incorporating n gene as an additional sensitive molecular marker to improve on the sensitivity table 1 in addition there are seven potential rapid diagnostic kits as of 24 january 2020 table 2 available on the market for 2019-ncov six of these are only for research purposes only one kit from beijing genome institute bgi is approved for use in the clinical setting for rapid diagnosis most of the kits are for rt-pcr there were two kits bgi china and veredus singapore with the capability to detect multiple pathogens using sequencing and microarray technologies respectively with the emergence of 2019-ncov there are about 15 potential vaccine candidates in the pipeline globally table 3 in which a wide range of technology such as messenger rna dna-based nanoparticle synthetic and modified virus-like particle was applied it will likely take about a year for most candidates to start phase 1 clinical trials except for those funded by coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi however the kit developed by the bgi have passed emergency approval procedure of the national medical products administration and are currently used in clinical and surveillance centers of china 40of the total of 570 unique studies on 2019-ncov sars cov or mers-cov vaccines screened only four were eventually included in the review most studies on sars and mers vaccines were excluded as they were performed in cell or animal models figure 1 the four studies included in this review were phase i clinical trials on sars or mers vaccines table 4 44454647 there were no studies of any population type cell animal human on the 2019-ncov at the point of screening the published clinical trials were mostly done in united states except for one on the sars vaccine done in china 44 all vaccine candidates for sars and mers were reported to be safe well-tolerated and able to trigger the relevant and appropriate immune responses in the participants in addition we highlight six ongoing phase i clinical trials identified in the clinicaltrialsgov register 4849 table s4 505152 these trials are all testing the safety and immunogenicity of their respective mers-cov vaccine candidates but were excluded as there are no results published yet the trials are projected to complete in december 2020 two studies in russia 5051 and december 2021 in germany 52existing literature search did not return any results on completed 2019-ncov trials at the time of writing among 23 trials found from the systematic review table 5 there are nine clinical trials registered under the clinical trials registry clinicaltrialsgov for 2019-ncov therapeutics 535455565758596061 of which five studies on hydroxychloroquine lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol mesenchymal stem cells traditional chinese medicine and glucocorticoid therapy usage have commenced recruitment the remaining four studies encompass investigation of antivirals interferon atomization darunavir and cobicistat arbidol and remdesivir usage for 2019-ncov patients table 5besides the six completed randomized controlled trials rct selected from the systematic review table 6 there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at sars therapeutics 92 the studies found from clinicaltrialsgov have not been updated since 2013 while many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavirritonavir or ribavirin only there has yet to be well-designed clinical trials investigating their usage three completed randomized controlled trials were conducted during the sars epidemic3 in china 1 in taiwan and 2 in hong kong 9394959697 the studies respectively investigated antibiotic usage involving 190 participants combination of western and chinese treatment vs chinese treatment in 123 participants integrative chinese and western treatment in 49 patients usage of a specific chinese medicine in four participants and early use of corticosteroid in 16 participants another notable study was an open non-randomized study investigating ribavirinlopinavirritonavir usage in 152 participants 98 one randomized controlled trial investigating integrative western and chinese treatment during the sars epidemic was excluded as it was a chinese article 94there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at mers therapeutics 99 it investigates the usage of lopinavirritonavir and interferon beta 1b likewise many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavirritonavirribavirin interferon and convalescent plasma usage to date only one trial has been completed one phase 1 clinical trial investigating the safety and tolerability of a fully human polyclonal igg immunoglobulin sab-301 was found in available literature 46 the trial conducted in the united states in 2017 demonstrated sab-301 to be safe and well-tolerated at single doses another trial on mers therapeutics was found on clinicaltrialsgova phase 23 trial in the united states evaluating the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics pk and immunogenicity on co-administered mers-cov antibodies regn3048  regn3051 100the existing practices in detecting genetic material of coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov include a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr b real-time rt-pcr rrt-pcr c reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp and d real-time rt-lamp 104 nucleic amplification tests naat are usually preferred as in the case of mers-cov diagnosis as it has the highest sensitivity at the earliest time point in the acute phase of infection 102 chinese health authorities have recently posted the full genome of 2019-ncov in the genbank and in gisaid portal to facilitate in the detection of the virus 11 several laboratory assays have been developed to detect the novel coronavirus in wuhan as highlighted in whos interim guidance on ncov laboratory testing of suspected cases these include protocols from other countries such as thailand japan and china 105the first validated diagnostic test was designed in germany corman et al had initially designed a candidate diagnostic rt-pcr assay based on the sars or sars-related coronavirus as it was suggested that circulating virus was sars-like upon the release of the sequence assays were selected based on the match against 2019-ncov upon inspection of the sequence alignment two assays were used for the rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene and e gene where e gene assay acts as the first-line screening tool and rdrp gene assay as the confirmatory testing all assays were highly sensitive and specific in that they did not cross-react with other coronavirus and also human clinical samples that contained respiratory viruses 11the hong kong university used two monoplex assays which were reactive with coronaviruses under the subgenus sarbecovirus consisting of 2019-ncov sars-cov and sars-like coronavirus viral rna extracted from sars-cov can be used as the positive control for the suggested protocol assuming that sars has been eradicated it is proposed that the n gene rt-pcr can be used as a screening assay while the orf1b assay acts as a confirmatory test however this protocol has only been evaluated with a panel of controls with the only positive control sars-cov rna synthetic oligonucleotide positive control or 2019-ncov have yet to be tested 106the us cdc shared the protocol on the real time rt-pcr assay for the detection of the 2019-ncov with the primers and probes designed for the universal detection of sars-like coronavirus and the specific detection of 2019-ncov however the protocol has not been validated on other platforms or chemistries apart from the protocol described there are some limitations for the assay analysts engaged have to be trained and familiar with the testing procedure and result interpretation false negative results may occur due to insufficient organisms in the specimen resulting from improper collection transportation or handling also rna viruses may show substantial genetic variability this could result in mismatch between the primer and probes with the target sequence which can diminish the assay performance or result in false negative results 107 point-of-care test kit can potentially minimize these limitations which should be highly prioritized for research and development in the next few monthsserological testing such as elisa iift and neutralization tests are effective in determining the extent of infection including estimating asymptomatic and attack rate compared to the detection of viral genome through molecular methods serological testing detects antibodies and antigens there would be a lag period as antibodies specifically targeting the virus would normally appear between 14 and 28 days after the illness onset 108 furthermore studies suggest that low antibody titers in the second week or delayed antibody production could be associated with mortality with a high viral load hence serological diagnoses are likely used when nucleic amplification tests naat are not available or accessible 102vaccines can prevent and protect against infection and disease occurrence when exposed to the specific pathogen of interest especially in vulnerable populations who are more prone to severe outcomes in the context of the current 2019-ncov outbreak vaccines will help control and reduce disease transmission by creating herd immunity in addition to protecting healthy individuals from infection this decreases the effective r0 value of the disease nonetheless there are social clinical and economic hurdles for vaccine and vaccination programmes including a the willingness of the public to undergo vaccination with a novel vaccine b the side effects and severe adverse reactions of vaccination c the potential difference andor low efficacy of the vaccine in populations different from the clinical trials populations and d the accessibility of the vaccines to a given population including the cost and availability of the vaccinevaccines against the 2019-ncov are currently in development and none are in testing at the time of writing on 23 january 2020 the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi announced that they will fund vaccine development programmes with inovio the university of queensland and moderna inc respectively with the aim to test the experimental vaccines clinically in 16 weeks by june 2020 the vaccine candidates will be developed by the dna recombinant and mrna vaccine platforms from these organizations 109based on the most recent mers-cov outbreak there are already a number of vaccine candidates being developed but most are still in the preclinical testing stage the vaccines in development include viral vector-based vaccine dna vaccine subunit vaccine virus-like particles vlps-based vaccine inactivated whole-virus iwv vaccine and live attenuated vaccine the latest findings for these vaccines arebased on the review by yong et al 2019 in august 2019 110 as of the date of reporting there is only one published clinical study on the mers-cov vaccine by geneone life science  inovio pharmaceuticals 47 there was one sars vaccine trial conducted by the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases both phase i clinical trials reported positive results but only one has announced plans to proceed to phase 2 trial 111due to the close genetic relatedness of sars-cov 79 with 2019-ncov 112 there may be potential cross-protective effect of using a safe sars-cov vaccine while awaiting the 2019-ncov vaccine however this would require small scale phase-by-phase implementation and close monitoring of vaccinees before any large scale implementationapart from the timely diagnosis of cases the achievement of favorable clinical outcomes depends on the timely treatment administered ace2 has been reported to be the same cell entry receptor used by 2019-ncov to infect humans as sars-cov 113 hence clinical similarity between the two viruses is expected particularly in severe cases in addition most of those who have died from mers-cov sars-cov and 2019-ncov were advance in age and had underlying health conditions such as hypertension diabetes or cardiovascular disease that compromised their immune systems 114 coronaviruses have error-prone rna-dependent rna polymerases rdrp which result in frequent mutations and recombination events this results in quasispecies diversity that is closely associated with adaptive evolution and the capacity to enhance viral-cell entry to cause disease over time in a specific population at-risk 115 since ace2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine coronaviruses are likely to infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and this may influence the type of therapeutics against 2019-ncov similarly to sar-covhowever in the years following two major coronavirus outbreaks sars-cov in 2003 and mers-cov in 2012 there remains no consensus on the optimal therapy for either disease 116117 well-designed clinical trials that provide the gold standard for assessing the therapeutic measures are scarce no coronavirus protease inhibitors have successfully completed a preclinical development program despite large efforts exploring sars-cov inhibitors the bulk of potential therapeutic strategies remain in the experimental phase with only a handful crossing the in vitro hurdle stronger efforts are required in the research for treatment options for major coronaviruses given their pandemic potential effective treatment options are essential to maximize the restoration of affected populations to good health following infections clinical trials have commenced in china to identify effective treatments for 2019-ncov based on the treatment evidence from sars and mers there is currently no effective specific antiviral with high-level evidence any specific antiviral therapy should be provided in the context of a clinical studytrial few treatments have shown real curative action against sars and mers and the literature generally describes isolated cases or small case seriesmany interferons from the three classes have been tested for their antiviral activities against sars-cov both in vitro and in animal models interferon  has consistently been shown to be the most active followed by interferon  the use of corticosteroids with interferon alfacon-1 synthetic interferon  appeared to have improved oxygenation and faster resolution of chest radiograph abnormalities in observational studies with untreated controls interferon has been used in multiple observational studies to treat sars-cov and mers-cov patients 116117 interferons with or without ribavirin and lopinavirritonavir are most likely to be beneficial and are being trialed in china for 2019-ncov this drug treatment appears to be the most advanced timing of treatment is likely an important factor in effectiveness a combination of ribavirin and lopinavirritonavir was used as a post-exposure prophylaxis in health care workers and may have reduced the risk of infection ribavirin alone is unlikely to have substantial antiviral activities at clinically used dosages hence ribavirin with or without corticosteroids and with lopinavir and ritonavir are among the combinations employed this was the most common agent reported in the available literature its efficacy has been assessed in observational studies retrospective case series retrospective cohort study a prospective observational study a prospective cohort study and randomized controlled trial ranging from seven to 229 participants 117 lopinavirritonavir kaletra was the earliest protease inhibitor combination introduced for the treatment of sars-cov its efficacy was documented in several studies causing notably lower incidence of adverse outcomes than with ribavirin alone combined usage with ribavirin was also associated with lower incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome nosocomial infection and death amongst other favorable outcomes recent in vitro studies have shown another hiv protease inhibitor nelfinavir to have antiviral capacity against sars-cov although it has yet to show favorable outcomes in animal studies 118 remdesivir gilead sciences gs-5734 nucleoside analogue in vitro and in vivo data support gs-5734 development as a potential pan-coronavirus antiviral based on results against several coronaviruses covs including highly pathogenic covs and potentially emergent batcovs the use of remdesivir may be a good candidate as an investigational treatmentimproved mortality following receipt of convalescent plasma in various doses was consistently reported in several observational studies involving cases with severe acute respiratory infections saris of viral etiology a significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following treatment of 025 compared to placebo or no therapy was observed 119 studies were however at moderate to high risk of bias given their small sample sizes allocation of treatment based on the physicians discretion and the availability of plasma factors like concomitant treatment may have also confounded the results associations between convalescent plasma and hospital length of stay viral antibody levels and viral load respectively were similarly inconsistent across available literature convalescent plasma while promising is likely not yet feasible given the limited pool of potential donors and issues of scalability monoclonal antibody treatment is progressing sars-cov enters host cells through the binding of their spike s protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and cd209l 118 human monoclonal antibodies to the s protein have been shown to significantly reduce the severity of lung pathology in non-human primates following mers-cov infection 120 such neutralizing antibodies can be elicited by active or passive immunization using vaccines or convalescent plasma respectively while such neutralizing antibodies can theoretically be harvested from individuals immunized with vaccines there is uncertainty over the achievement of therapeutic levels of antibodiesother therapeutic agents have also been reported a known antimalarial agent chloroquine elicits antiviral effects against multiple viruses including hiv type 1 hepatitis b and hcov-229e chloroquine is also immunomodulatory capable of suppressing the production and release of factors which mediate the inflammatory complications of viral diseases tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 121 it is postulated that chloroquine works by altering ace2 glycosylation and endosomal ph its anti-inflammatory properties may be beneficial for the treatment of sars niclosamide as a known drug used in antihelminthic treatment the efficacy of niclosamide as an inhibitor of virus replication was proven in several assays in both immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence assays niclosamide treatment was observed to completely inhibit viral antigen synthesis reduction of virus yield in infected cells was dose dependent niclosamide likely does not interfere in the early stages of virus attachment and entry into cells nor does it function as a protease inhibitor mechanisms of niclosamide activity warrant further investigation 122 glycyrrhizin also reportedly inhibits virus adsorption and penetration in the early steps of virus replication glycyrrhizin was a significantly potent inhibitor with a low selectivity index when tested against several pathogenic flaviviruses while preliminary results suggest production of nitrous oxide which inhibits virus replication through induction of nitrous oxide synthase the mechanism of glycyrrhizin against sars-cov remains unclear the compound also has relatively lower toxicity compared to protease inhibitors like ribavirin 123 inhibitory activity was also detected in baicalin 124 extracted from another herb used in the treatment of sars in china and hong kong findings on these compounds are limited to in vitro studies 121122123124due to the rapidly evolving situation of the 2019-ncov there will be potential limitations to the systematic review the systematic review is likely to have publication bias as some developments have yet to be reported while for other developments there is no intention to report publicly or in scientific platforms due to confidentiality concerns however this may be limited to only a few developments for review as publicity does help in branding to some extent for the company andor the funder furthermore due to the rapid need to share the status of these developments there may be reporting bias in some details provided by authors of the scientific articles or commentary articles in traditional media lastly while it is not viable for any form of quality assessment and meta-analysis of the selected articles due to the limited data provided and the heterogeneous style of reporting by different articles this paper has provided a comprehensive overview of the potential developments of these pharmaceutical interventions during the early phase of the outbreak this systematic review would be useful for cross-check when the quality assessment and meta-analysis of these developments are performed as a follow-up study rapid diagnostics vaccines and therapeutics are key pharmaceutical interventions to limit transmission of respiratory infectious diseases many potential developments on these pharmaceutical interventions for 2019-ncov are ongoing in the containment phase of this outbreak potentially due to better pandemic preparedness than before however lessons from mers-cov and sars-cov have shown that the journeys for these developments can still be challenging moving aheadin december 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 caused an outbreak of pneumonia that has now led to a pandemic1 by may 2020 the world health organization who had reported 5 million cases and 250 000 deaths to the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-192 covid-19 is highly transmissible and spreads rapidly in the population many of those infected will develop a fever and persistent cough and some will progress to severe lung injury34 acute respiratory failure may lead to severe complications or death particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease14the covid-19 pandemic poses potential serious additional risks for participants and staff engaged in clinical trials their safety is of key importance from a patient perspective potential risks entail not only additional exposure to infection during research visits but also risks due to disruption of general clinical care or due to failure to monitor adequately the continuation or withdrawal of research interventions the safety of patients and those who care for them is paramount but we should also ensure as far as possible that clinical trials are still able to answer the questions they were designed to address56investigators participants and funders enter a social contract when they decide to participate in a trial participants make the largest investment their own health and well-being time and effort often made over a period of years should be valued immensely investigators and funders provide their intelligence expertise curiosity questions and trial designs investigators guide patient care and investigation during a trial considering both trial-specific and general medical issues that arise and funders provide opportunities resources and management expertise the different stakeholders in this social contract also have both expectations and motivations some common and some diverse patients would like a better treatment for themselves and others in a similar situation now or in the future investigators physicians and nurses want to help their patients expand their professional knowledge and skills and help answer important medical questions for their patients and the wider society commercial companies have specialist knowledge in several important areas that often exceeds that of all other parties they may offer substantial resources in terms of manpower organization equipment expertise and finances however a return of investment is needed in order to reward the stakeholders who have financed the research and to enable the company to invest in future researchas physicians and trial leaders we consequently have the moral and ethical duty to our patients and the many thousands of people currently participating in clinical trials to provide reliable results we are responsible for the safety of trial participants but must also ensure that the commitment of trial volunteers is worthwhilethe integrity of clinical trials and the reliability of their results are essential for current and future generations of patients this remains true for heart failure hf trials even during the covid-19 crisis when the covid-19 epidemic has subsided hf will still remain a major cause of morbidity and mortalityrecognizing the unprecedented challenges facing clinical trials during this pandemic many national or regional regulatory authorities have issued guidance on the conduct of clinical trials in the face of the covid-19 crisis supplementary material online appendix s1 these efforts are important but many clinical trials are international crossing jurisdictional borders a single document that provides general internationally relevant guidance that can be modified according to local circumstances and regulations being recognized could help enhance the safety of trial participants and maintain the validity of trials and their results overall such a consensus document may also impact regional guidance accordingly the heart failure association of the european society of cardiology on 21 and 22 march 2020 conducted web-based meetings with expert clinical trialists in europe north america south america australia and asia the main objectives of this expert position paper are to highlight the challenges that this pandemic poses for the conduct of clinical trials in hf and to offer advice on how they might be overcome with some practical examples this expert panel acknowledges that suitable solutions will depend on many factors including whether the trial has recently started or is nearing completion the trial design the type and timing of interventions the nature of the patient population enrolled the local and regional severity of the covid-19 outbreak and the local governing laws and healthcare resources as the pandemic evolves so will the recommendationspatients not requiring urgent care should avoid hospitals or clinics whilst local regulations advise social distancing hf patients are generally older and have a higher burden of comorbidities which make them an especially high-risk group if they get a coronavirus infection every attempt should be made to reduce the risk of exposure some clinical trials might still be able to enrol new patients during the pandemic without increasing patient exposure for example those recruiting patients with acute hf during the index hospital admission if no extra trial visits in hospitals or clinic will be required after discharge or if the rest of the trial-related data collection can be accomplished remotely however in most circumstances it will be difficult to recruit new participants into hf trials that are currently in progress for many reasons including the fact that research staff may be redirected to support clinical services or covid-related research and may therefore not be available to enrol patients in clinical trialssponsors should assess the feasibility and safety of initiating new clinical trials until the evolution of the covid-19 pandemic becomes clearer and the rate of infection is under control currently only trials in hf that directly address specific issues relevant to covid-19 eg preventing infection or the consequences of infection or that treat aspects of covid-19 disease progression in hf patients such the use of anti-inflammatory therapies should be encouraged the timing of when it will again be safe to initiate new clinical trials will be strongly influenced by local circumstances rules and regulations for instance the national institute of health research in the uk has suspended all new clinical trials to prioritize covid-19 research and to enable the redeployment of staff to clinical duties7recruiting new participants into clinical trials will be interrupted in most cases or at least very severely curtailed due to the additional risk of infection and the reduced availability of research staff so that in most cases screening will cease whether it is advisable to contact patients by telephone to ask trial-related questions will depend on what ethical permissions have been obtained and the anticipated reaction of patients patients may be reassured by contact from a healthcare professional they know however it is also possible that patients may think it is inappropriate to be asked about trial participation when they or their family members might be in a crisis whether that be medical or financial this might depend on the nature of the research trials on protection from infection with or the complications of covid-19 might be expected by patients and greeted with enthusiasmin some countries the load on the healthcare system is now gradually decreasing and authorities are considering reducing restrictions whilst still maintaining social distancing depending on the region and the resilience of the healthcare system it may be possible to restart patient recruitment even when social distancing measures are still recommended these strategies will heavily depend on the local regulations and burden of covid-19 on the healthcare system in a particular region and will require frequent re-assessment of the situation when follow-up visits for existing trials are again possible then enrolment of new patients should also be possible however patients may be wary about agreeing to participate in clinical trials until they are confident that the covid-19 pandemic is firmly under controlpatient recruitment into international clinical trials will reflect the confidence that the sponsors have that a particular country has controlled not only the current risk of covid-19 infection but also the risk of resurgence some predict that the covid-19 pandemic might recur in waves over the next few years funders and sponsors need to be confident that the necessary treatment can be delivered and follow-up measurements can be done physically or remotely and that clinical outcomes will not be determined by the risk of or infection with covid-19 this may influence the geographic distribution of patient recruitmentpermanent cessation of ongoing clinical trials is rarely the best course of action unless they are nearing planned completion or have not yet started most trials should continue to follow patients who have already been enrolled provided this does not increase risk even if enrolment of new participants is temporarily haltedglobally almost two-thirds of deaths are due to the effects of chronic diseases such as hf89 it is the ethical responsibility of the biomedical research community towards our patients to continue to seek better therapies for conditions that shorten life even in these difficult times termination of a clinical trial may require patient contact such as study close-out visits to the hospital for final investigations and safety-related assessments and occasionally to down-titrate and stop investigational drugs or to start conventional treatments safely hence ending a trial could in some cases also increase the patient contact and local hospital research workload for a short period of timeif there are circumstances where patient safety cannot be ensured or trial data simply cannot be collected the trial may need to be paused or stopped altogether eg if early in the course trials that require close and frequent follow-up or complex investigations require detailed discussions to determine the optimum strategy for follow-up trials of devices that have already been implanted and cannot be managed remotely may require follow-up to ensure safe and effective device performance eg for implantable pulse generators where regular battery changes may be needed and for neurostimulation devices that may require clinically supervised titrationlastly the decision to restart enrolment into a trial should be re-assessed at regular intervals and will depend on epidemiological data pertinent to a given region or site and after review of the institutional capacity policies and local regulationsthere are special considerations for trials with run-in phases and views are controversial on this for instance if the run-in phase requires optimization of guideline-recommended therapy it can be argued that the risks of additional visits should be balanced against the advantages of optimizing therapy during the pandemic however if the run-in period is time limited and must be immediately followed by randomization and the active treatment phase it is preferable not to commence the run-in at all as a run-in phase that cannot lead to randomization serves no purpose also when orderly and timely delivery of the investigational product and data collection cannot be ensured the run-in phase cannot continue for the time being hence consideration should be given to a moratorium on commencing patients in a run-in phase until local staff can see a realistic prospect of successful and safe trial participation that is the aim of the run-in phasea first do no harm commitment mandates that every effort is made to minimize the risk of infection for trial patients and trial staff by converting physical visits into virtual visits whenever possible to ensure safe and documented study drug administration investigational medicinal products imps may be mailed to the patients home address using dedicated couriers risk management plans for storage and back-up transportation modalities should be considered and documented on a case-by-case basis this is of major importance because it may be ill advised for patients to attend face-to-face visits furthermore healthcare facilities may be overwhelmed especially if research staff are reassigned to clinical duties or quarantined due to sars-cov-2 exposurephysical visits should be reduced andor deferred whenever feasible trial procedures and endpoints that can be adequately assessed using remote visits such as symptoms or questionnaires eg eq-5d that do not require an in-person visit table 1 can instead be documented by postal questionnaires or standardized scripted phone follow-up alternative solutions using validated tools such as apps are encouraged1012 heart rate heart rhythm and blood pressure may all be potentially recorded by patients or carers if appropriate equipment and training is available13 participants should be asked to comply with standard operating procedures developed by the trial management team to ensure uniform data collection face-to-face visits at home might be necessary if a blood test a device check that cannot be done remotely or intravenous therapy is required patients would appreciate this see patient statements in supplementary material online appendix 2 however in some regions in-person visits may not be possible due to local laws and regulations
data that are critical for addressing the primary hypothesis of the trial should be prioritized a riskbenefit analysis should be applied to both primary and secondary endpoints balancing the safety of participants and staff with the impact that missing data will have on the results and their interpretation for example specialized investigations including some blood tests the investigation of mechanisms of action of the treatment under study and recording of surrogate endpoints that are ancillary trial aims may need to be interrupted for a period of time or entirely sacrificed to improve patient safety when the primary endpoint is a clinical event such as hospitalization or death this can usually be documented although accurate ascertainment and reporting might be delayedwhen in-person visits are deemed essential patients should be contacted via telephone first to screen for symptoms suggestive of viral illness in addition visits should be arranged so that patient waiting times and overlap are avoided by spreading visits over the working day non-essential companions should be discouraged from accompanying patients for their visits other trial processes that are not absolutely essential such as resolving data queries should be relaxed or if of low value omitted altogether to reduce the burden on research staff moreover healthcare workers could unknowingly be a vector of coronavirus and if sars-cov-2 testing is available it should be performed on trial staff to improve patient safety however currently this is not possible in most places and local circumstances and rules will prevail importantly testing of patients and staff with known exposure to or symptoms of covid-19 should be prioritized visitor logs and contact informationregularly maintainedshould be collected to enable subsequent contact tracing if required if personal protective equipment is available it should be used by both patients and staff during any face-to-face encounter however personal protective equipment should be reserved for frontline healthcare staff where there are shortages in addition careful cleaning of all surfaces and equipment is required after each patient contactthe number of staff that trial participants interact with should be minimized delegation logs where named individuals are approved to undertake certain duties in specific trials should be created to ensure as many team members cross-cover each other so that in the case of staff absence there is an alternative authorized personcase report forms cfrs should be changed so that covid-19 is a drop-down box for missing visits tests and drug supply a check list of screening questions to expedite the central endpoint committee deliberation may be helpful as well local regional and national rules take precedence and must be adhered to it is understandable that different policies and laws will exist in different regions meaning that the final decision taken will be locally determined patients must be informed about changes to the trial and planned follow-up as speedily as possiblewe strongly believe adjudication of endpoints in the future should consider covid-19 infection and its consequences if a patient is known to be infected with covid-19 this will assist interpretation and future analysis of results eg sensitivity analyses based on covid-19 status many regions have limited resourcestest kits for covid-19 diagnosis and thus routine testing of trial participants may not be possible however testing may become less costly and much more widely available in most regions perhaps as a rapid point of care test14 when covid-19 status cannot be assessed immediately it might be possible to retain specimens for future testing providing this is permitted and suitable safeguards for healthcare staff are in place moreover covid-19 pneumonitis can cause signs and symptoms similar to hf and may also cause acute systolic hf or myocarditis careful documentation of any tests of cardiac function eg echocardiography or invasive haemodynamic measurements or treatments directed at hf eg intravenous diuretic inotropic or vasodilator agents in the crf might assist differentiation between acute respiratory distress syndrome and hfthe event adjudication committee blinded to assigned intervention may be later asked to assess whether covid-19 contributed to a presumed cardiovascular endpoint event based on emerging evidence and publications a graded classification of relatedness eg proven likely or unlikely may be useful for future trial analysis and could be added to the crf when a patient is hospitalized determination of covid-19 status is strongly advocated particularly when hospitalization is part of the primary endpoint of the trial sites should be encouraged to focus on collection of narratives whenever possible as these can be especially valuable in patients with complex disease and when information from the medical chart may be lacking for many structural personnel or expediting reasons for example phone interviews with a patient may uncover useful clinical information that should be documented in the patients hospital and trial notespatients may avoid hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic and hospitals may be too overwhelmed to admit hf patients in the way in which they would normally do the clinical decision threshold for admitting a patient with decompensated hf may have changed during the covid-19 pandemic which may impact event rates for an uncertain period of time similarly the proportions of deaths due to cardiovascular non-cardiovascular or uncertain cause may change due to covid-19 infection if true then during the period of time of the covid-19 crisis the assumption that in a hf trial the majority of undetermined cause deaths are probably cardiovascular in origin may need to be reconsideredindependent data monitoring committees dmcs play a crucial role in the conduct of cardiovascular trials adjustments to the work of the dmc should be implemented in trials in which 8090 of the recruitment has been completed the dmc may be asked to perform an interim analysis to assess if the study question has already been answered trials that have already answered the primary question for futility harm or benefit may be stopped and thus limit unnecessary exposure for patients and investigators similarly if 90 or more of the anticipated events have accrued the power of the trial may not be affected severely and thus a decision regarding stopping or continuing a trial which is about to end could be made this also addresses the concern that the results of an almost complete trial might be changed by the impact of the epidemic for example if this epidemic had struck in 2014 the paradigm-hf trial could have been stopped well before march 2014 without adversely affecting the result and reducing the risk to patients and staff without exposing the trial to the risk of including many deaths due to infectionterminating a trial as opposed to pausing recruitment with the possibility of future resumptionwhich is not what we generally recommendis not without risks for patients in some cases as discussed above and hence careful evaluation is required before making such a decision case by case if based on an interim analysis appropriate statistical methods can be used eg promising zone approach15 but this cannot be applied post-hoc generally the steering committee blinded to study results should provide relevant boundaries and related decision rules for the dmc to use in order to make recommendations about early stopping of the trial or not the consequences of likely scenarios should be considered before looking at unblinded data this process is important for maintaining the integrity of the clinical trial16lastly the dmc should be flexible regarding the ability of trial organizers to provide timely reports there may be unavoidable delays in reporting serious adverse events and endpoints due to covid-19-related measuresinstitutional review board irb policies should be adapted to support clinical trials in these extraordinary circumstances as trial protocol modifications are expected to occur frequently irb policies should be adjusted to avoid the need for repeated reporting of protocol deviations flexibility may be considered for the timing of scheduled visits as long as they do not invalidate results for example if a face-to-face visit may be safely deferred then this should be allowed provided there are no safety concerns eg the imp is out of date or cannot be supplied in acceptable condition or at all this consideration will vary depending on the trial design and study intervention waivers in eligibility criteria due to difficulty in performing evaluations should not be allowed in addition definitions of protocol deviations may need to be revisited if certain tests cannot be performed within an expected time frame for logistical reasons if a covid 19-related protocol modification is not considered to be eligible for a waiver then expedited review will often be neededsponsors should describe in appropriate sections of the clinical study report the measures that were taken to manage trial conduct during disruption of the study caused by covid-19-related factors moreover a listing of all patients affected by the covid-19-related study disruption should be mentioned by unique participant number identifier and by investigational site with an explanation of how it altered participation trial registration sites such as clinicaltrialsgov should consider reporting all covid-19-related changes to the clinical trialsstatistical analysis plans should be reviewed carefully and modified if necessary to reflect changes to the trial precipitated by the covid-19 pandemic statistical approaches may change power calculations may need to be revised but rigorous methods of analysis including the principles of the intention to treat approach should prevail covid-19 status may or may not be important for the outcomes seen in a trial it is unclear what to do with data acquired before and after a prolonged delay in the conduct of the trial if a trial is temporarily halted statistical analysis plans may need to be revised to determine how to calculate and manage events that occur during the waiting time delays in recruitment can also alter the temporal distribution of events and hence power calculations may need revisionit may also be useful to select a date to distinguish data collected before covid-19 bc and after covid-19 ac the date should be defined per centre before and after the first documented covid patient is admitted to the local hospital this will allow post-covid-19 sensitivity analyses to be done and ensure for which part investigators may have the greatest confidence in the integrity of the data the date threshold must be specified per site per country andor for the trial overall prior to looking at the trial datait may be useful to describe a prepost covid analysis for all trials that were running at the time of the start of the covid-19 crisis this is for several reasons i the intervention might alter susceptibility to or the consequences of infection ii there may be uncertainty about the cause of events iii any benefit from the intervention may be overwhelmed or exaggerated by the impact of the virus iv delivery of the intervention in the population studied may be affected and finally v the general care or care specifically for hf may be affected eg monitoring of laboratory values for trial participantselectronic monitoring ie records from the hospital may provide an attractive alternative form of monitoring at enrolment patients may be consented for blanket electronic approval and this can provide important information to improve future trials in light of the covid-19 pandemic in some countries patient consent requirements cros for certain data protection issues have been abandoned for all covid-19-related data for clinical purposes17a few examples of actual recommendations given in a convenience sample of ongoing hf trials for some of which the authors are primary investigators are provided in the supplementary material online appendix 3in summary the covid-19 pandemic has caused various issues related to the conduct of clinical trials figure 1 in these challenging times it is our moral and ethical responsibility to keep trial participants safe and to safeguard the investment they have already made in ongoing clinical trials so that we can provide the answers that we have promised to them clearly patients with hf are at serious risk if infected by covid-19 any additional risk from participation in clinical trials should be avoided or minimized this should be a balance against the risk of not receiving optimal therapy which is often only attained when patients participate in clinical trials when they receive expert specialist protocol-driven care provided by the research team it is important to remember the social contract between patients trialists and funders through which patients enter trials in good faith so that they can help improve future healthcare and scientific knowledge the recommendations we make may evolve over time as the epidemiology of covid-19 remains dynamic
sars-cov-2 is an enveloped single and positive stranded rna virus the virus particles are round or oval in shape with a diameter about 60140 nm based on sequence analysis it shows that the novel coronavirus belongs to beta coronavirus lineage  sarbecovirus where sars-cov and mers-cov are included however it forms a new clade different from sars-cov and mers-cov and becomes the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans 4sars-cov-2 shows the typical beta coronavirus organization 5 untranslated region utr replication enzyme coding region s gene e gene m gene n gene 3 utr and several unidentified nonstructural open reading frames fig 1
 4 the replication enzyme coding region mainly expresses and encodes two large genes orf1a and orf1b which encode 16 nonstructural proteins nsp1  nsp16 that are highly conserved throughout the coronavirus s gene m gene e gene and n gene respectively encode four main structural proteins spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins the s protein is the receptor binding site which is on the viral surface the m protein shapes the virions promotes membrane curvature and is responsible for the transport of nutrients across cell membranes the e protein plays a role in the assembly and release of virus and is involved in viral pathogenesis the n protein can bind virus rna genome and maintain its stability 5 among them s protein plays a key role in virus recognizing and binding to host cell surface receptors and mediating the fusion of virus envelope and cell membrane 6 through the analysis of the whole genome sequence of sars-cov-2 it shares 40 sequence similarity with mers-cov and 80 sequence similarity with sars-cov indicating that sars-cov-2 is more compatible with sars-cov 7 in addition by performing systematic structural simulations and immunogenicity scans of the s proteins of all coronaviruses as well as calculating the immunogenic distance between sars-cov-2 and other coronavirus subtypes it can be concluded that the immunogenicity of the s protein of sars-cov-2 is closer to that of sars-cov 8 it is known that sars-cov enters target cells by binding the s protein to the ace2 receptor on the cell surface which is triggered by the cell serine protease tmprss2 9 in view of the 76 amino acid similarity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov 10 we can speculate that the novel coronavirus may have a similar function to sars-cov which has been preliminary proved in bioinformatics prediction methods as well as in vitro tests 9previous studies have shown that 4 of the 5 key amino acids of the s protein on the surface of sars-cov-2 that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on the target cells have changed it was suspected it may affect the affinity of the s protein to ace2 receptor and in turn affect the spread of the virus among the public 10 however through calculation methods of molecular structure simulation the interaction between the s protein of sars-cov and the ace2 receptor has perfectly maintained in a holistic manner 11 at present it has been proved that the binding affinity between the extracellular domain of the s protein of sars-cov-2 and ace2 receptors is about 1020 times higher than that of sars-cov which may facilitate human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 12covid-19 is a respiratory syndrome caused by sars-cov-2 infection in general covid-19 is an acute resolved disease and the most common symptoms at onset are fever dry cough and fatigue partly with nausea diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms compared with sars and mers covid-19 has milder clinical symptoms and lower fatality 1314 but it can also be fatal severe patients may develop diffuse alveolar injury progressive respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and so onsimilar to sars-cov the receptor binding domain rbd of s protein on the surface of sars-cov-2 binds to the ace2 receptor on the cell surface to facilitate the virus entering the host cell then the virus exposes its rna translates its rna replicase and forms an rna replicase-transcriptase complex through transcription and replication the complex forms rna negative strands that will be translated for the structural proteins of the virus later then the structural proteins and rna in the cytoplasm assemble into new viral particles which are released from infected cells by exocytosis to infect other cells fig 2
 each infected cell produces thousands of novel viral particles that spread to bronchi eventually reach the alveoli and extrapulmonary organs causing pneumonia and targeted organic infections however the ace2 receptor is not only expressed in the respiratory organs it has been reported that by using the rna-seq method to express ace2 receptors in human tissues the number of ace2 receptors expressed in the gastrointestinal tract high in esophagus small intestine and colon but low in stomach kidneys and testes is nearly 100 times higher than that in the lung 15 suggesting that these tissues may also be the target organs for sars-cov-2 invasion it may explain why some patients with covid-19 developed other system injuries clinically besides respiratory system injuries furthermore it have been found that sars-cov-2 nucleic acid detection is positive in the feces of some patients indicating that there may be live virus in the feces and the digestive system may be a potential route for covid-19 16in covid-19 in addition to the direct damages caused by the virus the indirect immune injuries caused by the injured tissues also attract great concern which may be related to the severity and fatality of the disease previous studies have shown that pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung injury in patients with sars are associated with an increase in proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1 il-6 il-12 ifn- ip-10 and mcp-1 in serum 17 and it has been reported that the mers-cov infection induced elevated proinflammatory cytokine concentrations such as ifn- tnf- il-15 and il-17 in serum 18 we note that patients with covid-19 also have high levels of il-1 ifn- ip-10 and mcp-1 in their serum leading to activation of the th1 cell responses furthermore the concentrations of gcsf ip-10 mcp-1 mip-1a and tnf- in icu patients were higher than those in non-icu patients indicating that cytokine storms were associated with disease severity apart from this sars-cov-2 infection also activates the secretion of cytokines such as il-4 and il-10 in th2 cell responses that suppress inflammation which is different from sars-cov infection 17 further researches are needed to investigate the responses of th1 and th2 in sars-cov-2 infection to elucidate the pathogenesis of covid-19currently the pathogenesis of covid-19 is unclear the first pathologic autopsy of a patient with covid-19 demonstrated that the lungs of the patient reviews diffuse alveolar injury and pulmonary hyaline membrane formation consistent with ards the overall pathological manifestations of the lungs were similar to sars and mers flow cytometry signified that the number of cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes in peripheral blood was greatly reduced but their state was overactivated other than this ccr4 and ccr6 th17 lymphocytes with highly proinflammatory effects increased in cd4 t lymphocytes cd8 t lymphocytes had a high concentration of cytotoxic granules of which 316 were perforin positive 642 were particle lysin positive and 305 were both particle lysin and perforin positive it manifests that the severe immune injury in this patient may be closely linked to the overactivation of t lymphocytes characterized by the increase of th17 lymphocytes and the high cytotoxicity of cd8 t lymphocytes 19we presume that the failure to develop a full adaptive immune response to covid-19 could be due to the progression of pneumonia was too rapid to allow the available establishment of adaptive immune responses likewise the counts of peripheral cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes were substantially reduced leading to insufficient immune defenses furthermore peripheral t lymphocytes are in an over-activated state manifested by increase of th17 and high cytotoxicity of cd8 t lymphocytes accounting for to a certain degree of immune injury in patients this over activation not only failed to establish an immune response but also caused tissue injuries mostly manifested as severe injury in the lungs and some patients died of multiple organ failure this situation further accelerates the deterioration and shortens the course of the disease hampering the establishment of fully adaptive immune response the immunopathological injuries caused by the over activation also provides us with an idea for treating covid-19 for example we can probably apply the il-17 inhibitor secukinwmab directed against th17 cell activation but it still need more exploration also vaccines are also one of the solutions to make up for the lack of adaptive immune responsethe latest study terms that the changes of viral nucleic acid in patients with covid-19 is similar to that in patients with influenza but different from those with sars viral load can be detected not only in symptomatic patients but also in asymptomatic patients pointing out the potential for virus transmission in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients these findings are coherent with reports evidencing that the virus transmission may have occurred early in infectious processes illustrating that case detection and isolation may require a different strategy from that required to control sars-cov 20remdesivir gs-5734 is a nucleoside analogues drug fig 3
b with extensive antiviral activity and effective treatment of lethal ebola and nipah virus infections in nonhuman primates 21 as an rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp inhibitor it can inhibit the replication of multiple coronaviruses in respiratory epithelial cells a recent study reported that remdesivir competes with natural counterpart atp once remdesivir added into the growing chain i position it cannot cause an immediate stop on the contrary it will continue to extend three more nucleotides down to stop the strand at i  3 position fig 2 22in the ces1c  mouse sars model the preventive treatment trial of remdesivir achieved satisfactory results administering 1 day after the onset of the disease lung virus titers decreased significantly with improvements on pulmonary function administering 2 days after the onset the pulmonary virus titer can be obviously reduced but the survival rate of mice is still relatively low this study implied that when the pulmonary injuries reach the maximum simply reducing the virus titer can no longer suppress the strong immune responses in mice also showing that administering before the peak of virus replication can significantly improve symptoms of the infected mice 23 in a rhesus monkey model infected with mers-cov treating with remdesivir 24 h before infection can completely prevent symptoms caused by mers-cov strongly inhibit viral replications in the respiratory tract and prevent the formation of pulmonary lesions administering remdesivir 12 h after infection provides clear clinical benefits reducing clinical symptoms lung virus replication and lung lesions 24pharmacokinetic experiments in cynomolgus monkeys showed the first-pass effect of oral remdesivir resulted in a low bioavailability of the drug intramuscular injection of 3 mgkg had a 50 survival rate compared with the control group administering intravenously at a dose of 10 mgkg remdesivir rapidly decomposed into the original drug nucleoside phosphate in rhesus monkeys within 2 h remdesivir quickly distributed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs and soon afterwards activated to nucleoside triphosphate to reach a peak with a survival rate of 100 25 as for pharmacokinetic studies in vivo after the intravenous infusion of the remdesivir solution formulation at a single dose of 3225 mg for 2 h it showed dose-linear pharmacokinetics intravenous infusion of 150 mg of a remdesivir solution repeated 1 h per day showed a linear pharmacokinetics over a period of 14 days after intravenously injecting 75 and 150 mg of remdesivir solution formulations over 2 h the pharmacokinetic profile was similar to that of a lyophilized formulation intravenous infusion of 75 mg of drug over 30 min provides similar levels of parent drug exposure to the same dose over 2 h table 1
 after the intravenous infusion remdesivir will enter the cellular metabolism to form active gs-443902 fig 3c but the frequencies of pbmcs exposure of gs-443902 is higher than those of intravenous infusion of remdesivir 150 mg within 2 h studies in pbmcs show that the half-life of gs-443902 is more than 35 h 26 in the case of daily administration the active substance of the drug gs-443902 will accumulate in vivo as a result in large-scale clinical trials after the first dose of 200 mg is administered the subsequent dose is adjusted to 100 mg to ensure the proper blood concentration in vivo 27intravenous infusions in previously phase i clinical trials have good safety and pharmacokinetic properties also no cytotoxicity hepatorenal toxicity or no serious adverse reactions related to metering have been observed in climbing experiments subjects were tolerant in studies that repeated 150 mg intravenously daily for 714 days remdesivir did not show any renal injuries in a multi-dose study 26 phase ii clinical trials were conducted in ebola virus-infected patients in clinical trials of anti-ebola drugs the fatality rate of patients in the experimental group using remdesivir was 53 and the efficacy was significantly worse than that of the two monoclonal antibodies mab114 fatality rate 35 and regn-eb3 fatality rate 33 27 the 53 fatality rate was not significantly different from the average 50 fatality rate of ebola virus infection and as a result phase ii clinical trials were stopped nevertheless in consideration of ebolas high lethality and monoclonal antibodies with more obvious therapeutic effects when there are merely 175 patients injected remdesivir we cannot assume remdesivir of no avail the small sample size is not enough to deny the effect of remdesivir moreover receptors of ebola virus are widely distributed in vivo not only to the respiratory tract but also to the digestive tract urinary tract and blood system etc causing mortally hemorrhagic fever in addition ebola virus persists in the eyes and central nervous system for long 28 once remdesivir entering body it will be quickly distributed to the testis epididymis eyes and brain but relatively less in eyes and brain 29 all these indicate that the wide range of spread of ebola virus in the high lethality tissues make remdesivir control ebola ineffectively the wuhan virus research institute conducted in vitro experiments on covid-19 of remdesivir and found that remdesivir was the fastest-acting and most powerful antiviral agent in the primary culture of human airway epithelial cells in vitro sars-covs ic50  0069 m mers-covs ic50  0074 m and the dose-dependent effect on virus inhibition 2 which is speculatively related to the fact that remdesivir triphosphate cannot be removed by nsp14-exon 30 it has been conjectured the loss of function of exonuclease may be involved with the three additional nucleotides added after the incorporation of remdesivir into the extended strand 22in vitro and animal models remdesivir has demonstrated activity against both sars and mers that also belong to coronaviruses and theoretically provides support its effectiveness in treating covid-19presently there have been successful cases of remdesivir in the treating covid-19 the new england journal of medicine reported the entire course of rehabilitation of the first patient with covid-19 in the united states the patient once visited wuhan but was neither directly exposed to wuhan seafood market nor had direct contact with the diagnosed patients he returned to washington on january 15 2020 on 19 january due to cough and fever for four days he went to the hospital for emergency treatment and was then diagnosed with covid-19 his condition was stable from the second to the fifth day of admission the sixth to ninth day of onset on the evening of the fifth day of admission the blood oxygen saturation decreased to 90 the condition continued to worsen and chest radiographs on the sixth day of admission tenth day of onset showed typical characteristics of covid-19 in view of the continuous aggravation of the patients clinical symptoms the physicians gave a chartered medication compassionate use to remdesivir on the evening of the 6th day of admission and began to give intravenous to the patient on the evening of the seventh day of admission the eleventh day of onset without adverse reactions vancomycin was discontinued that night and cefepime was discontinued the following day on the eighth day of admission the twelfth day of onset the patients clinical symptoms were improved and the oxygen saturation increased to 94 although the patient was still hospitalized as of january 30 2020 all symptoms had been resolved except for cough and occasional running nose 31it is worth noting that from the data in the article it can be found the viral load of patients has decreased before remdesivir injection table 2
 which is not described in detail in the original report its known that the viral infection is self-limiting and the patient is a mild to moderate infectious case with a controlled fever in time thus it is possible that his recovery is related to the role of self-defense mechanisms and supportive treatment as well it cannot be inferred that the improvement of patients condition after taking the drug is definitely connected to remdesivir whether there is a link between the improvement of the symptoms and the drug is worth further considerationclinical symptoms especially respiratory symptoms have been improved significantly within 24 h bringing hope for the treatment of patients with severe covid-19 for covid-19 no specific medication is available remdesivir is expected to be a specific drug however for the acute infectious diseases reducing the number of viral copies in the body is the key point also the efficacy of the drug should be focused on the pharmacokinetics and kinetics data of covid-19 in the ongoing phase iii clinical trialsthe outbreak of sars-cov-2 in wuhan constituted an epidemic threat in china the world health organization announced it a public health emergency of international concern on january 30 2020 during the outbreak the number of confirmed cases in china showed an exponential growth the people and the government of the country tried their best to fight the epidemic with soaring combat mood the nations enthusiasm to fight the epidemic provides the trials on covid-19 a favorable environment at the same time article 23 of chinas new drug administration law which came into effect on december 1 2019 has enabled the compassionate use to develop adaptively in china two clinical trials on remdesivir have passed the most stringent ethical review of the 74 projects on february 5 2020 the trial has officially launched with experimental drugs provided by gilead sciences for free in china by professor chen wang an academician of chinese academy of engineering an internationally renowned respiratory expert who successfully suggested chinese government building fang cang hospitals to cure more than 10 thousand mild or prepatent covid-19 patients 32 due to the large number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in china with no effective drugs it is easy to collect clinical samples for trials theoretically however the rigor of the included samples hindered recruitment as public attach more attention on prevention and treatment fewer patients meet stringent inclusion criteria resulting in a slow recruitment process another reason is that there are plenty of drugs in the clinical trials speeding up the patients leaving hospital nevertheless it has been reported that more severe patients have been recruited which provides favorable conditions for the trial of the severe group and as a result at least it can be rapidly applied to the clinical treatment of severe patients in the near future the need of treatment on covid-19 is urgent so if the results of clinical trials prove it has the potential to benefit the treatment according to chinas compassionate use remdesivir will be more immediately used in patients with severe illness meanwhile the opening of green channels under special circumstances to speed up the review and approval process of the drug approval center will undoubtedly help save the lives of critical patients and promote the developing of specific drugs in the absence of clinical trial results it is still difficult to put remdesivir into large scale clinical use 33 with the political support the rapid development of clinical trials on remdesivir is imperativea drug gs-441524 compound a fig 3a for treating feline infectious peritonitis fip caused by coronavirus infection in cats has been tested in cats its safety and effectiveness in treating fip have been proven 34 with fdas approval it can be seen from the structure that remdesivir is phosphorylated from gs-441524 with identical target rdrp fig 2 it is noteworthy that though coronavirus reproduces more than 20 generations in gs-441524 yields resistance the resistant virus is still sensitive to high concentrations of remdesivir and the fitness of the resistant virus has reduced to the same level as wild-type mers-cov 35 which avoids resistant mutant coronaviruses from producing resistant supervirus at the beginning of developing remdesivir gilead science selected a large number of nucleosides or their prodrugs to conduct in vitro growth inhibition experiments on ebola-infected human microvascular endothelial cells in the laboratory and found compound a showed inhibitory activity ec50  078 m and the compound a was gs-441524 thereafter on the basis of compound a after examining the activity and toxicity of compounds surrounding compound a modifying the prodrug and optimizing amino acids and acyl groups the cynomolgus monkey performs a pharmacokinetic test to select a structure such as gs-5734 fig 3b 25 although in phase ii it was not as effective as competitive drugs and clinical trials were terminated remdesivir showed good safety and pharmacokinetics in both phases i and ii clinical trials covid-19 has once again brought remdesivir to the stage of clinical trials whether the results of phase iii clinical trial will make its comeback to the stage is worthy of expectationphase ii clinical trials have demonstrated human tolerance to remdesivir of the 175 patients in the phase ii clinical trial administering remdesivir 9 were reported to have serious adverse reactions 8 of whom were considered not related to drugs and 1 with severe hypotension was thought to be drug-related but still not confirmed 27 the gs-441524 a drug used to treat fip has shown a high degree of safety in feline trials as well the focal injection site reactions only showed in immediate pain with vocalization occasional growling and postural changes lasting for 3060s these initial reactions were relieved after the owners became more adept at administering the injection except for a cat with a slight increase in urea nitrogen and sdma of the third round of treatment no other symptoms of systemic poisoning were observed 34 relevant research signified that through a large number of synthesis and structure-activity analysis the toxicity was greatly reduced after gs-411524 was synthesized into gs-5734 remdesivir 36 the safety of remdesivir in human is further speculatedcoronaviruses must replicate nucleic acids to generate new progeny virus after entering human cells sars-cov-2 is known to be single stranded rna virus so rdrp must be used to replicate nucleic acids remdesivir a nucleotide analogues act as rdrp inhibitor can provide a scheme for blocking rna replication related studies have found that it plays a role in the final stage of entering the cell which is consistent with its expected mode of action wuhan virus research institute carried out a vitro inhibition test and found that remdesivir can block virus infection at very low micromolar concentration of vero e6 cells infected with virus and the cell selectivity is high ec50  077 m cc50  100 m si  12987 2 in an anti-ebola infection experiment on cynomolgus monkeys intravenous injection of 10 mgkg of remdesivir the drug can exist in the blood for a long time and can inhibit to ebola virus with a percentage of 100 25 wuhan virus research institutes research that applied remdesivir to vero e6 cells with an ec90  176  lower than that of the monkey model draw to a speculation that it could also play a role in sars-cov-2 infected monkeys based on the effectiveness in previous researches although there are many unknowns and limits of remdesivir the phase iii clinical trials on sars-cov-2 are not only a fight against this epidemic but also of strategic importance to reserve more effective antiviral drugs for the futurestrategic reservation for antiviral drugs will avoid the difficulty of medicine unavailable when an outbreak comes again remdesivirs situational and political superiority as well as its previous research results and application effects make it imperative to carry out the clinical trials focusing on the sars-cov-2 given that sars-cov-2 is an rna virus that is easy to mutate the rapid starting of clinical trials is undoubtedly a right choice to prevent the resistance mutation due to blind medication it has been covered in the world health organization who director-generals opening remarks at the media briefing on covid-19 on february 20 2020 that the two clinical trials on remdesivir of therapeutics prioritized by the who rd blueprint are expected preliminary results in three weeks on february 24 the who cast a vote of confidence for gilead sciences experimental antiviral drug remdesivir indicating that remdesivir has great potential and may be the best candidate for the treatment of covid-19 whatever the progress of the clinical trials is we are expecting that the clinical trials of remdesivir a starring drug would bring outstanding breakthroughs to the treatment of covid-19 or more promisingly other virus infection in the futureall authors contributed to the conception of the review yc cao and qx deng reviewed the literature and drafted the manuscript sx dai critically reviewed the manuscript all authors contributed to the revision of the manuscriptthe authors report no conflictschloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are anti-malaria drugs that have been widely used to treat malaria patients due to the emergence of chloroquine-resistant plasmodium parasites the use of chloroquine to treat malaria has been more restricted hydroxychloroquine is also administered to patients with auto-immune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are considered as safe drugs and the side effects are usually mild and transient however it is important to note that the window between therapeutic and toxic doses is narrow chloroquine poisoning has been associated with cardiovascular symptoms and can be life-threatening self-treatment with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is therefore not recommendedthe antiviral activity of chloroquine was already identified in the late 1960s5 both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are able to inhibit a broad range of viruses from different virus families in cell culture including coronaviruses sars-cov-1 mers-cov67 recently in vitro antiviral efficacy against sars-cov-2 was also demonstrated8 for some viruses antiviral activity was observed in mouse models including for the human coronavirus oc439 and influenza a virus h5n110 however in a sars-cov-1 mouse model chloroquine was not able to reduce viral titres in the lungs11 in patients no evidence of antiviral activity has yet been observed during acute viral infections5a number of clinical trials has been conducted in more than 10 hospitals in china to assess the efficacy of chloroquine to treat covid-19 patients in a recent publication12 it was stated that according to the news briefing results from more than 100 patients have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia improving lung imaging findings promoting a virus negative conversion and shortening the disease course however no data from these clinical trials have yet been released to support this announcement making it impossible to draw firm conclusions in france 26 covid-19 patients were treated for 6 days with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times per day13 six of these patients also received azithromycin sixteen patients were used as the control group sars-cov-2 rna was measured in nasopharyngeal swabs daily during the treatment during the study six patients from the treated group had to be excluded and were not considered in data analysis three patients had to be transferred to intensive care units one left the hospital because the patient tested negative one stopped treatment due to side effects and one person died during the treatment the authors reported clearance in sars-cov-2 rna in the nasopharyngeal swabs in 57 of chloroquine-treated patients compared to 125 of untreated patients at day 6 post-inclusion in the study in addition a synergistic effect of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was suggested because all patients treated with this combination cleared viral rna by day 6 post-inclusion however as not all patients entered the study at the same stage of the disease it is difficult to assess whether the clearance in viral rna was due to the treatment or due to the immune system of the patient furthermore the combination of chloroquine and azithromycin is associated with severe qt prolongation and should thus be considered with care before chloroquine can be considered safe and effective as a treatment for covid-19 more studies are neededremdesivir gs-5734 is an experimental drug that was under development for the treatment of ebola virus-infected patients14 remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug that inhibits viral rna replication the prodrug needs to be activated in the cell into a nucleoside triphosphate which then serves as an alternative substrate for the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase the incorporation of the nucleoside triphosphate in the growing viral rna chain will result in chain termination and therefore halt viral rna replication despite potent efficacy in ebola virus animal models remdesivir was less efficacious in a clinical trial conducted in the democratic republic of congo15in cell culture remdesivir has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several other rna viruses including arenaviruses14 and coronaviruses16 it was previously shown that remdesivir can efficiently inhibit sars-cov-1 and mers-cov in cell culture including in human airway epithelial cells16 remdesivir also demonstrated antiviral activity against sars-cov-1 and mers-cov in an animal model in the mers mouse model remdesivir reduced lung viral loads and severe lung pathology17 very recently it was shown that remdesivir is also active against sars-cov-2 in cells8a case report described the use of remdesivir in one covid-19 patient18 this patient initially presented with mild symptoms including a cough and low-grade intermittent fevers without evidence of pneumonia however by illness day 9 the patient progressed to pneumonia as the clinical status of the patient worsened compassionate administration of remdesivir was pursued treatment with intravenous remdesivir was initiated on day 11 of illness on illness day 12 the clinical condition of the patient improved supplementation with exogenous oxygen was stopped although encouraging the apparent success of remdesivir treatment in this one patient does not prove that the drug is effective remdesivir is now being evaluated in covid-19 patients in five clinical studies

with ritonavir to increase its half-life via cytochrome p450 inhibition whether hiv protease inhibitors might also inhibit the coronavirus protease remains a question because the hiv protease belongs to a different protease family from the two coronavirus proteases aspartic vs cysteine protease family respectively19 furthermore hiv protease inhibitors were specifically designed to fit in a certain pocket of the hiv protease dimer but this pocket is not present in coronavirus proteases antiviral activity of lpvr against sars-cov-1 was reported in cell culture20 but conflicting results were reported for mers-cov721 in common marmosets infected with mers-cov lpvr was able to improve the clinical outcome and reduce viral loads in the lungs22 however in a mers-cov mouse model the prophylactic use of lpvr in combination with interferon-beta only slightly reduced the viral loads in the lungs without impacting other disease parameters17 therapeutic treatment of lpvr with interferon-beta improved the pulmonary function but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology in sars-cov-1-infected patients results of the treatment with lpvr were inconclusive23 in addition two case reports describing mers patients receiving lpvr in combination with ribavirin and interferon-alpha reported conflicting results2425 the preclinical and clinical evidence for the use of lpvr in covid-19 patients is thus modesta case report from south-korea described the use of lpvr in a covid-19 patient with mild respiratory symptoms26 lpvr was started at day 10 of illness no clear inhibitory effect on viral rna was observed in the daily sputum samples in a randomised controlled open-label trial involving hospitalised adult patients with severe covid-19 99 patients were treated with lpvr while 100 patients received the standard care treatment27 no difference in the time to clinical improvement and in mortality was observed between both groupsanother molecule that is being evaluated in covid-19 patients in china is favipiravir favipiravir t-705 is an antiviral drug that has been approved in 2014 in japan to treat pandemic influenza virus infections it acts as a prodrug which is converted intracellularly into its ribofuranosyl 5-triphosphate metabolite favipiravir-rtp28 interestingly this molecule is able to inhibit a broad range of other rna viruses29 the exact mode of action that underlies this broad-spectrum anti-rna virus activity has not been completely unravelled it is hypothesised that favipiravir-rtp could be misincorporated in a growing viral rna chain or that it could act by binding to conserved polymerase domains thus preventing viral rna replication incorporation of favipiravir-rtp in the nascent viral rna could result in lethal mutagenesis by ambiguous base-pairing or in chain terminationfavipiravir was evaluated in clinical trials for influenza virus infections mainly in japan in which the drug was well tolerated reported side effects were mild to moderate diarrhoea asymptomatic increase of transaminases and uncommonly decreased neutrophil counts importantly favipiravir is contraindicated in women who might be or are pregnant and in lactating women because of its association with embryonic deaths and teratogenicity in animal studies29favipiravir has modest antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in cell culture ec50 value of 62 m8 activity against other coronaviruses in cells or animal models has not been reported despite the rather weak scientific base for the use of favipiravir as an anti-coronavirus drug clinical trials with favipiravir have been conducted in china in an open-label non-randomised controlled study 35 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 were treated with oral favipiravir day 1 1600 mg twice daily days 214 600 mg twice daily plus interferon-alpha by aerosol inhalation 5 million u twice daily30 in the control group 45 patients were treated with lpvr days 114 400 mg100 mg twice daily plus interferon-alpha by aerosol inhalation both treatments were continued until viral clearance was confirmed or until 14 days after the start of treatment the median time of viral clearance for the patients treated with favipiravir was 4 days which was significantly shorter than the time for patients in the control group with lpvr 11 days the report of this study does not clarify in which type of samples viral clearance was studied chest computed tomography scans improved in the favipiravir-treated group 914 vs 622 in the lpvr treated groupin an open-label randomised study 116 covid-19 pneumonia patients received favipiravir in combination with conventional therapy whereas 120 patients received arbidol in combination with conventional therapy arbidol is an antiviral drug with activity against influenza virus infection that is approved in russia and china31 the primary outcome of this study was the clinical recovery rate at day 7 after start of treatment which was defined as recovery of fever respiratory rate oxygen saturation and cough relief for at least 72 hours a non-peer-reviewed report on this study describes that in covid-19 patients with mild symptoms fever and respiratory symptoms without difficulties in breathing the clinical recovery rate at day 7 was higher in the favipiravir-treated group when compared to the arbidol-treated group 714 vs 559 furthermore the time of cough relief and fever reduction by favipiravir was significantly shorter than that by arbidol however for covid-19 patients with hypertension andor diabetes the clinical recovery rate was not significantly different between both groups 548 vs 514 the same picture was observed for critically ill covid-19 patients these data suggest that favipiravir might be useful for patients with mild symptoms but not for severely ill patientstocilizumab actemra is a humanised interleukin-6 il-6 receptor antagonist that was approved to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis a non-peer reviewed report describes the results of a single-arm chinese trial in which 21 severe or critical covid-19 patients received tocilizumab33 on the first day after receiving tocilizumab the body temperature of all patients returned to normal conditions and remained stable for the next days in addition the need for supplemental oxygen decreased in 75 of the treated patients although promising the lack of a control group makes it difficult to interpret the true benefit of this therapy based on these results china updated its treatment guidelines and approved the use of tocilizumab to treat covid-19 patients with serious lung damage and high il-6 levelsas published data that support the use of tocilizumab are currently limited properly designed randomised trials are essential to understand the true impact of this therapy in covid-19 two non-randomised clinical trials are currently ongoing in china evaluating the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in larger groups of covid-19 patients furthermore a phase iii study covacta will enroll hospitalised adults with severe covid-19 pneumonia globally starting from april 2020 this study will be a randomised double-blind placebo controlled trial a us-based phase iiiii trial will evaluate the efficacy of sarilumab kevzara another il-6 receptor antagonist in adults hospitalised with serious complications from covid-19 in the double-blind phase ii trial the primary endpoint will be reduction of fever and the secondary endpoint the decreased need for supplemental oxygengranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf plays a critical role in the defence against viruses and maintaining a proper function of the immune system gm-csf might thus be one of the key cytokines involved in the overreacted inflammatory response observed in covid-19 pneumonia a yeast-derived version of gm-csf leukine sargramostim rhu-gm-csf has been approved for use in five clinical indications the safety profile of this drug is therefore well known the efficacy of leukine for the treatment of covid-19 patients with respiratory failure will be evaluated in a clinical study in belgium sarpac trial leukine will be administered in a nebulised form for direct inhalation or through intravenous administration for patients that are already on a respiratorwith hospitals being overwhelmed with severely ill patients treatment options for covid-19 are very much needed rapid identification of such therapies is thus essential but challenging repurposing of existing antiviral and immunomodulating drugs is an important strategy because the safety profile of these drugs is well known however the current outbreak of sars-cov-2 has emphasised once again the urgent need to develop broad-spectrum antiviral drugs not only for coronaviruses but also for other virus families that may also be the cause of future epidemicspandemicsseveral clinical trials with covid-19 patients are evaluating repurposed drugs but there is no uniformity in timing duration of treatment and study endpoints in the currently registered clinical trials the primary outcome was clinical in 66 of the studies virological in 23 radiological in 8 or immunological in 33 as the pathogenesis of covid-19 is not yet well understood and associations between clinical status and viral clearance radiological or immunological evaluations are unclear the use of clinical outcomes should be encouraged in the solidarity trial launched by the who only simple outcomes will be measured that are currently relevant for public health the day the patient left the hospital or died the duration of the hospital stay and whether the patient required oxygen or ventilation4in this pandemic context it is essential that clinicians have rapid access to the information from clinical trials still it is important that clinical trials and the reports on their results are of high quality as these results will guide clinicians in their decision on which drug to use the dosing and duration of the treatment and which patients to include and exclude clinical trials should thus be designed with care because robust results are essential in addition transparent and complete reporting on these clinical trials is needed to allow independent assessment of the potential benefit for covid-19 patients furthermore the selection of therapies to be evaluated in clinical studies needs to be based on clear scientific in vitro and preclinical in vivo evidence we may expect that in the next few weeks carefully performed trials will be reported that will guide doctors around the world to give the best care both in terms of reducing viral replication and mitigating hyperinflammation to covid-19 patientsgiven the steep upsurge of covid-19 cases worldwide within an unprecedented short period of time we are still waiting for solid evidence from large randomised controlled trials regarding targeted antiviral treatments in this systematic review we aim firstly to summarise the data on all currently tested treatment and prevention options for the covid-19 disease and secondly to methodologically analyse and evaluate the quality of the registered interventional studiesregistered clinical trials were systematically searched at the clinicaltrialsgov database 1 the chinese clinical trial registry 2 and the european union clinical trials register 3 from their inception up to 26th march 2020 using the search terms coronavirus or covid-19 additional manual search of the registries was performed for possibly unidentified studies no language country or study design restrictions were applied participants of any age and medical background with or at risk for covid-19

 other pis that are currently being assessed are ritonavir boosted asc09 a novel pi cobicistat boosted darunavir as well as the ns34a protease inhibitor danoprevir combined with ritonavir table 1 table s1sars-cov-2 and sars-cov rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp share 96 sequence identity this has justified the assumption that inhibitors effective against sars-cov could have similar inhibitory effects against sars-cov-2 20 nucleoside analogues compete with natural nucleosides for the rdrp active site thus inhibiting the viral genome replication 21 current research efforts focus on repurposing older molecules in covid-19 treatment as their safety profile has already been documented 22remdesivir gs-5734tm is an adenosine analogue with broad-spectrum antiviral properties 23 preclinical data demonstrated the efficacy of remdesivir against sars-cov and mers-cov as it has the potential to outcompete the proofreading ability of coronavirus exonuclease and carries a high genetic resistance barrier 13202224 wang et al confirmed its in vitro efficacy against sars-cov-2 25 currently it is investigated in 7 randomised controlled trials table 1 table s1favipiravir is a nucleoside analogue inhibiting the rna polymerase initially approved for the treatment of novel influenza viruses 26 it is also effective against a broad range of viruses including positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses 26 since there have been some promising in vitro results for its efficacy against sars-cov-2 favipiravir is now being investigated in 9 clinical trialsribavirin is a guanosine analogue that inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase required for the synthesis of guanosine triphosphate leading to lethal mutagenesis of rna genome 27 ribavirin was used in sars epidemic in combination with either lopinavirritonavir or interferon alpha ifn- and these combinations are currently recommended by the china national practice guidelines for the treatment of severe covid-19 1428azvudine an azidocytidine analogue that inhibits viral reverse transcriptase has been effective against hiv hepatitis b and c viruses 29 its efficacy against sars-cov-2 is being tested in 3 ongoing clinical trials table 1 table s1 another nucleoside analogue undergoing investigation for covid-19 pneumonia is emtricitabinetenofovir alafenamidechloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are currently licensed for the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases 30 however they have also been studied against several viruses with promising in vitro results never confirmed in humans 31 32 33 as weak bases they are concentrated in acidic intra-cellular organelles leading to alkalization and disruption of the low ph-dependent steps of viral replication including viral-cell fusion and uncoating 3032 moreover they impair the terminal glycosylation of ace2 receptor in golgi apparatus thus inhibiting the viral penetration into the host cells 34as they are accumulated in lymphocytes and macrophages these drugs reduce secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and particularly of tumour necrosis factor alpha tnf- 33 experimental data demonstrated that chloroquine is highly effective in vitro against sars-cov-2 in an estimated effective concentration that is easily achievable with standard dosing regimens 25 however the efficacy of anti-malaria drugs in clinical practice is still much debated some preliminary reports from ongoing trials supporting their effectiveness alone or in combination with azithromycin 3536 have been called into question on the basis of their methodology moreover these results were challenged by new trials that did not find any substantial benefit from hydroxychloroquine administration 37 38 39  therefore clinical trials with a control group are needed to provide reliable answers for clinicians antimalaria drugs are being tested in 30 randomised controlled trials table 1 table s1virus-induced immune response leading to cytokine storm syndrome css and secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hlh is probably the underlying pathogenetic mechanism that leads to critical and often fatal covid-19 infection 4041 hyperinflammation is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and fulminant multi-organ failure that are fatal if left untreated in this context immunosuppressors along with antivirals may play a key role in counteracting severe sars-cov-2 infection 40preliminary data from covid-19 patients in china reported significantly higher interleukin il-6 levels in patients with critical covid-19 disease than those with severe or mild disease 42 tocilizumab and sarilumab both humanised monoclonal antibodies mabs against the il-6 receptor are currently evaluated in 13 clinical trials table 1 table s1 tocilizumab in particular improved symptoms and laboratory parameters in a small retrospective study in china 43 various other molecules oriented against different cytokines as well as intra- and extra-cellular inflammatory pathways are currently being tested in covid-19 including adalimumab anti-programmed cell death protein 1 mabs bevacizumab ixekizumab eculizumab human recombinant il-2 inhibitors of nlrp3 inflammasome activation tranilast janus kinase inhibitors fingolimod and a recombinant fusion protein targeting an immune pathway checkpoint cd24fcimmunomodulators licensed for haematological and rheumatological conditions such as leflunomide and thalidomide as well as colchicine that counteracts the assembly of the nlrp3 inflammasome are also being studied for their therapeutic use against sars-cov-2 table 1table s1 44the immunomodulatory effects of macrolide antibiotics as well as their pharmacodynamic property to achieve at least 10-fold higher concentrations in epithelial lung fluid than in serum have led researchers to repurpose them against sars-cov-2 table 1 table s1 4546corticosteroids are major anti-inflammatory drugs with a conflicting safety profile in severe viral infections 47 however their use is currently recommended by the european society of intensive care medicine in covid-19 cases with shock andor evidence of csshlh andor mechanically ventilated patients with ards 48 corticosteroids are being tested in 11 clinical trials table 1 table s1progression to pulmonary fibrosis has been observed in survivors of severe covid-19 disease although the exact mechanisms remain unclear 4950 the role of cytokines in the cascade of events that lead to lung fibrosis has been elucidated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 51 in covid-19 disease pro-inflammatory cytokines mediate an aberrant immune response leading to a persistent lung injury 52 based on these observations the antifibrotic agent pirfenidone is being evaluated in at least three randomised clinical trials for its efficacy in the prevention of post-covid-19 pneumonia fibrosis table 1 table s1 pirfenidone targets collagen synthesis by inhibiting transforming growth factor beta tgf-b diminishing extracellular matrix deposition and reducing the activity of lung fibroblasts in vitro 53finally immunostimulatory molecules that enhance the hosts immune response against the invading pathogen like ifn- interferon beta ifn- the recombinant protein produced by dna-shuffling of ifn- novaferon the inactivated mycobacterium vaccine and thymosin a1 are evaluated as viable therapeutic options in various combinations against sars-cov-2 54sars-cov-2 spike protein s-protein binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on the epithelial cells membrane 55 the hosts type ii transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 facilitates membrane fusion and augments viral internalization by cleaving and activating the s-protein 5657 these proteins being an integral part of the viral life cycle can be used as possible therapeutic targetsrenin-angiotensin system ras inhibition conceivably ameliorates the over-accumulation of angiotensin ii induced by the down-regulation of ace2 as noted in other cov infections therefore the inhibition of ras system may be protective against the development of fulminant myocarditis and ards 58 currently 2 randomised controlled trials testing losartan are ongoing in the usacamostat mesilate is a potent serine protease inhibitor inhibiting the tmprss2 and is approved for chronic pancreatitis 59 umifenovir is a small indole derivative with a broad-spectrum antiviral activity developed about 30 years ago 6061 although it is currently used in russia and china to combat influenza it has shown in vitro activity against numerous dna and rna viruses including sars-cov 606263 it primarily targets the interaction between viral capsid and the membrane of the host cell by inhibiting the attachment the fusion and the internalization of the virus 60 moreover umifenovir has direct virucidal effects against enveloped viruses through interaction with the viral lipid envelope or with key residues within structural proteins of virions 606364 limited data support that umifenovir may exhibit immunomodulatory effects by stimulating hosts humoral immune response interferon production and phagocytes activation 65 a small retrospective study in china demonstrated some promising results regarding its effectiveness against sars-cov-2 when used in combination with lopinavirritonavir 66 currently 11 relevant clinical trials are in progress globally table 1 table s1the use of convalescent plasma cp to passively immunise patients against viral pathogens has been previously reported especially when no other treatment options were available 67 cp obtained from recovering patients was used during the sars epidemic two retrospective studies demonstrated that cp administration in sars patients reduced duration of hospitalisation and mortality rates when treatment with ribavirin and corticosteroids failed 68 69 70a meta-analysis of patients with severe respiratory infection induced by various viruses showed a statistically significant reduction of 75 in mortality odds in those who received cp across all viral aetiologies including the influenza a 2009 pandemic strain h1n1pdm09 and sars-cov 71 evidence of survival benefit was noted after early administration while no serious adverse effects were reported although results are pending from 10 relevant clinical trials the potential short-lasting immunity after cov infection has raised uncertainty regarding the clinical efficacy of cp antibodies in clinical practice 7273mesenchymal stromal cells mscs exhibit immunomodulating qualities may skew immune cell differentiation and have shown promise in h5n1-associated acute lung injury in preclinical models 74 a pilot study involving msc transplantation in 7 patients with covid-19 resulted in cure or significant improvement of pulmonary function and symptoms without adverse effects 75 mscs may partially accumulate in lungs and improve the pulmonary microenvironment a significant induction of regulatory dendritic cells dcs along with a shift from th1 towards th2 immune responses was also observed 75 other clinical trials utilizing mscs for curing covid-19 are ongoing table 1 table s1mscderived exosomes are extracellular bodies mediating intercellular communication containing mrnas mirnas lipids growth factors and cytokines that possibly exert the paracrine immunoregulatory effects of msc 76 furthermore msc-exosomes administration is associated with lower risks eg tumour formation immunogenicity compared to the intravenous injection of mscs 77natural killer cells have shown promising results as adoptive immunotherapy in various cancers and may also be potent effector cells in the sars-cov-2 infection a phase 1 clinical trial has been launched to determine their efficacy table s1 lastly ozone therapy may inactivate viruses among other pathogens and activate the immune system via up-regulation of th1 cytokines including ifn and tnf as such 3 trials have been launched to evaluate ozone autohaemotherapy efficacy in covid-19 78the world health organization who and the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc emphasise the role of screening precaution measures exposure prevention and environmental disinfection as the mainstay of covid-19 prevention 7980 as no effective preventative options are available yet several clinical trials are under way to explore the efficacy of various prevention strategies table 2

symptoms n5 or a biological outcome n1 routine blood tests table 3the sars-cov-2 is the third emerging coronavirus of the last 20 years but the one that has led to an evolving pandemic a fact that urgently requires the implementation of novel therapeutics however repurposing of existing drugs is a viable and less time-consuming alternative licensed broad-spectrum antiviral agents with a well-documented safety profile are currently tested against sars-cov-2 alternatively screening of chemical compounds libraries may be useful in the discovery of an efficacious treatment against covid-19 disease 84 in this review we have summarised and methodologically appraised the ongoing therapeutic and preventive trials for covid-19therapeutic strategies should follow the two-phased immune response to covid-19 initially treatment should aim at strengthening the hosts immune response against the virus and inhibiting the viral replication 85 early initiation of antiviral therapy has been proved beneficial for the prognosis of patients 86 as advanced age correlates with higher viral loads older patients could strongly benefit from the prompt initiation of antivirals87 moreover high inflammatory cytokine levels have been correlated with disease severity and the extent of lung damage 88 thus in the later phase of the infection patients could be availed by anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches such as the janus kinase inhibitors blood purification or tocilizumab 8990prevention is a key player in combating pandemics the mrna 1273 vaccine is currently in phase i but is not expected to be commercially available this year 91 the prophylactic potential of hydroxychloroquinechloroquine is also actively being examined among healthcare professionals 92 moreover prompt testing and isolation are of utmost importance for disease prevention at the moment real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction is the reference standard in diagnostics 93 the fda has recently announced the authorisation of rapid molecular tests that are capable of delivering results within minutes thus facilitating early treatment initiation when viral loads are highest and timely isolation 879495based on the retrieved data cell therapies and hydroxychloroquine were the most frequently evaluated candidate therapies 25 and 22 trials respectively while remdesivir was associated with the highest median number of planned inclusions per trial 453 iqr 397-650 although tcms and homeopathy represent a large proportion of the identified interventional studies we excluded them from our methodological analysis as we do not have the expertise to analyse clinical trials testing these agentsthis review shows the considerable amount of clinical trials that are currently registered although the number of identified trials was high there were several methodological caveats firstly study design data and details on the interventions being assessed were often lacking this hampers the available information to researchers and relevant stakeholders and potentially influences the discovery of successful treatmentssecondly most trials and especially those registered at the beginning of the pandemic disclosed low participant numbers which may impact the robustness of their future results however these numbers should be cautiously interpreted as they represent the anticipated and not the actual number of inclusions thirdly reported primary endpoints were highly heterogeneous among studies the use of clinical and uniform primary endpoints should be encouraged in an infection where the association between the clinical status and viral clearance radiological or immunological evolution is obscureour study underlines the need to meticulously register as many study details as possible on international registries during outbreaks in order to guide the development and enhance the consistency of future trials reporting as much detail as possible is instrumental in having consistent clinical trials and enhancing the reproducibility of the results especially as studies are more often associated with a low number of planned inclusions and composite or weak outcomes that can limit the treatments efficacy assessment that is why transparency and consistency are crucial when reporting clinical trials in order to improve statistical power by conducting for example meta-analysesthe development of clinical trials during an outbreak is an adaptive process and new evidence emerges at an impressive rate a review of the early registered clinical trials is an important asset for researchers and methodologists alike these results might encourage transparency when developing and registering future clinical trials and help improve their methodology hence the robustness of their resultsfor yy chair of the global research collaboration for infectious disease preparedness glopid-r and the coordinator of research and action targeting

human-to-human transmission of covid-19 but the estimated reproduction number r0 was not consistent however using early information the who estimated r0 to be 14-25 67 the sars-cov-2 viral load can be found in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 cells reported in the deep respiratory tract samples of humans in most cases covid-19 is a self-limited infection and presents mild or no symptoms in the early incubation phase 8 however infected asymptomatic patients can transmit the disease during the incubation period which has caused great difficulty in controlling the covid-19 pandemic specifically the elderly population and individuals with underlying chronic diseases such as hypertension cardiovascular disease diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are highly susceptible to sars-cov-2 and infection can lead to adverse outcomes such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and cytokine storm 1369 because there is currently no vaccine and therapy to treat covid-19 this contagious disease has recorded at least five million cases and more than 320000 deaths across the globe in this review we summarize various potential vaccines and therapeutic agents at different stages of clinical investigation for covid-19 from january to march 20201 methodsin this review we provide a brief overview of the portfolio of potential vaccines and therapeutic agents for covid-19 at various phases of clinical trials because many of these candidates are under the early stages of investigation and have not entered the peer-reviewed literature we reviewed the websites of major clinical trial databases including clinicaltrialsgov ctgov who international clinical trials registry platform ictrp and other primary registries to identify information available between january and march 15 2020 table 1 1011two of the authors waa and jr checked all potential candidates under the covid-19 pipeline the information retrieved from the clinical trial registries includes therapeutic agents clinical phases types of intervention age group gender inclusion and exclusion criteria and outcome measures only interventional trials were considered and detailed characteristics of these clinical trials have been provided we assessed only the english version of the included registries we excluded registries that were non-interventional and those at pre-clinical stages information was summarized based on the information provided on each of the clinical trial websites2 resultsa total of 249 clinical trials were identified between january and march 15 2020 after filtering out observational trials 194 studies a total of 56 interventional trials were considered a summary of major covid-19 treatment candidates under various phases of clinical development are summarized in table 2thirty-two trials were registered in the chinese clinical trials registry and the remaining 23 in us clinicaltrialsgov many trials are under investigation at phase iv n31 while others are at phase iii n8 phase ii n9 and phase i n8 the majority of the clinical trials are being conducted on chloroquine n10 and traditional chinese medications tcms n10 followed by antivirals n8 anti-inflammatoryimmunosuppressants n9 cellular therapies n4 combinations of different antivirals therapies n3 antibacterial n1 and other therapies n5 interestingly the safety profile of five vaccines are under phase i investigation in healthy volunteers and a couple of phase iii trials are investigating the efficacy of the bacillus calmette-gurin bcg vaccine among healthcare workers table 3 an overview of these vaccines is presented below21 vaccines211 artificial antigen-presenting cells aapc vaccine acellular aapcs are promising immunotherapeutic agents that can efficiently stimulate and amplify antigen-specific cd4 t cells 12 ace2 receptors mediate the binding of the sars-cov-2 spike protein for viral replication the primary aim of the aapc vaccine is to use genetically modified aapc to immune reactivate the t cells thus treating and preventing covid-19 currently the aapc vaccine for covid-19 treatment and prevention is at phase i and is recruiting healthy volunteers from the age of six months to 80 years in china nct04299724 this research is carried out by scientists from shenzhen geno-immune medical institute and is expected to investigate the safety and immunity reactivity of the covidaapc vaccine this study is expected to be completed in 2023 and 2024212 chadox1 vaccine the chadox1 ncov-19 vaccine is an adenovirus vaccine vector developed by the clinical biomanufacturing facility at the university of oxford uk the chadox1 ncov-19 vaccine aims to develop a strong immune response from a single dose and inhibit the replication of the virus the chadox1 ncov-19 vaccine contains the genetic sequence of the covid-19 surface spike protein causing the immune system to attack the sars-cov-2 virus 13 currently chadox1 is in phase iii trial and is expected to enroll at least 1090 healthy subjects between 18 to 55 years of age from the uk in a randomized sequential manner nct04324606 results are expected by mid-2021213 lentiviral lv-smenp-dc vaccine and antigen-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls the lv-smenp is an innovative approach using covid-19 minigenes engineered into a vaccine and was developed by the shenzhen geno-immune medical institute china lv-smenp is developed from multiple genes through the lentiviral vector system nhptyf to express covid-19 antigens causing dendritic cell dc modifications and t cell activation ctls are activated by the lv-dc present in the covid-19-specific antigen after lv-dc vaccination antigen-specific ctls are prepared in 7-21 days and administered to the subjects through subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion 14 lv-smenp is currently undergoing phase iii multicenter trial in healthy volunteers and covid-19-infected patients among children 6 months adults and older population 80 years to evaluate its safety the study is at the recruitment phase and the results are expected by 2024 nct04276896214 mrna-1273 vaccine mrna-1273 is a novel lipid nanoparticle lnp-encapsulated mrna-based vaccine that encodes a full-length prefusion stabilized spike protein from sars-cov-2 virus the mrna-1273 vaccine was developed by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid usa and is currently in phase i of clinical development to assess the safety reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the vaccine in healthy volunteers nct04283461 the current recruitment is ongoing at emory vaccine center in georgia national institute of health maryland and kaiser permanente washington health research institute washington usa this open-label multiple-arm interventional trial is expected to enroll 105 participants who are 18-99 years of age and is expected to be completed in 2021215 ad5-ncov ad5-ncov is the first novel genetically engineered vaccine for covid-19 developed by cansino biologics and the beijing institute of biotechnology china the vaccine utilizes replication-defective adenovirus type 5 as a vector to express the sars-cov-2 spike protein currently the ad5-ncov vaccine is in active phase i clinical trial to investigate its safety reactogenicity and immunogenicity in healthy volunteers between 18-60 years of age nct04313127 the study is estimated to enroll 108 participants from wuhan who are covid-19-negative in the screening tests and is expected to be completed in 2022216 bcg vaccine since 1921 the bcg vaccine has been widely used to prevent tuberculosis and leprosy 15 however there is currently no evidence that the bcg vaccine is effective against coronavirus infections researchers from australia and umc utrecht and radboud university netherlands believe that the bcg vaccine can help to bolster the immune system thereby reducing the infection rates of sars-cov-2 a couple of phase iii trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of the bcg vaccine in reducing the incidence of covid-19 at various children hospitals in western australia nct04327206 researchers from umc utrecht and radboud university netherlands are investigating the efficacy of bcg vaccination in reducing absenteeism among healthcare workers involved in covid-19 patient care nct04328441 the results of these two studies are expected by the end of 202022 cellular therapies221 mesenchymal stem cells mscs mscs are widely used cell-based therapies with superior efficacy in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus sle and graft-versus-host disease gvhd 16 the direct interaction of mscs with immune cells activates the toll-like receptor tlr to simulate pathogen-associated molecules such as lipopolysaccharide lps or double-stranded rna from a virus such as covid-19 17 a recent study assessed the immunomodulating efficacy of mscs in seven covid-19 patients for 14 days after administration within two days of msc transplantation patients demonstrated a significant decrease in the c-reactive protein reactivation of cytokinin-secreting immune cells and a decrease in tnf- cells 18 currently two trials in phase i chictr2000030300 and phase ii nct04269525 are under investigation for critically ill covid-19 patients with pneumonia since the phase ii trial is planned only for 10 covid-19 patients in critical condition results are expected by the end of september 2020 the study is sponsored by tuohua biological technology ltd and in collaboration with zhongnan hospital of wuhan university china222 convalescent plasma to provide immediate immunity to susceptible persons passive antibodies are administered to prevent or treat an infection recent focus has been on human convalescent serum during the viral epidemic for its use in the prevention and treatment of covid-19 19 two trials are gearing up to investigate the efficacy nct04332380 and safety nct04333355 of convalescent plasma against covid-19 the phase ii efficacy trial is conducted by the researchers from the universidad del rosario colombia and the phase i safety trial is sponsored by hospital san jose technologico de monterrey mexico both trials are expected to complete by the end of 2020 astonishingly there are 47 ongoing studies registered to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma in the covid-19 patients of which 22 are randomized controlled trials rcts23 anti-inflammatoryanti-allergic agents and immunosuppressantsthe covid-19 infection is characterized by an overexuberant inflammatory response that worsens the symptoms researchers have identified that the sars-cov-2 virus increases the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines tnf- ifn- il-6 and mcp1 in the serum indicating that the inflammatory storm may be involved in the progression of covid-19 20 thus the host inflammatory response to covid-19 is an important factor leading to lung damage and subsequent mortality therefore anti-inflammatoryanti-allergic and immunosuppressant drugs alone or in combination are crucial covid-19 therapies aiming to limit the excessive inflammatory response to counter the infection several potential drugs including meplazumab fingolimod bevacizumab baricitinib tranilast tozumabadamumab cerrokin recombinant human interferon-alpha 1beta and steroidal therapies are under investigation against sars-cov-2231 meplazumab cd147 is present in active inflammatory cells and by binding with cyclophilin a cypa cd147 participate in the regulation of cytokine secretion and leukocytes chemotaxis 21 meplazumab acts as an anti-cd147 humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks virus invasion and attenuating inflammation 22 currently it is undergoing a phase iii trial at the tang-du hospital china nct04275245 to assess the therapeutic effect with 28 days of administration of human meplazumab injection the results of this ongoing trial are expected by the end of 2020232 fingolimod fingolimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate s1p receptor modulator that is used for immune therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis 23 prior studies have described the use of immune modulators together with ventilator support in patients with severe pulmonary edema to prevent the development of ards 2425 a phase ii study nct04280588 at fujian medical university china aims to determine the efficacy of fingolimod for treating severe pneumonia in covid-19 patients the results of this ongoing interventional trial are expected by july 2020233 bevacizumab bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor vegf antibody vegf receptors are present on endothelial cells that produce various inflammatory and epithelial cells acting as potential vascular permeability inducer prior studies have identified increased levels of vegf in patients with ards 2627 given the causal link between ards and increased pulmonary edema and vascular permeability the researchers believed that bevacizumab might be a promising therapeutic agent in severe cases of covid-19 bevacizumab may reduce the levels of vegf caused by hypoxia severe inflammation and upregulation of the infected tract epithelium therefore it can suppress the edema in patients with covid-19 currently a phase iiiii open-label pilot study on 20 patients is ongoing nct04275414 to assess the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab for the treatment of severe or critical patients with covid-19 pneumonia best-cp study the results are expected by the end of may 2020234 baricitinib baricitinib is a highly selective janus kinase jak inhibitors approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and is also found to have an antiviral effect 28 the jak-dependent pathways are involved in producing a variety of cytokines and increased levels of inflammatory factors including il-6 and il-7 that can involve in the pathogenesis of covid-19 29 therefore baricitinib might act as a double-edged sword by inhibiting the inflammatory factors and also showing antiviral activity against the sars-cov-2 virus currently investors from the hospital of prato italy have registered a phase iiiii open-label two-week trial to assess the efficacy of baricitinib in combination with antiviral therapy in patients with mild to moderate covid-19 infection nct04320277 the study is expected to recruit 200 patients from mid-may 2020235 tranilast tranilast is an analog of a tryptophan metabolite identified as a potential anti-allergic agent and used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases 30 by releasing chemical mediator histamines tranilast inhibits immunoglobulin e ige antibodies from mast cells and it also showed promising results in controlling bronchial asthma in children 31 it is a potential cytokine modifier and also a potent inhibitor of many inflammatory mediators cytokines and chemokines it is proven to have suppressive effects on histamines cox-2 il-1 il-2 il-5 il-6 il-8 eotaxin-1 and tgf-1 30 reviewing its benefits researchers from the university of science and technology of china registered a phase iv interventional trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tranilast in treating patients with covid-19 pneumonia chictr2000030002236 tozumabadamumab tozumab is an anti-insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor igf-1r antibody that showed substantial responses in treating a small number of cancer patients with selective tumor types such as ewing sarcoma and thymoma 32 however the exact reason for proposing tozumab in combination with adamumab for the treatment was severe and critically ill covid-19 patients with pneumonia is unclear a phase iv randomized parallel controlled trial was registered by the shanghai general hospital at chictr chictr2000030580 in march 202024 antiviralsantiviral drugs are essential for the prevention and treatment of respiratory illness and are potentially important to halt coronavirus replication antiviral drugs used for influenza virus respiratory syncytial virus rsv and other conditions are under investigation for covid-19 33 currently there is no specific antiviral drug that effectively treats covid-19 in this regard several antivirals are under investigation in phase ii and phase iii clinical trials a detailed list of these drugs is presented in table 3favipiravir is a viral rna polymerase inhibitor effective against different types of influenza viruses and other rna viruses such as arenaviruses bunyaviruses and filoviruses 34 given its broad-spectrum activities favipiravir is considered a potentially promising drug for treating covid-19 and is currently in phase ii clinical trial chictr2000029996 to investigate its efficacy in treating patients with covid-19 pneumonia antiretroviral drugs such as prezcobix darunavircobicistat janssen pharmaceutica beerse belgium and lopinavirritonavir are known to have superior safety profiles in hivaids patients and are currently undergoing phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of covid-19 nct04321174 remdesivir a potential viral rna polymerase inhibitor is an investigational medicine for the ebola virus with undetermined safety and efficacy 35 due to the urgency of the covid-19 pandemic multiple phase iii clinical trials for remdesivir are underway nct04252664 the characteristics of these antiviral are described in table 3along with these antivirals the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have also demonstrated versatile antiviral activity against rna viruses such as poliovirus influenza a and b virus hepatitis a virus hepatitis c virus influenza a h5n1 virus ebola virus and zika virus 36 researchers from france have demonstrated the benefits of chloroquine in a small group of covid-19 patients whereas an rct from china showed no difference in the recovery rates in patients with mild to moderate covid-19 3738 there are currently many clinical trials underway attempting to generate robust evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 in addition to these medications several tcms and other miscellaneous agents are under investigation for some possible effects against covid-19 table 3we also reviewed the information of recent clinical trials for covid-19 that have not yet been initiated which are summarized in table 4 there are currently limited treatment options available for covid-19 and it will take several months to years to investigate potential treatments for their efficacy and safety in the meantime several researchers and public health agencies are repurposing medications with decent efficacy for other similar diseases for instance thalidomide an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agent is known for its effects in stimulating t cells inhibiting cell proliferation and anti-inflammation and reducing lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis 39 a couple of phase ii trials have registered thalidomide either alone nct04273529 or in combination with adjuvant therapies nct04273581 in severe covid-19 patientsfrom china the sars-cov-2 has spread around the world to emerge as an ongoing global pandemic 145 despite tremendous global efforts to reduce the spreading of sars-cov-2 human-to-human transmission continues apace leading to high morbidity and mortality most mortalities occur in individuals of older age and those with underlying chronic diseases such as hypertension diabetes and cardiovascular disease which have compromised their immune system 40 during the past months there has been some significant progress in the development of therapeutics and vaccines for the treatment of covid-19 however these are still in the early stages through this review we extracted and summarized the information regarding vaccines and therapeutics at different stages of clinical trials we carried out this review by comprehensively searching the websites of major clinical trial databases to identify potential therapeutic agents and vaccines for covid-19several vaccines are currently under development and some have begun to be tested on healthy volunteers most vaccine candidates are developed from recombinant dna and mrna or inactivated whole-virus iwv 41 given the close genetic relationship between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 the current sars-cov-2 vaccines may provide potential cross-protective effects and provide better efficacy to prevent covid-19 42two antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine together with azithromycin have been reported to be ineffective for the treatment of covid-19 3743 however there was no clinical evidence of viral clearance after seven days of treatment 38 considering the seriousness of covid-19 pandemic several novel therapeutic agents and some repurposed agents are under investigation in phase ii and iii clinical trials to test their efficacy against covid-19 the major challenge in drug discovery and development is to demonstrate that the medicine is effective and safe in both small experimental setups and in human clinical settingsapart from supportive care such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe covid-19 cases and oxygen inhalation in mild cases passive antibody therapy and cell-based therapies have clearly demonstrated efficacy and safety in many clinical trials 44 convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins are used as a last resort to improve the survival of covid-19 patients in deteriorating conditions 45 the use of convalescent plasma collected from patients recovered from infection has resulted in a short hospital stay and lower mortality rate in treated patients 46 in 2014 the who recommended the use of convalescent plasma as empirical treatment in the ebola outbreak 47 convalescent plasma obtained from recovered patients may provide antibodies capable of suppressing the viremia however more research is needed to confirm its efficacy in covid-19 patients in general viremia peaks during the first week of infection and causes a primary immune response within 10-14 days thus investigations focusing on the early transfusion of convalescent plasma and its effect on viral suppression are warrantedin addition to the development of vaccines and therapeutics numerous tcms are also under investigation for treating covid-19 the novel discovery of artemisinin from sweet wormwood artemisia annua has made a significant difference in the management of malaria treatment globally 48 tcms are mainly investigated in critically ill patients fuzheng huayu fzhy preparations are known to have an antifibrotic effect and have been approved by usfda for phase ii trials in patients with chronic hepatitis c 49 currently the fzhy formula of six traditional herbs radix salvia miltiorrhiza pollen pini semen persicae gynostemma pentaphyllum cordyceps and fructus schisandrae chinensis is undergoing phase ii trials for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis in covid-19 patients3 limitationsthis review has some limitations to consider first this systematic review was carried out on the basis of protocols registered in the various clinical trial websites secondly despite the fact that the search strategy used in this review was limited to until march 30 2020 we may have missed some of the important trials that were registered in the later stage of this period third due to the pressing nature of the active covid-19 pandemic which resulted in a rapidly evolving research scene many studies that are currently underway have not been included lastly we did not perform the risk of bias to assess the quality of these clinical trial registriesin this review we summarized the different approaches currently under investigation to provide effective treatment and thereby reduce the incidence and mortality related to covid-19 looking ahead the most feasible options meriting further evaluation in clinical trials for the ongoing covid-19 pandemic include monotherapy or combinations of antivirals monoclonal antibodies with anti-inflammatory therapies or immune suppressants that have a protective effect in the long term effective vaccines are essential to break the chain of transmission from infected humananimal to susceptible hosts and thus control the spread of sars-cov-2current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus is one of the deadliest virus outbursts of a century covid-19 is clinically characterized by difficulty in breathing fever and low blood oxygen level
the chronology of covid-19 infection starts when the initial case series was reported in december 2019 1 from 18 december 2019 through december 29 2019 five patients were hospitalized in hospitals of hubei province china with symptoms of atypical pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by unidentified infectious agent one of these patients succumbed to the disease 2 given the rapidity of its spread and atypical symptoms an outbreak was suspected and contact tracing was done which led the epidemiologists to a wholesale market of seafood and wild animals in wuhan district of the province at that point of time it was assumed to be due to any infective agents virus which was later identified as a new strain of coronavirus this new strain was named as 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov on 12 january 2020 by the world health organization who who officially named the disease caused by this novel virus as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19the current outbreak of the covid-19 virus has caused more than 5598 deaths in india mohfw india and more than 1931076 and 6057853 peoples have suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in india and worldwide respectively till 2nd june 2020 3 4 so far there is no established treatment option or prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to sars-cov-2 and those who develop covid-19 reviewing the documented scientific evidence of past similar viral outbreaks in various parts of the world helped in trying few therapy regimens initially but were not found effective in managing the present pandemic perfectly given that the present virus seems diverse in structure and characteristics 5clinical presentation of the persons infected with novel coronavirus ranges from asymptomatic subclinical infection to mild pharyngitis to severe lower respiratory tract illness fever cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing chills repeated shivering with chills muscle pain headache and sore throat loss of taste or smell are the few known symptoms 4 these symptoms may appear 214 days after exposure to the virus despite advancements in science technology and relentless research by scientific communities all over the world a comprehensive and compelling management of covid-19 is still lackingas the uncertainties in management of covid-19 are growing we started our search on what are novel strategies being explored in management of the covid-19 outbreak thus we have noticed a plethora of case series clinical trials preclinical trials and lab researches aiming to know the new modes of treatment we restricted our search only to studies on stem cell biology based and nucleic acid based vaccines thus we explored various trials registry nih httpsclinicaltrialsgov and httpswwwcoronavirusgov and chinese clinical trial registry httpwwwchictrorgcn and for preclinical trials various university institutions pharmaceutical companys websites and news bulletins portals were checked routinely from 3rd march 2020 to 21st may 2020 the proper phrase with boolean operator and were used for searching in scientific database like stem cell therapy and covid-19 mesenchymal stem cell and corona 2019 virus dna vaccines and covid-19 rna vaccines and covid-19 cell-based therapy with sars-cov-2 and universityinstitutions were used the trials on above stem cells and dnarna vaccines which were cancelled chictr2000030329 chictr2000030300 chictr2000030224 chictr2000029816 and chictr2000029812 and others like repurposing of drugs nano vaccines viral vectors based vaccines other miscellaneous trials of herbs music therapy etc were excluded from the review list the limitations are not so significant as few registered clinical trials have not mentioned their stage of clinical trials as i ii and iii and all trials have variable no of subjects in this review we are discussing and exploring the novel strategies 6 7 specially focussing on stem cell based therapy with and without immune cells rna and dna nucleic acid based vaccine trials so far used or in process of implementations against covid-19 pandemicthis situation is like a new puzzle out in the open for all to solve since the first reported case of covid-19 several anti-viral and antiparasite drugs were used but the efficacy of all such trials are questioned statistically hence we postulate and simultaneously hope for new modalities to have potential to manage this new viral pandemic and in our review this seems quite plausible in the near futurein recent years stem cell therapy has become one of the emerging therapeutic strategies in the treatment of many intractable diseases including viral infections although the development and progression in these cell-based therapies especially pluripotent stem cells are quite slow due to limited sources of its isolation and associated ethical constraints the common cells of choice are mesenchymal stem cells mscs may be due to source prospective or availability a high multiplying rate low invasive procedure and relative less of ethical constraints 8 9advantages of mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy include 1 easy accessibility and isolation from bone marrow bm most preferred site peripheral blood pb and adipose tissues abdominal fat infrapatellar fat pad and buccal fat pad these cells can also be isolated easily from neonatal birth-associated tissues including placenta pl umbilical cord uc warton jelly wj amniotic fluid af and cord blood cb these cells once isolated can then be stored for future possible applications 2 the cells are multipotent stem cells can self-renew by dividing and has ability to differentiate into multiple specialized cells 3 mscs can easily expand to required clinical and scientific volume in relatively shorter time period 4 mscs can be deposited for repetitive therapeutic applications 5 clinical trials of mscs until now have not revealed any severe adverse body reactions to allogeneic msc 6 safety of mscs have been reported in many clinical trials 8besides the availability storage and safety the efficacy of mscs in viral diseases is also to be well explained theoretically it is well established that during viral infections of high replicative and virulence the innate and adaptive immunity defense get impaired orchestrated immune players especially apcs antigen presenting cell dendritic cells macrophages etc fail to engulf process and present antigens to adaptive immune players t cells and b cells the above failure in innate and ultimately in the adaptive immune system provides green signals to proliferate viruses and aggravate their infections consequently the inflammation due to imbalance in cytokine milieu occurs like other infective diseases and cancer etc 1013studies have shown that covid-19 triggers mounting of aggravated cytokine storms which is mainly projected due to a large number of inflammatory factors-interleukins and immune cells 13 14 the cytokine storm generated ultimately impairs the apcs and adaptive immune cells thus nowadays the researchers as shown in table 1 are in a way to develop mscs therapy with either natural apcs or with artificial apcs to mount an appropriate immune responseas per previous studies on other viral diseases and few also on covid-19 it has been shown that mscs retains immune-regulatory potential by modifying immune responses with the help of proliferation and function of numerous immune cells like inhibiting differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells dcs changing the cytokine profiles of dcs with upregulation of regulatory cytokines and suppression of inflammatory cytokines mscs are also known to induce tolerant phenotypes of naive and effector t cells constraining antibody production by b cells and suppressing nk cell proliferation and nk cell-mediated cytotoxicity 1519 these immunomodulatory activities are mediated by both cellcell communications and secreted cytokines including interferon-ifn-  indoleamine 23-dioxygenase ido transforming growth factor-tgf-  interleukin il- 6 il-10 and prostaglandin e2 1923 with these suggested advantages and in hope of successful management of this pandemic several trials are underway on mscs by the united states china israel iran italy and iraq etc to combat the outbreak of covid-19 as shown in table 1in a case report of a 65-year-old female patient diagnosed with covid-19 hospitalised in critical condition had a neutrophilia increase of 87 and an associated lymphocytopenia decrease of 98 was treated with antiviral drugs such as lopinavirritonavir ifn- and oseltamivir but the vital signs kept on worsening as a trial of treatment patient was started on umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells uc-mscs with 1 thymosin 5  107 cells three times each and close monitoring of vitals done serum parameters revealed that after the second injection serum albumin crp and altast gradually reduced along with improvement in vital signs thereafter the patient was weaned off gradually from life supporting devices on investigations the number of total white blood cells and neutrophils returned back to a normal level while the number of lymphocytes increased to their normal level further assessment revealed a significant increase in numbers of cd3 t cell cd4 t cell and cd8 t cell radiological evidence of improvement was noted after a third dose of cord stem cells ultimately the patient was discharged from the icu ward this case report strongly recommended that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells alone or in combination with other immune modulators should be explored as a treatment option for acute covid-19 patients 24recently researchers from china beijing shanghai and hubei completed a study in which they successfully transplanted human mscs trial depicted in table 1 the study showed improvement in the outcome of 7 recruited and treated patients with covid-19 pneumonia in beijing youan hospital china from jan 23 2020 to feb 16 2020 the clinical results as well as alterations of inflammatory expressions immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 registered patients were evaluated for 14 days after msc injection mscs transplant significantly improved the symptoms and signs of all seven patients without any adverse effects the pulmonary function tests of these patients were significantly better 2 days post msc transplantation after the transplant the increase in peripheral lymphocytes counts was noticed and the c-reactive protein infection and inflammatory marker decreased additionally exaggerated levels of cytokine secreting immune cells cxcr3 cd4 t cells cxcr3 cd8 t cells and cxcr3  nk cells seen initially vanished in 36 days post treatment further a group of cd14  cd11c cd11 and regulatory dendritic cells population was also increased along with these the level of pro-inflammatory tnf- was seen to be decreased and anti-inflammatory il-10 levels were increased significantly in msc based treated group compared to the control placebo group thus this very first study of intravenous transplantation of mscs has opened a new vista as it was reported safe and effective for treatment in patients with covid-19 pneumonia 25further one more trial of mscs in marchapril 2020 is reported by pluristem therapeutics inc nasdaq psti tase psti haifa israel a leading regenerative medicine company has claimed successful treatment of patients suffering from covid-19 complications in the united states the treatment was as per the us food and drug administrations fda single patient expanded access program also called a compassionate use program which is part of the us coronavirus treatment acceleration program ctap an emergency program for that allows quick trials of all possible promising and available modalities in effective management of the pandemic before treatment with plx the patient was reported as critically ill with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and was on life support facilities for 3 weeks as per company news bulletin plx cells are allogeneic mesenchymal-like cells that possess immunomodulatory properties and are able to induce the immune systems natural regulatory t cells and m2 macrophages and thus may check or reverse the hazardous aggravation of the immune system so plx cells may potentially reduce the incidence andor severity of covid-19 pneumonia and pneumonitis leading hopefully to a better prognosis for the patients now the company is planning to work with the bih center for regenerative therapy bcrt and the berlin center for advanced therapies becat at charite university of medicine berlin to explore plx cell products candidates for covid-19as per the report on 8th may 2020 the company registered a phase ii trial after getting clearance from fda titled a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre parallel-group phase ii study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intramuscular injections of plx-pad for the treatment of severe covid-19 they proposed to treat 140 adult patients that are intubated and mechanically ventilated and are suffering from respiratory failure and ards due to covid-19 the primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the number of ventilator-free days during the 28 days from day 1 through day 28 of the study 26the initial result of the above phase of trial was made available on may 14 2020 in which the company claimed 875 survival rate of patients who were admitted with invasive mechanical ventilation out of these 75 of patients no longer require any mechanical ventilation further 625 of the patients were discharged from the hospitalin conclusion the above trials of mscs-based therapy in covid-19 patients suggest that this is worth exploring option for treatment of novel coronavirus or any other similar outbreaks in the futureit has been reported that during viral infections including covid-19 the dysregulated cytokine storm with enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory and downgraded expression of anti-inflammatory is a common phenomenon in an animal-based study it is documented that leukaemia inhibitory factor lif plays an essential role in neutralizing the cytokine storm in the lungs during viral pneumonia 27 mscs are known to release lif as per requirements but the cost burden of processing and maintaining it is on a higher side for the general patients answer to this comes with the invention of lifnano which is a result of application of nanotechnology principles on generation of synthetic stem cells that has shown a thousand times more potency than soluble lif 28 29although only a single finding of lifinano ie nanotechnology-based synthetic stem cells against experimental allergic encephalomyelitis eae a preclinical model of multiple sclerosis has been claimed where treatment with lifnano reversed paralysis within 4 days a timeline in accord with that reported for beneficial effects in covid-19 pneumonia using msc therapy this study has shown that lif is particularly important for the activation of epithelial stat3 which is required for proper functioning of lung alveoli and the treatment with exogenous lif or lif over-expression can limit pulmonary inflammation in response to lps or hypoxia 29 thus lifnano has a cutting edge technology and it could be utilized as an alternative to cell-based therapy to cater the need for a high volume and off-the-shelf therapeutic agents thus this therapy may be able to rejuvenate injured tissues and suppress the cytokine storm in atypical pneumonia of covid 19 patientsin the last 3 decades an innovative approach of vaccination has been developed which involves the direct introduction of a plasmid encompassing the dna sequence encoding the antigens into appropriate tissues in which an immune response is required this method provides several prospective benefits over conventional approaches such as the stimulation of both b- and t-cell responses enhanced vaccine stability the absence of any infectious entity and the feasibility of large-scale productionas evidence of the principle of dna vaccination immune reactions in animals have been assessed using genes from a diverse class of infectious agents including influenza virus hepatitis b virus human immunodeficiency virus rabies virus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus malarial parasites and mycoplasmas in a few studies protection from disease in animals has also been achieved though the worth and benefits of dna vaccines must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and their relevance will be determined by the nature of the agent being immunized against the nature of the antigen and the type of immune response required for protectionthe arena of dna vaccination is evolving rapidly vaccines presently being developed utilizes not only dna but also encompasses an accessory segment that supports dna to enter precisely into targeted cells or that may work as adjuvants in exciting or directing the immune response the earliest dna vaccines approved for marketing are likely to use plasmid dna derived from bacterial cells there are many gene-based vaccines permitted for use in veterinary practice for targeting canine melanoma merial west nile virus wyeth fish hematopoietic necrosis virus novartis and swine growth hormone-releasing hormone inovio now diverse strategies are in process to execute with rnas as well as with complexes of nucleic acid molecules and other entities 30it is recognized that the development and application of nucleic acid vaccines are evolving rapidly currently during the covid-19 outbreak several dna and rna vaccines trials as depicted in tables 2 and 3 are also in progress few are in clinical phase i and ii trials while others are in the pre-clinical validation stage by various institutions and pharmaceutical companies like initial initiative in feb 2020 as dna vaccine was taken by applied dna sciences usa subsidiary linearx and takis biotech italy by establishing a joint venture to develop a linear dna vaccine as a treatment for coronavirus the vaccine development utilizes polymerase chain reaction pcr-based dna manufacturing technology to develop the vaccineanother clinical trial of dna vaccines has been initiated by inovio pharmaceuticals usa in collaboration with coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi norway the current open-label phase i trial has been initiated in 40 participants to evaluate the safety tolerability and immunological profile of ino-4800 administered by intradermal id injection followed by electroporation ep using the cellectra 2000 device in healthy adult volunteerssimilarly a rna based vaccines phase i trial is in the process by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid united states registered trial as safety and immunogenicity study of 2019-ncov vaccine mrna-1273 for prophylaxis of sars-cov-2 infection covid-19 on 105 participants recently entos pharmaceuticals usa is developing fusogenix dna vaccine by using the fusogenix drug delivery platform to prevent covid-19 infections fusogenix drug delivery platform is a proteo-lipid vehicle that introduces genetic payload directly into the cells entos is working on developing an optimized payload containing multiple protein epitopes derived from sars-cov-2 proteins which will stimulate an immune response in the body to prevent covid-19 infection similarly zydus cadila india declared the pre-clinical trial to develop a vaccine for covid-19 using two novel approaches the first approach includes the development of a dna vaccine against the viral membrane protein of the virus while a live attenuated recombinant measles virus rmv vectored vaccine will be developed in the other further several preclinical trials on dnarna based vaccines have been started globally by reputed instituteuniversity like karolinska institute sweden waterloo university canada fudan university china shanghai jiaotong university china to pharmaceutical company like zydus cadila india bionet asia immunomic therapeutics thai-french privately-held biotech company etc and many more as shown in tables 2 and 3 these institutionsuniversities and pharmaceutical industries are in the process of developing suitable dnarna based vaccines against the covid-19 virus at the earliest 31the results of these on-going clinical trials on new therapeutic options have brought in hope in controlling the spread of novel coronavirus and sufferings of patients with covid-19 not only this the success of such trials may prove the best utilization of the technological advances and their integration with health sciences rna and dna vaccines offer us the potential for more rapid vaccine development because synthetic rna and dna are easier to construct and are relatively purified from contaminants improving safety with immense potential of scaling up the volume of production in comparison to the traditional vaccines as mentioned in text the phase i and phase ii clinical trials of pluristem therapeutics inc nasdaq psti tase psti haifa israel working on mesenchymal stem cells for treating covid-19 patients has shown higher recovery rate and less mortality paving the way to explore this treatment strategy for the large number of patients affected with severe forms of covid-19 all over the world mscs are well known in downgrading the inflammation and activation of antigen presenting cells but there is no evidence of their role in the activation of b cells and t cells which is well-known role of dna and rna based vaccines so both mscs and nucleic acid based vaccines in a synergistic way or with immune-engineered modification may produce better results in combating with this virus 32 33 thus utilization of such novel vaccines might be a better way for mitigation of the current covid-19 pandemic the finding that mesenchymal stem cells and dnarna vaccines are safe and can reverse severe critical disease with high potency is a key breakthrough representing an entirely new biological approach to treatment of such deadly viral diseases given the pressing needs to keep mortality as low as possible such treatments need to be researched and developed promptlyremarkably after 3 decades of discovery of dna vaccines and after few unsatisfactory human clinical trials of first-generation vaccines dna vaccines are now undergoing advancement with the introduction of more competent designs isolations of bio-molecules characterizations and better delivery technologies including electroporation like the past of monoclonal antibody vaccines development programme initially went through a highly negative phase but now has emerged as pharmaceutical blockbusters this also has scalable potential over the others now it is believed that dna vaccines have passed their darkest phase and thereby will soon be ready to emerge as commercially viable products most likely in the area of antiviral vaccines similarly the msc platform has the potential to express hundreds of peptides thereby generating a broad array of epitopes with precise post-translational processing mimicking natural infection thus by inducing immunity to a combination of epitopes and complimentary determining regions cdrs it may be possible to develop prophylactic and even therapeutic vaccines against current pandemic disease covid-19 where traditional vaccination approaches have failed to solve the puzzle we hope that these innovative vaccine strategies may open new vistas in the management of covid-19 and soon whole humanity would be free from the current covid-19 viral outbreaksince december 2019 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has broken out in wuhan china 1 the main symptoms include fever dry cough and fatigue while some patients with myalgia and diarrhea it can lead to severe respiratory failure acute respiratory distress syndrome septic shock and even death currently covid-19 outbreak is moving rapidly as of june 21 2020 a total of 8949953 confirmed cases of covid-19 has been reported in china and 200 other countries with 4760539 5319 cured cases and 467347 522 deaths unfortunately the number of confirmed cases continues to rise due to rapid spread world health organization who has defined it as a global pandemic worst of all except for conventional western medicine cwm including antiviral drugs antibacterial drugs antitussive expectorant and antiasthmatic drugs and symptomatic and supportive therapy no specific anti-viral drugs or vaccines has been discovered for this virus more efforts should be made to understand the pathophysiology and improve clinical efficacy of this new disease thus it has become a major global public health problemin china the pandemic is under control due to government strong measure public surveillance and utilization of both cwm and traditional chinese medicine tcm tcm especially chinese herbal medicine chm has been used extensively in the treatment of several acute epidemic infectious diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars influenza a h1n1 avian influenza malaria etc 23 according to the research reports of world health organization compared to cwm group tcm group has achieved remarkable therapeutic effect with 3 days for average fever reduction time 10 days for average hospital stay low medical costs and no death sequelae transfer and infection of nurses and doctors during the sars epidemic in 2003 4 among the 564 patients with covid-19 admitted to jiangxia fangcang tcm hospital 482 were cured and the rest 82 complicated with basic diseases were transferred to designated hospitals during the treatment no patients turned from mild to critical cases and no nurses and doctors were infected by covid-19 tcm has played an indispensable role and tcm therapeutic schedule was included in the guideline on diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 5currently a large number of published clinical studies including case reports case series and randomized controlled trials rcts showed that chm could improve clinical symptom and and lung ct image shorten fever reduction time and average length of hospital stay and reduce the conversion rate from mild to severe bringing new hope for clinical treatment and new drug discovery in treating covid-19 67 although 4 systematic reviews 8 9 10 11 regarding lianhua qingwen granules and other chm for covid-19

currently covid-19 has become a major public health problem in the whole world 3334 it has been identified that clusters of fatal pneumonia could be caused by 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov the clinical manifestation of which is greatly resembling severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 35 during the epidemic rapid and robust research is important to help guide clinical treatment formulating public health policy and new drug research and development from the beginning of outbreak chm has been widely used in china and evidences of chm for covid-19 are emerging gradually to our knowledge this is the first strictly designed systematic review and meta-analysis of all the published rcts to assess the efficacy and safety of chm for covid-19 in englishin this study several research highlights deserved our attention firstly extensive literature searching of relevant clinical trials published in both chinese and english databases was performed in the previous published systematic reviews only less than 5 rcts were included however up to 18 trials were enrolled in our review the conclusion of which was more persuasive and feasible although the number of included studies was still small these data are very valuable and timely in light of no specific drugs and high mortality of covid-19secondly large number of objective and subjective outcome measures including lung ct death clinical cure rate ranging between mild and critical cases length of hospital stay clinical symptoms tcm syndrome viral nucleic acid testing and inflammatory biomarkers were utilized to assess the efficacy of chm comprehensively this is different from the traditional evaluation of chm that only focused on subjective indicators the whole research findings from 18 trials involving 2275 patients showed that lung ct clinical cure rate ranging from mild to critical cases length of hospital stay total score of clinical symptoms fever reduction time symptom score of fever number of cough reduction cases symptom score of cough number of fatigue reduction cases symptom score of fatigue disappearing time of fatigue tcm syndrome viral nucleic acid testing and inflammatory biomarkers crp were significantly improved by chm in my opinion achievement of clinical efficacy is closely related to traditional medical experience and extensive use of large number of classical chinese herbal formulas although there is no records in tcm it does not affect the understanding of tcm pathogenesis and clinical treatment of covid-19 as symptoms and signs including tongue coating and pulse are the basis of diagnosis and treatment in tcm tcm syndrome and formulae syndrome rather than disease were focused accordingly 36 when in treating acute infectious febrile diseases large quantity of classical chinese herbal formulas have been formed and accumulated in ancient times 37 it is held that covid-19 belong to damp-heat epidemic or damp-toxin epidemic according to tcm theory the disease can be divided into 3 stages on the basis of different tcm pathogenesis illness in all three yang channels in the mild stage phlegm-heat obstructing the lung in the critical stage and deficiency of lung and spleen qi in the recovery stage therefore therapeutic principles of dispelling cold relieving exterior dissipating phlegm clearing away heat invigorating spleen and replenishing qi were widely used classical chinese herbal formulas including maxing shigan decoction xiaochaihu decoction etc were frequently applied correspondingly whats more all these formulas possessed a wide range of pharmacological functions including anti-inflammatory antiviral antipyretic expectorant antiasthmatic antitussive effects 38 however more researches on clinical evidence and molecular mechanism by classical chinese herbal formulas are also warrantedthirdly treatment course of chm was also worthy of attention the reported course ranged from 5 to 15 days whether chm can play a role in such a short period of time is a widely concerned issue patients diagnosed as covid-19 could develop severe pulmonary infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome which have a high likelihood of hospitalization in intensive care unit and death however tcm often held that to treat what and when it is not ill that is to say although patient manifested fever in the early stage and mild stage of covid-19 it belongs to the category of typical exterior syndrome from the perspective of tcm if it was intervened in time at the stage of exterior syndrome covid-19 can be effectively blocked in ranging from mild to critical cases thus reducing mortality length of hospital stay and fever reduction timefourthly in terms of adverse effects no severe discomfort and abnormal liver and kidney function was identified in chm group the results indicated that chm maybe relatively safe for covid-19 however as adverse effects were not reported in some studies the safety of chm should be observed and reported in more detailed informationfifthly the most frequently used chinese herbs were also analysed in this study in the top 5 herbs liquoric root gancao radix glycyrrhizae is traditionally used as shi to harmonize the properties of different drugs it is also widely used to resolve phlegm and relieve cough glycyrrhetinic acid fig 10
a the effective component of liquoric root gancao radix glycyrrhizae has a strong antitussive and expectorant effect with a dose-dependent relationship glycyrrhetinic acid and glycyrrhizin also possess obvious antipyretic effect baical skullcap root huangqin radix scutellariae baicalensis can clear away heat and reduce fire thus treating febrile diseases acute upper respiratory tract infection and cough yellow phlegm baicalin fig 10b and baicalein fig 10c the active components of baical skullcap root huangqin radix scutellariae baicalensis can inhibit multiple viruses and bacteria thus inhibiting inflammation pinellia rhizome banxia rhizoma pinelliae tematae is traditionally used to eliminate phlegm-dampness in pharmacology it possessed significant antitussive and expectant effects with forsythaside fig 10d as the active component forsythia fruit lianqiao fructus forsythiae suspensae could clear away heat and toxic material in tcm theory it can inhibit a variety of viruses including influenza a virus human cytomegalovirus encephalitis b virus respiratory syncytial virus and herpes simplex virus and inhibit a variety of bacteria including ecoli staphylococcus aureus salmonella typhi escherichia coli multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus epidermidis 39 bitter apricot seed kuxingren semen armeniacae amarum could be used to reduce qi relieve cough and asthma and relax bowel thus treating cough asthma chest fullness phlegm and constipation the main active ingredient is amygdalin fig 10e which possesses the effects of expectorant and antitussive it is noteworthy that oxidative stress is a negative effect produced by free radicals in the body and is considered to be an important factor leading to apoptosis aging and disease 40 41 42 43 virus infection is closely related to oxidative injury and it evokes oxidative stress and intensifies pathological process plant polyphenols include flavonoids tannins phenolic acids etc which have the functions of scavenging free radicals in the body anti lipid oxidation delaying the aging of the body and possess the effects of bacteriostasis anti-virus and anti-tumor 44 a large number of chinese herb medicine and natural medicine including baical skullcap root huangqin radix scutellariae baicalensis forsythia fruit lianqiao fructus forsythiae suspensae liquoric root gancao radix glycyrrhizae and so on possess certain anti-oxidation anti-bacterial and anti-virus effects and can be used in treating acute respiratory infection our study suggested that chm can not only improve symptoms reduce the number of severe patients shorten of fever reduction time and length of hospital stay and improve pulmonary imaging but also possess effects of antiviral and inhibiting inflammatory reaction in the treatment of covid-19 that is to say chm could be considered to treat patients in both mild and critical stages of the disease which embodies the advantages of multi-target and overall regulation by chmlimitations in this review should also be taken into account as below firstly poor methodological design is a very common problem in most of included trials significant drawbacks regarding sequence generation of randomization concealment of allocation reporting on blinding dropouts and pre-estimation of sample size should be considered in further studies secondly as viral nucleic acid testing turning positive again is very common in the recovery stage of covid-19 no trial adopted long-term follow-upin general this systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that chm maybe beneficial for the treatment of covid-19 in improving clinical symptoms imaging and laboratory indicators shortening the course of disease and reducing the number of severe cases however considering the shortcomings of original trials further rigorously designed trials following consort statement 45 and consort extension for herbal medicine 46 are warranted to confirm the conclusions chm especially classical chinese herbal formulas could be used as potential candidates for covid-19 in this battlexjx designed the paper extracted data carried out the statistical analysis produced the tables and figures and wrote the first edition of the paper pqw selected the literature kls evaluated the methodological quality of each trial ywx and ccw were consulted and helped to revise the manuscript xjx and kls contributed equally in this paperthe authors declare no competing financial intereststhe novel coronavirus pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection chen et al 2020a 2020b 2020c sars-cov-2 that seriously endangers human health has been found throughout china and around the world including america brazil russia india peru england and other countrieszhang et al 2020abcd as of april 14 2020 a total of 83700 confirmed cases and 3351 deaths in china and more than 185 million of covid-19 confirmed cases in other countries were reported according to the speed of sars-cov-2 infection the number of confirmed and deaths of covid-19 in the world is still increasing the prevention and treatment of covid-19 is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges in the history of human development chinese government formulated quickly strict prevention and control mechanism issued the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia the seventh trial version and encouraged the front-line clinical workers to try to use the marketed medicines for covid-19 treatment national health commission national administration of traditional chinese medicine 2020 fortunately as of april 14 2020 more than 78000 of patients had been successfully cured in china a number of drugs exhibit certain inhibitory effects on sars-cov-2 in china which are expected to be specific drugs for the treatment of covid-19 meanwhile a large number of clinical and fundamental studies on these potentially effective drugs are being carried out some drugs that have been clinically tested in advance have good curative effects and some drugs also have shown certain antiviral effects in vitro experiments however most of these drugs have not yet been tested in standardized clinical studies especially large sample randomized controlled trials rctsin the face of the battle between human health and viruses chinese scholars should share these potential drugs to cooperate with other countries and regions for resisting this virus attack this review lists current clinical trial drugs and potential drugs against sars-cov-2 in china including chemical drugs traditional chinese medicines tcms and biological products which is beneficial to promote researchers around the world to discover specific drugs for covid-19 treatment as soon as possiblewe searched the official and preprint websites pubmed and china national knowledge infrastructure cnki databases to identify literature with the following terms sars-cov-2 or 2019-ncov or covid-19 or novel coronavirus pneumonia ncp from december 2019 to april 2020 those papers with a description with drugs for covid-19 treatment were selected including full-length articles comments news correspondences editorials reviews government reports case reports and especially clinical or fundamental studies we screened out chemical drugs tcms and biological medicines that played potentially therapeutic effects on covid-19 supported by scientific data the review will be updated and revised with the increasing clinical studies on these drugs for the treatment of covid-19sars-cov-2 is a single-stranded rna virus whose genetic characteristics are obviously different from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov national health commission national administration of traditional chinese medicine 2020 li et al 2020b current research showed that sars-cov-2 had more than 85 homology with bat sars-like coronavirus bat-sl-covzc45 suggesting that bat is probably the natural host of sars-cov-2xu et al 2020ab zhou et al 2020 moreover many wild animals may become the potential intermediate hosts of sars-cov-2 such as swinhoe bamboo rat and badgerli et al 2020c in addition to patients with sars-cov-2 infection that are the main source of infection asymptomatic patients may also spread this virus from person to person humans are mainly infected by sars-cov-2 through respiratory droplets or close contact with patients chinese academician zhong nanshan team obtained the latest clinical manifestations of sars-cov-2 infected patients by analyzing 1099 cases which is the largest sample analysis to date results pointed out that only 438 showed fever symptom in the early stage and fever accounted for 879 after hospitalization fever and cough are the most common symptoms of covid-19 a few patients are accompanied by myalgia diarrhea and vomiting the latent period of covid-19 was 0-24 days the above symptoms can rapidly develop to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock metabolic acidosis coagulation dysfunction or multiple organ failure in severe cases huang et al 2020abc covid-19 is classified into mild common severe and critically ill based on the severity of disease symptomskaletra consists of two kinds of protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir which both can block the division of gag-pol polyproteins and generate non-infectious virus particles to specifically inhibit retroviral infectionvan der laan et al 2018 initially this drug is mainly used to treat human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection in adults and children over 2 years of age studies in vitro experiments showed that lopinavir and ritonavir could reduce the levels of sars-cov and mers-covchu et al 2004 based on the results of substantial clinical benefits of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients with sars-cov infection scientists speculated that this drug might be effective in patients with sars-cov-2 infectionhuang et al 2020abc the team in zhongshan university constructed a structural model of two new coronavirus proteases-coronavirus endopeptidase c30 and papain-like protein through homology modeling and docked lopinavirritonavir with protease models respectively results showed that lopinavir and ritonavir more easily combined with coronavirus endopeptidase c30 compared with papain-like enzymes which expressed excellent anti-sars-cov-2 effectslin et al 2020 however after using lopinavirritonavir tablets in 40 patients diagnosed with covid-19 29 cases had adverse reactions related to lopinavirritonavir such as the elevated triglycerides nausea and diarrhealiang et al 2020 therefore larger clinical trials of this drug should focus on its safetyribavirin a broad-spectrum antiviral drug can be phosphorylated in red blood cells to produce ribavirin monophosphate diphosphate and triphosphate ribavirin monophosphate is a strong inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase which can inhibit cellular guanylate synthesis reduce cellular guanylate triphosphate and block viral nucleic acid synthesis ribavirin triphosphate inhibits influenza virus rna polymerase thereby interfering with virus replicationknowles et al 2003 oral ribavirin administration with or without intravenous immunoglobulin is a well-tolerated treatment for respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection in moderately to severely immunocompromised hostsmarcelin et al 2014 in addition ribavirin was also active against dengue virus denv with the half effective concentration ec50 of 3 moll in a549 cellschang et al 2011 when ribavirin was used in combination with ifn-2b anti-mers-cov activity of ribavirin was significantly enhanced in rhesus macaquesfalzarano et al 2013 ribavirin was shown to inhibit sars-cov replication in five different cell types derived from animals or humans at therapeutically achievable concentrationmorgenstern et al 2005 however some adverse reactions should be noted during ribavirin application for example 61 of patients developed hemolytic anemia 58 hypocalcemia and 46 hypomagnesemia in 110 sars patients treated with ribavirinknowles et al 2003 given the efficacy of ribavirin in the treatment of diseases caused by sars-cov and mers-cov it is expected to become an effective drug for covid-19 treatment however the efficacy of ribavirin for the treatment of covid-19 is still controversial which are needed to further confirm in clinical trialschloroquine is an anti-malarial and anti-inflammatory drug which is widely used in the treatment of malaria and rheumatoid arthritis for more than 70 years anti-malarial effect of chloroquine may interfere with the replication and transcription of the plasmodium schizont dna or hinder its endocytosis thereby leading to the parasite to die due to amino acids deficiency chloroquine also has immunomodulatory activity which can synergistically enhance antiviral effectswang et al 2020abcde chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine destroy the terminal glycosylation of angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 in vitro therefore chloroquine may be potent inhibitors of sars-cov-2 infection based on the results of previous studies chloroquine phosphate has a therapeutic effect on covid-19 in vitrowang et al 2020abcde at present several clinical trials were successively announced the results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial revealed that hydroxychloroquine was significantly associated with viral load reduction or disappearance in patients with covid-19 philippe et al 2020 similarly another randomized clinical trial also confirmed the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine on covid-19 which are manifested with the shortening of the body temperature recovery time and the cough remission time of patients with covid-19 chen et al 2020a 2020b 2020c preliminary evidence from a multicenter prospective observational study showed that the median time to undetectable viral rna was shorter in chloroquine than in non-chloroquine and no serious adverse reactions were observed in the chloroquine group huang et al 2020abc in contrast the results of some clinical studies showed negative for the treatment of covid-19 with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for example an open-label randomized controlled trial indicated that hydroxychloroquine did not result in a higher negative conversion probability than standard-of-care alone in mild to moderate covid-19 patients and adverse events especially diarrhea were higher after receiving hydroxychloroquinetang et al 2020 another randomized double-blinded phase b clinical trial showed that the high dosage chloroquine phosphate group total 12 g presented more qtc500 ms and higher mortality rate 17 than the low dosage group total 27 g mayla et al 2020 hence the safety and efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 still need to be testified by more and bigger clinical trials 44 arbidol
arbidol inhibits the fusion between viral envelope and cell membrane of the target cells thereby preventing the virus from entering the target cellsteissier et al 2011 arbidol is often used to resist influenza viruses in russia and china which has not yet been approved for marketing in other countries in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that arbidol has antiviral activity against influenza virus rsv rhinovirus coxsackie virus coxsackie virus b5 and adenovirusshi et al 2007 zhong et al 2009 previous studies have shown that arbidol can inhibit rna viruses and filoviridae such as sars-cov and mers-covguan et al 2018 hulseberg et al 2019 chinese scientists found that arbidol could effectively inhibit the pathological effects of sars-cov-2 at a concentration of 1030 moll with 60 times of viral load in vitro through screening a variety of antiviral drugs at present two rcts have been initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of arbidol in the treatment of covid-19 in chinafavipiravir is a viral rna polymerase inhibitor which can be mediated by its metabolite ribofuranosyl-5-triphosphate rtp that inhibits influenza virus rna polymerase activity favipiravir was urgently used and presented good inhibitory effects on ebola virus in 2014nagata et al 2015 despite of fairly modest antiviral activity favisiravir could completely inhibit murine norovirus mnv replication at a concentration of 100 gml with little or no side effects on cells cell survival rate 80rocha-pereira et al 2012 favipiravir is proven to protect mice from lethal infection with various influenza virusesfuruta et al 2013 however previous reports showed that favipiravir might have a prolonged qt interval during treatment which should be paid attention to monitoring during medicationkumagai et al 2015 favipiravir has been officially approved by chinese medical products administration for marketing and formally put into production in china favipiravir is the first approved drug with the potential curative effect on covid-19 in china which will play an important role in prevention and control of sars-cov-2 infectionremdesivir produced by gilead sciences inc is mainly used as a test drug against ebola virus one review suggested that remdesivir might be more suitable against coronavirusesjohn 2020 remdesivir has a strong anti-filovirus effect in vitro and a certain anti-coronavirus effect through inhibiting rna-dependent rna synthetase in animal experimentswang et al 2020b zumla et al 2016 subsequent research found that remdesivir was not only effective against ebola virus but also inhibits respiratory syncytial virus coronavirus nipah virus and hendra viruswarren et al 2016 researchers reported that the first covid-19 patient in the united states recovered after receiving remdesivir treatmentholshue et al 2020 in november 2019 the results of a phase ii clinical trial showed that 175 of 681 ebola patients were treated with remdesivir following 29 serious adverse reactions only one of which was related to remdesivirmulangu et al 2019 research showed that giving remdesivir could prevent rhesus macaques from getting sick before mers-cov infection and improve their symptoms after being infectedde wit et al 2020 furthermore remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection had a clear clinical benefit in sars-cov-2-infected rhesus macaques which predicted that early remdesivir treatment initiation in covid-19 patients might prevent progression to severe pneumoniabrandi et al 2020 chinese scientists have found that ec50 of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 is 077 moll in vero e6 cells and the selection index si is greater than 129 indicating that this drug can effectively inhibit sars-cov- 2 infection in vitrowang et al 2020abcde preliminary results from a clinical trial conducted by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid in usa showed that the patients who received remdesivir had 31 faster time to recovery than those who received placebo indicating that remdesivir has a significant positive effect in reducing recovery time for patients with covid-19 in addition gilead sciences inc also announced that similar clinical improvements after the 5-day and 10-day remdesivir administration in patients with severe covid-19 were found even without a placebo control however a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled multicentre clinical trial conducted by chinese scientists revealed that remdesivir did not accelerate recovery or reduce the mortality in patients with severe covid-19 compared with the placebo group the rate of early discontinuation due to adverse events including nausea vomiting and cardiopulmonary failure was higher in the group receiving remdesivir than that in the placebo group 116 versus 51 although this is the first high-quality clinical trial of remdesivir in the treatment of covid-19 so far only 237 samples are included in the clinical trialwang et al 2020abcde therefore the antiviral efficacy and safety of remdesivir still need to be supported by more high-quality and larger sample clinical studiesglycyrrhizic acid ga is the principal bioactive ingredient isolated from chinese herb glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma the latest glycyrrhizic acid preparations are oral ga and pure alpha ga preparation ga has a direct antiviral effect on hepatitis b virus via affecting the hepatitis b surface antigen to extracellular secretion ga can significantly inhibit hiv proliferation through immune activationsun et al 2019 a study published by stanford university and the university of hong kong proved that ga could bind to ace2 which testified that ga preparation might have potential value in preventing sars-cov-2 infection studies have shown that ga can not only exert antiviral effects by regulating immune function but also has a clear anti-inflammatory mechanismli et al 2017 a number of experts in hubei province of china said that patients with severe covid-19 could trigger an inflammatory storm leading to multiple organ failure ga derivatives also presented the antiviral activity against sars-covhoever et al 2005 a clinical retrospectively analysis of 73 sars patients showed that compound glycyrrhizin could improve the symptoms of dry cough chest tightness shortness of breath and other symptoms which is believed that compound glycyrrhizin has a certain effect on sars-covlu et al 2003 at present the commonly used oral ga  vitamin c for the treatment of covid-19 has been approved in a clinical trial in chinain addition a study revealed that several active natural products and tcms might have therapeutic effects on covid-19 through screening the self-built highly pharmaceutical compound database and medicinal plant-derived compound component database the active ingredients of tcms such as deoxyrhapontin in rhei radix et rhizoma chalcone in sophorae tonkinensis radix et rhizoma polydatin in polygoni cuspidate rhizoma et radix and shikonin in arnebiae radix have good inhibitory effects against sars-cov-2 although clinical studies about these active ingredients of tcms have not been conducted this discovery provides strong evidence for clinical research and treatment of covid-19 with tcmschinese herbal compound prescription refers to a prescription consisting of two or more components for the treatment of a relatively certain disease and syndrome which has a relatively prescribed processing method and usage method each herb in chinese herbal compound prescription has specific curative effect which cooperates with each other to increase the curative effect or reduce toxicity and adverse reactions chinese herbal compound prescriptions are widely applied in clinical practice which has overall comprehensive effects of broad-spectrum antibacterial antiviral and immune function regulationhuoxiang zhengqi hxzq is used as a common chinese herbal compound prescription

such as wuhan hospital of traditional chinese medicine hubei provincial hospital of integrated chinese  western medicine and jiangxia shelter hospital results of the relevant cohort studies on covid-19 treated with xfbd are being sorted out xfbd can significantly reduce fever cough fatigue and other symptoms of the mild and common patients and prevent mild to severe in preliminary clinical studies the important targets of xfbd are mainly enriched in the pathways related to viral infection and lung injury through network pharmacology analysis suggesting that the mechanism of xfbd for the treatment of covid-19 is mainly related to combating viral infection and repairing lung injurywang et al 2020bshuanghuanglian is composed of lonicerae japonicae flos scutellariae radix and forsythiae fructus which has been used to prevent infection for more than 2000 years in china the common formulations on the market include granule oral solution and injection shuanghuanglian has multiple pharmacological activities including antibacterial antiviral and immune-enhancing functions previous studies have shown that shuanghuanglian injection has obvious antiviral effects against influenza a virus h5n1 in vivo and in vitrotang et al 2018 a systematic review of rcts suggested that shuanghuanglian could be applied for the treatment of acute upper respiratory tract infectionzhang et al 2013 preliminary studies in vitro found that shuanghuanglian oral solution inhibited sars-cov-2 but whether shuanghuanglian is effective against covid-19 requires a large number of clinical trials to confirm at present shuanghuanglian has been clinically studied in shanghai public health clinical center and tongji hospital affiliated to huazhong university of science and technology shanghai

and gastroenteritis has anti-inflammatory blood coagulation regulation vascular endothelial protection immunity-enhancing and other functions through the multi-components multi-targets and multi-pathways mechanismma et al 2009 ma et al 2015 xuebijing injection is mainly used for anti-infective treatment which can antagonize endotoxin and inflammatory mediators and improve lung and systemic inflammation in the treatment of coronavirusli et al 2020abcde in clinical application xuebijing injection had a significant effect on inflammation storm and low blood oxygen saturation caused by sars-cov-2 infection a retrospective analysis of 44 patients with common covid-19 found that xuebijing treatment could promote the absorption of lung infection lesions thereby improving the efficacy but xuebijing had no obvious efficacy on inflammatory indexes including white blood count lymphocyte count percentage of lymphocytes crp and ferritin zhang et al 2020abcd few patients may experience itchy skin after injecting xuebijing injection the incidence of xuebijing injection is reported differently probably between 268 and 4lu and fan 2013 the components of shenfu injection that is used clinically to treat septic shock include ginseng radix et rhizoma rubra and aconiti lateralis radix praeparata extract which contain the active ingredients ginsenosides and water-soluble alkaloids occasionally allergic reactions may occur after shenfu injection treatment an analysis on 23 rcts containing 1804 participants showed that the combination of shengmai injection and chemical drugs could achieve a better effect than drugs alone in terms of improving the clinical total effective rate pulmonary function blood gas index immunoglobulin and crp levels and the lung rale disappearance time of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copdhuang et al 2019 but shengmai injection may cause adverse reactions such as allergic rash and severe back pain the ingredients of reduning injection are artemisiae annuae herba lonicerae japonicae flos and gardeniae fructus which are used for relieving symptoms caused by upper respiratory tract infection such as high fever headache and cough reduning injection rescued death triggered by enterovirus 71 infection in vero cells and in micecao et al 2015 severe pneumonia induced by h1n1 influenza a virus could be reversed by the combination of ribavirin and redunning administrationma et al 2016 tanreqing injection is mainly used for the treatment of acute and chronic bronchitis pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infections caused by bacteria or viruses xingnaojing injection is well known for treating stroke in chinese clinic animal experiments showed that xingnaojing injection improved cerebral ischaemiareperfusion injury through inhibiting inflammatory response zhang et al 2020c a study revealed that xingnaojing had a positive effect on patients with fever poisoning and stroke-induced consciousness disturbancewu et al 2016 shenmai injection is increasingly used in tumor therapy which can obviously improve the immune function of tumor patients for example shenmai injection improved the postoperative immunological function of papillary thyroid carcinoma patients by inhibiting differentiation into treg cellsfang et al 2018 when combined with chemotherapeutic drugs shenmai injection reduces adverse reactions caused by chemotherapeutic drugs at present these chinese medicine injection preparations are mainly tried to treat middle and severe covid-19 cases in clinical trialsrecombinant human interferon- ifn- including ifn-1b and ifn-2b exerts broad-spectrum antiviral antitumor cell proliferation inhibition and immunity improvement on patients ifn- binding to cell surface receptors induces cells to produce a variety of antiviral proteins which inhibits viral proliferation in cells and improves immune ability through enhancing the phagocytosis of macrophages the cytotoxicity of lymphocytes to target cells and the vitality of natural killer nk cellschen et al 2016 sugita et al 1987 ifn-2b is widely used to treat some viral diseases such as acute and chronic viral hepatitis shingles and genital warts however ifn may have adverse reactions such as fever fatigue headache myalgia arthralgia loss of appetite and nausea at the early stage of medicationwang et al 2020c study showed that ifn-2b and ribavirin for the treatment of mers-cov infected rhesus macaques reduced virus replication moderated the host response and improved clinical outcomefalzarano et al 2013 in vivo studies also showed that ifn- played an effective role in promoting prognosis of mers-cov infectionmomattin et al 2013 by comparing the clinical effects of combined ifn- with glucocorticoid alone in treating patients with sars-cov infection the results showed that lung image remission time was reduced by 50 and oxygen saturation was significantly improved in ifn- treatment grouploutfy et al 2003 at present ifn- nebulized inhalation combined with other antiviral drugs such as ribavirin has been clinically tested for the treatment of covid-19 which achieved a good therapeutic effect however it is necessary to be alert to the microbial aerosols that may be generated during ifn- nebulized inhalation due to the possibility of aerosol transmission in sars-cov-2 infectionchen et al 2020a 2020b 2020c some medical protection and disinfection should be done to reduce the risk of infection by medical staff chinese clinical trial registry announced that clinical trial comparing the efficacy of new recombinant high-efficiency compound ifn and ifn- for the treatment of covid-19 has been registeredvaccines treatment is an effective method to prevent infection or improve the severity of diseaseswang and wang 2020 previous evidence showed that various vaccines were designed and synthesized to effectively prevent sars-cov and mers-cov infectionde wit et al 2016 development of vaccines need to take a long time involving virus strain isolation and selection in vitro experiments animal experiments clinical trials and administrative approval as of april 8 2020 a total of 115 covid-19 vaccine candidates in the world are under development 78 of which have been confirmed 73 of the 78 confirmed projects are currently in the exploratory or preclinical stage five fastest-growing vaccine candidates have entered clinical development stagethanh le et al 2020 inactivated vaccines recombinant protein vaccines adenovirus vector vaccines attenuated influenza virus vector live vaccines and nucleic acid vaccines against sars-cov-2 are being developed vaccines in china inactivated vaccines are the most effective path of vaccine development for newly emerging infectious diseases the latest reports indicated that chinese medical products administration has approved two clinical trials of inactivated vaccine against sars-cov-2 developed by wuhan institute of biological products co ltd combined with wuhan institute of virology and sinovac research  development co ltd respectively during recombinant protein vaccine development the construction of virus species has been completed and cell and virus species identification and genetic stability inspection animal experiments and safety evaluation testings currently are being carried out in china the adenoviral vector vaccine developed by chinese academician chen weis team was the first vaccine to be approved for clinical research currently the vaccination of the phase  clinical trial subjects of this vaccine has been completed and volunteers of the phase  clinical trial are being recruited which is the first vaccine strain against sars-cov-2 to launch the phase  clinical trial in the world moreover china has also completed the construction of attenuated influenza virus vector vaccine strains and the establishment of quality inspection methods following the quality process research and quality identification meanwhile animal experiments and safety evaluation experiments are also carried out in nucleic acid vaccine development process animal effectiveness and safety evaluation and the preparation and quality verification of clinical samples are being carried outstem cell therapy can promote endogenous injury repair by regulating the immune system and improving the microenvironment and inhibit the progression of acute inflammation in the lungs thereby relieving symptoms of respiratory distress studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells mscs can be effectively used for the treatment of mers-covzumla et al 2015 at present stem cell therapy of covid-19 is mainly focused on mscs and nk cells of which the most used is mscs on the basis of conventional treatment a 70 years old female patient with severe covid-19 was intravenously infused with allogeneic human umbilical cord mscs results showed that the main inflammatory factors il-6 and crp levels decreased the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes continuously decreased and the absolute values of t cells nk cells and b cells continued to rise results of ct imaging revealed that inflammation in the lungs gradually subsided without any adverse reactiongu et al 2020 thus mscs were shown to be safe and effective for critically ill patients with covid-19 up to now a number of medical institutions scientific research units and enterprises have launched related clinical research projects of mscs treatment of covid-19 in chinaju 2020 although stem cell therapy presents certain advantage against covid-19 more data and results are still needed to support the safety and efficacy of covid-19 treatmentcp therapy is applied for treating patients with infectious diseases through extracting the cured patients plasma serum or immunoglobulin which was widely used in infectious diseases outbreaks in recent years such as pandemic influenza sars and mersarabi et al 2015 cheng et al 2005 leider et al 2010 a systematic review showed that early treatment with cp might be more effective than late treatment with thatmair-jenkins et al 2015 in theory most of the patients with covid-19 will produce specific antibodies against sars-cov-2 after the recovery which can kill and clear the virus preliminary clinical studies also confirmed that crp and il-6 levels in 3 severe covid-19 patients after plasma exchange therapy were significantly reduced lymphocytes and prothrombin time were improved but inflammatory factors in patients treated with tocilizumab did not decreaseluo et al 2020the clinical symptoms improved significantly oxygen saturation and oxygenation index tended to improve and inflammation indicators also improved within 72 hours after cp infusion for a severe covid-19 patientli et al 2020b severe illness is the leading cause of covid-19-induced death therefore cp therapy may be an effective method to reduce mortality of severe covid-19 patients with serious inflammatory response in the absence of specific treatments in china cp therapy has been added to the diagnosis and treatment plan for the novel coronavirus infected pneumonia trial edition 7 which is applicable to the treatment of cases with rapid progression severe or critically ill however cp must be collected at an appropriate time and has a higher neutralizing antibody titerbai et al 2020at present a worldwide outbreak of covid-19 seriously affects peoples health and economic development sars-cov-2 infection has been widely caused in the general population and medical staff development of specific medicines or vaccines for the treatment of covid-19 is quite urgent chinese scientists tried various marketed drugs especially chemical drugs and tcms for the treatment of covid-19 a number of drugs with good effects against sars-cov-2 in vitro or preliminary clinical trials have emerged however there is still insufficient evidence to support the efficacy and safety of these drugs against sars-cov-2 some shortcomings exist in previous studies such as unreliable in vitro results non-standard clinical trials small sample size hence it is necessary to summarize these potential therapeutic drugs to ensure clinical medication safety and guide further standardized clinical researchchemical drugs have the advantages of clear composition rapid onset of action and strong antiviral ability due to the urgency of covid-19 treatment kaletra ribavirin chloroquine remdesivir arbidol and favipiravir were clinically used to antagonize sars-cov-2 in chinanational health commission national administration of traditional chinese medicine 2020 most of the above drugs show good antiviral effects during the treatment of sars-cov and mers-cov ribavirin favipiravir and remdesivir directly inhibit the viral rna polymerase leading to the premature termination of rna transcription arbidol inhibits the fusion between viral envelopeand cell membrane of the target cell preventing the virus from entering the target cell kaletra consists of two protease inhibitors that prevent the cleavage of gag-pol polyproteins resulting in the production of non-infectious virions chloroquine can interfere with the replication and transcription of pathogen dna although these chemical drugs have significant antiviral effects drug safety is an important factor to be considered in clinical application the latest clinical studies showed that lopinavir ritonavir and arbidol had no significant improvement on symptoms such as elevated body temperature or the shortening of the negative time of respiratory virus nucleic acid effect compared with the absence of any antiviral drugs in contrast the incidence of adverse reactions in the lopinavir and ritonavir groups was higher than that in the control group without antiviral drugs chloroquine and remdesivir are regarded as the promising chemical drugs against sars-cov-2 however the dosage and cycle of chloroquine need further clinical trials to confirm the clinical pharmacokinetic reports indicated that the oral half-life of chloroquine was as long as 5-60 days the median half-life is 21-30 days and the clinical lethal dose is 3-5 g therefore the clinical dosage of chloroquine needs to be adjusted according to individual differences of body weight and age the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for covid-19 treatment still lack more high-quality evidence therefore the application of these chemicals in the treatment of covid-19 should pay special attention to the latest clinical trials and drug safety studiestcm has been practiced clinically in china for thousands of years to relieve the symptoms of diseases and regulate immunity tcm is of great value in prevention and treatment of covid-19 the therapeutic effects of tcms including active ingredients of tcms chinese herbal compound prescriptions and chinese medicine injection preparations on covid-19 have been extensively studied currently active ingredients of tcms against sars-cov-2 are only studied in vitro or by computer simulation some studies have pointed out that ga can bind to ace2 by the molecular docking methods suggesting that ga preparations have potential application value for preventing sars-cov-2 infection there was a study that screened several tcms ingredients with anti-sars-cov-2 activity through virtual screening and enzymatic testing including emodin polydatin chalcone and shikonin however these active ingredients of tcms need to pass clinical trials to further confirm their efficacy against covid-19 hxzq jhqg lhqw sfjd ffts tjqw and qfpd suggested by chinese health authorities have all been tried in clinical trials all of which have shown good curative effects such as shorten the time for the patient to heal and relieve the development from mild to severexue et al 2020 hxzq can alleviate fatigue and gastrointestinal discomfort in patients with covid-19 jhqg lhqw and sfjd have similar effects which can improve the symptoms of fatigue and fever in covid-19 patients jhqg has a definite effect on the treatment of mild and common patients with covid-19 which can shorten the time of fever improve the normalization rate of lymphocytes and leukocytes and promote immunological function lhqw also shows good curative effect on mild and common patients with covid-19 which is manifested with relieving fever cough fatigue and other symptoms and effectively reducing the conversion rate of mildcommon to severeqfpd has a total effective rate of more than 90 in the early clinical treatment of covid-19 which is suitable for mild common and severe patientshe et al 2020 qfpd showed an important role in blocking the development of mild common to severe and critically ill and rescuing severe and critical illness hsbd and xfbd both are effective prescriptions summarized by chinese medical teams in the front-line clinical treatment of covid-19 based on clinical observations in wuhan which have good effects in blocking the progression of disease and improving symptoms especially in shortening the course of covid-19 in a clinical study of 50 mild covid-19 patients with tjqw oral adminstration the temperature of all patients returned to normal cough symptoms disappeared in 50 of patients symptoms of sore throat disappeared in 524 and symptoms of fatigue in 696 disappeared chinese medicine injections have also been clinically tested for severe and critically ill patients with covid-19 xiyanping reduning and tanreqing injections that all have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects can be used to treat patients with viral infection and mild bacterial infection xingnaojing injection has the effects of reducing fever resuscitating and refreshing the brain which is mainly aimed at patients with high fever following unconsciousness xuebijing injection can improve the cure rate and discharge rate of patients with covid-19 reduce the chance of conversion from severe to critically ill and promote the elimination of inflammatory factors shenmai injection can provide the immunity of patients which is mainly used to treat the immunosuppressed patients shenfu injection has the effect of resurrecting for patients with shock arachidonic acid metabolism pathway is involved in cytokine productionxiao et al 2005 the latest research showed that serum levels of inflammatory factors in patients with sars-cov-2 infection significantly increased suggesting that sars-cov-2 infection may involve cytokine stormalimuddin et al 2020 studies have screened 338 active ingredients of tcms that have potential inhibitory effects on the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway through the pharmacophore technologyren et al 2020 interestingly the above active ingredients existed in hxzq jhqg lhqw qfpd xuebijing injection reduning injection and tanreqing injection which suggested that the above tcms may resist sars-cov-2 infection by inhibiting the cytokine storm although tcms are effective and relatively safe for prevention and treatment of covid-19 clinical medication needs to be administered under the guidance of an experienced physician thereby avoiding adverse reactions due to overdose or misuse of tcms moreover clinical medication based on different symptoms and the severity of the disease is an important principle during the treatment of covid-19 with tcms for example preliminary clinical studies showed that lhqw was effective for the treatment of mild or common patients with sars-cov-2 infection which is manifested with the improvement of fever cough and diarrhea xuebijing had a wonderful effect on the treatment of severe and critically ill patients with covid-19both tcms and chemical drugs can complement each other rather than replacing each other which has been fully demonstrated in prevention and control of this outbreak of covid-19 tcm with a relatively wide range of treatment can improve the immunity and relieve symptoms in mild cases with covid-19 such as fever cough fatigue and sore throat in terms of severe covid-19 tcm can also reduce the progression from severe to critical illness thereby reducing the mortality rate chemical drugs have clear chemical composition and significant antiviral effect which can quickly inhibit sars-cov-2 infection the latest clinical evidence showed that the integrated traditional and western medicine for the treatment of covid-19 could significantly reduce the clinical symptoms of patients shorten the course of disease and improve the clinical cure ratexia et al 2020 a retrospective analysis of 71 discharged patients with covid-19 showed that the combination therapy of ifn- arbidol high-dose of vitamin c and tcms was effective against sars-cov-2huang et al 2020abc a systematic review showed that lhqw combined with western medicines significantly improved fever symptoms with good clinical safetyqi et al 2020 zhang bolis team observed the clinical effect of integrated traditional chinese and western medicine in the treatment of covid-19 the results showed that compared with the pure western medicine group 13 cases of commonl type 4 cases of severe and 1 case of critically ill the average days of treatment in the integrated traditional chinese and western medicine treatment group 27 cases of common type 6 cases of severe and 1 case of critically ill was shortened from 715 days to 515 days the average recovery time of body temperature was shortened from 438 days to 264 days the average time of hospital stay was shortened from 959 days to 738 days the improvement rate of ct imaging was increased from 688 to 882 clinical cure rate was increased from 611 to 941 the conversion rate of common to severe and critically ill was reduced from 353 to 59xia et al 2020biological products are currently an important means for treating severe covid-19 which can effectively relieve patients symptoms to reduce mortality development of biological products mainly includes ifn- vaccines stem cells and cp although the theoretical incidence of adverse events induced by ifn- nebulized inhalation may be lower than that of traditional administration routes the relevant medication monitoring should still be donewu et al 2020 ifn- is often used clinically in combination with other antiviral drugs to treat covid-19 such as ribavirin and favipiravir the dosage drug stability adverse reactions and the risk of secondary infection should be fully considered during ifn aerosol inhalation vaccine treatment is an effective method to prevent and treat covid-19 but the development of vaccines needs to take a long time the safety and effectiveness of drugs in vaccine development process require sufficient clinical data to verify fortunately the adenoviral vector vaccine that is independently developed by chinas team has entered the phase  clinical trials stem cell therapy also shows certain potential for covid-19 treatment the application of mscs will give new clinical plan for covid-19 treatment preliminary clinical studies have shown that cp therapy has good efficacy for severe covid-19 treatment but cp with high-quality antibody titers is difficult to obtain in the absence of specific drugs cp therapy can become a first-aid method for covid-19 patients with severe or critically illchina has accumulated a bit of experience during the prevention and treatment of sars-cov-2 infection with the above drugs including chemical drugs tcms and biological products although these drugs are expected to be specific drugs for the treatment of covid-19 the adoption of these drugs without adequate evidence of efficacy and safety must be careful nowadays these potential drugs have been used to treat covid-19 by many countries and regions due to the outbreak of covid-19 the basic characteristics of these drugs including pharmacological effects indications and adverse reactions and especially advance on the treatment of covid-19 should be understood to promote reasonable medication and guide further basic research and clinical trialsthe authors have no conflict of interestin late december 2019 a pneumonia of unknown etiology emerged in wuhan city hubei province china patients presenting with acute respiratory failure were seen in the er and then admitted to icu facilities for further treatment 1 the causative pathogen was later identified as a novel coronavirus named as 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov by world health organization who or sars-cov-2 by the coronavirus study group csg of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv on february 12 2020 or human coronavirus 19 hcov-19 by a group of virologists in china 2 the who announced coronavirus disease 19 covid-19 as the official name of the disease respiratory droplet transmission is the main route of transmission and human-to-human transmission had been occurring among close contacts since the middle of december 2019 3 who declared covid-19 as pandemic on march 11 2020 as of april 22 2020 a total of 2475723 cases had been confirmed globally with 169151 deaths httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019coronaviruses which are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna viruses belong to the family coronaviridae they are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals 4 previously six coronavirus species were known to cause human disease including hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 hcov-hku1 sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 5 the first four species caused only mild symptoms but sars-cov and mers-cov have caused more than 10 thousand cumulative infections in humans in the past two decades with mortality rates of 10 for sars-cov and 34 for mers-cov respectively 6 7 8 sars-cov-2 is the seventh number of the family of coronavirus that can infect humans 9 although the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 is lower than that of mers-cov and sars-cov its transmissibility median r0 57 is much higher than that of either mers-cov r0 1 or sars-cov r0 3 10 genome sequencing analysis of clinically isolated samples from patients showed that sars-cov-2 shares 88 nucleotide similarity with two bat-derived sars-like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 but has only around 79 and 50 identity with sars-cov and mers-cov respectively 11 the genome of sars-cov-2 and other emerging pathogenic human coronaviruses encodes four major structural proteins including spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n as well as sixteen nonstructural proteins nsp1-16 plus five to eight accessory proteins 12 among them sars-cov-2 uses s protein to bind its host cell membrane receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 for virus entry fig 1
 and subsequent pathogenesis 13 phylogenetic analysis suggested that bats might be the primary reservoir for sars-cov-2 14 while the intermediate host is still under investigation the rapid worldwide expansion of sars-cov-2 calls for smart poct diagnostic approaches safe and effective vaccines as well as novel therapeutics to detect prevent and cure covid-19 infection here we highlight the safety and effectiveness of vaccines with respect to dr shibo jiangs recent appeal that safety be foremost on the minds of vaccine developers as they begin to engage in preclinical and clinical trials to tackle sars-cov-2 15 here we briefly summarize current diagnostic approaches and development of vaccines and therapeutics for sars-cov-2those infected with sars-cov-2 may present with such symptoms as fever dry cough fatigue or shortness of breath with or without nasal congestion runny nose or other respiratory symptoms 1 however patients with mild symptoms may not present any positive signs thus rapid and accurate detection of the causative pathogen is essential in controlling the outbreak among both asymptomatic carriers and individuals showing signs of the disease however since sars-cov-2 is a newly discovered virus the diagnostic toolkit is limitedup to now sars-cov-2 has been detected from clinical specimens analyzed by electron microscopy cell culture real-time reverse-transcription pcr rt-pcr and next-generation sequencing 9 molecular tests for rapid detection of the causative virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients meanwhile rt-pcr which combines the reverse transcription of rna and amplification of specific cdna regions remains the primary means of diagnosing sars-cov-2 16 normally sputum lower respiratory tract secretions blood urine or stool samples are collected form suspected patients nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs are the recommended upper respiratory tract specimen types for sars-cov-2 detection 17 the university of hong kong-shenzhen hospital enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to wuhan from shenzhen between december 29 2019 and january 4 2020 nasopharyngeal or throat swabs were collected after rna extraction an rt-pcr assay was performed to amplify the genes encoding the internal rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and the surface spike s protein of sars-cov-2 phylogenetic analysis of the rt-pcr amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing confirmed that the family was indeed infected by sars-cov-2 18 prof poons group developed two 1-step quantitative rt-pcr assays to detect the orf1b and n genes of sars-cov-2 the assays were evaluated using a panel of positive rna extracted from cells infected by sars coronavirus and negative controls the detection limits were found to be below 10 copies per reaction and samples from two sars-cov-2 infected patients were positive in the tests 19 samples from all collections contained sputum as well as nose and throat swabs with or without viral transport medium rna extraction and rt-pcr were performed to amplify the rdrp e and n genes of sars-cov-2 the assays were highly sensitive and specific because they did not cross-react with other coronaviruses 20collection of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens may cause discomfort and bleeding especially in patients with thrombocytopenia 18 this method also requires close contact between healthcare workers and patients which poses a risk of transmission 17 consequently neither nasopharyngeal nor oropharyngeal specimens are ideal for serial monitoring of viral load one study used saliva to screen respiratory viruses among hospitalized patients without fever or respiratory symptoms 21 prof yuens group collected saliva from 12 hong kong patients with laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and the novel coronavirus could be detected in the saliva specimens of 11 patients 917 by in-house one-step real time rt-qpcr assay targeting the s gene 17 suggesting that saliva could be a practical noninvasive specimen type several rapid diagnostic kits for sars-cov-2 detection are now commercially available among them one is from the beijing genome institute bgi it can detect multiple pathogens using sequencing and microarray technologies and it has been approved for clinical use 16several major biotechnology companies have advanced nucleic acid platforms for covid-19 vaccine development the innovation and value initiative ivi inovio and the korea national institute of health knih are collaborating with the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi to test the safety and immunogenicity of a dna vaccine named ino-4800 in phase 12 clinical trial in south korea 24 both modernanih and curevac are focusing on mrna vaccine development and a safety clinical trial of modernas candidate vaccine mrna-1273 with a sample size of 45 volunteers was performed in march 2020 25subunit vaccines based on recombinant s or s1 protein of sars-cov and mers-cov have been demonstrated to be efficacious in many studies 26 27 28 29 clover biopharmaceuticals is developing a vaccine consisting of a trimerized sars-cov-2 s protein using their patented trimer-tag technology 30 the receptor-binding domain rbd in sars-cov-2 s protein was identified and it was further demonstrated that sars-cov-2 rbd exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ace2 receptor compared to binding between sars-cov rbd and ace2 31 suggesting that the rbd-based sars-cov vaccines have the potential to be developed for prevention of sars-cov-2 infections rbd-based vaccines are now under development by several organizations through international collaborations 32 the pulmonary surfactant-biomimetic nanoparticles used to potentiate heterosubtypic influenza immunity can be used as adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of sars-cov-2 subunit vaccines 33whole inactivated or live-attenuated virus vaccines represent a traditional vaccine strategy researchers at the university of hong kong have developed a live influenza vaccine that expresses sars-cov-2 proteins 34 codagenix has developed a codon deoptimization technology to attenuate viruses and the company is exploring covid-19 vaccine strategies 35vaccines based on viral vectors offer a high level of protein expression and long-term stability and induce strong immune responses 36 johnson  johnson is developing an adenovirus-vectored vaccine using advacperc6 vaccine platforms 37 the first covid-19 vaccine candidate based on adenovirus-vectored vaccine developed by chen wei group entered human clinical testing nct04313127 with unprecedented rapidity early on 16 march 2020 another phase i safety trial of a recombinant adenovirus vaccine candidate cansino biologics inc tianjin china ad5-ncov recruited 108 healthy adults in wuhan china in march 2020 38 apart from adenovirus vector-based vaccine two lentivirus vector-based vaccine candidates covid-19aapc and lv-smenp-dc have been developed by shenzhen geno-immune medical institute the covid-19aapc vaccine was developed by applying lentivirus modification including the sars-cov-2 minigenes and immune modulatory genes to the artificial antigen presenting cells aapcs the phase i clinical trial consisting of 100 participants started on february 15 2020 and the estimated study completion date was december 31 2024 nct04299724 the lv-smenp dc vaccine was developed by modifying dc with lentivirus vectors expressing sars-cov-2 minigene smenp and immune modulatory genes the phase i clinical trial involving 100 patients was conducted on march 24 2020 and the estimated study completion date was also december 31 2024 nct04276896 httpclinicaltrialsgovas we all know that adjuvants play a critical role by enhancing immunogenicity of the vaccine candidates and make dose viable in some vaccine platforms so far there are at least 10 developers have engaged into developing adjuvanted covid-19 vaccines vaccine developers dynavax seqirus and glaxosmithkline have committed to making some liscensed adjuvants including mf59 as03 and cpg 1018 available for use 36no matter which platform we take to develop the covid-19 vaccines researchers need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the candidate vaccine at each step in this situation sars-cov-2 specific animal models seems quite essential until now some different animal models are under developed including hamsters ferrets ace2-transgenic mice and non-human primates 36specific drugs to treat the novel coronavirus will probably take several years to develop and evaluate however a range of existing host-directed therapies are under investigation for example clinical trials with protease inhibitors clinical trialsgov nct04276688 nct04255017 and so on and nucleotide analog remdesivir clinical trialsgov nct04280705 nct04257656 nct04252664 and so on are ongoing in china and the united states 39lopinavir and ritonavir two licensed hiv protease inhibitors have been tested in combination for efficacy in 99 covid-19 patients in china but the results suggested no difference in the clinical outcome when compared with standard care 40 still one 54-year-old male the third patient diagnosed with covid-19 infection in korea did show a significant decrease in viral load after lopinavirritonavir administration and no virus titer was observed 41 the preliminary results of a clinical trial on favipiravir for the treatment of covid-19 with a total of 80 patients showed that favipiravir had more potent antiviral action than that of lopinavirritonavir 42 future trials on patients with severe covid-19 may help to confirm or exclude the efficacy of lopinavirritonavir treatmentremdesivir the antiviral agent was designed for the ebola virus infection and it was shown broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several rna viruses 43 remdesivir was shown to be highly effective in the control of sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 44 it was used to treat the first case of covid-19 infection in the united states and the patients clinical condition improved after only one day 45 indicating the promise of remdesivir an anti-sars-cov-2 drug several clinical trials are ongoingit has been demonstrated that sars-cov-2 uses the same cell entry receptor ace2 as sars-cov 13 the use of recombinant ace2 race2 to neutralize the virus clinical trialsgov nct04287686 is now under clinical investigation 39 in vitro studies have demonstrated that vero cells pretreated with chloroquine are refractory to sars-cov infection by interruption of the glycosylation process 46 chloroquine has been demonstrated to be highly effective in the control of sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 44 accordingly chloroquine was first tested in clinical trial by chinese investigators on more than 100 patients with covid-19 and it showed a reduction in the duration of symptoms and exacerbation of pneumonia along with radiological improvement leading to virus-negative seroconversion 47 hydroxychloroquine a less toxic derivative of chloroquine was shown to be effective in inhibiting sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 48 however no confirmed results from a normalized clinical trial clihydroxychloroquine along with azithromycin was tested by french investigators on patients with covid-19 and it showed that 100 patients with covid-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin exhibited virological cure on day 6 of the treatment however only 571 of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone have exhibited virologocal cure 49 however its use for treatment of covid-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial was against by the us fda due to risk of heart rhythm problems httpswwwfdagovdrugsdrug-safety-and-availabilityfda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-oranother interesting strategy is to use convalescent plasma cp as treatment but it should be noted that cp should be collected within two weeks after recovery to ensure a high neutralization antibody titer 50 it was reported that sars-cov-2 isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a severe patient could be neutralized by sera from several other patients 51 another preliminary uncontrolled case involved 5 patients with severe covid-19 after they were administered cp containing neutralizing antibodies nab their clinical status improved 52 one dose of 200 ml of cp with the nab titers above 1640 was transfused to 10 patients with severe covid-19 as an addition to maximal supportive care and administration of antiviral agents the clinical symptoms were significantly improved within 3 days and several parameters were improved compared to pretransfusion including decreased c-reactive protein and increased lymphocyte counts 53 presently 36 clinical trials are ongoing worldwide httpclinicaltrialsgovprevious research on mers-cov- and sars-cov-specific nabs may provide valuable guidelines for rapid design and development of sars-cov-2-specific nabs among the structural proteins of sars-cov-2 s fragments such as s1-ntd rbd and s2 can be considered as targets for nab development 12 polycloncal human immunoglobulin g igg derived from transgenic cows has been tested successfully for mers-cov in animal models 54 and this strategy has been tested for safety in clinical trials clinical trialsgov nct02788188 because of the high identity of the rbd in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the cross-reactivity of sars-cov-specific human monoclonal antibodies was tested on sars-cov-2 and it was found that only cr3022 bound potently with sars-cov-2 55 indicating that cr3022 might be a potential therapeutic candidate for treatment of covid-19 infections cocktails consisting of antibodies specific for rbd and other regions in the s protein can be considered to further improve the breadth and efficacy of nabs against sars-cov-2 infection 12studies have also revealed that some coronavirus entry inhibitors have potential to be developed for treatment or prevention of sars-cov-2 infection the peptides derived from the hr2 domain of the spike proteins of sars-cov 56 mers-cov 6 and sars-cov-2 57 58 have been shown to be effective against the fusion entry and replication of the corresponding coronavirus a pan-corovirus fusion inhibitor ek1 were reported to be highly effective against divergent human coronaviruses including sars-cov mers-cov hcov-oc43 hcov-229e hcov-nl-63 and sars-cov-2 as well as several bat sars-related coronaviruses sarsr-covs 58 59 a series of lipopeptides derived from ek1 which targeted the hr1 domain were highly potent in inhibiting entry and infection of divergent human coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 for example the lipopeptide ek1c4 inhibited sars-cov-2 s protein-mediated membrane fusion with ic50 of 13 nm 57 therefore these peptides have great potential to be further developed as a therapeutic or prophylactic for treatment or prevention of the current sars-cov-2 and mers-cov infection and future emerging and reemerging coronavirus infectionsresearchers announced that darunavir which is a second-generation hiv-1 protease inhibitor inhibited sars-cov-2 infection in vitro and that the inhibition efficiency was 280-fold over that of the untreated group 42 another trial nct04304053 is looking at the efficacy of a durunavircobicistat plus choroquine treatment 60 chinese herbal medicines such as radix sophorae and rhizoma polygoni cuspidati may contain agents against sars-cov-2 42 the combination of traditional chinese and western medicine treatments is also promising nonetheless the efficacy and safety of all these potential candidates in the treatment of covid-19 need to be confirmed in further preclinical and clinical trials however development of safe and effective covid-19 therapeutics is often hampered by the lack of valid covid-19 animal models for evaluation their in vivo safety and efficacy 61here we reviewed recently published information about diagnostic approaches as well as vaccine and treatment development for sars-cov-2 quickly identifying a person with sars-cov-2 infection is critical to control the continuing spread of the virus the noninvasive specimen collection strategy has the advantage when collecting clinical specimens it cannot be overstated that both vaccine development and investigation into potential drugs are subject to further studies to validate safety and efficacy including for example immunization strategies adjuvant selection or establishment of animal models international collaborations or consortia will promote covid-19 and move vaccine development forward safety evaluation of candidate vaccines against sars-cov-2 is paramount and this issue is related to the type of vaccines to be selected and immunogens to be designed potential therapeutics include lopinavirritonavir remdesivir chloroquine hydroxychloroquine cp and polyclonalmonoclonal antibodies again however clinical trials are needed for further confirmation of the efficacy and safety of these agents in treating covid-19the authors declare no conflicts of intereston december 31 2019 the world health organization who china country office was informed by the chinese authorities of a series of pneumonia cases with unknown etiology unknown cause in wuhan hubei china with clinical presentations that greatly resembled viral pneumonia the chinese authorities have isolated a causal agent on 7 january 2020 which was identified as a new type of coronavirus novel coronavirus ncov 1 titled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and the disease it causes coronavirus disease covid-19 2after emerging in china the virus has spread rapidly throughout the world on april 29 2020 there were 3162438 confirmed cases throughout the world with 219287 deaths due to covid-19 3 these numbers were escalating rapidly day by daythe research community has responded rapidly to this new threat to humanity on march 19 2020 a simple search of pubmed using the most common terms associated with the new virus and disease coronavirus or covid-19 or covid 19 or sars-cov-2 revealed that almost 2000 such articles were published since december 1 2019 however cursory browsing of those articles indicated that the majority of them appeared to be editorials news and opinionsthis is the third coronavirus epidemic in the third millennium after severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome mers in 2012 it is highly pathogenic and requires urgent action in the research community 4 mapping research methodology of published original studies and registered clinical trials since the outbreak of pandemic will help researchers in getting a better overview of relevant studies published thus far and how fast the research community has responded to the new health threat immediately following the outbreakthis study aimed to identify and classify published original research studies preprint articles and registered clinical trials regarding the sars-cov-2 and covid-19 from december 1 2019 until marchapril 2020 the period which would correspond to the first months following the outbreak we did not include an earlier period because the first official report about the new disease was submitted to the who on december 31 2019 1we defined protocol for this review prospectively and for transparency the protocol was published on open science framework osf url httpsosfiodzvxc after the final draft of the protocol was endorsed by all co-authors and before the commencement of any workwe included original studies of any study design that reported original data related to the virus sars-cov-2 and disease it causes covid-19 from december 1 2019 onwards we searched for records without language restrictions we excluded articles reporting editorials news opinions and other types of articles that did not report original research data all excluded articles were tabulated with references and reasons for exclusion we included articles posted on preprint servers medrxiv and biorxiv as well as registered protocols of clinical trials about sars-cov-2 and covid-19to retrieve published original studies we used publicly available who database of publications on coronavirus disease covid-19 5 the who has created this database based on searches of bibliographic databases and hand-searching of tables of contents of relevant journals as well as other scientific articles that came to their attention 5 we conducted a separate initial search of medline using common keywords related to covid-19 coronavirus or covid-19 or covid 19 or sars-cov-2 and we found a similar number of records as presented in the who database we downloaded the full database in excel and endnote format on march 19 2020we downloaded a list of preprint articles published in medrxiv and biorxiv on april 3 2020 the download was made via web site of the medrxiv httpswwwmedrxivorg where there is a link to covid-19 sars-cov-2 preprints from medrxiv and biorxiv we accessed registered protocols of clinical trials from the who international clinical trials registry platform who ictrp on april 7 2020 for both preprint articles and clinical trial registrations we did not conduct any searches as these information sources had pre-curated collections devoted to covid-19 and they do not publish other types of content two authors screened preprint articles and clinical trial registrations to make sure they were about covid-19for published articles two review authors screened all records titlesabstracts retrieved from the who database for each record they noted their opinion on whether the study was eligible or not and if not what was the reason not related to the topic not an original study report we retrieved full texts of eligible or potentially eligible studies and two review authors independently screened them for each full text reviewers recorded their opinion about study eligibility and reasons for exclusion not related to the topic not an original study report disagreements between reviewers in the second screening phase evaluating full texts were resolved via discussion or involvement of other authors for preprint articles and registered clinical trials one author verified their eligibility because they were downloaded from curated collections dedicated to covid-19for published studies one review author extracted the data and another author verified data extraction disagreements were resolved via discussion or involvement of the third author if necessary we extracted the following data related to characteristics of

covid-19 in terms of scholarly dissemination output the earliest date of onset of covid-19 symptoms was reported as december 1 2020 10 and december 8 2019 11 our study shows that within about 3 months since the earliest reported date of onset of symptoms more than two thousand articles were published in scholarly journals a quarter of which had original data within 4 months from the public announcement 11 about the new disease 1100 preprint articles were published and almost 1000 clinical trials registeredthe majority of studies came from china which is understandable as the disease originated there thus chinese scientists had a head start in exploring the disease the majority of the first studies with original data that were published in scholarly journals had observational study design which is understandable as interventional studies usually take more time to be completed however the research community has responded rapidly with designing and registering clinical trials on covid-19even though the majority of journal articles with original data were published in english a quarter was published in the chinese language this is concerning because those manuscripts may likely have valuable data but they will be difficult to read and access by an audience that does not speak chinese furthermore this may prove challenging for conducting evidence syntheses if the authors conducting systematic reviews and similar studies are unable to access or translate studies published in chinese those studies may not be included in evidence syntheses thus contributing to biased evidence syntheses some authors of evidence syntheses deliberately upfront exclude articles published in languages other than english 12 our results indicate that this may not be advisable in the evidence syntheses about covid-19the median jif of published articles was 5099 which is rather high it indicates that early articles were published in many high-impact journals even if they described case reports or case series because of the novelty of the disease it is likely that those journals were also able to accommodate submissions about covid-19 quickly and organize rapid peer-review and that those were journals with short turnaround times journals with professional staff would be in a better position to adapt quickly to publishing novel topic of interest compared to journals depending on volunteer staffwhile the majority of early articles about covid-19 in scholarly journals were observational mostly case reports the predominant type of early articles about covid-19 articles published on preprint servers included modeling studies this might be early view of studies that will be soon published in peer-reviewed journals but it remains to be seen how many of those preprint articles will actually pass the scrutiny of peer-review it is possible that the massive production of modeling studies is leading to difficulties with publishing them and that authors post those studies on a preprint server to make their work publicly available a large number of articles on preprint servers that we analyzed could be due to calls for authors to make their work publicly available in preprint servers along with submitting articles to peer-reviewed scholarly journals there were even suggestions that submission to a preprint should be the default for all submissions 13the majority of registered trials we analyzed were registered in the chinese registry of clinical trials which is contrary to the report that clinicaltrialsgov contains most of the global trial registrations 14 also the overwhelming majority of registered trials we analyzed were conducted in chinaalthough the aim of this study was not an in-depth analysis of outcomes and interventions that were used in registered trials about covid-19 our analysis of those trials indicates both the novelty of the disease as well as methodological shortcomings for example the majority of registered trials of interventions specified more than one primary outcome a clinical trial should have one primary outcome or a combination of co-primary outcomes but not multiple primary outcomes because primary outcomes are the basis for a sample size estimation primary outcomes and outcome measures were very different outcomes used in these trials should be used for informing the development of a core outcome set cos for covid-19 it is possible that trialists used multiple primary outcomes that were treated as exploratory due to the early phase of the pandemicvarious initiatives were already set up to start defining a cos for covid-19 at least one article about cos-covid has already been published 15 and multiple initiatives for developing cos for covid-19 were registered on the web site of the comet core outcome measures in effectiveness trials initiative 16many trials mentioned standard therapy or conventional therapy and it would be interesting to further investigate what is considered a standard or conventional therapy for a completely new disease with no approved interventions by regulatory agencies furthermore more than 10 of analyzed registered intervention trials were testing hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine therapies that have been suggested as effective for covid-19 and that have raised controversies 17accumulation of evidence on covid-19 is not without challenges there are particular methodological challenges related to analyzing covid-19 data during the pandemic 18 a major challenge is also timely evidence synthesis of the rapidly accumulating data and methodological sacrifices that are being made along the way multiple evidence synthesis organizations are now offering evidence collections investing duplicate effort into similar activities 19 overview of systematic reviews published until march 24 indicated that the majority of systematic reviews on covid-19 available by that date were of critically low methodological quality 20 hopefully research collaborations will be set up to reduce the multiplication of effort in terms of synthesizing and appraising covid-19 evidence 19early initiatives are evolving and improving along the way we used who collection of evidence on covid-19 and among the excluded studies there were 4 that were not published in scholarly journals instead they were published on a preprint server chemrxiv similarly we have used classification of eppi-centre for categorizing analyzed articles into thematic areas along the way we noticed that the number of articles in their collection had decreased indicating that they are likely better in curating their content in the living map of evidence 6in future studies it would be worthwhile to continue exploring the growth and characteristics of further studies regarding covid-19 to analyze how many of the preprint articles will be published in peer-reviewed journals and how many registered trials will be completed the resolution of the covid-19 pandemic is difficult to predict and this may hinder plans for clinical trials for countries that may be very successful in their lockdown and quarantine efforts reduction of the number of infected and diseased patients may prevent the completion of registered clinical trials thus it would be interesting to monitor how many of the registered trials will be terminated prematurely or will not even beginhowever in comparison to the past coronavirus epidemics sars-cov and mers-cov the scientific community appears to be much more involved we were unable to find bibliometric studies comparable to ours about the volume of research considering sars and mers but the simple pubmed search reveals that researchers were much less productive even in the first year after sars-cov and mers-cov first emerged namely the number of articles from november 1 2002 to november 1 2003 and from april 1 2012 to april 1 2013 was 611 and 561 respectivelya limitation of our study is a different search date for the three sources of information we analyzed however these sources have major differences in the export functionalities and amounttype of data they provide and that need to be screened or analyzed our analysis of articles published in journal articles took longer time compared to the analysis of preprint articles and registered trials because we needed to conduct screening and analysis about whether those articles contained original data a quarter of those articles were published in chinese and many of those articles were difficult to retrieve from chinese journals we are aware that with the ongoing covid-19 pandemic research output is fast increasing but we aimed to analyze early research output published between 3 and 4 months from the emergence of the new diseasefurthermore we did not analyse whether perhaps multiple publications referred to the same dataset also for the translation of non-english articles we used google translate as it has been shown in 2019 that this tool can be trusted for data extraction in evidence synthesis 7 one persian article was additionally clarified through consultation with a native speaker other languages that are not english were easily translated using google translateearly articles on covid-19 were predominantly retrospective case reports and modelling studies many clinical trials about covid-19 were registered but it remains to be seen whether they will be completed due to unpredictable development of the pandemic and changes in the number of infected individuals diversity of outcomes used in intervention trial protocols indicates the urgent need for defining a core outcome set for covid-19 research chinese scholars had a head start in reporting about the new disease but publishing articles in chinese may limit their global reach mapping publications with original data can help finding gaps that will help us respond better to the new public health emergencythe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has become a global health emergency on a pandemic scale covid-19 is a severe respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 12 the emergence of sars-cov-2 was first detected in wuhan china in december 2019 sars-cov-2 infections spread rapidly and globally causing enormous distress and loss of life in no time though most sars-cov-2 infections cause only mild symptoms 1015 of patients develop the severe disease that requires hospitalization with 5 requiring intensive care in the united states alone the centers for disease control and prevention reports over 2 million covid-19 patients and over 110 thousand related deaths so far worldwide sars-cov-2 has infected over 8 million people and caused over 400 thousand deaths as of 16 june 2020 httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirusas a newly emerged strain of coronavirus sars-cov-2 was rapidly identified as the causative agent of the outbreak sars-cov-2 contains a genomic sequence closely related to the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars coronavirus sars-cov 3 and both these viruses are zoonotic this is thus among some of the rare cases of an animal to human transmission of virus infection with pandemic potential 4 common symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection include fever cough and difficulty in breathing in severe cases the infection can result in death 5 the pathogenesis of the sars-cov-2 infection is not completely clear yet our present understanding of covid-19 pathogenesis so far is based on a limited number of investigated cases of sars-cov-2 and extrapolations from other similar coronavirus infections such as sars-cov and mers-cov 678 the probable courses of immunopathological events postulated based on limited studies on covid-19 along with past studies with sars-cov have been illustrated in figure 1 transmission of infection between humans is facilitated by close contact with covid-19 patients as evidenced by the rapid global spread of the infection all around the world in a short period of time sars-cov-2 likely originated in bats and may have amplified in an intermediate host before infecting humans sars-cov-2 enters the human body via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptors 9 current evidence indicates the mortality rate for sars-cov-2 could be approximately 3 which is significantly lower than sars-cov 10 and mers-cov 40 10 nonetheless sars-cov-2 has much higher transmissibility r0 1455 than both sars-cov r0 25 and mers-cov r0 1 11given the severity of covid-19 the rapid global dispersion of sars-cov-2 and the declaration of the sars-cov-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization there is a pressing and increasing need for new diagnostics vaccines and therapeutic options for this new threat however in this early phase of the sars-cov-2 outbreak a comprehensive prevention and treatment strategies is lacking due to limited knowledge about this virus in efforts to mitigate the current covid-19 pandemic government agencies and scientific and medical communities worldwide are working on new approaches to reduce infection and decrease mortality rates among infected individuals 12 so far neither vaccines nor direct-acting antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of this disease for now most of the countries with a high case burden have adopted a combination of large-scale testing contact tracing isolation and quarantine in parallel with social-distancing measures to curb the covid-19 pandemic until a durable cure or prevention strategy is developed while these measures have slowed down the spread of the disease and bought us more time to develop treatment and prevention strategies there is a pressing need for a resilient solution that can effectively control the disease the most effective strategy to control the disease is to develop a vaccine and many industrial and academic organizations are racing to develop one but face many challenges to achieve this goal at an unprecedented timeline therapeutic drug options have been actively explored including through many ongoing clinical trials to reduce the severity of disease and death rate this review provides an overview and analysis of most current advances in vaccines and therapeutics development against covid-19 while also discussing some of the major roadblocks and challenges that we face to halt this emerging virus infectionremdesivir is a promising antiviral drug against rna viruses including sarsmers-cov in cultured cells mice and nonhuman primate models 17 remdesivir is an adenosine analog that activates nucleoside triphosphate metabolites to inhibit viral rna polymerases in a nonhuman primate model intravenous administration of remdesivir 10 mgkg resulted in 100 protection against ebola virus infection 18 remdesivir is currently under clinical development for the treatment of ebola virus infection 19 in a recent double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of intravenous administration in adults hospitalized with covid-19 remdesivir shortened the recovery time of patients by 31 though it could not reduce the mortality rate to a significant extent these initial results of remdesivir-mediated improvement of recovery time in clinical trials granted its fda approval for critically ill covid-19 patients 202122 nonetheless given high mortality despite the use of remdesivir it is apparent that treatment with this antiviral drug alone may be less likely to be sufficient a combination of remidesivir with other drugs is another alternative approach currently being explored in clinical trials to improve patient outcomes in covid-19 since a hyperactive immune response leading to cytokine storm has been found to be associated with increased disease severity and mortality the addition of anti-inflammatory agent baricitinib to the remdesivir regimen is being explored in clinical trials nct04401579 to examine its potential in improving mortality outcomes several other existing antiviral drugs previously developed or used as treatments for other viral diseases are also being actively investigated as possible covid-19 treatment options with some already moved into clinical trials table 1 while the existence of evidence in support of these antiviral drugs is scant and preliminary in studies so far more comprehensive studies on these drugs can build and extend the arsenal of anti-sars-cov-2 agentschloroquine a well-known drug used for the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune disorders has been previously shown to exhibit antiviral activity against hiv zika virus and coronavirus 232425 under in vitro culture condition chloroquine blocks viral infection by increasing the endosomal ph required for viruscell fusion 26 it also prevents terminal glycosylation of the ace2 receptor of the host cell which is required for viruscell fusion chloroquine mediated block of virus replication and entry in the host cell have been reported for many other viruses including borna disease virus minute virus of mice the avian leucosis virus and hepatitis a virus 2527 these promising in vitro data suggested that chloroquine could be one of the promising drugs to treat covid-19 however the lack of robust preclinical data and potential safety issues of this drug remained to be addressed to date multiple clinical trials of chloroquine have been conducted either as a standalone drug or in combination with other drugs with and without randomization and placebo controls 28 while no significant effect of chloroquine on improvement in disease outcome could be ascertained in most of the studies reports of adverse events have been observed in some cases including ventricular arrhythmias qt prolongation and other cardiac toxicity indicating that this drug may pose risk to covid-19 patients if not given methodically and at the right dose 2930 interestingly chloroquine is also known to affect immune system activity by mediating an anti-inflammatory response which might reduce the pathology of covid-19 due to the exaggerated inflammatory response it triggers during the progression of the disease 31 however no studies have yet evaluated the use of chloroquine for prophylaxis against covid-19 future studies that can better elucidate the most effective dose schedule of administration and adverse events along with its prophylaxis effect on the disease will confirm whether it has any potential in controlling covid-19 the structure-based design of antiviral drug candidates 11a and 11b aldehyde based indole-2-carboxamide compounds which target the sars-cov-2 main protease recently exhibited in vitro antiviral activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties in vivo suggesting that they may also be promising drug candidates 32 while the in vivo pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies showed encouraging results for these two new compounds their efficacy against viral infection still needs to be validated in vivo in an appropriate experimental infection model before forwarding to clinical trials a more detailed review of the clinical studies of many other pathogen-targeting drugs including remdesivir and chloroquine has been described in other recent reports 2133the high morbidity of sars-cov-2 patients is due to acute respiratory distress characterized by a cytokine storm that leads to increased plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines il-2 7 10 and 17 gm-csf interferon--inducible protein 10 mcp-1 macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha and tnf- 34 tocilizumab a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin-6 receptor has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and promising clinical outcomes tocilizumab can suppress cytokine storms improve respiratory function and normalize body temperature 35 however this is a single observation study with a limited number of covid-19 patients and hence may have a significant bias covid-19 mortality has been found to be associated with myocarditis in the setting of ards and a th17 type immune response has been reported to drive more severe viral myocarditis 36 this suggests that anti-il-17 therapy could be another potential approach in managing the disease severity and decreasing the mortality related to covid-19-induced myocarditislow-dose steroids such as prednisolone and tacrolimus have also been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines that exacerbate lung pathology 37 given that pneumonia is secondary to a deleterious inflammatory process during covid-19 disease progression the use of prednisolone andtacrolimus for severe covid-19 lung injury patients thus could have a positive clinical effect clinical trials are already underway to evaluate the efficacy of these two immunosuppressive drugs in decreasing the secondary pathological manifestation of lung pneumonia in covid-19 patients nct04341038 another host-directed approach is to target the aceace receptor and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas of the host cell to reduce the chances of infection hypertension drugs lisinopril ace inhibitor and losartan angiotensin ii receptor-blocker arbs can increase the expression of ace2 receptors which may exacerbate viral load in cells 38 however some studies suggest that ace inhibitors and arbs could benefit patients with covid-19 since ace2 converts angiotensin ii to angiotensin which may have beneficial vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties though the usefulness of ace inhibitors or arbs is uncertain and based on retrospective cohort studies arb was recently approved for clinical trials to evaluate its potential for the treatment of covid-19 patients 1339 another alternative approach is to use recombinant human ace2 as the virus may more readily bind to the soluble ace2 in comparison to ace2 receptors on the cell surface this approach of preventing virus entry in the cells has shown promising preclinical results leading to its transition into clinical trials already 1339 camostat mesilate is another potential candidate drug that is being considered as a host-directed therapy for covid-19 patients camostat mesilate which is used primarily for treating postoperative reflux esophagitis and for acute exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis could block spread and pathogenesis of sars-cov in a pathogenic mouse model it is known to inhibit the host serine protease tmprss2 which primes the spike protein of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses 40 and since sars-cov-2 is also dependent on host tmprss2 13 it is a viable target for host-directed therapies based on more than 15 years of safe clinical track record in japan and efficacy against sars-cov in preclinical studies a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial for repurposing this drug for covid-19 is already in progress nct04353284convalescent plasma cp is passive immunotherapy that has been used to improve the survival rate of patients with infectious diseases for over a century 55 cp administration reduced mortality rates and shortened hospital stays in patients with sars 56 various studies demonstrate that severely ill covid-19 patients treated with cp showed a lower mortality rate compared to untreated controls 57 a new study reported that critically ill covid-19 patients n  10 treated with cp transfusion demonstrated significantly increased levels of neutralizing antibodies and depletion of viral load in 7 days clinical symptoms and paraclinical criteria in these patients improved within 3 days 58 placebo-controlled clinical trials to test cp therapy are ongoing in china nct04264858 and larger studies also started in the usa houston methodist hospital houston texas mount sinai medical center new york new york etc after it was approved by the us food and drug administration for covid-19 treatment 5960 cp from covid-19-recovered patients is used to treat patients infected with sars-cov-2 the sars-cov-2-specific igg antibodies received from sars-cov-2-recovered patients are passively transferred via transfused plasma and may neutralize viral particles and stimulate the complement system to encourage viral elimination 61 while the results from some of the more recent clinical trials are encouraging 6263 validation of these results from large randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials is needed to further establish the effectiveness of cp therapy cp dose and frequency are two of the criteria that may require more optimization to further improve the efficacy of cp therapy for covid-19 moreover with regard to selecting the cp donor the adequate titer of igg and neutralization antibodies should be standardized and a robust donation program needs to be in place to make cp therapy a more viable treatment option for covid-19 early intervention at the onset of symptoms should also be considered as an important factor in enhancing the success rate of cp therapy for the treatment of covid-19 patients this is based on the observation that a better treatment outcome was achieved in sars patients who were given cp before 14 days post infection thus underlining the significance of early time administration of this therapy transfusion-related acute lung injury and infection enhancement that could occur due to subneutralizing concentrations of antibodies could be some of the major drawbacks of cp if these are not considered during the course of treatment relationship between sars-cov-2 rna reduction and cp therapy the optimal concentration of neutralizing antibodies required for effective treatment and dynamic changes of different cytokine during treatment are some of the key parameters that once defined can further narrow the gap that exists for this therapeutic option cell-based therapies particularly stem cell therapies have become a promising therapeutic approach to treat various diseases for which treatment has proven difficult a few decades ago researchers made the important observation that stem cells including pluripotentmultipotent cells were resistant to viral infection due to the expression of specific genes such as interferon-gamma-stimulated genes 64 for example there is direct evidence of stem cell protection against infection from myxoma virus a therapeutic oncolytic poxvirus hematopoietic stem cells can contain the myxoma virus infection while other cells such as differentiated human monocytes b-cells and natural killer cells cannot 65 recently the usa china and several other countries have started stem cell therapy-based clinical trials to treat sars-cov-2 infection table 2 even with the significant progress of stem cell-based approaches limited cell sources immunogenicity and ethical issues remain some of the major limitations mesenchymal stromal cells mscs have received attention due to their source potential low invasive acquisition procedure high proliferation rate and lack of ethical concern mscs can be isolated from several tissues eg adipose tissue bone marrow peripheral blood cord blood dental pulp menstrual blood wharton jelly buccal fat pad and fetal liver and can be stored for future treatment they are easily expanded to clinical volume in a short amount of time and their safety and efficacy have been thoroughly documented in many clinical trials 666768 while multiple clinical trials for the use of mscs to treat various diseases are ongoing so far none of them have been yet proposed for covid-19 treatmenta 2016 study investigated the effect of mscs therapy on influenza virus ah5n1-infected mice and found that human mscs reduced influenza virus ah5n1-induced acute lung injury and increased overall survival 69 notably during sars-cov-2 infections the host immune system increases the production of inflammatory factors inducing a cytokine storm that results in excessive production of immune cells and cytokines 34 mscs therapy may inhibit this release of proinflammatory cytokines and owing to the regenerative properties of stem cells they may also improve endogenous repair of injured tissues figure 2 mscs secrete multiple growth factors vegf pdfg fgf tgf- etc that regulate endothelial and epithelial permeability suppress inflammation and enhance tissue repairregeneration 66 recent studies on stem cells ability to alleviate lung fibrosis has also been reported which is a critical pathological factor in covid-19 70 at the same time mscs are also known to exhibit strong antimicrobial effects through the secretion of antimicrobial peptides and proteins ll-37 defensins hepcidin and lipocalins which could benefit in reducing the viral loads as well during the progression of covid-19 7172 thus after the intravenous infusion of mscs a significant population of mscs would naturally live in the lung where they could cure covid-19 via protecting alveolar epithelial cells reclaiming the pulmonary microenvironment preventing pulmonary fibrosis and salvaging lung dysfunction these hypotheses spurred the pursuit of mscs therapy for sars-cov-2 patients a recent study demonstrated that intravenous administration of clinical-grade human mscs in seven severe covid-19 patients resulted in improved functional outcomes with observable adverse effects 73 the clinical benefit of mscs should thus now be evaluated in a larger cohort of patients in the future moreover the benefit of genetically engineered modified mscs should also be assessed in covid-19 patients genetically engineered modified mscs have been used to treat several diseases such as cancer myocardial infarction and acute liver failure mscs modifications include over-expression of cytokines chemically engineered mscs physical preconditioning or pharmacological preconditioning 74 one important limitation of this approach is a dependency on stem cell banks for clinical-grade mscs and limited speed of preparationscientific teams have now also begun investigating the prospects of car-t-based immunotherapy for treating covid-19 car-t therapy represents an incredibly promising approach to reprograming t cells by expressing a synthetic receptor directed against the specific antigen to eliminate the virus-infected cells or cancer cells to control the disease progression 75 car-t therapy has already revolutionized cancer immunotherapy especially for the treatment of b cell malignancies 7677 apart from their treatment potential against b-cell malignancies car-t therapies have also shown early encouraging results for chronic hepatitis b virus hbv infection hiv and hbv-related hepatocellular carcinoma in recent studies 7879 the success of car-t therapy against some of these viral infections accentuates their immense potential against other infectious diseases as well since pathogen-specific t cells play a pivotal role in controlling infections this therapy involves the extraction of t cells from the patienthealthy donors bloodstream and after harvesting and expanding the t cells they are reprogrammed to express a chimeric antigen receptor car targeting virus-infected cells figure 3 while the therapy could be cost-prohibitive for treating most types of viral infections it could be a viable option for covid-19 since no other definitive treatment option is available for this disease yet it has been indeed demonstrated that car-t cells can be redirected to target the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 80 these engineered t cells for sars-cov-specific antigen exhibited a functional profile comparable to that of sars-specific memory cd8 t cells recovered from sars-cov-infected patients this initial evidence suggested that car-t cells could thus be pursued for treatment for sars-cov-2 nonetheless the adoption of car-t therapy for clinical application against covid-19 will require managing certain technical obstacles one of the caveats is that car-t cells that stably express pathogen-specific t cell receptors could pose a risk of its proliferation and mediated excessive killing of infected cells which could result in excessive inflammation and tissue injury to overcome this problem engineering of car-t cells could be done through mrna electroporation rather than using viral transduction to obtain virus-specific t cells that will survive only for a limited time figure 3 the use of mrna electroporation has been shown to result in only transient expression 35 days of the car and thus is expected to decrease the risk for its off-target effects 81 this technological adaptation can also reduce the viral contamination that can come from the viral transduction method of conventional car-t cell engineering transient car-t cells could also overcome the common cytotoxicity due to cytokine storm that has been observed after conventional car-t therapy cytokine storm has been one of the pathological manifestations observed in severely ill covid-19 patients which leads to increased lung inflammation if lymphocytes are engineered using the transient mrna transfection approach that keeps them active for a limited amount of time this will likely minimize the potential of cytokine-storm-mediated cytotoxic effects in this context the dosing regimen and timing of administration of car-t cells should also be carefully assessed to rule out its possible cytotoxic effect for covid-19 treatmentunarguably the best long-term strategy to curb the scale of the humanitarian and economic impact of the covid-19 pandemic is to develop an effective vaccine that can prevent the new infections and stop the transmission of the disease the scientific community and the vaccine industry have responded urgently to this epidemic of sars-cov-2 to support the development of vaccines against covid-19 the demand of the situation and the availability of multiple vaccine technology platforms has also accelerated the development of many candidate covid-19 vaccines at unprecedented rapidity and some of these candidates have already entered human clinical testing the pipeline of vaccines against covid-19 has already reached more than 100 confirmed active candidate vaccines though most of them are at exploratory or preclinical stages as of june 4 2020 10 candidate vaccines that have made it to clinical stage represent diverse platforms including mrna dna adenovirallentiviralbacterial vector-based vaccines and inactivated sars-cov-2 82 dna and mrna-based platforms offer the advantage of flexibility in terms of antigen manipulation and manufacturing speed dna and mrna vaccines allow changing the antigen coding gene sequence in order to address the frequent mutations in the antigenic epitopes 83 by comparing the genetic similarity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov a set of sars-cov-derived b cell and t cell epitopes that exactly match sars-cov-2 have also been identified recently 84 as no mutations have been observed in the identified epitopes among the available sars-cov-2 genetic sequences immune targeting of these epitopes for future vaccine candidates can also counteract the issue of genetic variations of the target antigen currently there are no licensed dnamrna vaccines for use in humans but a few vaccines developed on these platforms have demonstrated potent immunity against various infectious disease targets and cancer in experimental animal models 85 while enhanced delivery technologies such as electroporation and liposomes have increased the efficacy of dna vaccines in humans a shift towards rna vaccine is clearly seen in the recent past non-infectious nonintegrating natural degradation egg and cell-free safety are some of the major safety advantages for mrna vaccines over vector-based or dna vaccines 86 mrna vaccines have also been found to stimulate a much broader range of innate and adaptive immune responses which is desired against covid-19 phase 2 clinical trials investigating an mrna vaccine sars-cov-2 mrna-1273 developed by moderna have begun and phase 3 trials are scheduled to begin soon 87 adenoviral ad vector vaccines also represent a promising modern vaccine platform as a variety of ad vector vaccines have reached human clinical trials for infectious disease and cancer 88 since first-generation adenovirus platforms ad5 have the disadvantage of induction of adenovirus neutralizing antibodies a second-generation adenovirus vaccine platform with four deletions enabling multiple homologous doses is being used to develop covid-19 vaccine 8990 specific targeting of an adenovirus to dendritic cells has been found to be very critical for the efficacy of the ad vector-based vaccine 91 the replication-deficient feature of ad vector vaccines is its key biologic property and they have had an excellent safety profile in clinical translation so far ad vector vaccines can also be easily grown to high titer in cell culture thereby facilitating their manufacture regulatory approval and clinical translation in a rapid manner 92 apart from that the ad vector vaccine also allows for the insertion of multiple transgenes including not only the antigen of interest but also other genes that can enhance the response to vaccination cansino biologics and the academy of military medical sciences china have developed a nonreplicating adenovirus serotype 5 ad5 vector carrying the gene for the sars-cov-2 spike protein and clinical trials are underway in wuhan china 8793 at the university of oxford uk phase 12 clinical trials using a chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine chadox1 carrying the gene for the sars-cov-2 protein are underway 3dendritic cellsantigen-presenting cells modified with the lentiviral vector which expresses viral proteins and immune-modulatory genes is also a new vaccine platform being evaluated in clinical trials currently for covid-19 nct04276896 under this platform dcsapcs carrying a synthetic minigene of the viral structural proteins and a polyprotein protease of sars-cov-2 within the lentiviral vector is administered together with antigen-specific cytotoxic t cells while there are fewer preclinical data and public information available about this platform phase i and ii clinical trials are already underway to evaluate the anti-covid-19 efficacy of these to lentiviral-based cell vaccines and we can expect to see the results of these trials soonsome studies also suggest that vaccines for other diseases may confer resistance to sars-cov-2 two recent reports suggested a correlation between bacille calmette-gurin bcg antituberculosis-vaccinated countries and reduced mortality in covid-19 patients 9495 bcg is known to provide nonspecific protective effects through boosting innate immunity to treat malignancies such as bladder cancer melanoma lymphoma and leukemia specifically bcg may augment the first line of immune defense so-called trained immunity to provide a better defense against bacterial parasitic and viral infection 96 clinical trials in the netherlands led by dr mihai g netea 97 nct04328441 and in australia led by dr nigel curtis nct04327206 investigating the protection of bcg vaccines against the sars-cov-2 virus are ongoing some of the recombinant bcg candidate vaccines that have shown a better protection profile in early preclinical and clinical studies could be other potential candidates to explore for covid-19 9899100moreover since the immunity of the bcg vaccine is not known to last more than 1015 years revaccination of adults with bcg or recombinant bcg strains is another viable approach to consider especially in countries where bcg is given at birth we have curated the list of other vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2 from multiple journal sources that have recently moved into clinical trials as mentioned in table 3 31193in summary drug repurposing plasma and stem cell therapies and vaccines are pharmaceutical interventions that are being actively explored to limit the transmission of sars-cov-2 infection an early clinical priority is to contain the spread of the infection via diagnostics that detect sars-cov-2 infection rapidly and accurately a vaccine or drug that prevents future infections is another early priority there are few potential sars-cov-2 drug and vaccine candidates for clinical trials in the pipeline globally however all promising treatment strategies should be investigated for efficacy and safety moving forwardin december 2019 a new type of unexplained pneumonia appeared in the south china seafood wholesale market in wuhan hubei province but its source has not yet been found to confirm the cause whole-genome sequencing of samples from patients with this unexplained pneumonia revealed a beta-coronavirus that had never been seen before which was different from sars-cov and mers-cov 1 after the alert of this new pathogen china quickly took measures to completely block off hubei province and implemented a quarantine policy nationwide to keep the outbreak under control this efficient process was also recognized by the international who this highly contagious new coronavirus was initially named 2019-ncov on feb 11 2020 the international committee on taxonomy of viruses introduced the name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 to refer to the virus and the who named the related pneumonia coronavirus pneumonia covid-19this article will go through basic virology of sars-cov-2 and review mainly the drugs used in the battle against covid-19 in chinaby genome sequencing it was found that sars-cov-2 has 82 sequence similarity with sars-cov 2 3 and through phylogenetic tree analysis it has 96 homology with bat coronaviruses at the genome level for which reason bats were inferred to be the host for sars-cov-2 4 the genome structure of sars-cov-2 is shown in fig 1sars-cov-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense rna virus and is classified in the order nidovirales coronaviridae and coronavirus 5 coronaviruses are a large class of viruses that can infect mammals and birds and can cause many diseases such as respiratory intestinal liver and nervous system diseases 6 coronaviruses are divided into four groups alpha- beta- gamma- and delta-coronaviruses 7 and all known human pathogenic coronaviruses are beta-coronavirusesthe single-stranded rna genome of sars-cov-2 is 29891 nucleotides in size the genes of sars-cov-2 from 5 to 3 are a 5 untranslated region including 5 leader sequences and open reading frame orf 1ab structural proteins including the envelope glycoprotein spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleoprotein n accessory proteins such as orf3 6 7a 7b 8 and 9b and a 3 untranslated region 3orf1ab occupy two-thirds of the viral genome and they encode two polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab 8 these two polyproteins can be hydrolyzed into 16 nonstructural proteins nsps including papain-like protease plpro 3c-like protease 3clpro rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp helicase and exonuclease 6 the enveloped glycoprotein spike s forms a layer of glycoproteins protruding from the envelope and is closely related to virus infection of cells 9 there are multiple sequence segments in the receptor-binding domain of the s protein which have high homology with sars-cov sequences and some studies have confirmed that sars-cov-2 can bind to the ace2 receptor on the cell surface similar to sars-cov 1 3 10 two additional transmembrane glycoproteins envelope e and membrane m are incorporated into the virion nucleoprotein encapsulates the viral  rna genome in the form of a spiral in the envelope to prevent degradation accessory proteins do not participate in viral replication but they interfere with the host innate immune response or have other unknown functions 10the sars-cov-2 possible life cycle begins when the spike glycoprotein on the envelope binds to the ace2 receptor and membrane fusion occurs either directly with the host cell membrane or with the endosome membrane after membrane fusion the viral rna genome is released into the cytoplasm and the uncoated rna is translated into two polyproteins the polyproteins are cleaved by the protease encoded by orf1a into the 16 nsps which can form an rna replicase-transcriptase complex 6 10 this complex drives the production of negative-sense rna which is used as a template for the full-length  rna genome during transcription subgenomic rnas are produced by discontinuous transcription and then transcribed into subgenomic  mrna which is translated into different structural proteins the newly formed structural protein and viral genomic rna combine to form a nucleocapsid the viral particles bud into the ergolgi intermediate compartment ergic and then the primary virion is released from the infected cells 10  a diagram of  sars-cov-2 life cycle is shown in fig 2due to the sudden emergence of sars-cov-2 no specific antiviral agents are available however many drugs under development are believed to have potential anti-sars-cov-2 activity due to common biological processes in the virus life cycle currently there are 200 domestic clinical trials of covid-19 drugs from the chinese clinical trial registry chictr as of 10 march and most are for chemical drugs chinese patent medicines and combinations all of these clinical trials were registered in 2020 after the outbreak of covid-19 11among those covid-19 treatment-related clinical trials a total of 155 registered covid-19 treatment drug-related interventional studies were obtained from the chictr database wwwchictrorgcn with ethics committee approval and informed consent signed by 10 march statistic information of these registered trials are shown in fig 3 the study phase of each trial was extracted and nearly 25 of these clinical trials were registered as phase 4 studies which were stated as postmarketing drugs or phase iv clinical trials by the chictr definition in phase four studies many domestically approved chinese patent drugs and chemical agents are being used to treat covid-19 patientswith so many clinical trials registered in such a short period of time we can see that china has responded to the epidemic in a timely manner and hopes to find sars-cov-2-specific medicines to end the epidemic as soon as possible this urgent need propelled chinas drug research ability to its full power and this motivation involved many academic institutions hospitals and companies this approach has also led to concerns about this phenomenon excessive research and drug trials can create the problem of squeezing each other for limited medical resources or even wasting them this phenomenon and its impact on our medical system as well as possible improvement in our medical administration need thorough review and discussion at an appropriate time in the futurein these 155 pooled clinical trials a number of approved chemical and biomacromolecule drugs have been used in covid-19 treatment clinical trials for drug repurposing most of which are nucleotide analogs and protease inhibitors against other viral pathogens including influenza virus hiv and hcv comprehensive information about the chemical agents used in covid-19 drug clinical trials is shown in the table below table 1type i interferons including ifn- and ifn- have broad-spectrum antiviral effects 16 ifn- can directly inhibit virus replication or can achieve antiviral effects by activating innate or adaptive immunity 17 many studies have proven that ifn- has an antiviral effect on sars-cov 18 and other experts discovered that ifn- can prevent mers-cov infection and effectively inhibit the virus in the early stages of infection 19 because it is also a coronavirus and highly homologous to sars-cov ifn- is recommended for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection according to the latest new diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia ifn- at a dose of 5 million u or equivalent dose each time for adults is added to 2 ml of sterile water and it is aerosolized and inhaled twice a day 13lopinavir was first approved in the united states in 2000 for the treatment of hiv infection 20 it is a protease inhibitor and is usually used in combination with ritonavir to increase its half-life through the inhibition of cytochrome p450 21 in vitro studies have shown that lopinavirritonavir can inhibit the replication of mers-cov and sars-cov and exert antiviral effects 2225 at present the drug has been used in the clinical treatment of covid-19 at a dose of 400 mg100 mg for adults twice daily and the course of treatment does not exceed 10 days 13 however this treatment has certain toxic and side effects on the treatment of covid-19 therefore its safety and effectiveness require further research recently some clinical studies have shown that lopinavirritonavir treatment has no significant effect 26 27ribavirin is a purine nucleoside analog with a broad-spectrum antiviral effect 28 it is used mainly to treat respiratory syncytial virus infection 29 and in combination with interferon for hepatitis c 30 ribavirin was widely used in 2003 to treat sars-cov infection but when used alone it seemed to have no effect and caused significant hemolysis in many patients 3134 when ribavirin was combined with ifn- it had good antiviral activity in in vitro studies 35 some studies have shown that in patients with severe mers-cov infection ribavirin combined with ifn--2a treatment can significantly improve patient 14-day survival 36 preliminary in vitro test results demonstrate that ribavirin can inhibit sars-cov-2 in a human cell line in the latest diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia it is recommended to use ribavirin at a dose of 500 mg each time for adults and in combination with interferon or lopinavirritonavir with 23 intravenous infusions daily the course of treatment does not exceed 10 days 13chloroquine phosphate is an antimalarial drug that has been on the market for many years and it also has a potential broad-spectrum antiviral effect 37 38 it can increase the ph of lysosomes to prevent virus fusion with the cell membrane and then block virus entry and infection 39some studies have found that the spike glycoprotein on the virus envelope binds to the ace2 receptor to mediate sars-cov-2 infection 9 40 chloroquine phosphate has been reported to interfere with the glycosylation of the ace2 receptor thereby inhibiting the binding of sars-cov to cells and achieving therapeutic goals 41 therefore chloroquine phosphate is used to treat covid-19 and in vitro experiments show that chloroquine phosphate does inhibit sars-cov-2 and that its ec50 is 113 m 39 apart from the above antiviral mechanism chloroquine phosphate can continue to exert antiviral effects after sars-cov-2 invades cells and it also has immunomodulatory activity to strengthen the antiviral effect 42 therefore chloroquine phosphate has been included in the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia and is undergoing clinical trials chloroquine phosphate is used for the treatment of covid-19 in adults aged 1865 years those who weigh more than 50 kg will receive 500 mg twice daily for 7 days while those who weigh less than 50 kg will receive 500 mg twice daily on days 1 and 2 and 500 mg once daily on days 37 13arbidol is a non-nucleoside broad-spectrum antiviral drug for upper respiratory tract infections caused by influenza a and b viruses and it was first approved in russia 43 it can inhibit the adhesion of viruses to host cells and prevent them from invading human cells 44 at the same time it can promote the synthesis of interferon which can prevent influenza virus invasion and treat influenza virus infection 45 some studies have confirmed that arbidol has a good effect against sars-cov and mers-cov infections 46 47 chinese scientists found in in vitro cell experiments that compared with a drug-untreated control group 1030 m arbidol can effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 up to 60 times and significantly inhibit the pathological effects of the virus on cells 48 as described in the latest diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia arbidol is used at a dose of 200 mg for adults three times daily and the course of treatment does not exceed 10 days 13 it has been reported that some patients have improved symptoms after receiving arbidol 49favipiravir is a nucleoside analog 50 51 with an ability to inhibit rna-dependent polymerase 52 and was approved for marketing in japan in 2014 it is used for antiviral treatment of influenza a and b 52 and can effectively inhibit ebola virus yellow fever virus 53 etc in vitro experiments have shown that favipiravir is effective for covid-19 and that its ec50 is 6188 m 39 to date some clinical trials of favipiravir in the treatment of covid-19 have been carried out in china recent clinical studies have found that compared with the antiviral drug arbidol the clinical effect of favipiravir is more significant nucleic acid positive-to-negative time mean antipyretic time and cough remission time were all better than those of the arbidol group 27remdesivir was first used to treat ebola virus and it has completed phase 2 clinical trials 54 as a nucleoside analog it can interact with rdrp 55 56 and the triphosphate form of remdesivir will compete with adenosine triphosphate leading to delayed chain termination and inhibiting viral replication and transcription 57 a number of in vitro studies have shown that remdesivir has inhibitory effects on a variety of human and animal coronaviruses 58 59 an in vivo study of remdesivir against sars-cov showed that remdesivir can reduce virus levels in the lungs of mice infected with sars-cov and reduce lung function damage caused by the virus 60 moreover some studies have found that the antiviral effect of remdesivir against mers-cov is better than that of lopinavirritonavir combined with ifn- 21according to the above evidence remdesivir has been used to treat sars-cov-2 and in vitro experiments showed that remdesivir has a good inhibitory effect on sars-cov-2 with an ec50 of 077 m 39 recently the first covid-19 patient in the united states was treated with remdesivir on the 7th day of hospitalization and their clinical symptoms were improved significantly 61 at present a phase three clinical trial of remdesivir for covid-19 has been officially launched in china and a total of 761 patients are planned to be enrolled in the study which will be randomized double-blind and placebo-controlled 62as a derivative of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine has similar efficacy and few adverse reactions based on its characteristics of immunomodulation antithrombotic activity and improved inflammation hydroxychloroquine has been used in the clinical treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus 63 hydroxychloroquine has been shown to have anti-sars-cov activity in vitro 64 and it is clinically safer than chloroquine 65 66 some clinical studies have found that after treatment with hydroxychloroquine the viral load significantly decreases or even disappears and azithromycin can enhance the antiviral effect 67 68chinese patent medicine is herbal medicines in traditional chinese medicine modernized into a ready-to-use form such as tablets oral solutions or dry suspensions chinese patent medicine has played very important roles in the domestic battle against covid-19 in china and many clinical investigations have started to more precisely evaluate its effects on covid-19 patient treatment chinese patent medicine as well as many herbal medicines has been very useful in improving symptoms such as coughing weakness and digestive system disorders as well as alleviating anxiety reports announced that up to 90 of covid-19 patients in china have been given chinese patent medicine or tcm prescriptions a list of chinese patent medicine currently undergoing covid-19 clinical trials is shown below table 4 to present an overall message about chinese patent medicine in covid-19 treatment research table 2some studies have confirmed that sars-cov-2 infects cells through endocytosis via the ace2 receptor on at2 alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs 78 79 at present the protein structure of the s protein and ace2 interaction has been solved providing reliable guidance for vaccine and drug design 80 aiming at the mutual use of the s protein and ace2 protein necessary for sars-cov-2 to enter host cells multiple domestic research teams have discovered a variety of potential ace2-binding agents through molecular docking virtual screening methods and artificial intelligence drug screening methodsplpro is a multifunctional protein with protease and phosphatase activity that is involved in viral replication and ifn antagonism 81 plpro of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have only 83 sequence similarity 82 however the high-level structure of the protein that forms the active site is not altered in the two plpro proteins 83 there are already domestic teams working to find potential inhibitors of plpro through virtual screening which needs to be confirmed by experimentsthe 3clpro of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have an amino acid sequence similarity of up to 96 and the structure of 3clpro in sars-cov-2 has been solved 82 3clpro is a key protein of the virus and the virus needs to use it to replicate rna therefore finding sars-cov-2 3clpro inhibitors can provide a more effective way to fight covid-19as an rna virus sars-cov-2-encoded rdrp plays a key role in the viruss rna replication rdrp inhibitors can be used as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against rna viruses the rdrp protein structure has a large and deep groove structural region as the active center of rna synthesis the sequence similarity of the rdrp proteins of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov is as high as 96 and structural differences exist outside the active center 82 therefore high sequence conservation allows the development of rdrp inhibitors against sars-cov to be applied to the development of anti-sars-cov-2 drugsa recent study showed that in addition to the use of the sars-cov receptor ace2 to enter the cell sars-cov-2 has two other proteins cathepsin b and lcatbl and tmprss2 that activate the s protein help sars-cov enter the cell and play a key role in the process of invasion of normal cells by sars-cov-2 84 when a tmprss2 inhibitor is used in combination with a catbl inhibitor they can completely inhibit the invasion of sars-cov-2 therefore tmprss2 may be a potential antiviral targetthis article provides an overview of published information on domestic research and the development of coronavirus-related therapeutic agents the drug-repurposing effort summarized in this article focused primarily on agents currently known to be active against other rna viruses including sars-cov mers-cov influenza hcv and ebola as well as anti-inflammatory drugs this information provides a strong intellectual groundwork for support of current and future research and development for the discovery and development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of covid-19 and coronavirus-related diseases however there are still no officially approved specific antiviral drugs or vaccines for sars-cov-2 and supportive care remains a key to treatment tcm has accumulated thousands of years of experience in the treatment of pandemic and endemic diseases complementary and alternative treatments are still urgently needed for the management of patients with sars-cov-2 infection and experiences in tcm are certainly worth examining many antiviral chinese patent medicines such as shuanghuanglian oral solution and others have been declared to have the effect of heat clearing and detoxifying which could help clear viral respiratory pathogens and relieve symptoms according to tcm theory chinese patent medicine has been used in many historic epidemics such as the previous two coronavirus outbreaks sars-cov in 2013 and mers-cov in 2012 and seasonal epidemics caused by influenza viruses and dengue virus fighting against current epidemics also provides an opportunity to test the true value of tcm in treating emerging contagious diseases it is encouraging that controlled clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of tcm in the treatment of sars-cov were conducted and reported we believe that specific and efficient antiviral drugs and therapy will arise from these ongoing and developing drugs especially from the rich tradition of herbal medicines in chinacoronaviruses are a family of enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded rna
genome that infects animal species and humans among coronavirus members are those
responsible for the common cold severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars
middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus mers and the recently emerged severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the causative pathogen of the disease
covid-191coronaviruses primarily cause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and
humans2 discovered in the 1960s they were originally thought to be
only responsible for mild disease with strains such as hcov 229e and hcov oc43 responsible
for the common cold3 that changed in 2003 with the sars pandemic and in
2012 with the outbreak of mers both zoonotic infections that resulted in mortality rates
greater than 10 and 35 respectively4 both coronaviruses likely
emerged from native bat populations which maintain a broad diversity of coronaviruses and
were transmitted through an intermediate host to humans loss of natural habitat and
increased exposure to new hosts are likely responsible for the increased frequency of
zoonotic infections originating from bats56 evidence also supports that the novel coronavirus which
emerged in the wuhan region of china in late 2019 also originated from bats7 this novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 resulted in an outbreak of pathogenic
viral pneumonia in wuhan hubei province china as reported to the world health
organization who in december 2019 subsequent spread has led to a global pandemic
officially declared by the who on march 11 20208covid-19 disease appears to be a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from
asymptomatic to severe respiratory failure common symptomology at the onset of illness are
fever cough and general myalgia with less common symptoms including sputum production
headache and diarrhea911 an initial case analysis
from china through mid-february 2020 found 14 of cases were associated with severe disease
dyspnea respiratory frequency  30min blood oxygen saturation  93
partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio  300 andor
lung infiltrates  50 within 2448 h and 5 of cases were critical ie
respiratory failure septic shock andor multiple organ dysfunction or failure12 a more extensive meta-analysis found a slightly higher severe disease
percentage 20313 the disease case fatality rate cfr varies
depending on region population demographics and heath care capabilities for instance in
italy an overall cfr of 72 is estimated in part driven by the higher proportion of
individuals of advanced age compared to china14 on the basis of global
data the cfr from covid-19 based on confirmed cases is estimated to be 6915 disease progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome typically occurs
in older patients over 63 often with underlying medical conditions such as hypertension
or diabetes16 elevated risk of mortality was associated with advanced
age sepsis blood clotting deficiencies1718 in individuals less than 60 years of age an increased body
to mass index over 30 was associated with increased disease severity and progression to
acute respiratory distress syndrome19 other symptoms including
neurologic symptoms and coagulopathies have also been reported in a portion of infected
individuals2024similar to other coronaviruses sars-cov-2 primarily infects the respiratory and
gastrointestinal tract with a cell tropism of nasal epithelial cells pneumocytes and
alveolar macrophages in the lung and enterocytes in the bowel2527 although not limited to only these specific cell types evidence does
support that cell binding via the viral s protein to the host receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 is required for infection figure
12829 following entry of the virus into the host cell the virus complex is
then translocated to the endosome where endosomal acid proteases cleave the s protein
mediating membrane fusion28 the viral genome is released and translated
into the viral replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab which are cleaved into functional
proteins by viral proteases subgenomic templates for mrna synthesis and translation of the
viral structural proteins occur through discontinuous transcription2
viral genome replication is mediated by the viral replication complex which includes an
rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp helicase exonucleasen and other accessory proteins
subsequent assembly of viral nucleocapsids from the packaged viral genomes and translated
viral structural proteins occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate
compartment30 with infectious virions then released from the cell
through exocytosisas a new disease sars-cov-2 does not have any clinically proven therapeutics furthermore
a significant amount of preclinical research was reported in the search for therapeutic
treatments for the related viruses sars and mers as the sars and mers coronavirus outbreaks
did not persist no therapeutic or vaccine development programs were completed the
consequence is that drug repositioning and repurposing has received a significant amount of
attention31 and approved agents including hydroxychloroquine
azithromycin ritonavir ruxolitinib and camostat have entered clinical trials to address
the current sars-cov-2 pandemic figure 13234 although some candidates
do have pre-existing data to support activity against coronaviruses other repurposing
candidates for potential use against sars-cov-2 are based on their ability to inhibit
sars-cov-2 viral replication in vitro293537 these include hydroxychloroquine a known autophagy
inhibitor that suppresses lysosomal function38 and the serine protease
inhibitor camostat29 the ability of these compounds to act as
prophylactic agents treat disease or even modulate viral replication in
vivo has not been demonstrated although clinical evaluation of several of these
potential therapeutics is ongoingone of the first clinical candidates that has received attention is remdesivir a
pre-existing drug candidate developed by gilead sciences as part of an antiviral development
effort with initial results against ebola virus ebov reported in 201539 it was recently authorized for compassionate use and has now entered controlled clinical
trials like all other therapeutic approaches for patients with covid-19 remdesivir was not
developed specifically to treat covid-19 and here we review its discovery and mode of
actionremdesivir gs-5734 was developed by gilead sciences and emerged from a collaboration
between gilead the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the us army
medical research institute of infectious diseases usamriid they sought to identify
therapeutic agents for treating rna-based viruses that maintained global pandemic potential
such as those that indeed emerged following the initiation of the program including ebov
and the coronaviridae family viruses exemplified by middle east respiratory
syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sarsas a starting point for discovery a library of 1000 small molecules focused around
nucleoside analogues was compiled based on prior knowledge of effective antiviral compounds
targeting rna viruses nucleosides are poorly cell-permeable and therefore can have a low
hit rate in cell-based screens such as antiviral screens so modified nucleosides such as
monophosphate ester and phosphoramidate prodrugs composed a significant portion of the
library such prodrugs are typically more permeable and metabolized to liberate the
nucleoside or phosphorylated nucleoside within cells4042 while the data from the original full screen does not appear to have
been disclosed a 1-cn modified adenosine c-nucleoside hit gs-441524 along with a
prodrug form of the monophosphate of gs-441524 gs-5734 later renamed as remdesivir was
found to be highly potent43 gs-441524 and its
s-acyl-2-thioethyl monophosphate prodrug had previously been reported in
2012 as potent leads from a series of 10-substituted 4-aza-79-dideazaadenosine
c-nucleosides with broad activity against a panel of rna viruses yellow fever virus yfv
dengue virus type 2 denv-2 influenza a parainfluenza 3 and sars44
the primary assay used was the cytoprotection effect cpe assay in which live virus is
incubated with a target cell line and the antiviral activity is inferred by the ability of a
test agent to rescue cell death measured using a standard cell viability reagent45 in a 2012 study gs-5734 showed cpe activity against sars strain toronto 2
ic50  22 m without causing cytotoxicity toward the host vero african
green monkey kidney epithelial cells used in the cpe assay note that different target cells
were utilized in viral cpe assayswhen the ebola outbreak occurred in 2014 the assembled library was utilized to identify
and prioritize compounds with efficacy against ebov the study by madelain et al found that
gs-5734 reduced ebov replication in hela cells with an ic50  100 nm and
it retained potency in in vivo nonhuman primate ebov infection models
while gs-441524 was inactive4647 in addition to demonstrating activity against ebov warren et al showed
that remdesivir also had antiviral activity against several other viruses including the
coronavirus mers with an ic50 of 340 nm in vitrowith the demonstration that gs-5734 remdesivir possessed broad activity against rna
viruses multiple groups assessed antiviral activity both in vitro and
in vivo454849 validating its activity against coronaviruses antiviral
activity was confirmed against sars mers zoonotic coronaviruses49 as
well as the circulating human coronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e causative agents of the
common cold50 furthermore de wit et al demonstrated that remdesivir
had both prophylactic and therapeutic activity against mers in a nonhuman primate in
vivo model51the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir have been summarized in compassionate use documentation
published by the european medicines agency ema 2020 remdesivir is administered via an
intravenous injection iv with a loading dose on day 1 200 mg in adults adjusted for body
weight in pediatric patients followed by a daily maintenance dose 100 mg in adults for up
to 10 days in nonhuman primates daily administration of 10 mgkg of remdesivir yielded a
short plasma half-life of the prodrug t12 039 h but
sustained intracellular levels of the triphosphate form45in vitro and preclinical in vivo animal models supported
the effectiveness of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 and related coronaviruses these include
a recent in vitro study of remdesivir assessing antiviral activity against
sars-cov-2 previously known as 2019-ncov strain ncov-2019betacovwuhanwiv042019 using
qrt-pcr quantification of viral copy number in infected vero e6 cells this study
demonstrated an ic50 of 770 nm and an ic90 equal to 1760 nm with
cytotoxic concentration 100 mm52 in addition works by sheahan et
al and de wit et al demonstrated in vivo efficacy of remdesivir at
inhibiting viral replication and reducing viral related pathology against related
coronaviruses5153
these findings along with the safety profile of remdesivir in the clinical trial assessment
against ebov54 support the evaluation of remdesivir as a potential
therapeutic drug for repurposing against the sars-cov-2 pandemicdriven by the ebov outbreak in 2014 and based on in vitro and animal model
in vivo efficacy against ebov45 gilead sciences
initiated clinical evaluation of remdesivir for ebov gilead pursued fda evaluation under
the fdas animal rule permitting the reliance on efficacy findings from animal
studies for drugs in which it is not feasible or ethical to conduct human trials as such
remdesivir was included in a randomized controlled trial of ebola virus therapeutics in
patients within the democratic republic of the congo nct02818582 however midstudy
primary analyses found remdesivir inferior to the antibody based therapeutics mab114 and
regn-eb3 with respect to mortality and the remdesivir intervention arm was
terminated54 mulangu et al reported one serious adverse event related
to remdesivir an instance of hypotension along with elevated creatinine and aspartate
aminotransferase plasma levels a suggestive marker for impaired kidney or liver function
respectively in remdesivir-treated patients compared to either antibody based therapeutic
arms although remdesivir was inferior against ebov based on efficacy compared to antibody
therapy the study arm did provide an initial insight into the safety profile in
patientsantiviral chemotherapeutic interventions often target specific viral enzymes or attack a
weak point of viral replication within the host such as targeting the divergent
rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp figure 2
nucleoside analogues represent a class of antiviral agents that has proven efficacious
against several viruses including hepatitis b and c as well as hiv generally these fall
into three general classes mutagenic nucleosides obligate chain terminators or delayed
chain terminators55 ribavirin a mutagenic nucleoside targets the viral
reliance on an rdrp to catalyze the replication of the rna genome from the original rna
template5657 in a
seminal paper crotty et al demonstrated that the rna virus poliovirus exists on the edge
of viability due to the proportion of virus particles with deleterious mutations
furthermore treatment with concentrations of ribavirin that caused a 97-fold increase in
mutations was sufficient to induce error catastrophe in effect lethally
mutating the poliovirus reducing infectivity by 99358 obligate chain
terminators such as azidothymidine azt lack the reactive 3-hydroxyl group which
directly prevents additional dna synthesis after incorporation59 lastly
delayed chain terminators which include remdesivir block transcription despite still
possessing the 3-hydroxyl and thus can still form a phosphodiester bond with the
next incorporated nucleotide however evidence suggests that the 1cn substituent of
remdesivir sterically clashes with rdrp residue s861 upon further chain elongation
remdesivir  three additional nucleotides distorting the positioning of the rna and
hampering translocation to the remdesivir  fourth position figure 260remdesivir gs-5734 a prodrug is metabolized within cells into an alanine metabolite
gs-704277 further processed into the monophosphate derivative and ultimately into the
active nucleoside triphosphate derivative figure 3 nucleotide analogues are not highly cell permeable and once in the cell they
require di- and then triphosphorylation to produce the nucleoside triphosphate ntp that
can be utilized by the viral rna-dependent polymerases for genome replication as such ntps
can then be misintegrated into viral rna by the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp
figure 2 to address this an approach to
antiviral drug design can employ the utilization of phosphoramidate prodrugs protides
inferred as prodrugs of
nucleotides6265 protides are composed of a nucleoside
monophosphate capped with an aryl group and an amino acid ester a phosphoramidate
following diffusion into the cell the prodrug is presumed to metabolize in a sequence of
hydrolytic steps that starts with esterase-mediated ester hydrolysis to a carboxylate that
cyclizes internally to the phosphonate ejecting the phenoxide the resultant unstable cyclic
anhydride is hydrolyzed open by water to the alanine metabolite gs-704277 whose pn
bond is hydrolyzed by a phosphoramidase-type enzyme figure 36669 this final step liberates the nucleoside monophosphate
which is highly polar and does not diffuse back across the cell membrane essentially
trapping it within the cell subsequent phosphorylation by host cell kinases convert the
compound into the ntp analogue that can be used as a substrate by the viral rdrp
enzyme70 while the nucleoside analogue core of remdesivir gs-441524
can diffuse into cells the initial phosphorylation step for nucleosides is rate-limiting
slow which is believed to account for the reduced antiviral activity of gs-441524
compared to remdesivir4971 this approach has been successfully applied to a number of fda-approved
antiviral drugs including the gilead products sofosbuvir for treating hcv and tenofovir
alafenamide first approved for treating hiv64remdesivirs antiviral activity sterically interacting with the viral rdrp to
induce delayed chain termination has been demonstrated in vitro against
multiple coronaviruses sars mers contemporary human cov and bat-covs72 remdesivir was also shown to perturb pan-cov rdrp function by inhibiting viral
replication of sars mers and the model -coronavirus murine hepatitis virus mhv
even in settings with intact exonuclease proofreading activity45
biochemical data from recombinant respiratory syncytial virus rsv rdrp suggested the
primary mechanism of action was through delayed chain termination7375 importantly remdesivir inhibits viral replication demonstrated with
both ebola and rsv in cell-based assays with ic50 values of approximately 100
nm whereas human rna polymerase rnap ii and human mitochondrial rnap are not inhibited in
the presence of compound75 providing approximately 500-fold selectivity
this selectivity is achieved at least in part due to the nucleoside analogues being poor
substrates for the human polymerases76 interestingly in
vitro assays demonstrate that the triphosphate form of the inhibitor was
incorporated at increased rates compared to natural nucleotide pools77
likely adding to strong antiviral potency of remdesivir through premature rna synthesis
terminationwith the covid-19 outbreak increasing in size and a lack of alternative therapeutics two
clinical trials using remdesivir were designed and initiated in china on february 5 2020
a phase 3 randomized quadruple-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was registered at
capital medical university with the goal to determine safety and efficacy of remdesivir in
patients with mild to moderate sars-cov-2 infection nct04252664 since suspended78 a day later a second trial nct04257656 since terminated was registered
at the same location focused on patients with advanced covid-19 respiratory disease79 both trials had planned to track the primary outcome as time to clinical
improvement up to 28 days normalization of fever oxygen saturation and respiratory rate
and alleviation of cough which is sustained for 72 h both trials delivered remdesivir as a
200 mg loading dose on the first day with 9 subsequent days of maintenance dosing at 100
mg this regime is identical to that utilized in the previous nct03719586 ebola trial which
appears to be the model for all subsequent trials involving remdesivir discussed below

metricswith the overwhelming influx of compassionate use requests on march 23 2020 gilead
sciences suspended compassionate use access to remdesivir for all cases save children and
pregnant women shifting their focus to support mounting clinical trials and establish a
system of expanded access wherein hospitals or physicians can request emergency use of
remdesivir for multiple patients at one time95 in an open letter to the
public on march 28 2020 gilead ceo reported that they had provided over 1000 doses of
remdesivir through compassionate use requests96 to date the fda has
granted expanded access treatment protocols for remdesivir sponsored by the us army
medical research and development command nct0430276695 and gilead
sciences nct0432376197 the primary objective of these studies is the
provision of expanded access to remdesivir for the treatment of sars-cov2 infections gilead
sciences has acknowledged that production of remdesivir is an involved process and this is
being scaled up to meet demandremdesivir is certainly not the only nucleoside analogue that is being investigated for use
against sars-cov-2 but it is the most clinically advanced a recent publication by sheahan
et al describes the ribonucleoside analogue
-d-n4-hydroxycytidine nhc eidd-1931 that
has in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 and in vivo
against the related sars virus98 although in preclinical development
eidd-1931 is orally bioavailable a significant advantage compared to remdesivir and has
increased potency against viruses containing mutations in rdrp that conferred increased
resistance to remdesivir supporting the potential for a combination therapy to address the
risk of sars-cov-2 becoming clinically drug resistant other clinically approved
nucleosidenucleotide analogues such as the hepatitis c drug sofosbuvir and hiv drugs
alovudine and zidovudine have also been shown to be active against the sars rdrp in
in vitro biochemical assays and might have the potential to be repurposed
against covid-1999 for a general review of nucleoside and nucleotide
analogues for cancer and viral diseases including approved drugs and clinical candidates
please reference jordheim et al100as the covid-19 pandemic races across the globe the scientific community from academic
and government laboratories to small biotechnology companies and multinational
pharmaceutical corporations has mobilized to develop and evaluate potential therapeutics
and vaccines101104 repurposing or repositioning an effective small-molecule
therapeutic promises to be the fastest therapeutic means to stem the tide of the
pandemic105106
among the candidate therapies remdesivir has demonstrated efficacy in both in
vitro and in vivo models against coronaviruses recently
through a compassionate use indication remdesivir has supportive evidence for yielding some
clinical improvement in covid-19 patients107 in addition an interim
analysis of the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial nct04280705 supports improvement in the
primary endpoint for patients receiving remdesivir compared to control with a 31 faster
time to recovery108 based on these initial findings the us food and
drug administration has issued an emergency use authorization for the emergency use of
remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalized covid-19 patients with no drug having fda
approval for marketing as a treatment for sars-cov-2 this is the first fda authorization of
an investigational therapeutic for use in treating sars-cov-2109 while
remdesivir represents one compound whose recent use authorization may in part mitigate the
morbidity mortality and strain on global healthcare systems caused by covid-19 additional
ongoing clinical trials will provide much-needed clarity surrounding the repurposing of
approved drugs and experimental agents against sars-cov-2

an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 began in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 1 the genetic characteristics of sars-cov-2 have proven to be significantly different from human sars cov and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers cov 2 common signs of sars-cov-2 infection include respiratory symptoms fever cough shortness of breath and breathing difficulties in more severe cases infection can cause pneumonia severe acute respiratory syndrome organ failure and even death 1 the virus is highly infectious spreading rapidly via human-to-human transmission as of march 12 2020 there were 80981 confirmed cases in china 3173 deaths and 44067 cases in 117 countriesterritoriesareas outside china 1440 deaths 3 currently there are no approved antiviral therapies for covid-19 the world health organization who has now declared the coronavirus a global pandemicwhen responding to the covid-19 pandemic medical services are under great pressure an effective coordinated pharmacy support system and event-driven pharmaceutical care activities are needed mobile cabin hospitals the square cabin hospitals have been built in wuhan china the epidemic epicenter in china to treat patients with mild symptoms of the virus pharmacists are actively engaging in the public health operation in china since the outbreak either at their home hospitals and community pharmacies or at the square cabin hospitals in wuhan the chinese pharmacy profession has gained valuable experiences through providing essential support to the public health operation in this commentary we share our experiences of providing pharmacy services combating coronavirus in china to disseminate what we have learned to the international pharmacy societythe timely supply of preventive and treatment medications and the provision of event-driven pharmaceutical care are critical to support and enhance public health

downloadable in the six official united nations languages on the fip website 7the department of pharmacy at xiangya hospital central south university proposed to develop a pharmacy emergency support guarantee system within a public health response operation a novel initiative in chinese public health fig 1 the pharmacy system aims to establish mechanisms to address drug shortages through surveillance early warnings drug emergency supply and distribution monitoring the safe use of medications and event-driven pharmaceutical care during the coronavirus epidemic 4 concurrently the xiangya hospital pharmacy department also published a reference book pharmacy service guarantee support for the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia the book provides pharmacists with evidence-based information and standardized operation protocols during the prevention and control of the epidemicthere is currently no specific vaccine and no effective antiviral therapy against sars-cov-2 the china national health commission cnhc has released the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for the new coronavirus infected pneumonia the cnhc guidelines currently in its sixth update 8 the cnhc guidelines suggest the use of antiviral drugs -interferon lopinavirritonavir ribavirin chloroquine umifenovir and traditional chinese medicines tcms for treatment although these therapies may not be recommended by the who their treatment roles are based on past experiences during the sars outbreak in china in 2003 with the consideration of lack of drug therapies to treat the coronavirus the cnhc guidelines recommend eight tcm injections for severe and critical cases for severe cases xiyanping xuebijing reduning tanreqing and xingnaojing injections are recommended for critical cases three additional tcm injections can be considered shenfu shengmai and shenmaito assist clinicians in better understanding and prescribing these drugs pharmacists applied evidence-based medication use evaluation approaches to collect and summarize drug information with these recommended drugs the hunan pharmaceutical association and the chinese hospital association pharmaceutical committee each separately compiled the drug information for the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia and the drug formulary in square cabin hospitalsduring the coronavirus pandemic both prescription including resuscitation drugs and over-the-counter otc medication shortages may occur drugs may also be in short supply due to production disruptions for various reasons pharmacists and pharmacies must conduct active surveillance and establish early warning mechanisms to address drug shortages in a timely manner the american society of health-system pharmacists ashp guidelines on managing drug product shortages and a published provincial drug shortage surveillance and early warning platform in hunan china can be referenced and adapted to create local regional and national platforms to manage prescription drug shortages during a pandemic 9 10 figure 2 shows the proposed prescription drug shortage surveillance and early warning mechanism community pharmacies and pharmacists should pay equal attention to potential shortages of otc drugs this is especially important due to an increase in the public buying otcs to treat the symptoms of the illness fever cough and shortness of breath from the advice of healthcare professionals and public agenciesevent-driven pharmaceutical care is provided to covid-19 patients in china during the epidemic the event-driven pharmaceutical care goes beyond routine activities medication review prescribing support and patient counseling three characteristics of the event-driven pharmaceutical care are 1 ensuring the appropriate use of off-label drugs many drugs recommended in the cnhc guidelines are used off-label pharmacists conduct literature evaluations and publish guidances for the off-label use of these drugs adverse drug reactions of some of these drugs are similar to the symptoms of the coronavirus disease such as fatigue fever and flu-like symptoms with -interferon it is necessary for pharmacists to assist in evaluating the efficacy and safety of these drugs and to monitor adverse drug reactions the pathological anatomy of the first patient with a covid-19 related death showed liver damage 11 which was either drug-induced or caused by the sars-cov-2 pharmacists are reminded to monitor drugs that may cause liver damage and to adjust drug dosing based on the patients liver function 2 ensuring the rational use of tcms the cnhc guidelines recommend the use of tcms for the coronavirus treatment preliminary evidence shows that integrating tcms and western medicines for covid-19 can improve the clinical cure rate and reduce the rate of disease progression from common infection type to severe type 12 however it is worth noting that the current research of tcms is based on clinical observations and is mostly used for patients with mild symptoms pharmacists with specialized training in tcm are confronted with preparing tcm formulations providing drug information to physicians and tcm pharmaceutical care for patients pharmacists should warn physicians about any interactions between tcms and western medicines when these drugs are prescribed for example the combination of hanshi yufei decoction and antipyretic analgesics can cause excessive sweating and even dehydration some proprietary tcms contain western medicine ingredients such as pipa lu a strong antitussive contains 015 mg of morphine per milliliter serotonin syndrome may occur when pipa lu is administered with monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as linezolid and 3 providing online real-time clinical support to frontline physicians and pharmacists working at the epidemic epi-center wechat the largest social communication mobile platform in china groups are established by pharmacy experts and pharmacists in china to provide clinical support for front-line pharmacists in hubei the epi-center of the coronavirus outbreak these chat groups create accessible drug use platforms by engaging in pharmacotherapy consultation through information and resource sharing in real-timein order to effectively reduce overcrowding and block the spread of the virus through person-to-person transmission during the coronavirus epidemic medical institutions across china have launched remote pharmacy services such as online drug prescribing drug consultation and drug delivery services for example the pharmacy department of xiangya hospital central south university created an online remote pharmacy service via wechat pharmacists provide patients with free medication consultation and education allowing patients to purchase medications online and arrange for home drug delivery the implementation of these remote pharmacy services provides out-of-hospital pharmaceutical care access and helps to reduce the risk of cross-infection during unnecessary hospital visits the positive effects of these remote services on patient care during the epidemic is helpful for pharmacy to further establish its professional role in chinaduring an epidemic false information and rumors can generate serious negative effects when the public cannot access timely authoritative and scientific information regarding the epidemic 13 for example after the media in china reported that shuanghuanglian a tcm that contains extracts from the dried fruit of forsythiae fructus inhibits sars-cov-2 in vitro it sparked panic buying of this medication online and offline the mass of people assembling to purchase this oral solution increased the risk of human-to-human disease transmission similarly after the media reported that chloroquine phosphate can inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro there were reports of a female patient who was not infected with sars-cov-2 but self-medicated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets 18 g 24 h the patient subsequently developed mental disorders and cardiac arrhythmias requiring hospitalization in an intensive care unit these incidences demonstrate that it is necessary for pharmacists and pharmacy associations to engage in public education to disseminate reliable authoritative information to the public and guide the publics rational thinking and behavior during the coronavirus epidemic to this end the chinese pharmacists association and the chinese pharmacological society released the expert consensus guidance on the rational drug administration and home drug therapy during an epidemic 14 a large number of popular science articles on coronavirus infection prevention and treatment and on home medication use during an epidemic have been written by pharmacists and published over the internet with the hope of decreasing drug-related problems the need to provide education to particular population subgroups homeless prisoners etc should be addressed it is important to note that the impact of these public education activities depends on the public trust of pharmacists and pharmacy as a professioncurrently more than 80 clinical trials have been registered in the chinese clinical registry to test for a coronavirus treatment during the first week of february china launched two placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir slated to include 760 people with covid-19 the studies should be completed by the end of april 2020 a few trials have started to test chloroquine an antimalarial drug that killed off the sars-cov-2 in cell cultures researchers are studying whether steroids diminish inflammation in people with severe covid-19 or cause harm another 300-person controlled trial is aimed to test whether serum antibodies from covid-19 survivors could rapidly help someone newly infected with the sars-cov-2 virus fifteen trials listed in chinas registry expect to enroll a total of more than 2000 people in studies on a variety of tcms including the largest trial assessing shuanghuanglian with 400 participants 15pharmacists are actively cooperating with research sponsors in the management of clinical trials including the proper supply use storage and disposal of experimental drugs in compliance with relevant clinical trial regulations pharmacists are also actively conducting pharmaceutical evaluations on the efficacy and safety of related trial drugsin summary during the coronavirus epidemic in china the chinese pharmacy profession has acted swiftly and forcefully with the above seven responses the impact of these measures needs to be further evaluated especially the several responses that rely on the public trust of pharmacy as a profession in chinathe epidemic of covid-19 is quickly evolving and the prevention and treatment pose great challenges to pharmacy services although chinese pharmacists have made significant contributions to the public health operation in fighting the epidemic the epidemic exposes a series of threats that we should face directly the first is that the number of frontline pharmacists is inadequate for example there are nearly 1000 beds in a square cabin hospital equipped with nearly 200 drugs including antiviral drugs rescue drugs and drugs used in the respiratory digestive and cardiovascular systems however only three to five pharmacists are stationed at each square cabin hospital pharmacists are undertaking dual responsibilities in the process of drug supply and management and pharmaceutical care it is not possible for a pharmacist to be able to provide quality essential pharmacy services with these heavy workloads second the lack of pharmacist consultations can lead to an overutilization and inappropriate use of antibacterial medications some doctors routinely prescribe covid-19 patients antibiotics such as quinolones or cephalosporins in the absence of a diagnosed bacterial infection this prescribing behavior increases the risk of microbial resistance and adverse reactions third most research manuscripts related to the coronavirus pharmacy services were written in chinese and published in chinese journals thus they cannot easily be shared with the international pharmacy community fourth although many drugs are being studied in clinical trials the design and quality of these clinical trials should be properly monitored many trials contain levels of bias such as small sample size and lack of control randomization and objective outcome evaluation criteria as a result these clinical trials are wasting valuable resources and will be unable to provide high-quality evidence of treatment efficacy and safety in response the china state council issued the notice on standardizing medical institutions to conduct clinical research on new coronavirus pneumonia drug therapy 16 the notice aimed to screen more effective drugs through standardized scientific orderly and efficient clinical drug research the first point is to further clarify the conditions for conducting research for example the drugs used for clinical research should be a marketed drug that has been validated by in vitro and animal experiments the second point is to further standardize the research process with regards to ethical review and record-keeping and hospitals should perform quality control and risk management throughout the process the third point is to speed up the application in an orderly manner for example the scientific research group recommends experimental drugs to the joint prevention and control medical treatment group and the medical treatment group decides whether to expand the scope of their use or include them in the treatment plantwo final reflections professional guidances should be established not only to pharmacists and pharmacies but also to the general population and to particular population subgroups eg homeless prisoners etc the role of the community pharmacists in preventing the spread of covid-19 virus should be strengthened community pharmacists are charged with key responsibilities including informing advising and educating the community maintaining a stable supply of pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene products and screening suspected cases and making appropriate referrals as necessary 17in summary chinese pharmacists and pharmacy associations have responded forcefully to the covid-19 epidemic the experiences and lessons learned in china not only allow the chinese pharmacy profession to improve pharmacy operations but also provide insight to the international pharmacy community to plan and operate pharmacy services to combat current and future epidemicsthis was a prospective open-label nonrandomized controlled trial conducted across five study centers one center institut hospitalo-universitaire mediterrane ihu administered hydroxychloroquine while four centers from the same region recruited the control patients it is unclear whether the control patients were part of the study or not in the protocol the reported sample size power calculation applies to a comparative 2-arm study however the abstract refers to a single-arm study and according to the protocol submitted to the eu clinical trials register clinicaltrialsregistereu id number 2020-000890-25fr the study was originally designed as a noncontrolled study thus it appears that the control arm was a later amendment of the studythe intervention hydroxychloroquine alone or combined with azithromycin was used in addition to the standard of care for the treatment of coronavirus 2 the comparator was standard of care which is not yet standardized  this may introduce a bias the patients receiving the active treatment were enrolled in a specialized unit benefiting from high-level experts and the most up-to-date infrastructure in comparison control patients recruited through other hospitals such as brianon which is a remote hospital in the french alps would receive fair and good quality of care but not as specialized as in the ihuthis raises the question of whether differences in management of patients between centers and therefore between arms might have influenced the outcomes of viral clearance management of these patients is intensive to help them survive by maintaining vital functions and preventing complications eg infections or heart or kidney failure however differences in patient management may not necessarily impact coronavirus carriage and clearance in addition an open study always raises the issue of observer bias ie the investigators knowledge of a patients treatment may influence the study outcome assessment when considering subjective outcomes it represents a very important source of bias however in this case the outcome measure is an automated biological measure it is very unlikely that the outcome measure might have been influenced by the open design development of the study product for a double-blind trial would have required several months to provide an appropriate formulation and relevant stability data as required by good manufacturing practicesgood clinical practices it is not a feasible option in the context of the ongoing crisisthese important methodologic biases represent clear conceptual methodologic limitations and several could have been avoided but it is unlikely that avoiding them would have reversed the trend seen in the trialthe study included hospitalized patients aged over 12 years with polymerase chain reaction pcrdocumented coronavirus 2 carriage from a nasopharyngeal sample at admission whatever their clinical status the patients who refused to receive hydroxychloroquine were used as control patients as were noneligible patients obviously this makes the comparability of participants between the control and active treatment arms highly questionable when comparing two treatment arms it is important to have comparable populations alternatively statistical methods should be used to control for differences in patient characteristics between armsthere is an obvious selection bias as patients were not randomly assigned patients from the ihu were very different from those at the other centers and were channeled based on unknown drivers as expected the analysis of baseline characteristics showed clear differences between the treatment arms the hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were older 51 years vs 37 years were less likely to be asymptomatic 10 vs 25 and were more likely to present with pneumonia 30 vs 125 these differences are considerable even if nonstatistically significant but are probably a bias against the hydroxychloroquine intervention this suggests that the study provided conservative results when considering population differences indeed older and more severely ill patients are likely to have a weaker immune defense response to virusbacterial infection although this may have serious impact on the patient prognosis and survival it may have limited impact on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine on virus clearanceit is unclear in the publication whether participants in both the active and control arm gave informed consent however as control patients were treated according to normal practice and the primary outcome assessment was not interfering with their normal care they may be considered an external standard-of-care control arm that may not be part of the study although this point requires clarification it is unlikely to affect the resultscarriage of coronavirus 2 is based on nasal and oropharynx sampling and assessed through a well-established technique to detect coronavirus 2 rna using real-time reverse transcriptase-pcr it is a reliable technique and should not raise significant objections however it appears the endpoint was changed during the study although the article is unclear about this the planned assessment time points were days 1 4 7 and 14 and the reported sample size calculation refers to a reduction in viral load at day 7 this contradicts the outcome section of the article in which the primary outcome is stated to be viral clearance at day 6 results are reported at days 3 4 5 and 6 it may be that 7 days was initially intended as the main assessment endpoint but the authors decided to report findings after 6 days when clear results were observed considering the urgency of the situation however these contradictions within the article as well as between the article and the protocol raise questions about the credibility of the article it is important to note that this endpoint is a surrogate endpoint and would not preclude clinical and survival benefit however with the lack of approved drugs to fight coronavirus 2 infection which can be fatal in some patients this information is of high importancethe dosing of hydroxychloroquine is well reported in the methods section 200 mg three times a day for 10 days however the administration schedule of azithromycin is not reported in the description of the methods but rather in the results section it may also be noted that there is no mention of azithromycin in the summary protocol on the eu clinical trials register according to the abstract the patients receiving azithromycin were selected based on clinical profile but the specific profile is not reported there is no clarity on this point the review of the baseline results does not allow identification of clear criteria such as age lower respiratory tract infection or onset of disease the plasma concentration of hydroxychloroquine in this combination therapy arm is not different from the monotherapy treatment armmale patients were more likely to receive azithromycin male patients comprised 37 of the control arm 28 of the hydroxychloroquine arm and 66 of the combined hydroxychloroquineazithromycin arm there is an obvious imbalance however it is unclear how sex may be a confounding factor how this may have impacted the very high rate of clearance of covid-19 in this subgroup population still must be clarified although this constitutes poor practice in study reporting it is unlikely to introduce a significant bias in the reported resultsthe use of the fisher exact test is appropriate but statistical methods for interim analyses and early interruption of clinical trials were not used19 it appears daily interim statistical analyses were performed and the trial was interrupted early without using methods to control for the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis of no treatment differences however the magnitude of difference appears to be so large that the hypothesis of no difference between arms would be rejected even if appropriate methods for interim statistical had been useda very important point concerns the population used to assess the primary endpoint the authors used the per-protocol population whereas intention-to-treat analysis is normally employed for clinical trials aiming to establish the superiority of a clinical treatment20 this is a particularly important point in this study as all patients who dropped out belonged to the hydroxychloroquine arm this imbalance requires a careful reanalysis of the resultsamong the patients who dropped out three patients were transferred to the intensive care unit two were pcr positive and one was pcr negative at the time of transfer one died while being pcr negative one withdrew consent while being pcr negative and one stopped because of adverse event nausea while being pcr positive thus of the patients who dropped out 50 were negative at the time of dropout and 50 were positiveby performing a statistical analysis using the last-observation-carried-forward imputation method to account for missing data a conservative methodology widely used by regulatory authorities21 we could assess the proportion of patients who were negative at 65 for hydroxychloroquine arm compared with 125 for the control arm which is still statistically significant p  00012 and very clinically relevantif we employ a very conservative method that assumes all dropouts were pcr positive at day 6 the proportion of patients who were pcr negative would become 54 for hydroxychloroquine arm compared with 125 for the control arm this is still statistically significant p  0096 and very clinically relevantfinally it is informative also to consider separately the subgroup of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone among whom the proportion with viral clearance was 57 compared with 125 for the control arm this difference is again significant from statistical p  00187 and clinical perspectivesalthough there may be uncertainty in the effect size ranging from 50 to 70 the intervention has shown a very large effect size that could not be undermined by statistical considerationsthe poor quality of medical writing is also an issue we identified more than a dozen inaccuracies imprecisions or mistakes in the abstract alone they are reported in table 1 this may be related to the time pressure to release the first non-chinese clinical results on coronavirus 2infected patients however this level of medical writing may compromise the perceived quality of the evidence reported and may lead readers to doubt the quality of investigational procedures used during the trial as well it is important that they be corrected in the final version uploaded in the journal
this study has been poorly reported and the trial design introduces several biases some of these biases could have been avoided at the time of protocol development with thoughtful consideration the quality of medical writing is poor and suggests a quickly written manuscript and no support from a skilled methodologist the priority obviously was given to the fast communication of the results that may have a dramatic impact in a situation of a severe pandemicthe authors could have significantly improved the quality of their manuscript and its public health impact by discussing in a more transparent way all the limitations of the study and invested additional effort in medical writing however none of these observations is of a nature to reverse the results these results appear to be acceptable in the light of the effect size these data may have been influenced by the several biases identified in the study manuscript but not to an extent to make the intervention ineffective it clearly works even if we cannot accurately specify the actual effect sizein china 483 studies on covid-19 were registered on the national clinical trial registry22 the most studied intervention was chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy represented in 17 trials most results are not yet published but evidence has accumulated on the effectiveness of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine a recent review of 100 patients aggregated from several trials has been published and reports the benefit of chloroquine on clearing coronavirus 2 from infected patients23 however it does not provide details on patient disposition and outcomes it aims to be a signal to the community that evidence supports the use of chloroquine but details are to follow as these trials are not yet finalizedthe us centers for disease control and prevention provides information on the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the usa to treat coronavirus 2infected patients they describe a multiplicity of different hydroxychloroquine regimens currently used in the usa it is also used as a prophylactic treatment for health-care professionals24beyond chinese trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine several randomized trials are being conducted on efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in the usa south korea norway and australia in coronavirus 2infected patients clinicaltrialsgov id nct04316377 nct04315896 and nct04308668 in addition two studies are ongoing assessing the prophylactic effect for health-care professionals exposed or not exposed to patients infected with coronavirus 2 clinicaltrialsgov id nct04318015 and nct04308668all 8 of the treatment guidelines endorsed by the national health commission of china including a chinese expert consensus report recommended using chloroquine 500 mg twice daily for 10 days maximum table 2 2532 however one guideline recommended not using it in conjunction with azithromycin to avoid the risk of cardiac arrhythmia table 2
the korean guidelines recommend the use of chloroquine 500 mg twice daily or hydroxychloroquine 400 mg per day33the gautret et al study is consistent with the results of recent chinese studies not fully reported and is very consistent with current scientific knowledge there is a well-founded biological assumption to support the validity of the tested hypothesis real-world large-scale clinical practice in china and korea supports the experimental finding even though the exact contribution of the chloroquine in control of the outbreak cannot be accurately quantified at this time in either country all current evidence while not as robust as that from a double-blind randomized clinical trial points to the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in patients with coronavirus 2 infectionevidence-based medicine teaches us to consider all evidence including case reports and expert opinions for decision-making in the specific case of available evidence on hydroxychloroquine used in coronavirus 2 infection the recommendation would receive an evidence level 2b or 2 c 3436 such evidence grading supports the recommendation for use of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 infection especially in a crisis situationthe overall knowledge around hydroxychloroquine should translate to policy decision-making to control the covid-19 pandemic especially as no alternative option currently exists in readily accessible quantitiesin france methodology tends to supersede all evidence if the methodology is not perfect the evidence is ignored this is very well illustrated by the debate between two major experts in the field jean luc harousseau and jean franois bergman both highly respected experts with extensive experience in policy decision-making in several governmental agencies37 in this context the poor reporting and the multiplicity of biases in this study prevent any french methodologist from considering the study while a careful assessment would have shown the limited impact of poor reporting and biases on the results french methodologists tend to disqualify studies but not to assess learning points despite biases and put them in the context of current knowledgethe possible second scientific obstacle may be competition between scientists there is always a very high competition among scientists to be first some scientists succeeded in establishing the gautret et al study as a hypothesis-generation study and not a hypothesis-testing study several other experts were convinced that the biases and poor reporting invalidated the study resultsin addition a large european study discovery will be launched next week and will enroll 3200 patients in 5 arms including placebo remdesivir a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir with or without interferon beta and hydroxychloroquine apparently without azithromycin38 six hundred and fifty patients per arm seems large but no information is available at the time of writing concerning how the sample size was estimated depending on the population included results may just be negative little is reported at the time we submit this manuscript who is launching a similar but global study called solidarity to test the same interventions against placebo3thus the decision on the recommendation of hydroxychloroquine may be delayed until several hypothesis-testing studies are reported while a lot of knowledge is available from chinese and south korean experience the low risk associated with a hydroxychloroquine recommendation to a specific population versus the potential high benefit would argue in favor of the use of hydroxychloroquine until more evidence brings definite results rather than waiting for new evidenceit is very difficult for politicians to make the right decision in a crisis all decisions are scrutinized and criticized hydroxychloroquine has been presented as an unsafe therapy and the study has been widely criticized in the mediathe primacy of the precautionary principle primare non nocere after the extensive transmission of hiv via blood transfusion in france has left profound effects 3940 and decision-makers are driven by safety first when making decisions more recently the massive ordering of h1n1 vaccines and stockpiling of antivirals in france has provoked considerable public controversy41 the european public health decision-makers appear to be risk-averse this is very clear when comparing the us food and drug administration and european medicines agency regulatory approval decisionsan important question will likely raise future controversy when evidence has accumulated why did we not start the recommendation of hydroxychloroquine prescription earlier the risk of serious adverse events with short-term administration of hydroxychloroquine is well below all the case fatality rate estimates in europe42 hydroxychloroquine may offer the potential to quickly control the covid-19 outbreak and associated social and economic psychiatric consequences as well as consequences for health-care professionals with adverse events that are manageablethe current confinement strategy will probably have worse direct consequences on health eg severe psychiatric consequences43 it will also have indirect consequences on health as economic losses entailed by this strategy will impact future funding of health systems if a therapeutic option is available with limited evidence one should carefully weigh the benefit and the risk of that option versus alternative optionshydroxychloroquine treatment with massive testing and limited confinement has successfully worked in south korea to control the outbreak with an impressively low rate of fatalities44gautret et al conducted a quick and dirty study as methodologists would legitimately say with poor quality reporting and several biases however the critical review of this study suggests that it brings useful knowledge on the top of an already existing one that could have prompted quicker policy decision-makinga temporary conditional approval known in france as recommandation temporaire dutilisation could have been granted to hydroxychloroquine and potentially saved livesassuming the ongoing studies return negative results everyone will consider it a good decision not to recommend hydroxychloroquine but if the results are positive which is highly probable then there will be furious discussion over why it was not taken earlier in that case we will learn about the risk of delaying decisions in an uncertain environmentevidence-based medicine would likely allow an intermediate grade for recommending the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of some specific cases of covid-19so far european decision-makers have shown very little ability to learn from china 45 and south korea44 the only two countries that have been able to control the outbreak cultural differences language barriers and arrogance from the old europe may certainly explain why best practice knowledge sharing failed in this situationwe performed a search on march 12 2020 at the clinicaltrials gov database with the descriptor coronavirus in the simple search field conditions or disease

immune deficiency syndrome aids treatment 13 in a recent trial with patients on covid-19 treatment 14 100 of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine in combination with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin were virologically cured comparing with 571 in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone and 125 in the control group currently chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be tested 1516

the other three studies comparing effects with oseltamivir 2627 lopinavir-ritonavir 27 and carrimycin 28 the arbidol anti-viral mechanism against influenza a and b involves viral fusion inhibition with the targeted membrane which blocks virus entry into the cell 24 oseltamivir is another drug approved for influenza a and b treatment it inhibits the viral neuraminidase and consequently blocks the release of viral particles from host cells reducing the spread in the respiratory tract 29 additionally the use of oseltamivir was already reported during the covid-19 epidemic in china either with or without antibiotics and corticosteroids 30 oseltamivir is also used in a clinical trial with multiple combinations with chloroquine and favipiravir 31 a nucleoside analog that is well-known as

coronavirus infection 49thalidomide will be used in two trials against covid-19 49 50 thalidomide has an anti-inflammatory action due to its ability to speed up the degradation of messenger rna in blood cells and thus reduce tumor necrosis factor- tnf furthermore thalidomide can increase the secretion of interleukins such as il-12 and activate natural killer cells 51the corticosteroid methylprednisolone will be tested against covid-19 52 long et al 2016 53 reported that corticosteroid therapy methylprednisolone dexamethasone and hydrocortisone is beneficial in treating sars-cov patients it significantly prolongs the survival time of clinical cases nevertheless other authors described the use of corticosteroids in the early stages of sars infection with increasing values of viral load 54 furthermore studies with corticosteroids in the adjuvant therapy of mers-cov infection were unable to prove efficacy because all patients died 55 methylprednisolone has already been used in covid-19 patients in combination with antibiotics oseltamivir and oxygen therapy 56finally vitamin c ascorbic acid pirfenidone bevacizumab fingolimod and bromhexine hydrochloride are going to be tested on covid-19 57-61 vitamin c has antioxidant activity and may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation 5762 effects that improve vasopressor synthesis enhance immune cell function improve endovascular function and provide epigenetic immunologic modifications clinical trials have demonstrated promising data on mortality improvement in sepsis but more extensive studies are necessary to validate these conclusions 63 pirfenidone has been used in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diseases due to anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects namely by inhibiting il-1 and il-4 58 trial nct04282902 claimed 58 that anti-inflammatory effects may be helpful in sars-cov-2 infection bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor vegf 5963 and it may reduce the levels of vegf caused by hypoxia severe inflammation and upregulation of the infected respiratory tract epithelium all of which might suppress the edema in patients with covid-19 63 fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor regulator fty720 with an effective immunology modulator that is useful in multiple sclerosis 60 according to some pathological findings of pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation the use of immune modulators together with ventilator support should be considered for severe patients to prevent the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards study nct04280588 aims to determine the efficacy of fingolimod for covid-19 60 bromhexine is a transmembrane protease serine inhibitor such a protease is responsible for the activation of s-glycoprotein of sars-cov and mers-cov for viral entry through the plasma membrane 6164 one study 60 will evaluate the efficacy of bromhexine combined with standard treatmentstandard treatment in patients with covid-19in conclusion the who declared an epidemic of pneumonia caused by the sars-cov-2 in 2020 in this review we found 24 clinical trials that have already started with the repositioning of more than 20 medicines for covid-19 treatment such as human immunoglobulin interferons chloroquine hydroxychloroquine arbidol remdesivir favipiravir oseltamivir thalidomide methylprednisolone bevacizumab and tcm the hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination was the first drug repurposed with excellent results in clinical trials against sars-cov-2 but further more extended studies with a higher number of patients are needed to confirm these results besides its limitations repositioning clinical trials are still an attractive strategy they may facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines they may reduce the costs and time to reach the market there is an existing pharmaceutical supply chain for formulation and distribution and there is the possibility of combinations with other drugs in treatments that are more effective than monotherapy most of the studies found in this article are scheduled to end in 2020 and we hope these repositioning trials may help to find solutions for covid-19 treatment by this yearauthors hold sole responsibility for the views expressed in the manuscript which may not necessarily reflect the opinion or policy of the rpsppajph andor pahoin december 2019 an outbreak of unexplained pneumonia has been diagnosed in wuhan hubei province in china with an epidemiological link to seafood and wet animal wholesale market where there was also sale of live animals 1 2 the chinese scientists isolated an unknown coronavirus from the patients respiratory epithelial cells of patients and performed genome sequencing of the virus 3 now this new virus is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and it causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 although covid-19 is considered to be the origin of zoonotic diseases human-to human transmission has been occurred 4 it initially erupted in wuhan and later spread to all parts of the world resulting in 2954222 confirmed cases including 202597 deaths globally as 28 april 2020 which caused a global health emergency 5the covid-19 belongs to the family coronaviridae and order nidovirales and is detected in bats with similarity in clinical features and genetic sequence to sars-cov 3 6 many patients of covid-19 suffer from fever fatigue cough chest tightness and dyspnea and some progress to sepsis or septic shock or died of the infection 7 the diagnosis of new cases includes clinical characteristics the epidemiological history and laboratory test according to the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus covid-19 infection by the national health commission trial version 7 8 currently there is no vaccine or specific antiviral drugs for the infection except meticulous supportive care 9tcm as an important part of complementary and alternative medicine has been widely applied in preventing and treatment of epidemic disease in china for hundreds of years patients with severe covid-19 often develop into sepsis or septic shock 7 severe covid-19 belongs to the epidemic febrile disease in tcm and the basic pathogenesis is pathogenic toxin and blood stasis additionally severe covid-19 has some characters of the acute deficiency syndrome as an innovation theory it refers to the pathological state with a rapid consumption of the vital qi in the human body caused by acute and severe pathological factors such as plague poisoning hemorrhage loss of fluid and all kinds of trauma 10 11 based on tcm characteristic theory six hollow organs must keep its unobstructed and acute deficiency syndrome our team put forward truncation and reversion strategy 12 and the principle on tcm for emergency treating the primary ben for emergency cases 10 timely controlling the course of disease and reverse disease on the foundation of the above theories we developed the shenhuang granule a formula which is composed of six medicinal herbs including panax ginseng renshen rheum palmatum l stem dahuang sargentodoxa cuneate hongteng taraxacum mongolicum pugongying aconiti lateralis radix praeparata fuzi and whitmania pigra whitman shuizhi rhubarb is considered a purgative and bactericidal agent to reduce heat and promote blood circulation and resolve dampness 13 sargentodoxa cuneate and taraxacum mongolicum have the same function of clearing heat and detoxifying activating blood and removing wind and relieving pain 14 15 our previous studies have demonstrated that jinhong decoction composed of rheum palmatum l stem sargentodoxa cuneata and taraxacum mongolicum can inhibit the levels of tnf- il-6 il-8 and other inflammatory cytokines protect against excessive inflammatory response and maintain organisms balance between inflammation and anti-inflammatory in severe infectious diseases 16 17 ginseng has the functions to strongly tonify the qi nourishing lungs and spleen promoting the secretion of saliva and quenching thirst strengthening the heart and calming the mind 18 several studies recently report that ginseng can directly kill bacteria and regulate bacterial adhesion inflammation cytotoxicity and hemagglutination 19 wang et al 20 report that ginseng extracts can inhibit different strains of influenza viruses aconiti lateralis radix praeparata is considered an effective stimulant for the spleen and kidneys 21 recent studies report that aconite had antibacterial activity especially against s aureus and e coli as well as immunoregulation efficacy 22 23 whitmania pigra whitman has functions of breaking stagnant and eliminating blood stasis yao et al 24 believe that whitmania pigra whitman extract effectively reduces deep vein thrombosis by inhibiting inflammation via modulating silent information regulator 1 sirt1nuclear factor-b nf-b signaling pathway therefore according to the theory of tcm and modern western medical research shenhuang granule should have beneficial and curative effects on severe covid-19 11 12 25we design this study as a multicenter randomized and controlled clinical trial based on the truncation and reversion strategy of tcm innovation theory and acute deficiency syndrome the aim of this clinical trial is to confirm the effectiveness and safety of shenhuang granule in blocking the deterioration of severe covid-19 and provide reliable evidence for clinical researchthe study will be a randomized

training and assessment 3 streamlining the research process 4 strengthen communication and supervision and 5 appropriate incentives in this study the subjects are seriously ill there is no specific medicine for this disease and the patients have relatively high compliance with tcmhowever the following aspects still need to be strengthened by the investigators control of the subjects compliance 1 the researcher who talks with the patient or their legal agents for informed consent should have strong communication skills and rich clinical experience be able to communicate with empathy and answer patients questions to obtain full understanding and trust so as to avoid non-compliance after enrollment and 2 subjects should maintain necessary contact after being transferred or discharged from the hospital after the end of the drug treatment perioda previous study 26 on covid-19 by traditional chinese medicine showed that the clinical cure rate in the conventional treatment group was 6111 while it was 9118 in the group receiving traditional chinese medicine plus routine treatment according to the literature presuming that the rate of the clinical effective rate in the treatment group is improved from 6111 to 9118 the sample size is calculated according to the parameters   005 two-sided test and   01 comparing the rates of the two groups with respect to the sample size estimation formula we calculated that 41 patients should be recruited in each group studies with a similar patient population have the drop-out rate of 10 27 and we will enroll a total sample size of 160 participants we used the calculation tool on httpswwwcnstatorgsamplesizethe randomization sequence is generated by spss 190 using permuted small blocks of random size stratified by medical center and grouping the chinese medicine group and the control group on a 11 schedule the two sets of allocation codes are kept in opaque envelopes one set is kept by the research sponsor and the other set by the pharmacy administrators who then assign the study drug to the nurses for administration this is an open-label study the allocation concealment is blinded before the envelop is opened after randomization subjects randomized to the intervention arm will be receiving combined shenhuang granule and western medicine therapy or only western medicine therapy the evaluators and statistician will be blinded until the completion of the visit and analysis the statistical analysis is carried out by the professors of statistics at the shanghai university of traditional chinese medicinethe

february 2020 we are currently recruiting participants from february 2020 it is estimated that up to 160 participants will be enrolled by june 2020the horrific pandemic outbreak of covid-19 coronavirus disease 2019 around the world caught the health care systems in every country by storm most if not all were caught off guard without proper defense mechanisms to cope with and to control such a pandemic covid-19 caused by a new and novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 has recently been identified and characterized 1 coronaviruses are named for their crown-like spikes on their surface and there are four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses known as alpha beta gamma and delta 1 2 sars-cov-2 belongs to the beta sub-grouping and is one of the seventh coronavirus to date infecting humans 1 some coronaviruses such as 229e alpha coronavirus 3 oc43 beta coronavirus 4 nl63 alpha coronavirus 5 and hku1 beta coronavirus 6 were associated with mild clinical symptoms whereas sars-cov beta coronavirus 7 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov beta coronavirus 8 and sars-cov-2 caused severe diseases 2sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus with 29891 bases 96 identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus and shares 796 sequence identity to sars-cov 1 sars-cov-2 encodes spike s protein containing receptor binding domain rbd that binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and promotes membrane fusion and uptakes of the virus into human cells such as the lung by endocytosis 1 911 upon entering the human cells sars-cov-2 like other coronaviruses will takeover or hijack the human cells protein synthesis machinery to synthesize the viral proteins and assemble the proteins and subsequent viral replication 12once inside the human body viruses in general will trigger a series of good versus bad host responses including autophagy apoptosis stress response and innate immunity 13 fortunately majority more than 80 of sars-cov-2-infected individuals are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms most likely due to the activation of the good response these good responders would likely activate the bodys innate immune system by activating the bodys antiviral defense mechanisms including natural killer cells and antiviral t cells and induction of interferon ifn 1316 unfortunately in about 20 of sars-cov-2-infected individuals including the immune compromised elderly patients with underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular and pulmonary problems diabetics hypertension obesity chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or copd such as emphysema pulmonary fibrosis asthma and interstitial lung disease 17 18 would encounter more severe disease characterized by significant respiratory symptoms leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and even death an important consideration to note is that ards occurs later in disease progression and is preceded by acute lung injury ali 19 this distinction may inform treatment strategy in terms of drugs directed towards cytokine storm and thrombosis which is described in this manuscript a study on sars-cov and mers-cov has found that these two coronaviruses appear to have evolved mechanisms to attenuate or delay ifn production resulting in enhanced inflammatory host responses and severe lung injury 12 13 2022 this aberrant host immune response with the production of powerful inflammatory cytokines known as cytokine storm found in sars-cov- and mers-cov-infected patients would correlate with disease severity and poor prognosis 13 16 2023 severe covid-19 patients exhibit profound inflammatory response 24 25 transcriptomic rna-seq analysis of covid-19 patients has revealed that several immune pathways and pro-inflammatory cytokines cxcl ccl2 cxcl2 ccl8 il33 and ccl3l1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf and tnfsf10 cxcl10 il10 timp1 c5 il18 areg and nrg1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc were induced by sars-cov-2 infection suggesting a sustained inflammation and cytokine storm 26 importantly sars-cov-2 infectioninduced excessive cytokine release correlates with lung tissue injury and covid-19 pathogenesis 26 this estimated 20 of patients developing more severe disease with sars-cov-2 infection are most likely due to genetics epigenetics and or other factors with dampened innate immune response to fight the virus coupled with enhanced viral load leading to cytokine storm severe inflammatoryoxidative stress response and severe lung injury secondary to ards while there is clear understanding that the respiratory system is dramatically impacted in covid-19 patients evidence suggests that other organ systems are also affected emerging data show that sars-cov-2 may lead to damage to other organs including the heart and brain nearly 20 of hospitalized patients with covid-19 have indication of cardiac damage 17 furthermore neurologic symptoms have been reported in patients and infection of sars-cov-2 has been found in the brainstem of both humans and experimental animals 18 19currently there is no vaccine andor specific therapeutic drugs targeting the sars-cov-2 hence it remains a major challenge to decide what potential therapeutic regimens to prevent and treat the severely sick covid-19 patients effective vaccines are essential to combat against the extremely contagious sars-cov-2 at present a lot of research efforts have been invested to develop vaccines around the world until we have specific vaccines or therapeutic drugs targeting sars-cov-2 repurposed drugs that have been approved by the fda in the usa for other indications have been used to treat covid-19 patients this review will summarize the most current pharmacotherapeutics prescribed in the treatment of severe cases of covid-19 patients these include antiviral therapy antibiotics systemic corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory drugs including anti-arthritis drugs neuraminidase inhibitors rna synthesis inhibitors convalescent plasma and traditional herbal medicinesremdesivir is a potential drug for treatment of covid-19 it is a phosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine c-nucleoside and a broad-spectrum antiviral agent synthesized and developed by gilead sciences in 2017 as a treatment for ebola virus infection 28 remdesivir is metabolized into its active form gs-441524 that obscures viral rna polymerase and evades proofreading by viral exonuclease causing a decrease in viral rna production the antiviral mechanism of remdesivir is a delayed chain cessation of nascent viral rnaanimal experiments indicate that remdesivir can effectively reduce the viral load in lung tissue of mice infected with mers-cov improve lung function and alleviate pathological damage to lung tissue 29 wang et al found that remdesivir potently blocks sars-cov-2 infection at low range of micromolar concentrations and has a high selectivity index half-maximal effective concentration ec50 077 m half-cytotoxic concentration cc50  100 m si  12987 30 holshue et al reported that iv administration of remdesivir yielded promising results in the treatment of a patient with covid-19 recovering from pneumonia in the usa 31 in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug in patients with covid-19 a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind multicenter phase iii clinical trial was launched on february 5 2020 in china patients in the experimental group received an initial dose of 200 mg of remdesivir and a subsequent dose of 100 mg for 9 consecutive days via intravenous infusion in addition to routine treatment patients in the control group received same dose of placebo treatment the trial is expected to conclude by the end of april 2020 the number of cases planned to be enrolled is 308 and 452 respectively 32 33 current recommendation for remdesivir includes a 10-day regimen of remdesivir treatment 200 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 100 mg once-daily maintenance doses for 9 days in both studies this regimen of remdesivir therapy is similar to that of former randomized clinical trial against the ebola virus 32 33 in a summary of subjects receiving remdesivir via compassionate use in the usa nearly 70 of patients had improvement in terms of oxygen requirements and many patients that were mechanically ventilated were extubated this report did not include a control group therefore extrapolating these results is difficult it is too early to conclude the direct antiviral effect of remdesivir on the enhanced clearing of viral loads in the respiratory tract but it indeed suggests a promising therapeutic effect of remdesivir 34chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs with a long history of clinical use with similar chemical structures often used in the treatment of lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis and malaria 35 compared with chloroquine hydroxychloroquine has a hydroxyl group which makes it less toxic while maintaining similar activity one mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is targeting lysosome which may be useful to control graft-versus-host disease in humans 36 with the accumulation of chloroquine in lysosomes the ph of lysosomes is significantly changed and the activity of proteases in lysosomes is directly affected thus affecting the degradation of proteins and glycosaminoglycan 36 37 chloroquine can inhibit the entry of sars-cov-2 and prevent virus-cell fusion by interfering with glycosylation of ace2 receptor and its binding with spike protein suggesting that chloroquine treatment might be more effective in the early stage of infection before covid-19 reduces ace2 expression and activity 30 38 39 hydroxychloroquine possesses anti-inflammatory effect on th17-related cytokines il-6 il-17 and il-22 in healthy individuals and systemic lupus erythematosus sle and rheumatoid arthritis ra patients 40 there is some evidence that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can reduce cytokine storm according to one analysis the main cause of death of covid-19 patients is related to the triggering of the cytokine storm which contributed to acute respiratory distress 41 it has been reported that hydroxychloroquine is effective in inhibiting sars-cov-2 infection in vitro 1 39 42 zinc inhibits sars-cov and retrovirus rna polymerase activity in vitro and zinc ionophores block the replication of these viruses in cell culture 43 there is also evidence that zinc enhances chloroquine intracellular uptake 44 as such combining zinc with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is intriguing and is currently under investigation overall more clinical trials are underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic and treatment for covid-19 the us fda has issued emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 a recent study by tang et al reported that hydroxychloroquine did not lead to higher negative conversion rates but had reduced clinical symptoms through the anti-inflammatory properties and recovery of lymphopenia 45 it has also been reported that high doses of chloroquine 600 mg twice daily for 10 days or total dose of 12 g may be associated with significant cardiac risks and should not be recommended for treating covid-19 46 there is still a lack of evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of these agents in treating covid-19 in this regard clinicians and patients should be made aware of the risk versus benefit profile of these medications 47lopinavir is a protease inhibitor with high specificity for hiv-1 protease lopinavir is marketed and administered exclusively in combination with ritonavir this combination was first marketed by abbott under the brand name kaletra in 2000 48 due to lopinavirs poor oral bioavailability and extensive biotransformation it is co-formulated with ritonavir to enhance its exposure ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of the enzymes that are responsible for lopinavir metabolism and its co-administration boosts lopinavir exposure and improves antiviral activity 48 lopinavir is a peptidomimetic molecule containing a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the peptide linkage typically targeted by the hiv-1 protease enzyme but which by itself cannot be cleaved thus preventing the activity of the hiv-1 protease 49lopinavir-ritonavir was investigated in an open-label individually randomized controlled trial where patients with covid-19 received either lopinavir-ritonavir 400 mg100 mg orally twice daily plus standard of care or standard of care alone no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care diarrhea nausea and asthenia were the most frequently reported adverse effects in patients receiving lopinavir-ritonavir-based regimen 50 interestingly in a report from korea lopinavir-ritonavir administration significantly decreased coronavirus titers with no or little coronavirus titers were observed in the follow-up study however the analysis included a single patient in the initial phase of outbreak in korea 51umifenovir branded as arbidol a derivative of indole carboxylic acids was first developed in 1988 in russia and has since been approved in russia and china for treating prophylaxis and infections associated with influenza a and b and other arbovirus 52 later on umifenovir demonstrated in vitro antiviral efficacy in widely spreading virus strains such as the ebola virus human herpesvirus 8 hhv-8 hepatitis c virus hcv and tacaribe arenavirus 53 its major mechanism of action is to block the virus-cell membrane fusion as well as virus-endosome fusion through incorporation into cell membranes and interference with the hydrogen bonding network of phospholipids 54 in influenza virus it has been shown to directly interact with virus particles to stabilize hemagglutinin ha reducing the likelihood of reaching the low ph threshold required for conformational transition into functional fusogenic ha 55 blaising et al reported the in vitro activity of umifenovir against sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 56 57 a retrospective cohort study has reported that compared with lopinavir-ritonavir lpv-rtv only group combination of umifenovir and lpv-rtv has shown increased negative conversion rate of sars-cov-2 and improved chest ct scan results 58 however another prospective study chictr200030254 has shown that compared with favipiravir umifenovir has inferior outcome in clinical recovery rate and relief of fever and cough 59 there are two randomized and open-label trials ongoing in china investigating the efficacy and safety of umifenovir against covid-19 the effect of umifenovir plus standard treatment versus lpv-rtv plus standard treatment will be evaluated in nct04252885 and the effect of umifenovir plus standard treatment versus standard treatment will be tested in nct04260594favipiravir branded as avigan has been developed by fujifilm toyama chemical in 2014 in japan for the treatment of avian influenza or novel influenza resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors it is a guanine analogue with pyrazinecarboxamide structure and its antiviral activity is decreased at the presence of purine nucleosides due to the competition 60 the prodrug favipiravir first enters the infected cells through endocytosis and is then transformed into active favipiravir ribofuranosyl phosphates through phosphoribosylation and phosphorylation 60 61 the antiviral activity is exhibited through selectively targeting conservative catalytic domain of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp interrupting the nucleotide incorporation process during viral rna replication 60 the dysregulation in viral rna replication results in increased number and frequency of transition mutations including replacement of guanine g by adenine a and cytosine c by thymine t or c by uracil u which induces destructive mutagenesis in rna viruses 60 favipiravir has been used in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by rna viruses such as influenza ebola and norovirus 62 recent in vitro and human studies have repurposed favipiravir as an experimental agent against enveloped positive-sense single-strand rna virus sars-cov-2 an in vitro research has investigated seven potential anti-sars-cov-2 medicines including ribavirin penciclovir favipiravir nafamostat nitazoxanide remdesivir and chloroquine showing that remdesivir and chloroquine have favorable selectivity index 30 in addition the study showed favipiravir has exerted efficacy in vero e6 cells infected with sars-cov-2 with half-maximal effective concentration ec50 of 6188  m and half-cytotoxic concentration cc50 at over 400 m implying the high concentration is needed for safe and effective treatment 30 clinical trials testing favipiravir against covid-19 have been carried out vigorously in various countries including china and japan a randomized control trial chictr200030254 has shown that covid-19 patients treated with favipiravir have superior recovery rate 7143 than that treated with umifenovir 5586 and the duration of fever and cough relief time are significantly shorter in favipiravir group than in umifenovir group 59 up to mid-april 2020 there are eight undergoing clinical trials in china and two in japan examining the anti-sars-cov-2 potential of favipiravir these trials include non-randomized and randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of favipiravir alone chictr2000030113 jprn-jrcts031190226 jprn-jrcts041190120 or in conjunction with interferon- chictr2000029600 baloxavir marboxil chictr2000029544 chictr2000029548

the neuraminidase distributed on the surface of the influenza virus to inhibit the spread of the influenza virus in the human body 63 64 a study in wuhan reported that no positive outcomes were observed after receiving antiviral treatment with oseltamivir 65 several clinical trials are still evaluating the effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating sars-cov-2 infection oseltamivir is also used in clinical trials in several combinations such as with chloroquine and favipiravir 66azithromycin is an antibiotic that can be used to fight many different types of infections caused by susceptible bacteria such as respiratory infections skin infections and sexually transmitted diseases 68 moreover it has been proven to be active in vitro against zika and ebola viruses and to prevent severe respiratory tract infections when treated to patients suffering viral infection 6971 for the mechanism of action azithromycin prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis it binds to the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome thus inhibiting translation of mrna 72 previously azithromycin has been used as adjunctive therapy to provide antibacterial coverage and potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of some viral respiratory tract infections eg influenza 73 74 currently many trials are testing the effect of azithromycin conjunction with hydroxychloroquine on the course of disease in people with sars-cov-2 for example pfizer has announced positive data for the use of its azithromycin zithromax drug along with hydroxychloroquine in a covid-19 clinical trial that was performed in france in brief the clinical trial was conducted to assess hydroxychloroquine in 20 patients 6 of which were co-administered with azithromycin compared with 16 controls and 14 hydroxychloroquine alone group the 6 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine  azithromycin presented with highest virologic cure rate following 6-day treatment 73 three other clinical studies used azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 then 250 mg daily on days 25 co-treated with 10-day regimen of hydroxychloroquine 600 mg daily in an open-label non-randomized study in france 6 pts 73 open-label uncontrolled study in france 11 pts 75 and uncontrolled observational study in france 80 pts 76 specifically gautret et al reported a 100 viral clearance in nasopharyngeal swabs in their 6 patients after co-treated of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin 73 but the findings reported by molina et al stand in contrast with those reported by gautret molina et al repeated the experiments thought the rapid and full viral clearance was quite unexpected and found 8 of 11 patients had significant comorbidities 75 based on those results data presented to date are insufficient to evaluate possible clinical benefits of azithromycin in patients with covid-19 76 furthermore one must consider the additive cardiac toxicity of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin both agents are known to prolong the qt interval and may potentiate the risk for cardiac events in a population known to have cardiac-related comorbiditiesvitamin c is an essential nutrient and plays significant roles within the human body it can neutralize free radicals and assist to prevent or reverse cellular damage as a potent antioxidant agent it is also involved in some biological processes many of which are associated with immune health 77 moreover vitamin c appears to be effective as an antiviral agent especially against influenza viruses 78 many studies showed that vitamin c positively affects the development and maturation of t lymphocytes and nk natural killer cells involved in the immune response to viral agents it also contributes to the inhibition of reactive oxygen species ros production and to the remodulation of the cytokine network typical of systemic inflammatory syndrome 79 given this background a phase ii clinical trial nct04264533 is initiated in china to evaluate high-dose iv vitamin c in icu patients with severe covid-19-associated pneumonia 80 some hospitals have reported giving infected patients 1500 mg of vitamin c as supportive treatment high-dose iv vitamin c has been given in the treatment of 50 moderate to severe covid-19 patients in china 81 the doses varied between 2 and 10 g per day given over a period of 8-10-h iv infusion the oxygenation index was improved in real time and all the patients eventually recovered and were discharged 81 moreover high-dose 15 mgkg body weight vitamin c has been used for several decades clinically and an nih panel also documented clearly that this dose regimen is safe and has no major side effects 81 82as a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic drug low doses of methylprednisolone depo-medrol or solu-medrol have the potential to prevent an extended cytokine response and may accelerate resolution of pulmonary and systemic inflammation in pneumonia 83 84 recently many medical researchers believe that corticosteroids especially methylprednisolone may improve dysregulated immune response caused by sepsis possible complication of infection with covid-19 and increase blood pressure when it is low 85 specifically in a retrospective cohort study 201 patients with confirmed covid-19 who developed ards were treated with methylprednisolone 12 mgkg daily iv for 57 days and the results showed that treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ards in the reduction of the risk of death briefly of those patients with ards who received methylprednisolone treatment 23 of 50 46 patients died while those who did not receive methylprednisolone 21 of 34 618 died 86 in another study 46 patients with severe covid-19 that progressed to acute respiratory failure use of methylprednisolone was associated with improvement in clinical symptoms ie fever hypoxia and a shortened disease course in patients who received the drug compared with those who did not 87 moreover according to expert consensus statement from chinese thoracic society dosage regimen of methylprednisolone should be low to moderate ie  05 to 1 mgkg daily or equivalent 88 and the most common regimens of methylprednisolone applied in china were typically 4080 mg iv daily for a course of 36 days 89 the appropriate dosage low dose versus high dose place in therapy early versus late and role for corticosteroids cytokine storm or comorbidity management require additional clarity there is concern that the use of corticosteroids may have deleterious effects ie inhibition of immune response and pathogen clearance in patients with covid-19 83 one study reported no effect on mortality and decreased viral clearance with the use of corticosteroids 24 furthermore the infectious diseases society of american recommends against the routine use of corticosteroids in covid-19 however they do recommend the use of corticosteroids in the setting of ards in the context of a clinical trial 90 similarly the surviving sepsis campaign recommends against corticosteroids in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury in the absence of ards 91 however they provide a recommendation for the use of corticosteroids in patients with ards acknowledging the weak level of evidence dexamethasone has demonstrated utility on ards by decreasing ventilator days and mortality on severe ards in patients without covid-19 92 whether the use of corticosteroids provides similar benefit in patients with covid-19 and ards remains to be seen ultimately the clinical utilization of corticosteroids still needs to be established and should be considered on a case by case basissince patients with pre-existing pulmonary conditions are at higher risk of covid-19 and should be closely monitored and cared pulmonary vasodilator agents have been used in some patients for hypoxemia refractory to conventional treatments but no study has been performed specifically on covid-19 patients the surviving sepsis campaign suggested a trial of inhaled pulmonary vasodilator method as rescue therapy in mechanically ventilated adults with covid-19 severe ards and hypoxemia despite optimized ventilation and other rescue strategies inhaled nitric oxide ino and inhaled epoprostenol iepo a naturally occurring prostaglandin are two common pulmonary vasodilators that have been widely studied 9395 experience in patients with ards indicates that ino can substantially reduce mean pulmonary artery pressure and improve oxygenation in such patients furthermore in vitro evidence of direct antiviral activity against sars-cov was studied and the genetic similarity between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 suggests their potential effectiveness against sars-cov-2 96 for iepo dosages up to 50 ngkg per minute have been used 93 94 97 98 previous studies reported that to provide a clinically important increase in pao2 and reduction in pulmonary artery pressure the most effective and safe dosage appears to be 2030 ngkg per minute in adults and 30 ngkg per minute in pediatric patients 98 for ino therapy was given for  3 days 30 ppm on day 1 followed by 20 and 10 ppm on days 2 and 3 respectively then weaned on day 4 in a pilot study on sars-cov 99 additionally clinical trials evaluating ino for treatment or prevention of covid-19 are planned or underway nct04305457 nct04306393 nct04312243 100 101 and on march 20 2020 fda granted emergency expanded access allowing its ino delivery system inopulse to be immediately used for the treatment of covid-19 finally additional studies are needed to evaluate the potential role of iepo and ino in the treatment of covid-19 patientssirolimus also known as rapamycin is an immunosuppressant that is used to prevent organ transplant rejection and to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis lam by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin mtor kinase it was originally isolated from the bacterium streptomyces hygroscopicus found on easter island rapa nui 102 and is commercially available as rapamune pfizer mtor and more specifically a protein complex mtorc1 formed by mtor plays a key role in viral replication in an in vitro experiment sirolimus has been shown to affect pi3kaktmtor pathway which inhibited mers-cov activity 103 a new randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial scope by university of cincinnati is planned to be conducted between april and september 2020 to test the effect of sirolimus on progression of patients hospitalized with covid-19 to advanced respiratory support 104 studies of patients hospitalized with influenza can further shed light on the antiviral effect of sirolimus in a randomized clinical trial conducted on 38 patients with confirmed h1n1 pneumonia and on mechanical ventilator support a group treated with corticosteroids and 2 mgday of sirolimus for 14 days n  19 showed significantly better clinical outcomes compared with the group treated with corticosteroids only including shorter median duration of ventilator used 105 delayed oseltamivir plus sirolimus treatment in ph1n1-infected mouse model further suggested a significant association between the sirolimus treatment and improved outcomes 106 additionally a new trial by the chinese university of hong kong is planned to begin in august 2020 to investigate the effect of sirolimus and oseltamivir on normalization of respiratory status and changes in biomarkers viral rna concentration 10 cytokineschemokines and pro-inflammatory mediators and several other clinical endpoints in influenza patients 107 at least one in silico study identified sirolimus as one of the 16 potential candidates for treating covid-19 patients based on data from other human coronavirus infections using network-based drug repurposing model 108tocilizumab branded as actemra is a humanized mab developed by roche and chugai pharmaceutical for treating ra and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients at the time of publishing this article clinicaltrialsgov listed 20 planned studies that included tocilizumab treatment arm all of them at the recruiting stage or earlier a study published in april 2020 reported that 21 severe or critical covid-19 patients in china were treated with the compound with 20 of them recovered at the time of publication and 1 on the way to recovery but still in icu encouraged by these results a larger multicenter clinical trial was launched chictr2000029765 and had about 500 patients treated with tocilizumab already enrolled 109 110sarilumab branded as kefraza a humanized mab was developed by regeneron pharmaceuticals and sanofi for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ra a phase 23 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was planned by regeneron pharmaceuticals and sanofi and in partnership with northwell healths feinstein institutes for medical research for march 2020 targeting to enroll 400 covid-19 patients measuring percent change in c-protein phase 2 only and time to improvement on a 7-point scale based on death and type of hospitalization in patients with serum il-6 level above a threshold as primary endpoints as of the time of this publication the results of this study have not been made public 111anakinra branded as kineret by swedish orphan biovitrum is a modified human il-1 receptor antagonist il-1ra approved in 2001 in the usa and in 2002 in europe for use in ra patients il-1 family of receptors triggers innate immune response and was associated with damaging inflammation 112 out of 5 approved clinical trials involving anakinra treatment 2 also have tocilizumab as a comparison one multicenter open-label non-randomized trial in greece with estimated enrollment of 20 patients 113 and another multicenter randomized open-label trial in belgium with estimated 342 patients has been enrolled to date 114angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor is regarded as an important target in the pathogenesis of covid-19 studies reveal that frequently observed comorbidities including hypertension and diabetes in patients infected with sars-cov-2 are under medication with angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker arb 115118 that result in overexpression of ace2 it is speculated that sars-cov and sars-cov-2 bind to human cells via interaction with ace2 receptors 118 119 the opposing physiological actions of ace and ace2 in the renin-angiotensin system are reviewed to determine the therapeutic efficacy of ace2 inhibitors or arbs 120 121 in hypertensive patients chronic treatment with angiotensin ii type 1 receptor at1r antagonists like losartan lisinopril or olmesartan facilitates cardiac and renal ace2 overexpression according to some in vivo studies 120 122 in contrast sar viral rna following entry into respiratory epithelial cells downregulates the activity of ace2 thereby increasing the levels of angiotensin 2 this may potentially cause severe lung damage 121 123 continued treatment with these drugs may be essential for the survival to attenuate the cardiac stress of advancing covid-19 infection and limit the vasoconstriction and profibrotic effects of angiotensin 2 in alveolar capillariessome of the anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug nsaid are activators of ace2 receptors same as ace inhibitors or arbs their usage can lead to increased risk of contracting covid-19 118 since fatal lung failure induced by sars-cov infections may be controlled by blocking renin-angiotensin pathway 123 ibuprofen may not be harmful however there is no strong evidence suggesting a link between intake of an nsaid and worsening symptoms due to infection caused by sars-cov-2 the fda considers ibuprofen and the likes as a potentially promising therapeutic agent against covid-19 124studies have demonstrated that thiazolidinedione and its derivatives which are type 2 diabetes mellitus drugs show efficacious effect against pulmonary disease induced by respiratory syncytial virus rsv or h1n1 influenza infection 125 126 but their role as a therapeutic drug against coronavirus is not yet explored interestingly it is known that thiazolidinediones may have the potential to upregulate ace2 receptor which is identified as a binding target for sars-cov-2 in host cells 118 however lack of clinical evidence makes it uncertain to determine its therapeutic efficacy against coronavirus infectionsamici et al have demonstrated that indomethacin a well-known nsaid and a potential cyclooxygenase cox inhibitor exhibits antiviral activity against sars-cov and canine coronavirus ccov in vitro studies suggest that indomethacin exhibits dose-dependent response in canine a72 cell monolayers infected with ccov with an ic50 of 5 um after 24 h of exposure also remarkable inhibition against sars-cov-infected vero cells by more than 99 at concentrations that were non-toxic for uninfected cells is also observed in addition indomethacin significantly blocks viral rna synthesis in dogs infected with ccov following oral administration of the drug 1 mgkg 127 this suggests probable efficacy of indomethacin against sars-cov-2 127colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for gout management and a variety of other conditions sharing similar pathophysiology its mechanisms of action are related to interfering with migration of neutrophils to sites of inflammation and blocking the inflammasome complex in both neutrophils and monocytes thus reducing il-1beta activation 128 colchicine also has inhibitory effects on macrophages via the inhibition of the nacht-lrrpyd-containing protein 3 nalp3 inflammasome and pore formation activated by purinergic receptors p2x7 and p2x2 there may also be beneficial effects on endothelial function due to colchicines anti-fibrotic activities some patients with covid-19 present with myopathies and colchicine has been shown to reduce inflammation in the cardiac myocytes 129 there are several ongoing studies investigating colchicine for cytokine storm nct04326790 nct04322682 nct04322565niclosamide an anthelmintic drug has been shown to be an effective sars-cov virus replication inhibitor at dose concentration of 156 um or higher in vero e6 cells without interfering with binding of corona virus onto the cells 130 another study reveals the efficacy of niclosamide in inhibiting mers-cov replication in verob4 cells via reduction of skp2 regulated becn1 ubiquitination and enhancement of autophagic flux and its ic50 value is determined to be 03 um 131 thus the possibility of niclosamide to inhibit sars-cov-2 cannot be neglected ivermectin a potent anthelmintic drug was first discovered to inhibit interaction between integrase in molecule of human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 and its nuclear transport receptor importin  132 further studies exhibit its potential to prevent viral replication of a broad spectrum of viruses including dengue virus flavivirus and influenza 133135 very recently ivermectin has shown inhibition against sars-cov-2 up to 5000-fold at 48 h in vitro inhibition of imp1-mediated nuclear import of viral proteins is suggested as the probable cause of its antiviral activity 136 it will be interesting to know its inhibition effect against sars-cov-2 in vivoboth nitazoxanide and its metabolite and tizoxanide have shown inhibitory effects against mers-cov in llc-mk2 cells besides inhibition of other corona virus strains including murine corona virus mouse hepatitis virus strain a59 mhv-a59 bovine corona virus strain l9 bcov-l9 and human enteric corona virus 4408 hecov-4408 by nitazoxanide is reported via suppression of viral n protein 137 nitazoxanide is found to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs and il-6 in vivo however the relevance of this information is currently unknown 138this treatment option refers to transfusion of plasma loaded with antibodies from individuals after resolution from a specific pathogen this technique has been used for decades 139 transfusion can offer a short-term immediate immunity for individuals convalescent plasma can be used prophylactically and for already infected patients to attenuate clinical severity 140 141 mechanism of action is through binding of the transfused antibodies to the pathogen resulting in cellular cytotoxicity phagocytosis or direct neutralization of the pathogen 142 143 previously convalescent plasma was used for two coronaviruses sars-cov and mers 144 one large study in hong kong involving 80 patients with sars-cov supported early administration of antibodies for optimal clinical effect compared to later administration 145 limited data from taiwan and south korea showed clinical benefits in severe cases of sars-cov and mers 146 147 reported dosage varied widely in terms of the amount of plasma transfused and antibody titer 148 limited data on covid-19 patients from china illustrated clinical benefits 149 150 pilot study reported clinical improvement in terms of fever cough tightness of breath and chest pain while no serious side effects were reported 150there has been considerable attention placed on the role of hypercoagulable state leading to micro- and macro-vascular thrombosis in covid-19 disseminated intravascular coagulation and elevated d-dimer level were identified as predictors of worse outcomes in a cohort study of patients with covid-19 151 patients receiving anticoagulants had a decreased mortality 152 heparin has anti-inflammatory properties and may also inhibit viral attachment via conformational changes to the sars-cov-2 surface receptor spike s1 153 low molecular weight heparin in patients hospitalized with covid-19 was associated with lower serum il-6 concentrations suggesting that there may be an added mechanism besides preventiontreatment of thrombosis 154 based on available evidence it is reasonable to administer venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with either a low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin in hospitalized patients in patients with rapidly progressing respiratory deterioration or where clinical judgment suggests thrombosis treatment doses of anticoagulants may be consideredthe covid-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis in the past 100 years hopefully vaccines and or specific therapeutic drugs targeting sars-cov-2 will be made available in the next few months or years with the speed and volume of basic and clinical covid-19sars-cov-2 research to develop potential drugs and therapies for this disease our hope will be on the horizonin late december 2019 an outbreak of sars-like pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in the chinese city of wuhan which was officially named as covid-19 coronavirus diseases 2019 by the world health organization who later and the novel coronavirus was designated sars-cov-2 spreading nationwide and across the world on march 11th 2020 who assessed that covid-19 could be considered as a pandemic so far the quantity of covid-19 diagnosed worldwide is 132758 and the death toll is 5420 as of march 13th 2020 1the majority of patients infected with sars-cov-2 showed nonspecific symptoms fever dry cough fatigue along with pneumonia demonstrated on chest ct scan imaging and have a mild condition with a case fatality rate cfr around 2 2 however among elderly patients and patients with chronic underlying diseases such as hypertension diabetes there is a higher rate of transmission to the intensive care unit icu and mortality 3given sars-cov-2 is a novel strain causing a global pandemic effective targeted therapies are urgently needed however no proven effective antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies exist for the treatment of covid-19 4 most patients have received numerous potentially targeted therapies as described so far based on medication experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers which mostly belong to existing antiviral agents approved or in development for treating infections caused by human immunodeficiency virus hiv hepatitis b virus hbv hepatitis c virus hcv and influenza and a section of patients have participated in ongoing uncontrolled clinical trialsin this review we summarize the current therapeutic medicines used in the real world according to possible mechanisms based on chinese clinical experience hoping to provide some implications for clinical medicationremdesivir is a nucleoside analog effective against a variety of viruses including mers-cov and sars-cov in vitro and animal models 56 and phase iii clinical trial for inhibiting ebola virus are ongoing 7 research has revealed that in vitro remdesivir has the ability to inhibit sars-cov-2 recently 8 the first covid-19 case in the us has improved condition and declined the viral load after treated with remdesivir on illness day 7 suggesting that remdesivir has the potential to treat covid-19 recently the results of a trial of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with severe covid-19 under sympathetic medication were published the data have shown that 68 of severe patients have relieved symptoms after using remdesivir and the mortality of those patients is 13 which is noteworthy though these findings need to be confirmed in the ongoing randomized placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy for covid-19 9 remdesivir is an investigational agent not commercially available safety and efficacy have not been established in covid-19 patients it is available as part of several ongoing clinical trials for adult and nonpregnant patients while individual compassionate use requests are limited to pregnant women or pediatric patients 18 years of age with confirmed covid-19 and severe disease although there are no clear contraindications in the population included in clinical trials nct04257656 nct04252664 nct04292899 people with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml per minute and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate aminotransferase ast more than five times the upper limit of the normal range were excluded therefore patients with liver and kidney function impairment should be used with caution fig 1
chloroquine is a drug widely used in the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases 10 reported to having broad-spectrum antiviral potential in2006 11 in a recent study 8 chloroquine was found to inhibit sars-cov-2 at low-micromolar ec50  113 m in vero e6 cells which can be clinically achievable based on experience with rheumatoid arthritis 12 in addition time-of-addition assay 8 demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry and post-entry stages of the 2019-ncov infection in vero e6 cells the antiviral activity of chloroquine may be due to the following three ways fig 2
 1 reduce the ace2 receptor terminal glycosylation on the surface of cells thus interfere with the binding of sars-cov-2 to the ace2 receptor 13 2 increase the ph of endosomes and lysosomes to prevent the fusion process of the virus with host cells and subsequent virus replication 1415 3 impede pro-inflammatory signaling activation and production of cytokines eg il-1 il-6 and tnf by inhibiting lysosomal activity in antigen-presenting cells apcs interrupting binding between toll-like receptors tlr7 and tlr9 and their rnadna ligands and interfering with the interaction between cytosolic dna and the nucleic acid sensor cyclic gmp-amp synthase cgas the press released from the state council of china indicated that chloroquine phosphate had demonstrated marked efficacy in preventing the deterioration of covid-19 related pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in china on february 17 2020 16 the latest guideline 17 recommended for adults 18-65 years old 500 mg each time 2 timesday lasts 7days for patients who weigh more than 50 kg 500 mg each time 2 timesday lasts 2 days and 500 mg each time 1 timeday lasts 5 days for patients who weigh less than 50 kg banned for people with underlying heart disease due to its cardiotoxicity there are currently more than 20 clinical trials of chloroquine registered in the china clinical trial registryhydroxychloroquine is an analogue of chloroquine with similar therapeutic effects and significantly reduced toxic side effects 18 besides in vitro hydroxychloroquine exhibited better anti-sars-cov-2 activity than chloroquine 19 comprehensive treatment and management of coronavirus disease 2019 an expert consensus statement from shanghai 20 recommended hydroxychloroquine in an attempt of antiviral treatment however no dosage recommendations were made peking university third hospital established a physiology-based pharmacokinetic pbpk model based on the data of the hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in vitro to simulate the distribution concentration of the drug in the lung whole blood and plasma after different dosing regimens according to the results of the pbpk model it is recommended that the oral loading dose of hydroxychloroquine 400 mg bid on the first day and the maintenance dose of 200 mg bid continue to be treated for four days on the fifth day the lung titer can reach more than three times the oral chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice daily 19 this dose was subsequently confirmed in the first randomized controlled clinical trial chictr2000029559 of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19 which enroll 62 patients with covid-19 31 received hcq 400 mgd 200 mg bid another 31 entered the control group have found that after 5 days the clinical recovery time of the hydroxychloroquine group was significantly shortened and the symptoms of fever and cough were relieved faster p  005 81 of patients in the hydroxychloroquine group had significantly improved pneumonia compared with 55 in the control group p  005 all patients who progressed to critical illness were in the control group this study affirmed the therapeutic effect of hydroxychloroquine 21recently in a clinical trial 22 involving 36 patients with covid-19 shown the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has a full and rapid viral clearance the effects of which is better than hydroxychloroquine alone the mechanism by which azithromycin enhances the efficacy of covid-19 is unclear but azithromycin has previously been shown to prevent severe respiratory infections in patients infected with the virus 23 however jean et al 24 have not observed similar results in 11 covid-19 patients who have received the combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin given the trial is not an rct the number of cases is small and the control group is from other clinical centers an expanded clinical trial with good quality control is needed to confirm in addition the simultaneous use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin can lead to a prolonged qt interval and increase the risk of tip torsion arrhythmia so careful evaluation is requireddue to the cardiac and retinal toxicity acute lethal risk of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is used electrocardiogram monitoring should be performed and attention should be paid to changes in patients vision and neurological symptomsfavipiravir t-705 belongs to nucleoside analogs like ribavirin approved for the treatment of novel or re-emerging pandemic influenza in china and japan effectively against multiple viruses like influenza ebola yellow fever chikungunya norovirus and enterovirus 25 favipiravir is teratogenic and is strictly prohibited during pregnancy and lactation 2627 wang et al reported its activity against 2019-ncov ec50  6188 m in vero e6 cells 8 and subsequently more than 10 clinical trials of favipiravir for the treatment of covid-19 has been registered the preliminary results from one of the clinical trials chictr2000029600 showed that group treated with favipiravir 35 cases has shorter median time to virus clearance 4 days vs 11 days high improvement rates of chest image 9143 vs 6222 than control group treated with lopinavir and ritonavir 45 cases with significant differences between the two groups and adverse reactions were lower than that in the control group the zhongnan hospital of wuhan university initiated a multicenter randomized open and positive parallel-controlled clinical study of favipiravir in the treatment of covid-19 chictr2000030254 with 240 patients enrolled and clinical treatment observations completed the results showed that the experimental group treated with favipilavir 120 cases is significantly better than the control group treated with arbidol 120 cases in the treatment of covid-19 in terms of secondary indicators the clinical recovery rate of day 7 was significantly better in the experimental group than in the control group which were 7143 and 5586 respectively in terms of secondary indicators the time from randomization to fever reduction 25 days vs 42 days cough relief 457 days vs 598 days and the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation 816 vs 1712 during the trial in the experimental group was significantly better than the control group in view of the good safety of favipiravir and the drugs are available experts have been formally recommended to be included in the guideline as soon as possible 28arbidol has been licensed in russia and china against upper respiratory tract infections caused by influenza a and b viruses it is contraindicated in patients allergic to this product antiviral mechanism of arbidol is by inhibiting hemagglutininase a protease on the surface of the influenza virus that binds to sialic acid receptors on human cells and then enters the cells through endocytosis to prevent the influenza virus from infecting human cells besides abidol can induce interferon production and exert a broad-spectrum antiviral effect 29 a recent study has revealed that arbidol can inhibit sars-cov-2 infection at a concentration of 10-30 m effectively in vitro 30 deng et al 31 found patients taking arbidol and lpvr n  16 had increased sars-cov-2 negative rate in 7-days and 14-days and improved chest ct scan compared to oral lpvr n  17 only however no effects of lpvr or arbidol was found to improve symptoms or shorten the clearance time of nucleic acid in respiratory specimens while there are more gastrointestinal adverse reactions comparing with the placebo control group in a clinical trial at shanghai public health clinical center 32 these contradictory results may be due to small sizes and inconsistent timing of medications missing the best therapeutic window in part of patients a clinical study of arbidol using for post-exposure prophylaxis of sars-cov-2 in a high-risk population including medical staff is in progress chictr2000029592 may providing us whether there are effects of arbidol on prevention and early treatment the latest guide recommends that the course of treatment for arbidol should not exceed 10 days 200 mgeach time 3 timesdaylopinavir is approved by the food and drug administration fda to treat hiv infection as a protease inhibitor with ritonavir as a booster by inhibiting cytochrome p450 to increase blood concentrations 33 lopinavirritonavir lpvr is contraindicated for allergy to this product severe liver dysfunction and drugs that are highly dependent on cyp3a clearance and elevated plasma concentrations are associated with acute or life-threatening reactions a non-randomized clinical trial showed that sars patients treated with ribavirin combined with lpvr had a lower risk of ards and death than ribavirin monotherapy 34 a korean covid-19 patient has been found reduced viral loads and improved clinical symptoms when being treated with lopinavirritonavir 35 while it was not clear whether it was an effect of an antiviral drug or natural course or both lpvr has been recommended for the treatment of covid-19 in the latest guideline 400 mg100 mgeach time 2 timesday based on experience in sars-cov and mers-cov nausea vomiting fat metabolism disorders and elevated blood sugar are common adverse reactions to lpvr elderly patients with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia need close monitoring of blood glucose and blood lipids however with the increase in the number of clinical applications most clinicians believe that it is not effective and gastrointestinal adverse reactions also occur frequently 36 nejm has published an article on march 18 2020 reporting a randomized controlled open-label clinical trial involving 199 patients with severe covid-19 in the china-japan friendship hospital chictr2000029308 which proves that lpvr has no significant effect on the treatment of covid-19 37 that might confirm antiviral drugs themselves are challenging to reverse the lung injury caused by a cytokine stormribavirin a nucleoside analog may through multiple mechanisms of action including lethal mutagenesis specific or nonspecific chain termination and inhibition of nucleotide biosynthesis to eliminate rna viruses 38 it has been approved for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus rsv by fda 39 and contraindicated to autoimmune hepatitis hemoglobin disease impaired kidney function creatinine clearance below 50 ml per minute pregnant females or males with pregnant partners and allergies to it 40 due to its broad-spectrum antiviral effect it was widely used in the early stages of the sars epidemic however the role ribavirin play is controversial on the one hand severe side effects such as hypoxia anemia and decreased hemoglobin levels are related to the use of high-dose ribavirin 41 the other hand contradictory results from clinical observation experiments 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 in cell culture ribavirin has an inhibitory effect on sara-cov-2 but requires higher concentrations ribavirin is not recommended for antiviral treatment in diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus disease from military medical team supporting wuhantrial version 2 but has been included in the guidelines for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia trial version 7 which recommend low-dose ribavirin 500 mg each time 2 to 3 timesday combined with lopinavirritonavir or interferon instead of monotherapy a trial comparing effectiveness and safety of ribavirin plus interferon-alpha lopinavirritonavir plus interferon-alpha and ribavirin plus lopinavirritonavir plus interferon-alpha in patients with mild to moderate novel coronavirus pneumonia is in progress chictr2000029387 the antiviral effect of ribavirin in the combination of multiple drugs is not clear and clinical trials need to be confirmed table 1
the antiviral interferon system plays a critical role in the innate immune defense in human beings ifns are cytokines produced by cells when meeting viruses 49 at present ifns are approved for indications such as hepatitis b hepatitis c and various malignancies by the fda in patients infected with sars-cov and mers-cov the ifns production is suppressed 5051 which is confirmed to be responsible for activating pro-inflammatory monocyte macrophages and cytokines in the lungs of the sars mouse model 52 effect of ifn monotherapy or combined with ribavirin was observed in vitro and animal models if given early in the disease 53 54 55 56 however in clinical trials combination therapy with ifn did not show good curative effect and prognosis 4357 58 59 which might occur due to medication delay and multiple organ damage caused by subcutaneous medications 57 guidelines 17 for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia trial version 7 recommend interferon inhalation as early as possible which ensuring higher levels of the drug in lung tissue and longer drug circulation time than subcutaneous injection it should be noted that nebulized interferon is contraindicated in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax and pulmonary bullaeat present the corticosteroid use is controversial in covid-19 on the one hand corticosteroids suppress lung inflammation and cytokine storms which is essential for covid-19 patients especially severe and critical patients on the other hand increased secondary infection rate and delayed virus clearance can be found in sars and influenza pneumonia patients using corticosteroids 60 61 62 a small observational study of patients with covid-19 showed potential benefits from low-dose corticosteroid treatment in critically ill patients despite no significant improvement in overall survival 63 ni et al 64 retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 72 patients with covid-19 and found that there was no statistically significant difference in the time of viral nucleic acid negation and lung image recovery between the low-medium dose glucocorticoids methylprednisolone 075-15 mgkgd treatment group and the non-glucocorticoid control group glucocorticoid immunosuppressive therapy does not prolong virus clearance time in patients with covid-19 suggesting that hormone therapy may be helpful to severe patients a study reviewed the clinical data of 112 cases in wuhan red cross hospital with the treatment of low dose methylprednisolone when mild and common cases became severe and critical and found that the optimal window period for low dose methylprednisolone treatment of covid-19 is within 48 hours after switching from mild condition to severe or critical the early administration of low dose methylprednisolone within the window period for these patients could significantly reduce the critical illness rate and mortality rate 65 the expert consensus statement in china 66 recommends low-to-moderate corticosteroid 05-1 mgkg per day methylprednisolone or equivalent should be used carefully in critically ill patients with covid-19 and the duration should be short 7 daystocilizumab is a recombinant humanized antibody that specifically binds the interleukin-6 il-6 receptor to inhibit the activity of the il-6 licensed for adult rheumatoid arthritis and cytokine release syndrome 67 il-6 has long been considered as one of the key cytokines that induce cytokine storms among patients with covid-19 il-6 was significantly higher in severe and dead patients than in mild and discharged patients 368 for the reasons above the first affiliated hospital of university of science and technology of china initiated a multicenter randomized controlled trial for the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of covid-19 chictr2000029765 in the first phase of the clinical study 14 patients with covid-19 pneumonia maximum age of 82 years 9 of whom were severe and 2 of who were critically ill had diffuse lesions in both lungs before treatment of which 11 had a persistent fever after treatment with the new treatment regimen of tocilizumab combined conventional therapy the temperature of 11 patients with fever fell to normal within 24 hours 4 patients had better absorption of ct lesions in the lungs xu et al 69 also found similar results in observational studies therefore for patients with severe conditions caused by a cytokine storm tocilizumab is a drug worthy of clinical research there have been five clinical trials in addition to that mentioned above on trastuzumab in progress for patients with extensive infiltrating lesions of the lungs and severe patients with elevated il-6 tocilizumab treatment can be tried the recommended dose is 400 mg and the cumulative dose is up to 2 times and medical staff should pay attention to allergic reactions and exclude active infections such as tuberculosis 17in the absence of particularly effective medicines from western medicine chinese medicine has played a unique advantage in improving immunity and improving symptoms in china more than 90 of people use traditional chinese medicine for treatment 70 chinese medicine physicians summarized the law and experience of traditional chinese medicine in the treatment of viral infectious diseases deeply explored ancient classic recipes combined with clinical practice thus selecting a group of prescription drugs represented by the three drugs and three prescriptions with obvious curative effects jinhua qinggan granules lianhua qingwen capsules xuebijing injection qingfeipaidu decoction huashibaidufang and xuanfeibaidufang jinhua qinggan granule and lianhua qingwen capsule are used in no confirmed suspected cases the former is mainly used for patients with headache as the main symptom and mild fever symptoms while the latter is used for patients with severe fever and dry stool qingfei paidu decoction is a general prescription for mild severe and critical covid-19 patients 71 in the treatment of severe and critically ill patients xuebijing injection may be a very important therapeutic drug xuebijing injection has a curative effect on the inflammatory storm and coagulation dysfunction early clinical studies have proved that xuebijing has a certain effect in severe pneumonia 72 some observational studies 73 74 75 suggested that traditional chinese medicine can improve patients symptoms inflammation and promote the absorption of lung infections however there is a lack of reliable rct researches in covid-19based on the currently reported retrospective studies on covid-19 6476 77 78 79 80 81 we found that most people received two or more antiviral therapy in combination because it depends on the patients liver and kidney function whether there is complications and adverse reactions there are various combinations the most common combinations are the following interferon ifn  lpvr ifn  arbidol oseltamivir  arbiodol ifn  lpvr  arbidol a multicenter prospective study of 237 patients showed the triple combination antiviral therapy of ifn lpvr and arbidol showed shorter viral shedding time and hospitalization time compared with the dual combination antiviral therapy of ifn and arbidol and the earlier the time to initiate triple antiviral treatment the shorter the time of virus shedding 82in addition some studies have suggested that troponin is elevated in some severe and critically ill patients 4 90 the most likely cause is myocardial damage caused by inflammatory storms cardioprotective drugs such as coenzyme q10 trimetazidine hydrochloride and creatine phosphate and vitamin c could be used in severe and critical patients to improve cardiac energy metabolism 58 in elderly patients the hematopoietic function of liver kidney heart and bone marrow declines with age and there are more underlying complications and drug treatments it is necessary to pay attention to the interaction between antiviral drugs and treatment drugs for basic diseases and close monitoring and individualized treatment is requiredin conclusion there are no antiviral drugs proven to be effective currently antiviral drugs should be used carefully to reduce viral replication in the early stages of disease based on the dynamic results of clinical trials while it is not recommended to use antiviral drugs for the prevention of covid-19 since the antiviral effects of lpvr and arbidol are not apparent and gastrointestinal adverse reactions frequently occur the therapeutic effect of the above two drugs on covid-19 still needs further evaluation based on the current clinical trial results and clinical medication experience we recommend favipiravir and interferon for patients with mild to moderate conditions given the good results of the clinical trial of remdesivir are focused on severe patients currently we recommend it for severe patients chloroquine is another antiviral drug that has the potential to have an effect on severe patients due to its immunosuppressive effect in addition to the antiviral effect in critically ill patients low-to-moderate corticosteroid and tocilizumab should be used to combat cytokine storms and reduce mortality with cautionthe authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this worksince december 2019 the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 designated sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly to almost every country causing coronavirus disease19 covid-19 pneumonia according to the johns hopkins csse website httpscoronavirusjhuedumaphtml as of 22-04-2020 there were globally more than 2500000 documented cases 178371 deaths with country specific mortality of more than 10 in spain italy france and the uk 1 it has been observed that morbidity and mortality increase with age and comorbidities like hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease or chronic obstructive lung disease 2currently there are no approved vaccines or pharmaceutical therapies available for prevention of sars-cov-2 infection or treatment of covid-19 extensive global research efforts are underway to identify specific vaccination strategies and pharmaceutical targets however the development of a specific vaccine is not expected for at least 12-18 months due to required time for research evaluation and regulatory approval worldwide social distancing and self-quarantine are currently the only protective measures to slow the rate of sars-cov-2 infections and help to keep the novel coronavirus from overwhelming the healthcare systems nevertheless every day covid-19 related deaths are still increasing and so the repurposing of available and approved drugs has emerged as a feasible strategy for treatment near term 3 in this regard potentially suitable antiviral and immunomodulatory candidates have been identified and selected 4one promising opportunity might be the clinical use of the oral prescription drugs chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine hcq used for the treatment of malaria and certain inflammatory conditions 4 in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 has been demonstrated for both 5 in a recent clinical study in china it was demonstrated that cq treatment of covid-19 patients had a clinical benefit versus control treatment 6results of an open label non-randomized clinical trial with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in france support these findings 7 based on these limited in vitro and clinical data cq and hcq are now recommended for treatment of hospitalized covid-19 patients in a growing number of countries and fda just granted emergency authorisation for botha larger number of clinical trials to further investigate the benefit of cq and hcq in covid-19 are already initiated in china and elsewhere 8 although the world health organization who and other organizations recommend cqhcq for testing to fight covid-19 pandemic many questions remain regarding the design of conducted or ongoing clinical studies with cqhcq and the conclusions drawn from the respective results 9the who recently announced the initiation of the so called solidarity trial which physicians from all over the world can easily join without many bureaucratic barriers 9 four drugs have been initially recommended to be evaluated in this trial as monotherapy or in combination-cq previously used for treatment of malaria-remdesivir developed for treatment of ebola-lopinavir and ritonavir used in combination for treatment of hiv-lopinavir and ritonavir with interferon beta
the antiviral nucleoside analogue remdesivir has been administered to patients with confirmed severe sars-cov-2 infections in the united states europe and japan 4other therapies have been evaluated in human clinical trials during previous coronavirus outbreaks sars-cov in 20022003 and mers-cov in 2012 and include lopinavir and ritonavir with or without interferon beta 4however it is not known whether these proposed strategies are effective in the treatment of sars-cov-2 infected covid-19 patients for example lopinavir and ritonavir already failed to show beneficial clinical effects versus standard of care in a recently published clinical study with covid-19 patients conducted in china 10it is expected that the who list of drugs and compounds will continue to be amended with other candidates planned to be researched in the solidarity trial 9cq and the metabolite hcq are well known drugs concerning pharmacology approved indications dosing appropriate patient populations as well as clinical efficacy and safety both drugs act as weak bases and are known to accumulate within endosomes lysosomes or golgi vesicles within cells resulting in increase of ph within these compartments 11 the increase in ph especially in lysosomes could interfere with ph-dependent steps of sars-cov-2 replication like fusion and uncoating 12 as coronavirus requires acidification of endosomes for proper functioning 12 it is speculated that a ph increase in intracellular compartments might be one important inhibiting effect of cq and probably of hcq in the treatment of sars-cov-2 infected patients 8an interesting new finding demonstrated that cq has characteristics of a zinc ionophore and specifically targets the extracellular trace element zinc to intracellular lysosomes 13 zinc is an essential micronutrient with strictly regulated systemic and intracellular concentrations and it is physiologically needed for an effective antiviral response 14from in vitro and some clinical studies it is well known that zinc elicits activity against several viruses 14 indeed it was demonstrated that zinc inhibits the activity of rdrp of hepatitis e virus 15 it was further shown in vitro that zinc inhibited coronavirus rdrp activity and that zinc ionophores blocked coronavirus replication 16 despite the well-known antiviral effects of zinc and possible properties of cqhcq as zinc ionophore the combination of zinc with one of these established drugs to achieve additive or even synergistic antiviral effects ought to be still confirmedzinc is a general stimulant of antiviral immunity 14 in the context of covid-19 morbidity and mortality zinc deficiency may be relevant for the outcome of patient populations with severe clinical courses of covid-19 including elderly patients patients with hypertension diabetes coronary heart disease or chronic obstructive lung disease in addition hypertensive and cardiovascular disease patients are frequently treated with hydrochlorothiazide angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin 2 receptor antagonists which can result in an increased urinary excretion of zinc with subsequent systemic zinc deficiency 17 zinc deficiency was also demonstrated in diabetic patients 18 decreased zinc plasma levels are even present in a large number of healthy elderly patients 19 the nhanes iii study demonstrated that 3545 of adults aged 60 years or older had zinc intakes below the estimated average requirement of 68 mgday for elderly females and 94 mgday for elderly males 2025 of older adults still had inadequate zinc intakes even when intakes from both food and dietary supplements were considered 20 it may be speculated that also younger adults or even infants and adolescents with present zinc deficiency could be at higher risk for severe courses of sars-cov-2 infections therefore we hypothesize that effective zinc supplementation during treatment of covid-19 with cq and hcq which have zinc ionophore characteristics may result in increased intracellular zinc levels in general and in lysosomes specifically higher intracellular zinc levels might result in a more efficient rdrp inhibition and consequently a more effective inhibition of intracellular sars-cov-2 replication potentially improving clinical outcomes of covid-19 patients treated with cq or hcq whether this accumulation and treatment effect may sufficiently occur in relevant pulmonary tissue of covid-19 patients has to be confirmeddue to the existing substantial evidence we propose to amend current clinical trial designs to test this hypothesis in the treatment of covid-19 patients by including at least one treatment arm with oral cq or hcq in combination with zinc however because of the better clinical safety profile hcq should be preferred to avoid interindividual differences of oral absorption rates and because of possible gastrointestinal side effects of oral zinc supplementation it is especially for inpatients proposed to use parenteral zinc preparations which are approved and clinically already used for outpatients at expected high risk to develop severe covid-19 oral administration of sufficient doses of zinc should be considered supplementation of zinc is known to be clinically relatively safe if dosing ranges and upper limits of dosing are based on recommended dietary allowances 20 in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial oral zinc supplementation with 45 mg zinc per day for 12 months demonstrated a significant lower incidence of infections in the elderly and was very well tolerated 21in the first clinical study arm eg of an open-label randomized clinical trial we recommend using preferably hcq in daily doses and treatment durations as recently studied 7 in the comparator arm similar daily doses of hcq should be combined with parenteral or oral zinc as comprehensive zinc dose findings studies may currently not be feasible but as sufficient clinical safety needs to be ensured we recommend administering zinc in the range of the upper limit of dosing based on recommended dietary allowances 20 so for a male or female adult patient with normal renal function and no contraindications a parenteral daily dose of 40 mg zinc could be implemented dependent on observed tolerability safety and growing clinical experience the total daily dose of zinc could be further increased or decreased at the discretion of the physicianbased on real world dialogue the combination of hcq with oral zinc often in a triple combination with the antibiotic azithromycin is obviously already used by some clinical practitioners in accordance to his own statement and available press reports the medical practitioner dr vladimir zelenko form monroe new york usa has already treated hundreds of patients with coronavirus-like symptoms with the described triple combination claiming favourable clinical outcome based on personal communication the following experimental treatment regimen has been used so far hcq 200 mg twice daily zinc sulfate 220 mg once-daily and azithromycin 500 mg once-daily each for 5 days detailed analysis of patient outcome is currently ongoing and might support guidance for clinical practice and the design of needed randomized clinical trialsmore effective covid-19 treatment protocols to ensure shorter hospital stays less need for prolonged mechanical ventilation and to reduce death are still missing based on the evidence of therapeutic effects of cqhcq their possible pharmacological effect as zinc ionophores and possibly underestimated specific and unspecific antiviral effects of zinc we hypothesize that the combination of cqhcq with zinc in the treatment of covid-19 patients in an out- or inpatients setting may help to improve clinical outcomes and to limit the covid-19 fatality rates 1 2the safety tolerability and efficacy of a combination of cqhcq with zinc possibly in triple combination with an antibiotic like azithromycin still represents an additional option to win todays battle against covid-19 this hypothesis can be rapidly evaluated by amendment of a suitable who-supported solidarity trial or other studies important advantages of using cq or preferably hcq in combination with zinc are the broad availability affordability and demonstrated efficacy and safety in approved and clinically established indications the european medicines agency recommends using cq or hcq only in clinical trials or emergency use programs 22 whether zinc supplementation in combination with cqhcq should be recommended for high risk or also younger patients outside of clinical trials as a prevention or treatment approach during sars-cov-2 pandemic should be currently considered only on a

the company leukocare in munich germanythe authors confirm that this article content has no conflict of interestacute respiratory tract infections artis comprise the most common illnesses worldwide and children often experience several episodes a year1 in children clinical presentation can range from mild uncomplicated upper respiratory tract illness to severe lower respiratory tract infection lrti including pneumonia bronchiolitis croup and exacerbations of asthma or wheezing2 the world health organization estimated that 19 million children died from arti in 2000 70 in africa and south east asia3 in 2011 pneumonia alone led to 13 million deaths worldwide in children less than 5 years of age4
most artis are caused by viruses but until the advent of multiplex polymerase chain reaction pcr techniques it was often not possible to identify accurately specific viral infections in clinical cases5 6 the pathogens considered responsible for most arti are respiratory syncytial virus rsv influenza a and b parainfluenza viruses types 1 2 and 3 and adenovirus2 several new pathogens associated with arti have been identified more recently including human metapneumovirus hmpv rhinovirus coronavirus human bocavirus hbov and parainfluenza 42 7
vaccine efficacy trials provide intensive active follow-up of a well-defined population and can be used to evaluate viral epidemiology as part of a trial of pandemic influenza vaccines which included 1 year of prospective active community-based surveillance for influenza-like illness ili in 17 centers in eight countries8 we evaluated the prevalence and incidence of respiratory viruses in children 6 months to less than 10 years of age at first vaccinationparents were instructed to contact the study center within 24 h if the child became ill active surveillance via scripted telephone contact was conducted from 2 weeks after first vaccination and contact made every 12 weeks to day 385 for each child regardless of time of enrollment ili was defined as temperature 380 c by any route and at least one of newworsening cough sore throat stuffy nose or runny nosestudy staff visited the childs home to collect one anterior nasal swab and one throat swab ideally within 24 h of ili onset and at most within 7 days collection could also take place at a study center or hospital if necessary swabs were transported in a single tube of m4rt transport medium stored at 70 c and maintained on dry ice during transport a 7-day symptom-free period was required between new ili episodes sample testing was performed by standard multiplex pcr techniques8 10

rhinoviruses are classified in the picornavirus family of the enterovirus genus7 a high prevalence of this family has been reported in other studies in different settings13 14 18 19 20 as in our study an australian study with active community-based surveillance of healthy preschool-age children with arti found that picornaviruses including rhinoviruses were the most frequently detected 41313 however other viruses were detected less frequently than in our study rsv 66 parainfluenza 41 influenza a and hmpv both 37 adenovirus 31 and coronavirus nl63 1513 in another prospective australian study in children aged 6 months to 3 years reporting ili rhinovirus was again the most commonly detected15 however in contrast to our results adenovirus was detected at the same frequency as rhinovirus followed by parainfluenza 3 polyomavirus hmpv and hbov15 influenza ah1n1 and rsv were relatively uncommon approximately 40 of children were fully or partially vaccinated against influenzarhinovirus is not always the most commonly detected virus in children with respiratory disease in children under 5 years of age hospitalized for lrti in thailand the most commonly detected viruses were rsv 195 rhinovirus 187 hbov 128 and influenza 8216 a study of children aged 3 years hospitalized for lrti in brazil found that rsv was most prevalent 535 of episodes followed by hmpv 323 rhinovirus 208 influenza 127 hbov 104 parainfluenza and adenovirus both 65 and coronavirus 1217
in our analysis influenza prevalence increased with age the other viruses showed the opposite trend with the lowest prevalence observed in the oldest children 60 months there was a less obvious pattern in younger ages but in general prevalence of all viruses except influenza declined with age despite this the burden of illness remained considerable in older childrenthere was a clear seasonal pattern for influenza rsv and hmpv in most countries and to a lesser extent for rhinovirusenterovirus a previous study found that although there was no clear seasonal peak for rhinovirusenterovirus onset seemed to correspond with the start of the school year in the usa18 a limited one year analysis of human rhinoviruses and enteroviruses in ili in latin america showed a year-round temporal distribution throughout central and south america21 however human rhinovirus c species displayed opposite seasonal trends on either side of the equator accounting for a higher percentage of ili cases north of the equator between september and january while south of the equator detection increased between april and july21
as part of the study all children received a monovalent influenza ah1n1 pandemic vaccine one or two doses of an as03-adjuvanted vaccine were administered or two doses of an unadjuvanted vaccine trivalent seasonal influenza vaccination rate in the present study was approximately 18 influenza a subtype h1 was not isolated in any children influenza a subtype h3 was isolated in 90 of children and influenza b was isolated in 57 of children no difference between the study vaccine groups was observedcases associated with influenza were least likely to be co-infected with other respiratory viruses rhinovirusenterovirus was also more common as a single infection adenovirus and hbov were found more often as a co-infection bacterial co-infection was not measured as part of this study in the us-based influenza incidence surveillance project which evaluated the most commonly detected viruses in outpatients with arti or ili three-quarters of all co-infections involved adenovirus and rhinovirusenterovirus18 a uk-based analysis found negative associations between influenza a and hmpv and between influenza a and rhinovirus22 positive associations were found between parainfluenza and rhinovirus rsv and rhinovirus adenovirus and rhinovirus and parainfluenza and rsv22 no correlation was found between co-infection and clinical severity in a study in brazil evaluating children under 5 years who sought medical care for respiratory tract infections23 more research is needed to understand the interaction of respiratory viruses and the host response to infectionthere were no clear differences between viruses in the severity of illness most ili episodes were medically attended ili associated with influenza resulted in the highest proportion of children missing school or daycare 52 although 2040 of children infected with the other viruses also missed school or daycare there was no difference between viruses in the proportion of children hospitalized clinical features were variable depending upon the viral infection associated with the ili episodestudy limitations have been described previously9 only healthy children participated in the trial limiting generalizability in addition our study did not include any children aged 6 months and only a limited number of children aged 611 months so our findings are mainly relevant to older children fever was part of the ili definition and therefore we would have missed cases in children with no fever to put this into perspective in the influenza incidence surveillance project 34 and 43 of cases among children aged 14 years and 517 years respectively met the arti definition which did not require fever but did not meet the ili definition which did require fever18 however our definition of ili was somewhat broader except in children under 2 years of age and us data may not be generalizable to the tropical and southern hemisphere countries in our study the inclusion of only healthy children in the study and the exclusion of cases with no fever would have underestimated the burden we also could not discriminate between rhinovirus and enterovirus by pcr therefore the exact prevalence and incidence of each one could not be determined finally our study included only a small number of pneumonia cases n  20 limiting the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the distribution of viral infection in these cases the overall pneumonia detection rate in the clinical trial 09 is higher than but in line with what has been reported in the us for hospitalized cases24 however our sample collection rate among pneumonia cases was only 625 compared with 800 for ili overallin conclusion our active surveillance of healthy children as part of a vaccine efficacy trial provided evidence of the burden of respiratory illness associated with a range of viruses a substantial burden of illness occurs in older children data on the epidemiology of respiratory viruses determined from active surveillance of healthy children are generally lacking and are particularly sparse in the developing countries included in our study a considerable amount of the burden would not be identified through hospital-based surveillance these novel data fill an important gap in our knowledge of the epidemiology of viruses contributing to the substantial burden of respiratory disease in children and may be useful in informing priorities for implementation of existing vaccine programs and development of new vaccinesthis work was supported by glaxosmithkline biologicals sa who was the sponsor of the study and was

manuscript and the corresponding author was responsible for the submission of the publicationsince the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019ncov also known as novel coronary pneumonia ncp in january 2020 a number of clinical trials for treatment have been registered in china although the time span of study registration was less than 2 weeks 30 january 2020 to 12 february 2020 subtle changes in the classification of registered trials could be seen from the development of the epidemic including that the proportion of studies targeting critically ill patients had gradually increased in the latter period and patients physical and psychological rehabilitation had also received attention based on the current registered trials together with the epidemic situation in china and published literatures of 2019ncov we made a preliminary assessment on the prospects of therapy for 2019ncov and the availability of drugs in the short termwe used novel coronavirus to search in the chinese clinical trial register and 2019ncov in httpclinicaltrialsgov a total of 107 clinical trials had been registered by chinese researchers of which 90 were registered in the chinese clinical trial register and 17 in httpclinicaltrialgov by 14 february 2020 almost all trials were investigatorinitiated most of the trials involved clinical therapy and a small part of pathogenesis research and 87 trials were related to drug interventions more than 20 trials were conducted in wuhan the most severely affected area figure 1 most of them were shortterm clinical trials with the planned study period of 1 to 11 months and about a quarter of them were within 6 monthswe used novel coronavirus and china to search on pubmed website by 14 february 2020 and a total of 81 literatures for 2019ncov were retrieved after excluding the results like news and comments most of the literatures were focusing on the description of epidemiology and clinical characteristics of 2019ncov while studies of diagnosis imaging nucleic acid detection and treatment were limited in terms of diagnosis seven literatures were published in radiology to conduct computed tomography analysis for more than 80 patients to summarize the imaging characteristics of ncp
1
 in addition there were two literatures on nucleic acid detection of 2019ncov
2
 it should be noted that there was no shortage of institutions for nucleic acid detection and even a few of them had been approved by the government however the data to prove the sensitivity and consistency were still lacking and the new england journal published the first clinical evidence of tumor patients in the outbreak of 2019ncov supporting that tumor patients may be more susceptible to infection due to the influence of malignant tumor chemoradiotherapy surgery and other factors on immune status
3
 in terms of treatment no successful randomized controlled trial rct had been published which also reflected the bottleneck of current treatment in general finding effective targeted drugs remains an urgent workin the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars period 17 years ago our capacity to conduct clinical trial on drugs was still relatively weak in china and there was also a lack of awareness and registration conditions for clinical trials we attempted to retrieve the registered trials during sars period from the first patient infected with sarscov in november 2002 to the complete end of the epidemic in july 2003 but failed therefore only incomplete statistics based on literatures for sarscov could be obtained a total of 54 literatures of drug studies were retrieved

 of which 83 were retrospectively analyzed with few prospective studies the selection of the study drugs was similar to that of 2019ncov with ribavirin lopinavir interferon and glucocorticoids as the main drugs vaccine studies were also launched however the followup data were not reportedcompared with that in the sars period the ability and consciousness of carrying out clinical trials in china during the period of 2019ncov were significantly improved meanwhile the quality of clinical trials and the level of evidence will provide important evidencebased data for the clinical diagnosis and treatment for 2019ncovthe experimental drugs included western medicine including antiviral drugs antimalarial drugs and biotherapy interferon stem cell therapy and immune regulation therapy etc and traditional chinese medicine and studies of glucocorticoids and plasma also accounted for small proportion figure 2 and table 1 the number of trials on traditional chinese medicine was much higher than that of the treatment of previous diseases which meant that western medicine still lacked effectiveness in antivirus therapy almost all drugs were old and most of them had already been brought to the market for other indications and some drugs were in phase ii clinical trials for infectious diseases caused by other virusesprospective multicentercontrolled studies for traditional chinese medicine like shuanghuanglian and lianhua qingwen have been conducted at the same time the trials combining traditional chinese and western medicine occupied a high proportion considering that 2019ncov might cause cytokine release syndrome crs patients in the studies of traditional chinese medicine could also receive western medicine which was a very important therapy for themantiviral drugs still drew the most attention

 including remdesivir asc09 lopinavirritonavir arbidol as well as the traditional biological agents such as interferonalpha and thymosin alpha1 at the same time three studies for glucocorticoids were launched and two of them recruited patients with severe pneumonia in addition the traditional antimalarial drugschloroquine and hydroxychloroquinewere also widely studiedit was encouraging that two important drugs registered clinical studies for ncp as more and more evidence showed that the mechanism of severe pneumonia may be associated with crs caused by virus infection tocilizumab which was the most effective way to inhibit crs in the chimeric antigen receptor tcell therapy has been the focus of recent academic discussion a multicenter rct for the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of ncp has been registered on 14 february 2020 simultaneously the wuhan jinyintan hospital registered a trial to explore the efficacy of pd1 inhibitor carrizumaba new drug for tumor treatmentfor severe ncp with lymphocytopenia and this was the first immune checkpoint inhibitor used in the study of ncp the results of the two studies were very worthy of attentionthe studies for the effects of plasma from recovered patients are ongoing which is promising besides vaccines are an effective way to prevent and reduce the harm of viruses
7
 and a number of pharmaceutical institutions around the world have started the research for 2019ncov messenger rna vaccine which could enter clinical phase as early as april 2020in general compared with that in sars period there are more options for the treatment of 2019ncov including more antiviral drugs such as remdesivir asc09 and arbidol although previous studies had shown that chloroquine could inhibit sarscov
8
 the conclusion remained at the cellular level study and have not entered the clinical stage besides tocilizumab and carrizumab mentioned above might provide patients with more opportunities for treatmentmost of the trials will continue over a period of about 1 year table 1 which means that the results of these studies are likely to be of limited help in the current epidemic with more value for prevention and treatment in the future however the epidemic situation is urgent and the number of patients is huge with a certain critically ill proportion therefore the availability of effective experimental drugs in the shortterm may be the most concerned according to the retrieved data more than 20 studies would be completed within 6 months and some important drugs like remdesivir asc09 lopinavir ritonavir chloroquine and glucocorticoids might be completed within 4 months the rct of remdesivir for severe ncp and the mild to moderate ncp carried out by chinajapan friendship hospital respectively were expected to be completed by the end of april or early may 2020 table 1if these trials could be completed on schedule or ahead of schedule with the endpoint achieved significant impact would be made on the control and prognosis of 2019ncov the first affiliated hospital of zhejiang university school of medicine carried out two openlabel multicenter rct to evaluate and compare the safety and efficiency of asc09ritonavir vs lopinavirritonavir and baloxavir marboxil vs favipiravir vs lopinavirritonavir for confirmed cases of ncp respectively table 1 and the studies were expected to be completed by 03 june 2020 and 31 may 2020 respectively although the epidemic may be coming to an end at that time the drugs could be approved for treatment in advance with the preliminary effective results of the interim research optimistic forecast by march 2020 at the same time researchers have also carried out the trials for traditional chinese medicine with a short study period which might also provide preliminary efficacy and safety data and provide important options for clinical treatmentbesides it has been reported that remdesivir chloroquine phosphate and farpiravir showed preliminary efficacy in clinical studies

 which is encouraging for medical staff and patients who are still in the critical stage of the epidemicthere were significant differences in the primary endpoint selected in the retrieved studies including improvement in clinical symptoms negative nucleic acid detection and survival with no clear conclusion for which one of them was the most appropriate the two major concerns of antiviral therapy are certainly one is prognosis of treatment for mild to moderate patients reducing critical illness rate is the primary objective and for severe or critical illness patients reducing mortality or improving recovery of pulmonary function matters more which are indicators of efficacy that can be evaluated in the near future the other is the rate and time for the virus to turn negative which is related to patients speed of recovery and prevention of the virus transmission therefore improvement of clinical symptoms is more important to reduce the incidence of severe illness and mortality and the detection of virus nucleic acid has a longer term significance for reducing transmission however there were several cases reported that patients with turning negative virus nucleic acid detection after treatment became positive again after a period of time therefore the frequency and time interval of detection after turning negative need to be further discussed if the frequency of detection is increased or the interval is prolonged combined with the improvement of clinical symptoms the disease progression could be more accurately estimated and whether the patient still carries the virus and is infectious could be further determinedin addition in a public health emergency the race against the epidemic forces us to consider an earlier effective endpoint of as a surrogate endpoint for mortality to accelerate the process of clinical trials for example two studies of remdesivir nct04252664 nct 04257656 used time to clinical recovery ttcr and time to clinical improvement ttci as primary endpoint respectively instead of virus nucleic acid detection or survival status of severe patients the former is based on the patients body temperature breathing rate oxygen saturation and the improvement of clinical symptoms the latter is based on the time for improvement of the clinical status and given the relatively low mortality rate of about 2 for ncp at present the choices of endpoint were based more on recommendations for influenza drug research in which mortality is not the primary endpoint in most studies besides ttcr or ttci as a surrogate endpoint required smaller sample sizes than the other dichotomous endpoints such as disease control rate and it should be emphasized that the choice should be dependent on the opinions and decisions of the clinical medicinebased on the analysis of the current situation of the epidemic in china effective quarantine measures have been carried out throughout the country however a large number of patients are in urgent need of treatment with a significant proportion of critically ill patients we support that improvement of clinical symptoms and prognosis of disease should be used as the most important indicators to evaluate the shortterm efficacy of experimental drugs and once supported by interim research data the drugs should be applied earlybesides the current severe illness rate is estimated to be about 15 it is unclear whether some of these patients will have longterm recovery problems such as impaired lung function or other organ dysfunction which should be paid attention to and the study should be initiated to confirmto carry out a large number of clinical trials so rapidly is also worrying due to the urgency the theoretical bases of some trials were needed to be discussed more comprehensively and the designs might not be reasonable enough whether these factors will increase the risk of the patients is also a matter which should be treated with caution in the researchcompared with the sars epidemic period 17 years ago china had a stronger ability to conduct new drug clinical trials independently in an emergency event however there is still no effective therapy for virus infection when expecting that these studies can provide effective treatment for ncp in china we need to carry out these trials carefully to ensure the safety of the patientsthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestscoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is a novel infectious disease that started in wuhan china in late december 2019 with the first human-to-human transmission reported in mid-january 202012 coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and has rapidly spread all across the world leading the world health organization to declare it a pandemic on march 11 20201 as of april 22 2020 more than 25 million cases of sars-cov-2 have been confirmed worldwide with more than 175000 related deaths1 currently there are no approved treatments for covid-19 or vaccines against sars-cov-2 guidelines have focused on hand hygiene and social distancing and clinical management consisting of supportive and respiratory care treatment of secondary pulmonary infections and respiratory failure and management of other complications given the limited ability to contain the virus and the relatively high transmissibility and case fatality rates governmental institutions and pharmaceutical companies are racing to find therapeutics and vaccines that target this novel coronavirus1on april 14 2020 we conducted an online search at wwwclinicaltrialsgov using covid as the search term this yielded 588 studies with only four less than 1 specifically designed for pregnant women three registries two from italy and one from the united states designed to determine the clinical characteristics of covid-19 infection in pregnancy and a survey from turkey to evaluate physical activity and sleep of the 588 studies listed on the clincaltrialsgov website 376 64 were interventional 22 in the united states and 16 in china and involved agents such as remdesivir hydroxychloroquine azithromycin interleukin-6 inhibitors lopinavir ritonavir hyperimmune or convalescent plasma and others although none of these interventional trials were specifically designed for pregnant women the majority more than two thirds specifically added pregnancy as an exclusion criterion or required a negative pregnancy test for participants to be included examples of these include actt the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial sponsored by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases evaluating the safety and efficacy of remdesivir and the orchid trial outcomes related to covid-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine among in-patients with symptomatic disease sponsored by the national heart lung and blood institute evaluating hydroxychloroquine even a trial evaluating high doses of antiinflammatory and antioxidant dietary supplements such as eicosapentaenoic acid and gamma-linolenic acid has excluded pregnant women a singular bright example of inclusion is the crown coronation study aimed to repurpose chloroquine to health workers for coronavirus mitigation although this is not a pregnancy-specific trial the investigators specifically noted that pregnancy and breastfeeding are not exclusions for entry a similar pattern of exclusion of pregnant women from covid-19related trials was noted in other international registriesthis pattern of protection by exclusion of pregnant women from research even during pandemics and epidemics is not new or limited to emerging infections34 even during the ebola virus epidemic pregnant women were excluded from all therapeutic and vaccine-development trials this occurred even with ebola being a highly lethal virusthe vast majority of cases of ebola virus infection in pregnancy resulted in the death of the mother and child5 this automatic disqualification denies pregnant women the potential for benefit given to other patients since the 1950s and after the discovery of the association between exposure to certain drugs during gestation and birth defects pregnant and breastfeeding women have been systematically excluded from drug-development and clinical trials despite several policy and legislative changes including the national institutes of health revitalization act of 1993 the us food and drug administrations guidelines for the study and evaluation of gender differences in the clinical evaluation of drugs the national institutes of healths guidance for the inclusion of women in clinical trials the establishment of the office on womens health and the establishment of the task force for research specific to pregnant and lactating women pregnant women remain therapeutic orphans with the vast majority of current accepted therapies for medical conditions never having been studied in pregnancy46results from studies that have excluded pregnant women cannot be automatically extrapolated to a pregnant population this lack of generalizability is due to the physiologic changes in pregnancy which affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs the lack of data specific to pregnancy will negatively affect the health of pregnant women and their access to interventions in the current and next outbreak especially with estimates from public health officials that indicate that this outbreak may last for a significant duration of time until an effective vaccine is identified and a massive vaccination campaign is implemented although it is not known how quickly a safe and effective vaccine may be readily available and approved by the us food and drug administration experts believe it will take at least 12-18 months2 pregnant women with covid-19 infection may be harmed because knowledge gained from ongoing research may not be generalizable to them this will create a knowledge gap concerning the safety and efficacy of any drugs or interventions that may emerge from current covid-19 research467 although fetal safety is the most cited reason for the exclusion from research studies of pregnant women and those who could become pregnant it is unethical to automatically preclude them from carefully designed clinical therapeutic research studies for example several trials are investigating the benefit of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin in patients with covid-19 infection however pregnant women are excluded despite the fact that these two medications have been used for decades in pregnancy for women with systemic lupus erythematosus or as malaria treatment and prophylaxis hydroxychloroquine and in women with community-acquired pneumonia and those with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes azithromycin moreover the drugs safety profiles are well established in pregnancypregnancy recently was removed as a classification for vulnerable population in the common rule but the research community has yet to catch up6 the perception that pregnant or breastfeeding women are a vulnerable population needing protection from exploitation research studies has hindered progression of care we need to advocate for a cultural shift within the research community to view this population as in need of more evidence particularly in pharmaceutical research47 pregnant women should be permitted to determine their eligibility and entry into a research study based on the principle of informed consent excluding pregnant women from research under the guise of the vulnerable populations perception places a restraint on their right to autonomy6 although one must consider the safety of a drug in pregnancy it is equally important to consider the risks of not treating or inadequately treating pregnant women similarly the risk to the fetus of treatment needs to be weighed against the risk of inadequate treatment given that many of the conditions that affect the mother will ultimately adversely affect the fetus if not treated it is crucial that the sequelae of lack of treatment be weighed against the risks of treatment or at a minimum inclusion in clinical trialsthe prevalence of pre-existing medical conditions or complications in pregnancy has progressively increased over the past three to four decades this is secondary to increased maternal age at the time of pregnancy and higher rates of obesity and chronic medical conditions such as diabetes hypertension and asthma during pregnancy these comorbidities have been well established as risk factors for mortality for patients with covid-19 infection8 while we face this life-threatening emerging pandemic it is significant that pregnant women are excluded from potentially beneficial interventions with researchers failing to consider the concepts of justice equity and autonomy therefore we urge the scientific community not to miss this opportunity and we recommend that without clear justification for exclusion pregnant women should be given the opportunity to be included in clinical trials for covid-19 rather than automatically excluding them investigators should consult with experts in obstetrics teratology and obstetric pharmacology this automatic exclusion is both misguided and not justifiable pregnant women are fully able to weigh the ethical implications of health decisions they make for themselves and their fetuses especially when provided with adequate counseling we also call on the concerned professional organizations such as the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists and the society for maternal-fetal medicine to endeavor to provide timely consultation as well as advocate for reversal of the decision to exclude pregnant women from the appropriate trialsduring the early weeks of december 2019 the first case of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus defined as covid-19 by the who was reported in wuhan the capital city of hubei province china 1 local daily-wage employees of the huanan seafood market in wuhan were believed to be the initial covid-19 carriers infecting a large proportion of the population of wuhan 2 3 since its emergence and as of may 20 2020 covid-19 had infected 84505 individuals across china at the time of writing may 2020 the usa spain russia uk italy brazil france turkey iran and india had recorded the highest population count of covid-19 cases ranging from 107819 to 1573728 wwwworldometersinfocoronavirus thus far 5018592 cases of covid-19 have been recorded worldwide with the total number of deaths reaching 325671 and the number of recovered patients 1980290 wwwworldometersinfocoronavirusalthough sars-cov-2-encoded proteins share similar homologous structures with sars-cov the spike s ectodomain of the covid-19 virus shows a higher binding affinity 15 nm for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor protein of the upper bronchial system which is 1020-fold higher compared with sars-cov thus this facilitated the unprecedented transmission of covid-19 among humans 4 the sars-cov-2 strain can spread through all modes of physical contact including sneezing and coughing 5a higher level of covid-19 cases 87 has been recorded among the adult and older population groups 3079 years of age 6 contradictorily a moderate 3 and a small 1 number of cases have been recorded in the older population group 80 years old and the younger population group 1019 years 6 concomitantly people with prior respiratory ailments and metabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes mellitus hypertension cardiovascular complications and cancer are highly susceptible to covid-19 infection with increased mortality 6 7 consistent with earlier clinical evidence that sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov affected males more than females 8 the prevalence of covid-19 has been recorded in the male population at a higher rate compared with that of the female population 3 it might be that estrogen receptor activation and its associated signaling cascades in females confer increased protection against infection with covid-19 similar to the results of clinical-based research studies with sars-cov and mers-cov 9moreover some patients with sars-cov-2 have become infected with virus from asymptomatic carriers who do not show any obvious clinical symptoms such as flu tiredness fever and dry cough but are able to pass-on covid-19 to healthy individuals either by direct or indirect physical contact through nasal droplets and sneezing 10 in addition to this major barrier to the control of covid-19 spread it is difficult to control the spread of disease from recovered patients to healthy individuals 11 12 in this review we focus on clinical trials involving drugs against covid-19 potential clinical therapeutic targets and the future directions of covid-19 managementduring the initial stages of the covid-19 outbreak from late december 2019 to early february 2020 during 40000 cases were confirmed and 850 people died across china patients in clinical trials were treated with drugs that were found to be generally ineffective at against the virus one such drug was oseltamivir selected because covid-19 symptoms include fever and other symptoms common to influenza infections 15 oseltamivir is a potent neuraminidase inhibitor that effectively attenuates the virulence of influenza viruses a and b but did show any noticeable effects against covid-19 because the virus does not secrete neuraminidase 16 moreover the treatment of patients with covid-19 with antibacterial drugs including moxifloxacin ceftriaxone and azithromycin either as a single drug or in combination showed little health benefit 17 in addition the long-term use of a higher dose of antibiotics during the covid-19 outbreak was found to be linked with the adverse clinical symptoms of severe respiratory ailments including hyperinflammation shock circulatory impairment and other organ damagecorticosteroids mimicking the natural corticosteroids of the human body have been commonly used to treat patients with defective adrenal glands who fail to synthesize sufficient levels of corticosteroids 18 however corticosteroids have also been widely prescribed at a higher dose in patients with immunological disorders inflammation andor an impaired saltwater balance 18 nevertheless there is no clear clinical evidence of the core therapeutic benefits of corticosteroids in treating respiratory symptoms of respiratory syncytial virus rsv common influenza viruses sars-cov and mers-cov 19 20 research was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids in low to mild doses for treating the adverse clinical symptoms induced by coronaviruses 21 concomitantly patients with covid-19 were treated with corticosteroids as a supplementary drug for a minimal duration of 315 days with no substantial improvement in symptoms 6 15 this shortened treatment time was because corticosteroid are well known for their long-term adverse effects and other secondary level complications 16 22thus this lack of success with the aforementioned drugs also contributed to the increased mortality among patients with covid-19 across china alongside impairments in the early diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 delayed action from healthcare professionals to break the virus transmission chain a poor understanding of covid-19 virulence and its transmission efficacy among the common population and inadequate clinical diagnostic kits and other essential medical facilities such as respiratory ventilators protective medical gowns and gloves to handle patients critically ill with covid-19 23to manage the emerging covid-19 outbreak and its associated mortality 300 clinical trials have been performed on patients with covid-19 in china 24 some of the clinical drugs used in these trials have shown promising results in reversing covid-19 clinical symptoms 25 table 1
to tackle the sars-cov epidemic lopinavir and ritonavir drug combinations us food and drug administration fda approved that inhibit viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease 33 supplemented with ribavirin effectively controlled sars-cov virulence and the associated mortality rate 34 such outcomes resulted in 14 clinical trials using lopinavir and ritonavir drug combinations to treat patients with covid-19 that lopinavir and ritonavir drug combinations effectively attenuated the adverse clinical symptoms such as fever of five patients with covid-19 demands further clinical validation 35 by contrast a recent clinical trial using these drug combinations failed to show any noticeable therapeutic effects on the adult patients with covid-19 over other patients who received standard medication 36 thus there is a need for a more in-depth clinical trial on these drug combinationsribavirin another fda-approved effective antiviral drug commonly used to treat hepatitis c virus and rsv has been widely referred to in combinations with effective antibiotics andor with or without hormonal treatment 16 as a potent inhibitor of the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp ribavirin effectively controlled covid-19 virulence when co-administered with ritonavirlopinavir drug combinations 27given that chloroquine derivatives exhibited a strong inhibitory action against sars-cov colonization 16 37 clinicians showed that chloroquine derivatives together with remdesivir effectively controlled the proliferation of a clinically isolated sars-cov-2 strain 28 a clinical trial using chloroquine phosphate to treat covid-19 virulence has since been approved by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china 38arbidol a potent antiviral drug targeting virus-associated inflammatory cytokines has been used to treat patients with covid-19 and severe pneumonia it has not shown any adverse effects and thus is under study in both china and russia 39 in addition both in vitro and in vivo studies have explored the additional therapeutic advantages of arbidol as a drug that exhibits a strong immune response by disrupting the viral capsid binding the host cell membrane 16 40 arbidol has been prioritized with the other potential clinical drugs discussed earlier for clinical trials to tackle the covid-19 outbreak supported by the sixth edition of guidelines for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia xxdipyridamole an antiplatelet and phosphodiesterase inhibitor drug that targets intracellular campcgmp levels including positive-stranded rna viruses has been suggested to be an effective antiviral drug 41 42 dipyridamole effectively inhibited the replication of sars-cov at a half-maximal effective concentration ec50 concentration of 100 nm in vitro
30 this clinical proficiency of dipyridamole emphasized its possible usage as an adjuvant to strengthen the immune system as well as to inhibit viral proliferation and hypercoagulation 30darunavir a potent retrovirus inhibitor together with cobicistat which controls cytochrome p4503a cyp3a activity resulting in the breakdown of antiviral agents has been used to treat patients with hiv 43 although darunavir is intended to inhibit viral proteinases 31 research is required to prove its clinical significance in reversing covid-19 virulenceanimal studies showed that remdesivir inhibited the virulence of sars-cov and mers-cov 32 in vitro research also confirmed that remdesivir treatment profoundly inhibited sars-cov-2 proliferation at an ec50 concentration 077176 m 28favipiravir which markedly inhibits influenza-dependent rna polymerase exhibits profound antiviral activity against many viruses including arenavirus bunyavirus and filovirus which result in fatal hemorrhagic fever 16 44 in addition to these viruses favipiravir treatment effectively inhibited the proliferation of sars-cov-2 in vero e6 culture cells with an ec50 value of 62 m 32 based on this positive outcome the ministry of science and technology china recently recommended favipiravir for covid-19 management in a larger group of patients 45other potential drugs of high therapeutic value include baloxavir and marboxil which target the viral cap-dependent endonuclease although this is absent in sars-cov-2 32 tmc310911 targets viral protease activity 46 emtricitabinetenofovir alafenamide and azvudine target the viral reverse transcriptase and have been tested on patients with covid-19 47 48 although these clinical drugs showed promising therapeutic effects against covid-19 virulence there is still a need for an in-depth clinical trial to confirm their efficacy in a larger group of patients with covid-19the pharmacokinetics pk of all emerging covid-19 drugs such as absorption distribution metabolism and excretion including the druggable effect on the host body pharmacodynamics pd can be studied using pkpd modeling 49 a pkpd drug model would reveal the correlation between drug exposure and its associated pd effect in silico
49 of the empirical and mechanistic models of pkpd available empirical models that comprise direct-link spline-function logistic-regression and circadian models could be used to study disease progression in patients with covid-19 with or without drug exposure in silico
49 mechanistic model studies which primarily rely on data from clinical biomarkers in the context of covid-19 virulence in the presence or absence of a drug would confer a brief clinical understanding of the druggable effect against covid-19 in humans and other species as well as the determined drug dosage for covid-19 management 49 pkpd analyses are conducted at three various levels level 1 reveals the direct correlation between the drug exposure and its relevant response using a plot graph with the measured unbound plasma drug concentration plotted against the relevant pd response in vivo this generates the effective drug dosage concentration based on the ratio of mean unbound plasma drug concentrationhalf-maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 level 2 generates the pd response turnover rate k
out in response to the noticeable changes in the drug and biological system level 3 with the supportive pre-established models unravels the pharmacological response to the drug at various dosages among the patients involved in the experimental study the correlation of biomarkers with the generated pkpd models would also provide a mechanistic understanding of the mechanism of action of the drugs to enable translational research and intersubject drug evaluation on a wider scale 49convalescent plasma therapy using clinically procured blood plasma samples of patients with a particular virus has been adopted to treat patients with sars-cov-2 50 it has been proposed that convalescent blood plasma cbp infusion into such patients would effectively attenuate the pathogenicity of the virus with its eventual removal from the patients blood although the methodology of cbp transfusion has certain constraints for clinical trials clinical treatment using the cbp of patients with covid-19 has been considered to be both promising and effective for treating patients critically ill with covid-19 to test cbp transfusion on a large scale certain clinical factors must be taken into consideration such as the transmission of intermittent pathogens between the donor and the recipient and the precise recruitment of donors with sufficient immunoglobulin titers to produce noticeable effects against the pathogenicity of that particular pathogen in the patients 51bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells mscs have been used to treat patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards with no adverse effects recorded during the relevant trial 52 to date there are 13 clinical trials in progress to manage sars-cov-2 using mscs with promising initial clinical results in seven patients with covid-19 who showed a remarkable improvement in their clinical condition within 14 days of treatment without any noticeable adverse effectsinterferon-alpha ifn- a potent immune cytokine released during pathogen infection improved pulmonary function when coupled with other antiviral agents such as lopinavir ritonavir and remdesivir in patients with mers-cov 53 the therapeutic combination of ribavirin and ifn- was acknowledged in the sixth edition of guidelines for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia xxpatients with covid-19 and other severe health conditions have shown increased circulatory levels of proinflammatory cytokines especially interleukin 6 il-6 which might be responsible for adverse clinical symptoms such as septic shock organ tissue damage associated with heart liver and kidney and respiratory dysfunction 54 in one ongoing clinical trial chictr2000029765 clinicians are targeting the increased levels of il-6 using the il-6-specific monoclonal antibody tocilizumab to treat patients critically ill with covid-19 clinical results from 21 chinese patients with covid-19 showed a reduced body fever after treatment improved their respiratory function 55 these results suggested targeting additional circulatory proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1 and il-17 using cytokine-specific neutralizing antibodies 55 following successful results from these clinical trials it would be possible to adopt a proficient biological strategy to treat covid-19 virulence in immunocompromised patients a monoclonal antibody labeled cr3022 raised against the receptor-binding domain of the s membrane glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 could benefit patients by disrupting its colonization in the upper respiratory system 56 also monoclonal antibodies generated specifically against the functional proteins of sars-cov-2 andor its potential agonist ace2 which controls viral entry would significantly benefit patients in terms of a quick recovery and a restricted transmission rateto tackle the covid-19 outbreak within a short timeframe treatment using drug repurposing against the virus- and host-based targets could resolve similar clinical issues in the future in the long term the development of novel-multifaceted-pan-cov antiviral drugs against coronaviruses might result in an efficacious treatment for sars-cov-2 a profound activation of the bitter taste receptors taste 2 receptor member 4 t2r4 taste 2 receptor member 38 t2r38 taste 2 receptor member 43 t2r43 and taste 2 receptor member 46 t2r46 using bitter taste compounds including nicotine as agonists could attenuate covid-19 virulence with increased intracellular calcium-dependent nitric oxide no production accompanied by reduced secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines in the upper respiratory system 57 58 59 this increased no production further strengthens the ciliary beat frequency with the resulting mucociliary clearance of the invading pathogens 57 the idea of triggering the innate immune response by the activation of bitter taste receptors and reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines by the stimulation of ace2 and neuronal acetylcholine receptors using nicotine will be validated in patients with covid-19 in the near futureall of proposed therapeutic strategies discussed herein including the on-going clinical trials of covid-19 management have to overcome substantial obstacles such as the possibility of spontaneous mutation of sars-cov-2 restricted animal models for preclinical studies a lack of patients for clinical study the high maintenance costs of experimental set-ups and retention of the sustainability of clinical-based therapeutic study outcomes in addition all the basic criteria of each clinical trial must be well studied and abide by the proper clinical guidelines regardless of study type only with such concerted research efforts is the research community likely to be successful in its search for a therapeutic with proven effects against covid-19none declaredcoronaviruses belonging to the family coronaviridae are positive-sense enveloped rna viruses that cause infections in humans weiss and leibowitz 2011 lim et al 2016 the family includes four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus deltacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus the genus betacoronavirus includes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov historically these coronaviruses had got great clinical importance in infecting humans kuiken et al 2003 at present the novel coronavirus strain the sars-cov-2 the causative agent of covid-19 emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 zhu et al 2020 since then the number of cases and deaths related to this virus have been skyrocketing throughout the worldas per the world health organization who report the total number of cases and deaths outside china has overtaken the total number of cases in china who 2020 who has declared covid-19 worldwide pandemic and global public health emergency with europe and lately unites states of america became new epicenters who has recommended several preventive measures including laboratory tests for any suspected cases quarantining suspects applying physical distancing frequent hand washing and using hand and surface sanitizers to help contain further spread of the pandemic who 2020 despite such preventive strategies there is no vaccine or drug therapy officially approved for prophylaxis or treatment of covid-19 at present there are several classes of drugs undergoing clinical trials including rna polymerase inhibitors remdesivir and favipiravir protease inhibitors lopinavirritonavir aminoquinolines chloroquine and its hydroxyl derivative anti-inflammatory agents corticosteroids and xiyanping injection angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 blockers convalescent plasma viral rna antisense technologies monoclonal antibodies and chinese traditional medicines httpwwwchictrorgcnindexaspx and httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2homeamong the above-mentioned classes of antiviral counterparts aminoquinolines chloroquine and its hydroxyl derivative and protease inhibitors primarily lopinavirritonavir have taken the largest share of clinical trials since the sars-cov-2 outbreak however their clinical benefit has become full of controversies according to the various research findingswith regard to the aminoquinolines and their role in covid-19 therapy in an open-label non-randomized clinical trial gautret et al reported 100 viral clearance in nasopharyngeal swabs with combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin 571 in hydroxychloroquine group and 125 in standard of care group in cohort of 6 patients after 5 to 6 days follow-up gautret et al 2020 in addition in study conducted in 62 patients in china the use of hydroxychloroquine could significantly shorten the time to clinical recovery and promote the absorption of pneumonia in randomized open label clinical trial chen z et al 2020 in contrary to this a recent study from china in individuals with covid-19 found no difference in the rate of virologic clearance at 7 days with or without 5 days of hydroxychloroquine and no difference in clinical outcomes chen j et al 2020 indicating the absence of evidence of a strong antiviral activity rapid viral clearance or clinical benefit of this combination for severe covid-19 patients another randomized open label clinical trial posted on medrxiv preprint reported that the overall 28-day negative conversion rate and symptoms alleviation rate in hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care group was not different from standard of care group tang et al 2020 apart from this the safety issues of aminoquinolines should also be emphasized the cardiovascular and retinal toxicities may also limit the usefulness of these agents if there is hope from ongoing randomized blinded and placebo controlled trials for example the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have shown to prolong qt-interval resulting torsades de pointes a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death chorin et al 2020a randomized open label clinical trial conducted on protease inhibitors lopinavirritonavir indicated that treatment with lopinavirritonavir did not show statistically significant difference in the time to clinical improvement and mortality censored at day 28 though a secondary outcomes measures were found promising in lopinavirritonavir group cao et al 2020 this trial was initiated in severe covid-19 patients lately and lacks blinding and well established placeboremdesivir is one of the frontline medications being used as expanded access and is under extensive clinical investigation hereafter this review aims to address the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir as a potential therapeutic option for covid-19remdesivir gs-5734 is a phosphoramidate prodrug of a pyrrolo21-ftriazin-4-amino adenine c-nucleoside having broad spectrum antiviral activity figure 1 remdesivir is metabolized into its active form gs-441524 that interferes with viral rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp enzyme thereby it evades proofreading by viral exonuclease and arrests rna synthesis this drug has shown potent inhibitory activity against rdrp with intact proof reading and with low level of resistance to target mutations agostini et al 2018 it is supported in the study conducted by gordon et al who demonstrated rdrp is indeed the target of remdesivir in mers-cov strains gordon et al 2020 studies based on the molecular dynamics simulation and free energy perturbation methods clearly indicated sars-cov-2 rdrp as a target of remdesivir zhang and zhou 2020 though it has not been officially approved for ebola and coronaviruses yet siegel et al 2017 gilead sciences is working closely with organizations and health authorities to respond to the covid-19 outbreak through synthesizing and providing this investigational drug gilead sciences 2020aagostini et al demonstrated that remdesivir can potently inhibit coronaviruses such as sars-cov-1 and mers-cov in vitro agostini et al 2018 remdesivir can inhibit sars-cov-1 and mers-cov replication in several in vitro systems including primary human airway epithelial cell cultures sheahan et al 2017 in research conducted by sheahan et al remdesivir showed superior antiviral activity to lopinavirritonavir against mers-cov in vitro sheahan et al 2020 in mers-cov nonstructural proteins nsp5 nsp7 nsp8 and nsp12 of insect cell lines remdesivir showed potent inhibitory activity against nsp12rdrp in vitro gordon et al 2020 yethindra et al demonstrated that remdesivir showed strong inhibition against sars-cov and mers-cov in human air way epithelial cells at early stages in replication process via inhibiting viral rna synthesis yethindra 2020 on the top of these remdesivir has shown promising results in clinical control of sars-cov-2 pneumonia in-vitro in human liver cancer cell lines wang m et al 2020 beyond beta-covs remdesivir has shown potent inhibition of human endemic and zoonotic delta-covs with highly divergent rdrp in human hematoma huh7 cell lines brown et al 2019in a mouse model of sars-cov-1 prophylactic and therapeutic at early stage administration of remdesivir significantly reduced pulmonary viral load and improved respiratory function and other clinical signs of the disease sheahan et al 2017 likewise both prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir has shown improvement on the pulmonary function and reduced lung viral loads and severe lung pathology in mers-cov strains in mice model sheahan et al 2020 in the rhesus macaque model of mers-cov infection remdesivir reduced virus replication the severity of the disease and lung damage when administered in animals infected with mers-cov de wit et al 2020 despite having an in-vitro antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 there are no published studies justifying the activity of remdesivir in animal models of sars-cov-2 in vivo until the time of this reviewaccording to the paper published at the new england journal of medicine on 05 march 2020 it had been suggested that remdesivir might be a potential therapeutic option for the therapy of covid-19 patients in the report remdisivir intravenous infusion compassionate use was started on day 7 in covid-19 patient during the treatemnt no adverse events were observed in association with the iv infusion the patients clinical condition improved the bilateral lower-lobe rales apeared initially were no longer present his appetite improved became afebrile and asymptomatic except intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea holshue et al 2020 however this is a single patient report and is too infant to conclude its efficacy and disentangle the true effect size of this drug because of the chance of recovery from this disease without treatments hence it is imperative to have adequate well controlled randomized and blinded clinical trials in large cohorts of patients to justify its clinical utility in real settingsas summarized in table 1 gilead sciences has initiated two phase 3 randomized open label clinical trials comprising approximately 1000 covid-19 patients in the first trial 400 patients with severe covid-19 cases were enrolled to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir on 5 arm 1 and 10 days arm 2 regimens with standard of care in both arms without comparator gilead-sciences 2020b in the second trial 600 patients with moderate covid-19 cases were enrolled to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the same dosage regimen of remdesivir in addition to the standard of care and with standrad of care alone as active comparator gilead-sciences 2020cwith the coordination of china-japan friendship hospital two phase 3 randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trials were intiated in china to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir paralleled to palcebo therapythe first phase 3 trial has already involved 308 hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate cases of covid-19 cao 2020a the patients were randomized to intervention arms of either remdesivir 10 days regimen or placebo that matched to remdesivir the primary end point of this trial is set to determine the time to clinical recovery ttcr within 28 days another phase 3 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of 10 days of remdesivir regimen in 453 hospitalized adult patients with severe covid-19 compared to placebo matched to remdesivir in dose and duration the primary outcome measure in this trial is the time to clinical improvement ttci censored at day 28 cao 2020b table 1 at the time of this revision the finding of the second trial was published on lancet though not statistically significant patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less hazard ratio 152 095243 in addition remdesivir did not show statistically significant clinical benefits wang y et al 2020 however the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in the larger cohort of patients and in the remaining trialswith the coordination of the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid another phase 3 adaptive randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trial enrolled 394 hospitalized patients with covid-19 to assess the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in this trial patients were randomized to either placebo or 10 days therapy with remdesivir 200 mg remdesivir iv loading dose for day 1 followed by 100 mg iv daily maintained for 9 days total of 10 days therapy the primary indicator in this trial is the percentage of patients reporting each severity rating on the 7-point ordinal scale within 15 days niaid 2020 table 1with the sponsor and coordination of us army medical research and development command amrdc remdesivir is also provided as expanded access compassionate use us-amrdc 2020 through emergency investigational new drug applications the term expanded access compassionate use is a potential pathway in which a patient with an immediately life-threatening condition or disease gain access to an investigational medical product for treatment of patients outside of clinical trials when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options are available fda 2020 to this end remdesivir synthesized and developed by gilead sciences is readily available for compassionate use for covid-19 patients coppock 2020 table 1 latest observational study published on the new england journal of medicine revealed that severe covid-19 patients treated with compassionate-use of remdesivir showed clinical improvement in 68 cases grein et al 2020on the top of this who has initiated solidarity trial at global level to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in one of the interventional arms branswell 2020 likewise national institute of health and medical research inserm of france has planned to initiate discovery trial inserm 2020 the trial protocol has already been registered on 20 march 2020 and available at httpsclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04315948 the recruiting of participants has not been started but estimated to enroll 3200 patients in 4 arms in which remdesivir alone is to be provided in usual dosage regimen in one of the interventional armsdespite the promising effects of remdesivir against previous beta-coronaviruses as well as the current novel coronaviruses in vitro there is no published in vivo study that substantiates the in vitro activities against this global public health threat a case report and observational studies are not sufficient to generate evidenced-based medicine on the clinical use of remdesivir for this pandemic a double blind placebo controlled randomized clinical trial showed that remdesivir did not have statistically significant clinical benefit in reducing the time to clinical improvement in severe covid-19 patients compared to placebo though remdesivir is readily available for compassionate use in many countries it is imperative to wait the remaining ongoing clinical trials to justify its clinical utility on larger cohort of covid-19 patientsthe author confirms being the sole contributor of this work and has approved it for publicationthe author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestnovel 2019 coronavirus disease covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 after the identification of 118 000 cases in 114 countries

 an early report from a singlecenter case series of 138 hospitalized patients for covid19 in wuhan china in january 2020 found that 29 40138 were healthcare workers that had been infected in hospital

 as of february 11 2020 chinas infectious disease information system has reported covid19 in 1716 healthcare workers

although the transmission of covid19 is not yet fully understood it is believed to be mainly through large respiratory droplets
5
 for aerosolgenerating procedures such as intubation or bronchoscopy there is consensus that n95 respirators offer better protection than medical masks

9
 n95 respirators are designed to minimize facial seal leakage because of tight fit and prevent inhalation of small airborne particles they also are required to pass filtration tests in contrast medical masks also known as surgical masks are loose fitting provide barrier protection against large droplets and prevent handtoface contact
10

globally current recommendations to protect healthcare workers against covid19 for nonaerosolgenerating care are conflicting
6
 
7
 
8
 
9
 for example the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc and european centre for disease and prevention ecdc recommend the n95 respirator for nonaerosolgenerating routine care of patients with covid19

 while the world health organization and the public health agency of canada recommend medical masks

shortages of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers including medical masks and n95 respirators have been widely reported in this pandemic
11
 a shortage of n95 respirators for aerosolgenerating procedures where the risk to healthcare workers is high is of particular concern this along with conflicting recommendations warrants an update of previous systematic reviews where the last search was conducted in 2015
12
 
13
 evidence to support similar relative effectiveness of medical masks compared with n95 respirators might help preserve stockpiles of n95 respirators for aerosolgenerating procedures on the other hand if n95 respirators are clearly more effective then their use for nonaerosolgenerating procedures should be universally recommended we conducted an updated systematic review and metaanalysis to help answer this questionwe adapted search strategies published by smith et al by removing terms related to surrogate exposure studies ie simulations and experiments involving manikins and applying databasespecific randomized controlled trial rct filters appendix s2ac

20
 the certainty we can have in our evidence ranges from very low low and moderate to high it depends on risk of bias inconsistency indirectness imprecision and other considerations like publication bias the cochrane risk of bias tool and grade were applied at the outcome level consensus was reached through discussion among the review pair or with consultation of a third reviewer when necessarypooled odds ratios ors and corresponding 95 confidence intervals cis comparing medical masks to n95 respirators on dichotomous outcomes were calculated in r project for statistical computing version 363 the metafor package was used applying the inverse variance method and assuming a random effects model due to expected heterogeneity between studies

using the cochrane risk of bias tool randomized trials were judged to have low risk of selection attrition and reporting biases risk of performance bias was high across all trials and outcomes due to lack of blinding of participant healthcare workers risk of detection bias was high for influenzalike and clinical respiratory illness due to lack of laboratory confirmation but low for laboratoryconfirmed viral respiratory and influenza infection appendix s4 in applying grade the certainty of the overall evidence was judged to be low for laboratoryconfirmed respiratory infection and laboratoryconfirmed influenza infection and very low for influenzalike illness and clinical respiratory illness largely due to indirectness and imprecision table 2there is no convincing evidence that medical masks are inferior to n95 respirators for protecting healthcare workers against laboratoryconfirmed viral respiratory infections during routine care and nonaerosolgenerating procedures medical masks also performed similarly to n95 respirators in preventing laboratoryconfirmed influenza infection for influenzalike illnesses and clinical respiratory illnesses the point estimates favored n95 respirators however the confidence intervals were wide and there was considerable heterogeneity for the clinical respiratory illness outcome p  01 i
2  78 this heterogeneity may have been due to the subjective nature of the criteria used to define this outcome between trials appendix s3 reduced protection with medical masks during routine care of covid19 patients cannot be ruled out our low certainty in available evidence is because of its indirectness when we searched for randomized trials comparing the protective effect of medical masks to n95 respirators against coronaviruses we did not identify any for novel sarscov2 causing covid19our findings support preliminary epidemiological data from a casereport of respiratory protective devices for covid19
26
 fortyone healthcare workers were exposed to aerosolgenerating procedures from a patient with severe pneumonia who later tested positive for sarscov2 during covid19 surveillance these procedures included endotracheal intubation extubation noninvasive ventilation and exposure to aerosols in an open circuit all of the exposed healthcare workers tested negative 14 days after their date of exposure despite 85 3541 having worn surgical masks during the highrisk procedures
26
 given the limited direct evidence from this casereport further research on the risk of secondary infection in healthcare workers caring for covid19 patients is warrantedthere are several limitations in this metaanalysis first only one trial individually studied cases of coronavirus infection between medical masks and n95 respirators therefore we were unable to metaanalyze coronavirus infection specifically this led us to downgrade the evidence with grade as it relates to indirectness because our findings may not be generalizable to sarscov2 all trials however did report a composite outcome of laboratoryconfirmed viral respiratory infections that included coronavirus infections second this is a metaanalysis of aggregate data rather than individual data the latter would allow for harmonization of confounding covariates and outcome definitions specific to coronavirus infection the definition of influenzalike illness was based on a predetermined set of signs and symptoms however swabs in these studies were likely obtained using a more lenient threshold therefore there would have been swabs obtained even when the influenzalike illness criteria were not met this likely resulted in fewer influenzalike illness events compared with laboratoryconfirmed influenza infections reassuringly outcome definitions excluding clinical respiratory illness were consistent among all four studiesa strength of this review is that it is uptodate and incorporates the largest randomized trial of medical masks vs n95 respirators that have been completed to date
18
 secondly we used appropriate metaanalytic techniques that accounted for cluster randomization that was present in three of the four included trials
16
 
17
 
18
 cluster randomization was not adjusted for in the most recent metaanalysis potentially leading to falsely narrower confidence intervals around point estimates of protection
13
 
27

for aerosolgenerating procedures n95 respirators are unanimously recommended by national and international guidelines however there is inconsistency in recommendations for routine care and nonaerosolgenerating procedures of covid19 patients

 our evidence is in keeping with current who and public health agency of canada recommendations to use medical masks for nonaerosolgenerating procedures when caring for covid19 patients in contrast the cdc and ecdc recommend use of n95 respirators for nonaerosolgenerating procedures over the less expensive and more readily available medical maskswith the widespread of sarscov2 a serious concern is that stockpiles of n95 respirators will be depleted the department of health and human services announced that its strategic national stockpilethe emergency stockpile of drugs and medical supplies in the united statescontained approximately 30 million medical masks and 12 million n95 respirators this stockpile of respiratory protective devices equates to 1 of the estimated amount needed for us hcws in a pandemic scenario 42 million stockpiled compared with the estimated 35 billion needed
28
 based on the evidence preservation of n95 respirators for highrisk aerosolgenerating procedures in this pandemic should be considered when in short supply the uncertainty of this evidence and the depleting stockpiles of respiratory protective devices emphasize the need for further comparative research of medical masks and n95 respirators

which could be altering virulence becerra-flores and cardozo 2020 besides the four structural proteins of sars-cov-2 mentioned above s e m n and the critical rtc there are several additional open-reading frames orfs encoding nonstructural proteins and a viral protease within the sars-cov-2 genome some with clear functions deduced from prior study with sars-cov-1 but others with unknown

antigenserological antibody tests seeking approval or already with eua for this important area ghaffari et al 2020vaccines are one of the monumental achievements in human medical intervention to mitigate the dispersion and impact of infectious disease polio was a serious crippling disorder for decades until the development of two separate vaccine candidates by jonas salk and albert sabin melnick 1996 from the time of the first polio outbreak in the united states to testing and development was almost 60 years4 figure 2 more recently a vaccine for the lethal infectious hemorrhagic fever elicited by ebola disease took on a substantially different timeline with development by a canadian team jones et al 2005 preceding the worst outbreak in western africa in 2014 with the disease first described in isolated cases in 1976 taking into account the prolonged development and testing phases it still took at least 15 years figure 2 for authorized clinical use of an ebola vaccine5 looking at the other coronavirus disease-causing outbreaks sars and mers that led to regional epidemics in various countries the impetus was strong initially to develop vaccines but fizzled out with their spontaneous resolution although vaccine candidates were brought forward for both sars-cov-1 and mers and projects continue there are still no approved vaccines for either infectious agent 17 and 6 years respectively de wit et al 2016 song et al 2019 since the original outbreaks figure 2 in view of this the bar is set high for developing an effective vaccine targeting covid-19 will sars-cov-2 go the same direction as the other coronaviruses or will it become a seasonal outbreak like influenza and persist as a moderately benign to severe nuisance-causing infectious disorder that lasts for yearsgiven the worldwide magnitude of the covid-19 pandemic and comparisons to the great spanish flu of 1918 the race for a vaccine candidate has taken on unprecedented urgency and commitment across the globe established organizations are maintaining databases of vaccines under development including the world health organization6 who the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations7 cepi the milken institute8 a nonprofit think-tank out of california and biocentury inc9 a partner to the biopharmaceutical industry unparalleled data sharing and collaborative team efforts are breaking down barriers in an attempt to reduce the time from the usual 10 years for an approved vaccine down to 1218 months cepi the biomedical advanced research and development authority10 barda gavi the vaccine alliance11 formerly global alliance for vaccines and immunization various governments and other sources are either pouring money into the efforts to fund projects or providing logistical support with additional initiatives one such initiative is the strategic alliance activ12 accelerating covid-19 therapeutic interventions and vaccines a public-private initiative bringing together more than a dozen leading biopharmaceutical companies the cdc centers for disease control and prevention fda us food and drug administration and ema european medicines agency to develop an international strategy for a coordinated research response to the covid-19 pandemic another massive undertaking to expedite the process is operation warp speed13 which includes scientists pharmaceutical companies and us federal officials and is being compared to the manhattan project14what does the ideal vaccine look like for covid-19 prevention in clinical terms three main factors are essential i a robust immune response generating long-lasting neutralizing antibodies to sars-cov-2 antigens eg s andor n is imperative figures 1 and 3 when individuals are infected with foreign antigens on viruses they evoke both innate and adaptive immune reactions with a coordinated antigen-presenting cell apc attack on the virus and t-helper cell activation that leads to b-lymphocytes producing antibodies in this context ideally the antibodies will directly interfere with sars-cov-2s knack for latching onto epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes via ace2 figure 1 in order to neutralize the virus this would curtail successfully the virus from infecting the host and be protective if an infection resulted however there remains critical shortfalls in the current knowledge of what comprises a protective immune response against covid-19 and how long it lasts as of may 2020 ii the ideal sars-cov-2 vaccine will also induce potent t-lymphocyte immunity ideally this would be a well-coordinated orchestrated t-cell response that includes t-helper and cytotoxic t-lymphocyte subsets that recognize sars-cov-2 infected cells in the body and annihilate them to block viral replication along with acquisition of memory t-cells to prevent reinfection months to years later iii the candidate vaccine should limit any serious adverse events saes at the injection site or systemically for example fever in infants and young children in the case of respiratory disorders caused by infectious agents it is essential that vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease vaerd antibody-dependent enhancement ade antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity adcc complement-dependent cytotoxicity including cytokine storm-inducing effects are completely avoided graham 2020 hotez et al 2020 vardhana and wolchok 2020 some of these clinical sequelae have been associated with past vaccines in development figure 3 with a prominent example that for respiratory syncytial virus rsv during the late 1960s graham 2020 since the virus apparently activates complement deposition in small blood vessels of some infected individuals magro et al 2020 blocking adverse host responses is essential complement inflammation and coagulation systems are intertwined oikonomopoulou et al 2012 and hyperactive in covid-19 positive cases and the vaccine should not provoke these host response systemsin logistical terms there are a few essential parameters for the ideal candidate vaccine for covid-19 i the vaccine should be easy to administer and preferably in a single dose at the lowest possible amount an oral or intranasal vaccine would be ideal ii the vaccine should be facile to produce and scale-up manufacturing millions to billions of doses required to immunize the human population must be feasible and rapid iii long-term storage of the vaccine at room temperature should be a sought after goal to facilitate transport and stockpiling in underdeveloped nations with inadequate supply chains and cold chain capacities figure 3 the ideal vaccine targeting covid-19 would fit into a proposed target product profile as described in table 1the normal strides taken to achieve successful vaccine development are similar to those for any drug the process should be very stringent seeing that it will culminate in administration of the vaccine candidate to billions of humans the typical paradigm is depicted in figure 3 and is explained in the legendthe scientific publications to date ahn et al 2020 amanat and krammer 2020 caddy 2020 callaway 2020a callaway 2020b cohen 2020 chen wh et al 2020 kim et al 2020 lurie et al 2020 thanh le et al 2020 wang f et al 2020 wu 2020 as well as databases mentioned above have various formats for classifying vaccine platforms in our analysis we consider seven main platforms of vaccine development along with an eighth catch-all other category figure 4 there are two nucleic acid platforms dna 12 candidates and rna 20 candidates which could be sub-divided further according to particular traits related to delivery and carriers eg electroporation with special devices intradermally vs oral formulation or lnps vs exosomes but for simplicity are considered only as two categories these nucleic acid platforms belong to the new generation of vaccines neither has reached licensing for human use but a number are being tested in humans cohen 2020 a third category termed protein-based also referred to as subunit vaccine includes a broad range of technologies to prepare immune-stimulating viral protein antigens and represents the largest category of all current covid-19 vaccine candidates currently 44 in development like nucleic acids protein-based vaccines represent a newer technology but some are already in use in the clinical realm eg gardasil for human papillomavirus the fourth and fifth categories are viral-based vectors similar to those used in gene therapy and include nonreplicating 16 candidates and replicating 14 candidates vectors the next two are the sars-cov-2 viruses themselves either inactivated usually with a chemical such as -propriolactone which chemically inactivates enveloped viruses and can inhibit viral membrane fusion in a dose-dependent mannergao et al 2020 or in a live-attenuated version generated by techniques such as codon deoptimization or serial passaging in cell culture mueller et al 2020 the other category includes virus-like particles vlps the use of nonsars-cov-2 virus carriers such as killed rabies coravax and live modified horsepox tx-1800 there are 10 in this category repurposed existing vaccines for polio or tuberculosis to evoke general immunity various cellular immunotherapies to stimulate the host immune system encapsulated convalescent serum and unknown platform designation listed in the milken institute database are excluded from our analyses figure 4 according to these criteria there are over 125 sars-cov-2 vaccines in development which is astounding from all across the globe in such a short time-framefor the ideal covid-19 vaccine to reach routine use in humans it is imperative that the vaccine protects against both clinical disease and viral transmission in order to break the chain of person-to-person pandemic spread some of the advantagesdisadvantages of each platform are considered in table 2in this section we provide some specific details on 16 of 125 vaccines in the pipeline that are registered for clinical trials or already being tested as of may 25 2020 in addition to those that are currently cepi- andor barda-sponsored from each platform that are or not yet in clinical trials this is to provide a snapshot of the field in early endeavors to procure a functional sars-cov-2 vaccine in man and their proposed developmental

levels reaching or exceeding neutralizing antibody titers generally seen in convalescent sera as measured by a plaque reduction neutralization assay against live sars-cov-2 mrna-1273 was generally safe and well tolerated and provided full protection against viral replication in the lungs in a mouse challenge model in view of these data the company is forging on with phase ii and iii studies with an anticipated dose for phase iii using between 25 g and 100 g rna since the level of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 is generally quite variable and in some cases undetectable in people who have recovered from covid-19 without hospitalization wu et al 2020b it remains to be seen how effective the moderna vaccine candidate will be at providing long-term immunity this should come into focus in the upcoming large clinical trialsin this preclinical trial van doremalen et al 2020 nhps rhesus macaques were administered a very high dose of sars-cov-2 after receiving a single dose of the vaccine very similar to regimen being used in the current clinical trials the active treatment group of animals n6 produced elevated levels of sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies compared to no increase in the control group n3 there were indistinguishable amounts of virus in the nasal compartment compared to control animals but significantly reduced viral load in the lungs the vaccinated nhps were free of clinical-grade pneumonia in contrast to the controls although the levels of antibodies and cell-mediated cytokine responses in the vaccinated nhps were substantial nobody

coming months-years never before in the modern era of science has the accumulation of scientific papers in preprint archives biorxivmedrxiv 5000 preprints and peer-reviewed publications pubmed 22000 papers reached such exponential heights in such a short period with thousands of all-things-considered covid topics mobilization of data sharing and joint global efforts toward this vaccine goal are monumental it is hoped that the collaborative framework such as activ and others around the world for prioritizing vaccine and drug candidates streamlining clinical trials coordinating regulatory processes andor leveraging assets among various partners to rapidly respond to the covid-19 and future pandemics will soon be a reality however a successful path forward will be challenging and is certainly not guaranteed for instance no efficacious and approved vaccine for hivaids has come forward in over 30 years the main hiv surface protein for host cell entry is covered in sugars as is the spike protein of sars-cov-2 but to a lesser extent watanabe et al 2020 will this site-specific glycan shield provide difficulties in target antigen recognition if not properly reconstituted in some of the vaccine platforms will it be necessary to target more than just the spike protein which most approaches are banking on cryptic epitopes for antibody recognition need to be considered yuan et al

financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestin the late 2019 a novel type of coronavirus emerged from wuhan china causing patients to show pneumonia-like symptoms 1 2 later on the virus spread around the world and the world health organization announced a covid-19 pandemic in march 2020 by march 17 2020 190000 covid-19 cases and approximately 7500 deaths from the virus were identified 3 this large number of infected patients in only three months since the first reported case of covid-19 demonstrates that the disease is extremely contagiouscovid-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 which belongs to the family coronaviridae the family that has been responsible for two other viral outbreaks in recent years the first of which was in 2003 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov 4 the second outbreak occurred in 2012 and 2015 due to the spread of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov another virus from the same family 5 6 these two epidemics infected many people at the time of their peak but after the diseases regressed limited reports of laboratory accidents or animal-to-human transmission were publisheduntil today no treatments have been reported for covid-19 7 although some case-reports or observational studies have reported a few antiviral drugs being effective in improving the outcome of covid-19 patients 8 no definitive cure has been discovered so far recently a chinese research team proposed a treatment protocol for management of covid-19 patients which included moxifloxacin levofloxacin consider tolerance and arbidol administration 8 however the underlying evidence for the mentioned treatment protocol is unclear as there are no clinical trials performed on this matter several antiviral therapies have been considered to be potentially effective in treating covid-19 including oseltamivir ganciclovir arbidol and lopinavir  ritonavir many clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the efficacy of different medications on the outcome of covid-19 patients 9 but their results have not been published yet on the other hand the quality of these studies is rather uncleartreatments used for sars-cov or mers-cov may be useful in the treatment of covid-19 due to the fact that all of these viruses are from the same family and they all cause respiratory diseases nevertheless a consensus is yet to be reached on this matter the primary objective of the current systematic review is to evaluate the evidence underlying the efficacy and safety of antiviral therapies in treatment of covid-19 in the current pandemic another goal for the present study is to investigate the clinical trials performed in recent years on the effects of antiviral therapies on sars-cov or mers-cov to propose potential existing treatments for covid-19
study design
the present systematic review was performed in two sections in the first section current clinical evidence about the efficacy of antiviral treatments in management of covid-19 namely the covid-19 antiviral therapy section is presented the second part provides a review of clinical trials conducted on sars-cov and mers-cov to find proposed antiviral therapies namely the sars-mers antiviral therapy section
selection criteria
in the covid-19 antiviral therapy section all types of performed clinical studies aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antiviral drugs were included exclusion criteria comprised in vitro studies animal studies guidelines and review studiesin the sars-mers antiviral therapy section inclusion criteria consisted of clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of antiviral drugs administered for management of ars-cov and mers-cov the exclusion criteria in this section contained observational studies guides animal studies and review articles since sars and mers outbreaks happened in recent years and there was the opportunity for conduction of clinical trials only clinical trials were included in this section as they provide the highest level of evidence in this section antiviral therapies for covid-19 are to be suggested so the provided underlying evidence should be of highest validity
search strategy
an extensive search was performed on medline via pubmed embase scopus central and web of science databases the keywords were selected using expert opinions mesh emtree and related article titles the keywords in the covid-19 antiviral therapy section were the only keywords associated with covid-19 since a small number of articles were published about the treatment and the use of antiviral treatments were prevalently not mentioned in the abstracts of the articles keywords related to antiviral therapy were not included in the search also the search date was chosen to be from early 2019 until march 15 2020 since the first report of covid-19 was published in late 2019the keywords in the sars-mers antiviral therapy section included keywords related to sars-cov and mers-cov in combination with standard filters for clinical trials similar to the previous section keywords related to antiviral therapy were not included in the search due to the limited number of studies the time range for search was set to be from the inception of the database until march 15 2020 search strategy in medline is presented in table 1 in addition to the systematic search an extensive search was also performed on google and google scholar search engines and in the article bibliographies
data collection
two independent researchers reviewed the titles and abstracts of the records obtained from the databases and selected related articles next full texts of these articles were collected and reviewed carefully finally related articles suitable based on inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the present systematic review then the two researchers summarized the articles and collected data including the name of the first author publication year country in which the study was conducted type of the study sample size age and sex distribution of the patients the drug used dose and duration of administration route of administration and treatment outcome any disagreements were resolved by a discussion with a third researcher

the only clinical trial found was performed on 199 patients with severe covid-19 using lopinavir-ritonavir regimen in this randomized open-labeled clinical trial patients were divided into two groups lopinavir-ritonavir 99 patients group and standard treatment group in addition to lopinavir-ritonavir 400 mg  100 mg twice daily 14 days standard treatments such as antibiotics invasive or non-invasive ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo and vasopressor were also used the findings of this study showed that patients receiving lopinavir-ritonavir had a similar recovery process to those receiving standard treatment 28-day mortality and viral rna load were not significantly different between the two groups 10 the researchers concluded that lopinavir-ritonavir administration in patients with severe covid-19 was not more effective than the standard treatmentas previously mentioned all of the other studies were case-reports and case-series moreover most of the studies did not provide an analysis regarding the efficacy of antiviral therapy in the treatment course of covid-19 patients for instance chen et al reported no deaths among nine patients treated with lopinavirritonavir however the sample size of the mentioned article was quite small 12 according to the existing statistics the mortality rate of covid-19 among patients aged 10 to 60 years varies between 02 and 13 3 hence for every 100 patients in this age group only one patient dies therefore the sample size was probably not large enough to observe at least one death in another study hu et al studied 24 asymptomatic patients and reported no mortality or icu admission and no serious complication in 21 patients treated with antiviral agents nonetheless in addition to the small sample size since the patients were asymptomatic the severity of covid-19 was rather mild in them therefore the recovery of the patients might have been due to their mild disease rather than the efficacy of the antiviral drugs used 15 guan et al studied 1099 patients 393 of which were treated with oseltamivir and showed that icu admission need for mechanical ventilation or death rate was 92 among the oseltamivir-treated group whilst the rate was 44 in the group that was not treated with oseltamivir in other words oseltamivir administration was ineffective in decreasing icu admission rate the need for ventilator and death rate among the patients 13 shang et al performed a study on 416 patients indicating that antiviral drugs have no effects on the mortality rate of covid-19 patients in their study the mortality rate was 129 among the group treated with antiviral drugs whereas the group which did not receive the antiviral treatment had a mortality rate of 56 22 furthermore in singapore young et al studied 18 patients and administered lopinavirritonavir for only five patients two of whom recovered and two deteriorated only one patient tolerated the antiviral regimen and completed the 12-day treatment course after the start of antiviral treatments liver test results became abnormal in three of the patients 28also li et al examined five children with covid-19 two patients treated with antiviral drugs and three patients did not receive antiviral therapy indicating that antiviral agents did not change the outcome or the duration of hospital stay 17 lim et al presented a 54-year-old non-smoker woman with no medical history in whom the viral load started to decline and symptoms started to alleviate gradually with the start of lopinavirritonavir treatment and eventually the patient was discharged the researchers reported that it is not clear that the reduced burden of covid-19 is due to the healing process or to the administration of anti-viral therapy 18 furthermore han et al and zhang et al reported complete recovery in one patient who had diabetes and was treated with oseltamivirganciclovir 14 and two patients treated with oseltamivir and arbidol 30 respectivelythere are also studies available that despite having an acceptable sample size did not report the final outcome of a large portion of their patients for instance wu et al did not report any deaths among 80 patients treated with ribavirin while 59 patients were still not discharged and their outcome was still unclear at the time of the submission of the article 25 xu et al 26 yang et al 27 and wang et al 24 also observed no deaths in their studies however the majority of the patients they reviewed were still under treatment with an unclear final outcome at the time of the publication of their articles
studies on 
sars-cov and mers-cov
an extensive search was conducted in databases in order to find the existing evidence regarding antiviral therapies for treatment of diseases caused by sars-cov and mers-cov which are in the same family as sars-cov-2 in this section only clinical trials were supposed to be found 2004 non-duplicate articles were reviewed and no clinical trials were performed on the antiviral treatments in managing sars-cov and mers-cov patients figure 1 only one clinical trial protocol commissioned by a research team in saudi arabia existed this study named as the miracle trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of lopinavir  ritonavir and interferon-1b combination therapy in the treatment of mers-cov patients the study is currently ongoing and their results have not been published yet 32 therefore no clinical trials exist on the basis of which an antiviral drug can be suggested for covid-19 not even for sars-cov and mers-covthe findings of the present study indicated that only one clinical trial was completed on the efficacy and safety of antiviral agents in management of covid-19 patients which showed ineffectiveness of lopinavir-ritonavir in improving patients outcomes moreover no clinical trials exist on treatments for sars-cov and mers-cov furthermore in 2019 and 2020 21 case-series and case-reports provided reports about antiviral treatments in management of covid-19 patients none of which can be taken into account when assessing the clinical usefulness of antiviral treatments against covid-19 in general no study has examined the efficacy of antiviral therapies alone in treatment of covid-19 and all of the existing articles have used other treatments such as antibiotics immunoglobulin interferon glucocorticoids antifungal and antiparasitic drugs in their studies hence the reports presented cannot be attributed solely to antiviral drugs therefore the existing literature regarding the efficacy of antiviral therapy in management of covid-19 patients has serious limitations including1 only one clinical trial has been conducted on the matter depicting that lopinavir-ritonavir is not superior to the standard treatments in management of covid-19 patients2 in all of the existing case-series and case-reports antiviral agents were used in combination with other medications and therefore the observed outcomes cannot be solely attributed to antiviral therapy3 since there was no placebo group in the case-series and case-reports one cannot determine that the outcomes are due to antiviral therapy or the nature of healing process or both4 follow-up was incomplete in some studies and a great proportion of the patients have unclear outcomes5 the sample size was small in most of the studies and some were even case reportsrecently zhang et al posted a guideline in the lancet respiratory medicine journal recommending the administration of arbidol for management of covid-19 patients however this guideline has limitations in general the underlying evidence for this guideline are unclear secondly based on the present systematic review arbidol was used as the second line of therapy in all of the included studies hence the drug appears to be inappropriate for the first line of therapy 8 nevertheless lopinavir-ritonavir being ineffective in management of covid-19 patients highlights the need to search for other antiviral therapiesmany existing guidelines and instructions propose antiviral drugs for management of covid-19 patients based on the studies performed on sars-cov and mers-cov therefore in the current study we aimed to summarize the evidence obtained from clinical trials to determine the level of evidence underlying the mentioned proposal surprisingly no completed clinical trial on sars-cov and mers-cov was found and all of the proposals were based on simulation studies in vitro studies pre-clinical studies or at best observational studies and case-series 33-38 after an epidemic has subsided researchers are reluctant to perform further investigations on the matter which is a major pitfall in research and can have several reasons the first and most important reason is the decline in the number of patients which severely limits the possibility of performing a clinical trial secondly the previous two epidemics namely sars-cov and mers-cov never became a pandemic and the majority of the cases were in a limited geographic region therefore after the suppression of the epidemics and decline in the number of patients the two diseases were eliminated from the list of priorities of international organizations if those international organizations such as the world health organization had further insisted on the importance of the subject and provided grants for independent researches maybe a few effective antiviral agents for sars-cov and mers-cov would have existed which could be helpful in management of covid-19 decreasing its burden on societies a lesson should be learned from the covid-19 pandemic and negligence of health policy makers in setting up clinical trials during sars-cov and mers-cov epidemics so that in the current pandemic and future epidemics researches and well-designed clinical trials are planned-out while the disease is at its peak the findings of which can be used when necessaryfindings of the current systematic review indicated that it is not clear whether the currently used antiviral agents are beneficial in improving the outcome of covid-19 patients or not one clinical trial and some case-series suggest that these drugs may not have an impact on the final outcome of covid-19 patients furthermore lack of published clinical trials on sars-cov and mers-cov which were epidemics in recent years impedes suggesting a potential antiviral treatment for covid-19 the current situation is a serious red flag for international organizations such as the world health organization in the time of the current pandemic and future epidemics organizations such as who should pursue more proactive actions and plan well-designed clinical trials to be able to use the results in managing future pandemicsfor over two decades global health leaders have been cautioning the world about another pandemic comparable in severity and scope to the 1918 influenza epidemic 1 two major outbreaks afflicted the world in the 20th century that is the 1918 influenza epidemic and the ongoing human immunodeficiency virus hiv pandemic 2 the 21st century has already seen a significant number of outbreaks severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov in 2002 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 and the ebola virus ebov in 2014 currently we are in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic due to sars-cov-2 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 these outbreaks have posed many challenges an important one being the public health aspect but also the lack of effective therapies and vaccines prevention of complications and supportive treatment are the standard of care for most of these recent viral disease outbreaks 3 no treatment has been proven effective for the current covid-19 pandemic the medical community is under immense pressure and many clinicians are embarking on using experimental treatments based on poorly conducted clinical trials and observational data 4 randomized controlled trials conducted efficiently and promptly are the only way to find effective therapiesremdesivir gs-5734 is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral drug that has demonstrated activity against ribonucleic acid rna viruses of several families including coronaviridae such as sars-cov mers-cov and strains of bat coronaviruses paramyxoviridae such as nipah virus respiratory syncytial virus and hendra virus and filoviridae such as ebov 59 in this narrative review we will summarize the studies available to date for remdesivir in the context of viral outbreaks especially its development as an antiviral agent for ebola and coronaviruses we searched pubmed for published clinical and preclinical reports assessing remdesivir for ebola virus disease evd sars mers and covid-19 the search terms used were ebola virus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov covid-19 2019-ncov sars-cov-2 and remdesivir or gs-5734 the references of the selected papers were reviewed to identify additional pertinent reportscoronaviruses are large enveloped positive-strand rna viruses that can be divided into four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus deltacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus 10 alpha and beta cov are known to cause human disease until recently human coronavirus hcov received relatively less attention as they were considered low-virulence organisms and believed to cause only mild self-limiting upper respiratory infection in humans1112the first coronavirus outbreak sars caused by sars-cov occurred in the guangdong province of china in 20022003 the mortality rate during this outbreak was 9 with a higher mortality rate 50 in the elderly population this outbreak was largely contained because of relatively inefficient transmission which mainly occurred through direct contact with infected individuals hence strict quarantine of infected patients restricted the spread of the disease and the outbreak ceased after affecting 8098 people and causing death in 774 patients 13the next coronavirus outbreak occurred in the middle east saudi arabia in 2012 and was named the mers-cov this virus caused severe lower respiratory infection with a mortality rate of about 35 per the world health organizations who report the total number of reported cases globally was 2519 out of which 866 patients died 13 both mers-cov and sars-cov originated from bats however serologic studies for antibody testing in dromedary camels suggested that camels were the intermediate host for mers-cov 14mers-cov shared many clinical features with sars-cov such as severe atypical pneumonia however there were some differences with mers causing prominent gastrointestinal gi symptoms and acute kidney injury the investigators attributed the differences in clinical manifestations to the involvement of different receptors used by these two viruses while mers binds to the human dipeptidyl peptidase receptor present in the lower airway gi tract and kidney sars binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme ace-2 receptor1213 the treatments for these coronavirus outbreaks largely relied on supportive careon december 31 2019 china reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases with an unknown etiology 15 early cases were associated with the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan hubei province soon after that the causative pathogen was identified as a novel betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 and the disease was ultimately named covid-19 sars-cov-2 has high sequence homology with bat coronaviruses 87 identical sequences with bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 which supports the hypothesis of bat origin when compared with sars-cov and mers-cov sars-cov-2 has a genetic similarity of 79 and 50 respectively 13 the clinical presentation of covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic carriage to severe viral pneumonia causing acute respiratory distress syndrome fever and gi symptoms are common at the time of this report covid-19 has spread across the globe with 2397216 confirmed cases and 162956 deaths according to the who situation report 16ebola viruses belong to the family filoviridae a taxonomic group of enveloped non-segmented negative-strand rna viruses there are five different species of ebov that can infect humans but they differ in their virulence and disease progression with a case fatality rate ranging from 40 for bundibugyo ebov to 7090 for zaire ebov humans infected with ebov initially have non-specific symptoms such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea with the hemorrhagic phase occurring in half of the cases 17 outbreaks of evd have mainly been limited to africa however in recent times a small number for patients have been transferred to hospitals with modern technology in the usa and germany the mortality rate in africa is often very high compared to patients who have received supportive care in developed countries there are no approved drugs for the treatment of evd during the 20142016 west african outbreak and subsequent outbreak in the democratic republic of congo drc several investigational treatments such as antibody therapy and remdesivir were evaluated in clinical trials 18in summary it has been challenging to evaluate investigational drugs in randomized controlled trials during outbreak situations the initial response to the covid-19 outbreak was to use treatments that were not shown to be effective in properly conducted trials most studies thus far have lacked adequate controls are observational and have a very small number of patients that precludes any meaningful statistics regarding efficacy here we review the available studies for the antiviral remdesivir gilead sciences inc in an attempt to present an impartial review of data available for this drug with a specific focus on outbreaks of ebov and now sars-cov-2remdesivir previously gs-5734 chemical formula c27h35n6o8p is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of a c-adenosine nucleoside analogue figure 1 1921 remdesivir terminates viral rna synthesis by inhibiting viral rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp the active form remdesivir triphosphate competes with native adenosine triphosphate for chain inclusion resulting in delayed chain termination 22 remdesivir displays linear pharmacokinetics and a prolonged intracellular half-life 35 hours for the active parent triphosphate remdesivir triphosphate was found to accumulate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells suggesting a loading dose that could accelerate the achievement of a steady state 23 these characteristics support the dosing regimen used in clinical studies to date 200 mg intravenously on the first day followed by 100 mg intravenously once daily 510 days total detailed information regarding remdesivir metabolism and elimination is unavailable 23remdesivir exhibits broad in vitro antiviral action against zoonotic and human pathogens from multiple virus families table 1 remdesivirs activity has been consistent when tested against members of the filoviridae paramyxoviridae pneumoviridae and coronaviridae
6 among hcov remdesivir inhibits three of the endemic strains associated with respiratory illness hcov-oc43 229e and nl63 as well as the less common mers-cov sars-cov and novel sars-cov-27924 in addition remdesivir possesses activity against sars-like and mers-like bat coronaviruses hku3 wiv1 shc014 and hku5 7 although most preclinical research has been in vitro remdesivir was also effective in non-human primate nhp models of mers nipah virus infection and evd52526remdesivir is less potent against the flaviviridae with moderate activity against hepatitis c dengue and yellow fever viruses 6 remdesivir has poor-to-negligible activity against tick-borne flaviviruses alkhurma hemorrhagic fever kyasanur forest disease omsk hemorrhagic fever tick-borne encephalitis and west nile lassa vesicular stomatitis rift valley fever and crimeancongo hemorrhagic fever viruses 6remdesivir was first identified during a broad screening for compounds with activity against emerging viruses 19 the original screening program was primarily geared toward identifying candidates that could inhibit rna viruses namely coronaviridae and flaviviridae subsequent to the 20132016 evd outbreak in west africa some previously screened compounds were further investigated against ebov remdesivir was observed to have high potency against ebov across multiple cell lines with an anti-ebov half maximal effective concentration ec50 of 0086 m in human macrophages remdesivir was chosen for continued clinical development based upon its potency and a chemical structure amenable to rapid scale-up 19 the first in vivo efficacy evaluation was completed in an non-human primate nhp model of evd 5 in the nhp evd model previously healthy rhesus monkeys received an intramuscular inoculation of ebov which results in death after a clinical course mimicking human evd nhp was challenged with ebov followed by receipt of various remdesivir dosing regimens the time from inoculation to remdesivir initiation varied between study groups as soon as 30 minutes after viral challenge and up to 3 days after viral challenge lower doses 3 mgkg daily demonstrated a measurable antiviral effect with survival rates between 33 and 66 however higher doses were most promising with 66 nhp surviving after receiving remdesivir 10 mgkg daily starting on day 3 this was the first report of a molecule providing post-exposure protection from evd and supported the further evaluation of remdesivir in human evda limited number of case reports described the use of remdesivir for evd through emergency compassionate use protocols prior to the completion of formal clinical trials2728 the first case described the use of remdesivir for ebov meningoencephalitis in a 39-year-old woman who had fully recovered from an episode of evd 9 months earlier the second case involved an infant diagnosed with evd on her first day of life following birth from an ebov-positive mother 28 although both patients in these reports survived it is difficult to make conclusions regarding the role remdesivir played in their recovery as multiple therapies were administereda randomized multi-intervention trial was later conducted during the evd outbreak in the drc 18 patients of any age including pregnant women were eligible for enrollment if they tested positive for ebov patients received standard supportive care along with an assignment to one of four treatment arms in a 1111 ratio study treatments included zmapp a triple monoclonal antibody mab114 a single human monoclonal antibody derived from an ebola survivor regn-eb3 a mixture of three human immunoglobulin g1 igg1 monoclonal antibodies and intravenous remdesivir remdesivir was administered at a dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for 913 days weight-based doses were used for pediatric patients the primary outcome was mortality at day 28 nearly 700 patients had been randomized when an interim analysis led to early cessation of the trial the data and safety monitoring board found higher mortality in the zmapp and remdesivir groups compared to the mab114 and regn-eb3 groups further the regn-eb3 group had met a prespecified threshold for efficacy a total of 673 patients were included in the final analysis the mean age of enrolled patients was 29 years and 56 of patients were women 6 of whom were pregnant at day 28 mortality rates were remdesivir 531 zmapp 497 mab114 351 and regn-eb3 335 for remdesivir 85 and 29 of patients with high- and low-viral loads at baseline died respectivelyin summary despite potent in vitro activity against ebov and unprecedented success in animal models of evd the journey of remdesivir for human evd culminated in disappointing resultsremdesivir was known to inhibit the replication of coronaviruses prior to the emergence of sars-cov-2 wang and colleagues published the first report affirming that remdesivir among other existing antivirals could effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 replication 29 the investigators evaluated the activity of seven drugs against sars-cov-2 in the non-human vero e6 cells ribavirin penciclovir nitazoxanide nafamostat chloroquine favipiravir and remdesivir the ec50 was lowest for remdesivir 077 m followed by chloroquine 113 m a simulated molecular docking experiment also predicted remdesivir would bind to sars-cov-2 rdrp with high affinity 30 a number of factors have led to the public and medical interest in remdesivir for the treatment of sars-cov-2 in recent times first in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 has been confirmed second remdesivir has an established dosing and safety profile finally effective treatments for covid-19 are desperately neededas the covid-19 pandemic spread gilead sciences inc facilitated emergency access to remdesivir through a compassionate use program for patients with severe disease and no access to a clinical trial individual requests for compassionate use have since been halted in favor of a newly expanded access program exception compassionate use requests for pregnant women and children 18 years old are still accepted 31 the initial clinical efficacy data for remdesivir in covid-19 have centered on the case reports wherein patients received remdesivir through the compassionate use process all cases described received remdesivir 200 mg intravenously on day 1 followed by 100 mg for up to 9 more daysthe first patient diagnosed with covid-19 in the united states was treated with remdesivir 32 the patient was a 35-year-old man with a limited past medical history and recent travel to wuhan china he was admitted to a hospital for airborne isolation and monitoring remdesivir was initiated on hospital day 7 due to increasing oxygen requirements and ongoing pyrexia the patient improved the following day and was mostly asymptomatic at the time the report was published a more recent report describes the use of remdesivir in a 40-year-old man who was hospitalized with severe covid-19 requiring mechanical ventilation 33 remdesivir was not started until day 13 of illness the patient was extubated 72 hours later and a full recovery was expected at the time of publication the authors hypothesize that remdesivir may retain a therapeutic effect even when started late in a disease course a non-peer reviewed manuscript is available that describes the outcomes of the first 12 patients in the united states with covid-19 34 three patients received remdesivir and all 12 patients clinically recovered retrospective cohort studies have been published detailing covid-19 outcomes in patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo and those with a history of solid organ transplant3536 in the ecmo cohort 35 survivors received remdesivir and 110 non-survivors received remdesivir in the transplant cohort only 290 patients received remdesivir and their specific outcomes were not reportedgrein and colleagues recently reported their experience with the compassionate use of remdesivir for covid-19 in a multicenter open label cohort that enrolled 61 patients of note this analysis included previously reported cases 37 compassionate use approvals were reserved for hospitalized patients with an oxygen saturation of 94 on room air or the need for oxygen support patients were required to have a creatinine clearance crcl greater than 30 mlmin and hepatic transaminases less than five times the upper limit of normal there were no predefined endpoints or enrollment goals a total of 53 patients were included in the final analysis 8 patients were excluded due to missing or erroneous data the median age was 64 years and 64 of patients were receiving invasive ventilation at baseline including 7 receiving ecmo the median time from symptom onset to remdesivir initiation was 12 days after starting remdesivir 36 of 53 patients 68 showed improvement based on their level of oxygen support of those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation 1730 57 were extubated three out of four patients 75 receiving ecmo were able to stop ecmo seven 13 patients died the risk of death was increased in patients who were 70 years of age those with higher serum creatinine and those requiring invasive ventilation the authors suggest the 13 mortality rate is noteworthy given previously reported mortality rates of 1778 in severe covid-19 unfortunately conclusions regarding the clinical effect of remdesivir are hampered by the lack of a control group and delay in initiation of therapy additionally the direct antiviral effect of remdesivir was not assessed with viral load measurements the sample size was small and a substantial proportion of patients given remdesivir were eventually excluded from analysis 861 13finally 4 months into the disease the data from randomized trials are beginning to emerge one of the first randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study in severe covid-19 was released at the time of manuscript preparation nct04257656 table 2 38 wang and colleagues randomized hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 in a 21 allocation to remdesivir n158 to matching placebo n78 38 remdesivir was given in the dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily on days 210 the primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement defined as a two-point reduction in disease severity on a six-point ordinal scale the baseline characteristics though largely balanced had higher proportion of patients with medical comorbidities and presenting later than 10 days with higher respiratory rate at baseline most patients required supplemental oxygen but not mechanical ventilation in the efficacy analysis time to clinical improvement was similar between groups median 21 days in the remdesivir group versus 23 days with placebo hazard ratio hr 123 95 confidence interval ci 087175 mortality at 28 days was also similar between groups 22 14 died in the remdesivir group versus 10 13 with placebo sars-cov-2 rna loads were not reduced with remdesivir compared to placebo the trial was halted before target enrollment was reached as the covid-19 outbreak subsided in the study region as such the statistical power was reduced from a planned 80 to 58 and the study remained inconclusivewhile the results of the study from china are inconclusive the preliminary results of the first randomized controlled study from the usa conducted under the auspices of the national institute of allergy and infectious disease adaptive covid-19 treatment trial have also been released nct04280705 table 2 on the same day through a press release 39 although full data release is awaited the preliminary analysis of over 1063 enrollments showed that the median time to recovery was shorter in those who treated with remdesivir compared to those treated with placebo 11 days versus 15 days p0001 the results also showed a trend toward survival benefit with remdesivir mortality of 8 in remdesivir arm versus 116 in placebo p0059 in absence of details it is also uncertain as to what proportion of the population received treatment with additional therapeutic agents for covid-19 finally in another press release gilead sciences inc summarized results of an open-label study comparing the treatment regimen of 5 versus 10 days of remdesivir for severe covid-19 nct04292899 table 2 40 clinical improvement was similar with either regimen however lack of placebo arm and limitation of the study details prohibit meaningful conclusionstogether these reports suggest a promising role for remdesivir for covid-19 though its effects on hard outcomes including mortality are still pending release of the full reports of these recently reported randomized studies and of the ongoing studies referenced in table 2 will be needed to judge the true efficacy and safety of remdesivir for covid-19remdesivir has a low affinity for human rna polymerase ii and human mitochondrial rna polymerase which is expected to contribute to a favorable safety profile in humans 22 safety was initially evaluated in phase one of the dose-ranging studies 23 single doses from 3 to 225 mg were well tolerated with no observed toxicities multiple administrations of remdesivir 150 mg for 7 or 14 days led to reversible grade 1 and 2 alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate transaminase ast elevations remdesivir is not considered to have reproductive or developmental toxicity remdesivir injection is formulated with sulfobutylether--cyclodextrin sbecd 41 other drug products formulated with sbedc such as intravenous voriconazole carry warnings for sbecd accumulation in patients with renal dysfunction 41 however the clinical significance of vehicle accumulation is unclear 42 patients with crcl  30 mlmin have been excluded from remdesivir compassionate use and expanded access protocols thus far 31 some ongoing clinical trials table 2 are excluding patients with crcl  50 mlminin the open-label covid-19 compassionate use cohort 37 3253 60 patients reported adverse events while 453 8 experienced adverse events leading to discontinuation the most common adverse events were increased hepatic enzymes diarrhea rash and renal impairment this constellation of events is difficult to interpret as there is a significant overlap with clinical attributes of severe covid-19 no new safety concerns were noted in the published covid-19 randomized trial adverse events leading to drug discontinuation occurred in 18 12 remdesivir patients and 4 5 placebo patients 38 reported adverse events were uncommon in the landmark evd trial the full toxicity profile will be further elucidated as results emerge from additional placebo-controlled trials in covid-19there are currently seven randomized trials involving remdesivir registered on clinicaltrialsgov table 2 two of these trials both conducted in china nct04257656 and nct04252664 were recently terminated or suspended the information posted to clinicaltrialsgov indicates difficulty enrolling subjects as the covid-19 pandemic has come under control in the region of the two halted studies results have only been released for nct04257656 as described earlier 38 the remaining active trials include comparisons with placebo active comparators eg hydroxychloroquine and lopinavirritonavir short 5 days versus long 10 days remdesivir regimens and patients with moderate-to-severe covid-19infectious disease outbreaks have shaped the course of human history and with every new outbreak come new challenges today scientists and clinicians around the globe are fighting to halt the covid-19 pandemic a chief concern remains there are no antiviral treatments proven to be effective in fully published peer-reviewed randomized placebo-controlled trials remdesivir has emerged as a promising candidate based on its in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 uncontrolled clinical reports and limited data from randomized trials however expectations should be tempered based on lessons from the past remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against ebov and was highly efficacious in an animal model of evd unfortunately early hopes for a new paradigm in evd management were deflated with the completion of the first randomized trial remdesivir holds promise for covid-19 but the first published randomized trial was underpowered and inconclusive high-quality data are still lacking at this time thus clinicians across the world now eagerly await complete results from additional randomized trials in covid-19 will remdesivir deliverin december 2019 a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged followed by a rapidly spread due to strong human-to-human transmission 1 2 based on the clinical presentation the pneumonia was determined to be a viral infection the virus was initially named the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and then formally severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 3 the state council of the peoples republic of china implemented a level 1 public health response to prevent the spread of the disease 4 all levels of the chinese government medical doctors and other healthcare professionals anti-epidemic volunteers of all kinds and virtually the entire nation have been working together as a whole for more than six weeks in order to get the spread under control most districts have reported zero increase of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 cases in the past few weeks as of 11 march 2020 a total of 80 955 laboratory-confirmed cases had been documented in china 5the world health organization who declared covid-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020 6 the mortality rate was found to be 39 according to the data at that time 5 given the human-to-human transmission and high infectivity of the disease covid-19 has been rapidly spreading in republic of korea iran italy the united states and europe 7 8 9 10 11 a number of studies and reports have identified a median incubation period of 4 d and have determined that the top four symptoms include fever cough shortness of breath and chest tightnesspain 12 13 14 the most unfortunate fact is that there have been no effective therapies for preventing and treating covid-19 to date although remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be effective in inhibiting sars-cov-2 the data obtained thus far are primarily from in vitro studies 15 interferon lopinavirritonavir arbidol ribavirin and the therapeutic application of plasma antibodies have also been recommended as alternatives for the treatment of patients with covid-19 however the efficacy and safety of these drugs remain to be verified in patients and their applications are yet to be validated by scientifically sound randomized clinical trials rcts 16 17triazavirin tzv a new antiviral drug has been on the market in russia since 2015 it is a synthetic compound analogue to the purine nucleoside bases the principle mode of action of tzv is inhibiting the synthesis of viral rna and preventing the replication of genomic fragments 18 because of its multiple-target mechanism of action tzv has a wide spectrum of antiviral activity against rna-containing viruses including influenza a virus h5n1 etc influenza b virus tick-borne encephalitis and forest-spring encephalitis both in vitro and in animal models in vivo
18 19 20 according to the package insert the recommended dosage of tzv is 250 mg three times daily for a consecutive 57 d in a phase ii rct on tzv patients took 250 mg tzv orally three times a day for 5 d the results showed that tzv can significantly shorten the duration of the major clinical symptoms of influenza and decrease the incidence of influenza-related complications and complications induced by the concurrent use of symptomatic drugs no obvious adverse events aes were reported 21 22 nevertheless the efficacy and safety of tzv for covid-19 remain uncertain until the anticipated positive results are obtained from rcts we therefore set up the present ongoing multicenter and blind rct with the aim of testing the efficacy and safety of tzv for covid-19this clinical study is an ongoing multicenter and blind rct to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of tzv versus a placebo in the treatment of covid-19 patients with positive nucleic acid tests for sars-cov-2 are randomly assigned into two groups in equal proportions 11 the trial group receives tzv plus standard treatment according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version 7 and the diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia trial version 5 drafted by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china and the national administration of traditional chinese medicine 16 23 and the placebo group receives the tzv placebo plus standard treatment patients undergo consecutive 7-day treatment and are then followed up on days 3 7 14 and 21 after the end of treatment specific items that will be recorded for each intervention and follow-up period are outlined in table 1

one strength of this trial is that it is an add-on interventional study consisting of the chinese standard therapy plus the study drug or placebo this design ensures protocol compliance and maximizes the facility of patient enrollment to this trial while maintaining the standard treatments according to the guidelines of the national health commission of the peoples republic of china another strength is its block randomization in each of the ten study sites in which the patients baseline demographic features and treatment characteristics will be recorded and balanced by randomization within each local hospital during the life-support treatment of patients in case of emergency
there are some limitations to our study first all assessments of clinical symptoms and signs are conducted at local study sites by pis and assistants without sufficient training on covid-19 beforehand second there is no central laboratory for urgent tests for diagnosing or monitoring disease with uniform sample-transferring procedures third covid-19 is a time-limited disease and at present there are 100 confirmed covid-19 patients in heilongjiang province there is no guarantee that we will be able to acquire the prospective number of patients for the trialwe designed this randomized clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of tzv for covid-19 although the results of this study lack statistical significance due to the limited sample size they are expected to show that tzv might benefit covid-19 patients by controlling symptoms and reducing frequent usage of concomitant therapies for vital organ supports there is a need for further research to be performed with large sample sizes to assess these outcomeson december 31 2019 the wuhan municipal health commission china reported to the world health organization a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology in the city of wuhan in the chinese province of hubei on january 9 2020 the chinese center for disease control and prevention reported that a new coronavirus sars-cov-2 has been identified as the causative agent of respiratory disease later called covid-19 coronavirusdisease-19 zhu et al 2020as of april 18 2020 there have been more than 22 million recorded cases and over 80000 deaths in over 22 countries situation report n89 2020covid-19 syndrome is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle eastern respiratory syndrome mers-cov this similarity was confirmed by the rapid viral genetic makeup sequencing that evidenced the proximity among the pathogens sanders et al 2020the availability of the entire genomic sequence of the virus on one hand and isolated virus specimens made available by the researchers who obtained them may be useful to quickly refine the knowledge on the peculiar features of this new coronavirus above all this information could help us significantly to develop reliable diagnostic tools and effective therapeutic regimenssars-cov-2 a single-stranded rna-wrapped virus penetrates cells by binding to a receptor called angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team china cdc 2020the viral particle uses host cell receptors and endosomes to penetrate cells a serine protease tmprss2 facilitates entry into cells hoffmann et al 2020once inside the cell the viral polyproteins that encode the replicase-transcriptase complex are synthesized the virus then synthesizes rna through its rna-dependent rna polymerase y chen et al 2020c fehr and perlman 2015these stages of the viral life cycle provide potential targets for drug therapy fig 1

summarizes the current pharmacological treatments for sars-cov-2 identified in the present work through the clinicaltrialsgov website clinicaltrialsgov ndremdesivir gs-5734 was discovered and synthesized in 2017 by siegel et al to counter ebola and other emerging viruses siegel et al 2017later on there were different pre-clinical and randomized clinical studies that have respectively analyzed its mechanisms of action and its efficacy against these microorganisms agostini et al 2018 it has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against rna viruses it is a prodrug the structure of which resembles adenosine siegel et al 2017therefore it can incorporate into the nascent viral rna and inhibit the rna-dependent rna polymerase stopping the replication of the viral genome mulangu et al 2019remdesivir has previously been shown to exhibit antiviral activity against several coronaviruses including sars-cov and mers-cov in vitro and in vivo agostini et al 2018 sheahan et al 2017 in a recent in vitro study remdesivir has also been shown to inhibit sars-cov-2 m wang et al 2020bthe current dose under consideration is a single 200 mg followed by a 100 mg daily infusion for a period of time of 510 days different trials are underway to evaluate the use of remdesivir against coronavirus table 1the most common severe adverse effect of remdesivir is a reversible increase in transaminases with possible kidney damage sheahan et al 2020the aifa italian medicines agency is sponsoring two randomized open-label multicenter phase 3 studies which will shed light on the effectiveness of remdesivir as an antiviral agent compared to supportive care clinicaltrialsgov ndpreliminary results from some ongoing studies randomized trials suggest to include this agent for the treatment of covid-19 because of this the fda recently approved the emergency use of remdesivir for the treatment of covid-19 fda allows for emergency use of remdesivir experimental coronavirus drug 2020favipiravir or 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide t-705 was developed in 2002 and was approved for medical use in japan in 2014 furuta et al 2002it has been found to have strong and selective inhibitory activity against influenza viruses besides favipiravir is also considered as a novel viral rna polymerase inhibitor furuta et al 2013in 2018 favipiravir was also studied as a potential countermeasure against neglected and emerging rna viruses delang et al 2018therefore similar to remdesivir favipiravir works as an rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor structurally resembling endogenous guanine furuta et al 2017competitive inhibition may reduce viral replication although most of the information on this antiviral comes from its activity against ebola and the h1n2 virus favipiravir also demonstrated extensive activity against other rna viruses furuta et al 2017for the treatment of covid-19 doses at the upper limit of the average dosage range should be considered appropriate doses of favipiravir against coronavirus are still under investigation some trials are testing protocols with attack doses of 18002400 mg followed by maintenance doses ranging from 300 mg to 1800 mg table 1 sissoko et al 2016favipiravir is generally well tolerated however knowledge about safety in higher dose regimens is limited chinello et al 2017 dong et al 2020 kumagai et al 2015 favipiravir can cause hyperuricaemia increase in transaminases decrease in the number of neutrophils diarrhea furuta et al 2013currently there is no sufficient information available to support the use of favipiravir for covid-19one study compared favipiravir with umifenovir after seven days of therapy a significant difference was found between patients treated with umifenovir or favipiravir c chen et al 2020a with better results returned by the latterthese data suggest that further clinical trials on the efficacy of favipiravir for the treatment of covid-19 are required despite little scientific evidence and the limited number of clinical trials available in march 2020 favipiravir was approved by the national medical products administration of china as the first anti-covid-19 drug in chinalopinavir and ritonavir are used in combination as therapeutic drugs for hiv croxtall and perry 2010although coronaviruses encode a different enzyme class of protease cysteine protease there is theoretical evidence that lopinavir and ritonavir can also inhibit the coronaviral protease 3cl1 chan et al 2015 chu et al 2004 de wilde et al 2014the lopinavirritonavir combination is being investigated in a clinical study against covid-19 in patients with moderate and severe covid-19 table 1 however it has shown only little benefit agostini et al 2018in another study in patients with severe covid-19 chictr2000029308 no benefits of lopinavirritonavir were observed compared to standard care cao et al 2020further information on the use of lopinavirritonavir for the treatment of covid-19 mainly comes from clinical cases and retrospective non-randomized and small studies which make it difficult to ascertain the effect of the treatment chan et al 2003 yao et al 2020the current lopinavirritonavir dose protocol under investigation consists of doses of lopinavir 200 mg and ritonavir 50 mg every 12 h for 714 days diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia 2020although further clinical trials are underway on lopinavirritonavir current data do not support lopinavirritonavir in covid-19 treatment this because of significant drug on drug interactions and their potential adverse reactions according to a recent rct about 50 of patients treated with lopinavirritonavir experienced at least one adverse effect and 14 of patients had to interrupt the therapy cao et al 2020the main adverse effects of lopinavirritonavir include gastrointestinal disorders up to 30 and hepatotoxicity between 2 and 10 lexicomp database online 2016 more serious adverse effects are represented by hepatotoxicity pancreatitis abnormalities in cardiac conduction cao et al 2020 chu et al 2004ivermectin has been studied since 1946 against avid diphtheria it was considered as an enigmatic multifaceted wonder drug in 2017 crump 2017more recently it has also been used as already approved by the fda as an anti-parasitic against scabies and equally against hiv zika dengue west nile and influenza viruses wagstaff et al 2012its mechanism of action involves the dissociation of the preformed imp1 heterodimer responsible for the nuclear transport of loads of viral proteins caly et al 2012since nuclear transport of viral proteins is essential for the replication cycle and inhibition of the hosts antiviral response focusing on the nuclear transport process can be a viable therapeutic approach against rna viruses yang et al 2020recently an in vivo study has shown ivermectins ability to reduce viral rna up to 5000 times after 48 h of sars-cov-2 infection

hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can also block virus infection by increasing the endosomal ph necessary to the fusion of the membrane between the virus and the host cell savarino et al 2003recently in vitro tests revealed the ability to reduce the number of viral copies of sars-cov-2 lan et al 2020a news briefing from china reported that chloroquine has been successfully used to treat over 100 covid-19 cases the results demonstrated increased viral clearance and reduced disease progression gao et al 2020 however the final data have not yet been published preventing the validation of these statementsaccording to some authors adding azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine in 6 patients resulted in numerically higher viral clearance 66 100 compared to hydroxychloroquine monotherapy 814 57

cardiotoxicity to a lesser extent than chloroquine lim et al 2009 d zhou et al 2020ait is thought that the recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 rhace2 may prevent the entry of sars-cov-2 into the host cell by blocking the protein s responsible for the interaction between the virus and cellular ace2in a recent study rhace2 was reported to inhibit sars-cov-2 replication in cell and embryonic stem cell-derived organoids by a factor of 10005000 times penninger et al 2020the administration of rhace2 may reduce the serum level of angiotensin ii depriving the ace enzyme of its substrate this mechanism could prevent further activation of the ace2 angiotensin receptor and thus preserve pulmonary vascular integrity and prevent ards khan et al 2017rhace2 has already undergone a

class for covid-19 is that of monoclonal antibodies directed against the main inflammatory cytokines or other components of the innate immune responsethe reason for their use lies in the pathophysiology of damage to the lungs and other organs caused by covid-19 which induces an amplified immune response named cytokine storm mehta et al 2020il-6 seems to be a key factor in this inflammation as evidenced by clinical results from chinese research f zhou et al 2020bso perhaps monoclonal antibodies directed towards il-6 may reverse this process and lead to clinical improvements

search for drugs that can guarantee a therapy for sars-cov-2 we can mention thalidomide - an antiangiogenic anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic agent thalidomide is an inhibitor of tnf-alpha synthesis was used as a treatment for multiple inflammatory diseases such as behets disease and crohns disease vargesson 2015preclinical studies showed that thalidomide was effective in the treatment of h1n1-infected mice by reducing the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines zhu et al 2014in the wake of this evidence current studies are focusing on immunomodulatory effects that could reduce lung damage caused by the strong immune response to sars-cov-2 table 1 clinicaltrialsgov ndhowever it is eaully important to underline that thalidomide can cause some adverse effects such as severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death even with a single dose if taken during pregnancy boylen et al 1963besides this molecule may also induce severe hepatotoxicity hamadani et al 2007 hanje et al 2006systemic glucocorticoids are currently contraindicated in sars-cov-2 infection as they can slow viral clearance russell et al 2020observational studies showed a delay in viral clearance from the respiratory tract that is associated with some complications including psychosis ed hyperglycemia by using corticosteroid combinations in patients with sars and mers arabi et al 2018 stockman et al 2006furthermore a meta-analysis of 10 observational studies with 6548 patients with pneumonia published in 2019 found that corticosteroids were associated with an increased risk of mortality and about two times greater risk of secondary infections ni et al 2019whether methylprednisolone administration may or may not help suppress unwanted immune reactions is still a controversial topic therefore studies have been launched to investigate and assess their efficacy and safety methylprednisolone in particularthe rationale for the use of corticosteroids lies in their inhibitory action against the production of t cells t lymphocytes and the release of pro-inflammatory interleukins such as il-2 il-1 il-6 and il-12 but also tnf-alpha the

are glycosaminoglycans obtained by the fractionation of heparin they are used in the prophylaxis of post-surgical venous thromboembolism and non-surgical patients with acute pathology and reduced mobilitya chinese retrospective analysis of 415 cases of severe hospitalized covid-19 patients suggested that in subjects with coagulation activation administration of unfractionated or lmwh heparin for at least one week could lead to a greater chance of survival the positive therapeutic effect would be evident only in those patients who show a high level of d-dimer 6 times of the maximum values or a high score on a scale of sepsis-induced coagulopathy sic score 4more hemorrhagic adverse events were observed in heparin-treated patients with normal d-dimer values siddiqi and mehra 2020this study presents an important series of limits but it represents the only cognitive element available we have at present regarding lmwh for covid-19the use of lmwh in covid-19 patients can be applied only in subjects with 46 times higher levels than normal or a sic score 4 since this indication is based on preliminary evidence this use may be considered after a careful case-by-case evaluation onlyit is also important to remember that this retrospective study indicates that not only would patients who do not show equal levels of clotting activation not benefit from the administration of heparin but their clinical condition could even get worse mcgonagle et al 2020low molecular weight heparins are currently under investigation in some interventional randomized phase-3 trials table 1 in adults with moderatesevere covid-19 or covid-19 hospitalized patientsthe evidence on the therapeutic use of lmwh in covid-19 patients is incomplete and with important concerns regarding safety

improve the survival rate of patients with acute respiratory syndromes of viral etiology to provide immediate immunity to the patient mair-jenkins et al 2015zhang et al have shown that sars-cov-2 convalescent plasma contains ab neutralizing against the virus involved zhang et al 2005some preliminary studies carried out in china and south korea on a sample of 27 patients aged between 28 and 75 years reported good results after performing the convalescent plasma transfusion cpt zhang and liu 2020the cpt protocols studied in these trials were different and vary from a minimum of a single dose of 200 ml of convalescent plasma with neutralizing antibody titers 1 640 to a maximum of 2400 ml duan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020all patients in these studies received cpt between day 6 and day 50

of participants the dosage of cpt and duration of therapy etcsome clinical trials are in progress on samples of 10100 patients treated with plasma infusions from 300 ml to 500 ml in a time interval of up to 4 h clinicaltrialsgov ndcurrently there is not enough scientific evidence available on the effectiveness of the use of autoimmune plasma evidence that can be provided by the results of the ongoing trialsthanks to the sequencing of the viral genome of sars-cov-2 multiple nucleic acid vaccines are being tested focusing on the specific sequence that codes for the viral s proteinthe mrna

clinicaltrialsgov ndthe simple structure of nucleic acids avoids the risk of incorrect folding which instead could occur in recombinant protein-based vaccines sheahan et al 2020however the way of administration the interval between administrations and the quantity supplied in genetic vaccines are key factors and therefore these will be investigated carefully as they may significantly influence the immunogenicity of this kind of vaccine sheahan et al 2020the vaccine developed by oxford university is composed of a non-replicating adenovirus vector the fact of not being replicant makes the vaccine safer in children and in people with pre-existing diseases it is currently undergoing clinical trials nct04324606 clinicaltrialsgov ndnonavax is developing a vaccine based on nanoparticles

work first of all as per the literature analysis this was carried out only on 3 search engines pubmed embase and cochrane library using just certain specific keywords this method may exclude some papersbesides the importance and the necessity to discover a new system to fight the novel coronavirus means that there are daily news updates and publications that cannot be considered for practical reasons in this publication some studies in progress at this moment may be completed at the time of publication of this manuscriptdue to the lack of large-sample randomized clinical trials small sample studies have also been includedhowever this work is aimed to be a general reference point and to provide an overview as comprehensive as possible regarding the main clinical trials in progress at the momentthe covid-19 pandemic represents the largest global public health crisis of this century we present an overview of the possible therapeutic options currently under investigation and the future perspectives of this disease the current clinical studies that were quickly launched at the beginning of the pandemic and were underway in april 2020 are summarized most of them are based on the administration of therapeutic agents previously used for other pathological conditionsthese agents can be divided into two broad categories 1 those that can directly interfere with the virus replication cycle and 2 those based on immunotherapeutic approaches aimed at modulating immune responsesalthough vaccines and antibodies targeting sars-cov-2 are under study these still require careful evaluation of efficacy and safety therefore to date drug therapy is the only available approach for a rapid response to the pandemicat present some of them have already shown promising results in preliminary studies and were approved for wider use however no effective therapy has been identified yet therefore no standard therapeutic protocol is availablesince the beginning of the pandemic some news and social media have disseminated incorrect information about covid-19 and possible therapies orso et al 2020 the internet is an excellent source of data but anyone can share and disseminate incorrect information that can endanger peoples health this should be seriously considered by the competent authorities kadam and atre 2020 rovetta and bhagavathula 2020 waszak et al 2018it is imperative that all actors involved in the fight against coronavirus follow the findings of scientific research and not be misled by information without scientific basissome medicines presented some activity against covid-19 however there is no reliable evidence on prognosis and safety in order to find a safe and effective therapeutic protocol or vaccine as soon as possible

interestscoronavirus belongs to the coronaviridae family nidovirales order the name of the genus corona means crown as the virus appears with crown-like projections on its surface in the late 1960s it was first isolated from patients suffering from common cold named as b814 and visualized under an electron microscope1 the subgroups of coronavirus family include alpha  beta  gamma  and delta  the key reservoirs of the virus are bats palm civets livestock and animals these viruses were assumed to transmit infection only among animals till the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in the year 2002 in guangdong china2 later there was an outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers in the middle eastern countries3 coronavirus is a single-stranded positive-sense rna virus enveloped e-protein with club-shapedpear-shapedpetal-shaped glycoprotein projections s-protein the virus is spherical or pleomorphic with 80120 nm size the spikes are made of hemagglutinin-esterase the s protein mediates the viral attachment and entry to endoplasmic reticulum4in december 2019 there occurred a novel coronavirus coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 outbreak in wuhan china this outbreak was thought to have originated from the hunan seafood market at wuhan in china the patients presented with pneumonia of unknown etiology and had a history of travel to the seafood market gradually the number of cases began to rise and few patients had no travel history to seafood market indicating a possible human-to-human transmission5 sars-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 retains the classic coronavirus structure like the presence of spike protein and expression of other nucleoproteins polyproteins and membrane proteins such as rna polymerase 3-chymotrypsin-like protease papain-like protease helicase glycoprotein and accessory proteins6the outbreak was declared as a public health emergency of international concern by the who on january 30 2020 and as a pandemic on march 11 2020 as of april 28 2020 there are 29 lakh confirmed cases worldwide with 2 lakh confirmed deaths the united states have the highest number of confirmed cases7 the first case of covid-19 in india was reported on january 30 2020 with origin from china as of april 29 2020 there are 22629 active cases in india with 1007 deaths8 keeping in mind the increasing number of covid-19 cases in india india observed a 14 h janata curfew on march 22 2020 as insisted by our honorable prime minister narendra modi later the pm of india announced a nationwide lockdown for 21 days on march 24 2020 so as to break the chain of transmission and the lockdown was then extended till may 3sars-cov-2 a type of beta-cov is accountable for 510 of acute respiratory tract infections around 2 of the population are believed to be healthy carriers of the novel coronavirus9 the exponential rise in the number of cases reflected human-to-human transmission infection is spread through droplets produced by symptomatic patients while coughing and sneezing as well as by asymptomatic patients who may later develop symptoms10 the virus can persist in the aerosols for nearly 3 h and was detected up to 72 h after application on different surfaces the virus remains more stable on stainless steel and plastic when compared to copper and plastic however a decline in their infectious titer was observed11 hence transmission can also occur if one comes into contact with such contaminated surfaces and then touches mouth nose and eyesgiven the fact that fecal excretion takes place in case of both sars-cov and mers it may also be possible that sars-cov-2 is also transmitted through this route12 it has been reported that patients suffering from sars-cov-2 infection have gastrointestinal symptoms and some patients have the presence of viral rna in feces or even infectious virus this might suggest that feco-oral transmission might also be a route of transmission of sars-cov-2 in china out of ten pediatric patients suffering from covid-19 no one required intensive care or respiratory support but eight patients out of ten had positive rectal swabs for sars-cov-2 even after negative nasopharyngeal tests13 in another study 39 patients had a positive sars-cov-2 rna test in stool samples out of 73 patients in addition 17 patients still had a positive stool sample even after negative respiratory samples this could conclude that asymptomatic patients might shed virus which can possibly infect many other healthy individuals1415the spike protein anchors to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace 2 receptors situated in lungs vascular beds and kidney and gains entry into the host cell as both the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 outbreaks occurred in china it can be speculated that asians might be more prone to this infection however chen et al showed that the expression of ace2 is similar in asians and other races and increases with an increase in age but not related with sex16 hence till date there exists no data to suggest any correlation between ethnicity and susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infectionsimilar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 binds to ace2 cell receptor expressed by epithelial cells of lung intestine kidney and blood vessels and gains entry into the host cell majority of the patients in india suffer from diabetes mellitus and hypertension and most of them are on ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor blockers arbs consequently this will result in an upregulation of ace217as a result theoretically this would facilitate the infection with covid-19 however there is no robust evidence regarding the use of ace inhibitors and susceptibility to covid-19in contrast to the above hypothesis a study by meng et al showed that reninangiotensin system inhibitors improved the clinical outcomes in covid-19 patients with hypertension in this study acei and arb therapies attenuated the inflammatory response as evidenced by a decline in interleukin-16 il-16 levels in addition an increase in cd3 and cd8 t cell counts in peripheral blood and decrease in the peak viral load were observed18severe disease outcomes were observed in patients with diabetes mellitus hypertension chronic kidney diseases and coronary artery diseases who were most probably on ace inhibitors and arbs10hence with the current evidence we cannot exactly conclude the role of these drugs in covid-19 patientssars-cov-2 infection patients present with a wide range of symptoms from asymptomatic cases to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards septic shock and multiorgan failure in mild-to-moderate cases patients usually present with fever cough sore throat malaise headache shortness of breath and tachypnea in severe cases patients may suffer from pneumonia acute respiratory symptoms and septic shock patients with comorbidities are known to have high case fatality rate19laboratory findings include lymphopenia elevated prothrombin time lactate dehydrogenase creatine kinase and c-reactive protein patients also showed abnormal findings suggestive of myocardial renal or hepatic injury20 elevated ils and tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf- levels are usually observed in critically ill patients10as covid-19 has been declared a pandemic every case presenting with any of the symptoms discussed earlier or a travel history to any of the affected countries or a history of any contact with infected persons should raise a suspicion of infection with sars-cov-2 the who recommends sample collection in the form of expectorated sputum endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage real-time-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test is used for the detection of viral rna sometimes if the test is negative but a strong suspicion of covid-19 is present then the test has to be repeated for confirmation21a developing country like india may face a problem of limited number of supply of kits and testing facilities the rna-based molecular labs need restrictive biosafety levels and expertise the methods are expensive and also time-consuming hence testing can be performed in only selected centres where well equipped laboratories and expertise are available the suspected patients have to wait for the confirmation of their report during which they might infect others the actual number of confirmed cases can be underestimated if the number of testing performed is lowanother issue with the nucleic acid tests is regarding their sensitivity and specificity sometimes rt-pcr tends to give false-positive and false-negative results22 according to the current guidelines a person can be considered as cured only if he is tested negative twice 24 h apart by rt-pcr apart from the technical challenges false results can also be generated because of the deletions and mutations in the sars-cov-2 genome which tend to occur during evolution therefore there exists a need for serological tests which can be performed in any hospital and at a faster rateevidence from the previous sars epidemic reveal that serological responses including virus-specific immunoglobulin immunoglobulin m and immunoglobulin g can permit for serological diagnosis23 it was shown that patients with covid-19 also exhibited similar acute serological responses5 the testing capacity with 96-well microplate and automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa devices is greatly enhanced with a faster turnaround time of 23 h hence the serological tests can test a large number of samples in a short span which is the need of the hour however there could be an issue that antigen used in elisa might cross react with antibodies against other human coronaviruses causing common cold this cross reactivity may affect the sensitivity and specificity of the test results another issue of concern is asymptomatic individuals who can still infect the people being exposed to them hence there is an immense need of rapid viral detection tests such tests can be employed as a part of sero-epidemiological studies thereby helping us to know about the actual burden of the infection table 1repurposing of already-approved agents for a different medical condition is an effective strategy as it saves considerable amount of time money and resources sarma et al have also discussed few potential therapeutic options for treating sars-cov-2 infection26 discovering the target exploration of the signaling pathways or the mechanism of action are few key steps involved in drug repurposing where the role of a pharmacologist is quite essential as the safety efficacy and toxicity data of the agents being explored are already available the cost of drug development and time taken are minimized27 the requirements of the regulatory agencies are the key factors in determining the production of repurposed drugs in the united states there are three possible regulatory pathways namely section 505b1 section 505b2 or section 505j though only one out of them which is section 505b2 applies to drug repurposing2728 a supplemental new drug application must be submitted if slight modifications are to be made to the already-approved agent28 the drug repositioning approval process in europe can be submitted through three different paths centralized decentralized or national in europe article 10 of directive 200183ec provides the principal legal framework for repurposed drug applications on an average approval of new indications for a drug takes ema 6 months longer than the food and drug administration fda27it is desirable to accelerate the development of therapeutic agents for serious medical conditions particularly if these agents are the first treatment available or if the benefits of the new drug are more than that of the currently available agents in the market four different yet effective strategies have been established by the fda for providing the access to these agents as quickly as possible priority review breakthrough therapy accelerated approval and fast track process bearing in mind that the expected therapeutic benefit of a drug may take an excessive amount of time the fda introduced the accelerated approval regulations in 1992 the fda approved these drugs quickly based upon the surrogate end points29 surrogate end points are meant to substitute for a clinical endpoint and using these end points a drug approval process can be shortened considerably30during the ebola outbreak in 2014 the fda sought to help speed up the production and delivery of medical items for containing the epidemic the fda approach to the ebola outbreak in 2014 demonstrates the vast array of resources and versatility in regulatory procedures that allowed it to act fairly and quickly during the epidemic earlier fast-track process was used to counter bioterror risks pandemic risks and for neglected medical conditions this fast-track status was provided to therapeutic agents which were to be used against ebola tkm-ebola in 2014 and zmapp in 201531 the nipah virus outbreak in may 2018 in india was met with a rapid response by the government as there are no agents for this infection the state government of kerala engaged with the department of health in queensland australia for getting the monoclonal antibody m1024 for treating the patients32 the indian council of medical research icmr collaborated with the australian authorities for fast-tracking the acquisition and facilitating the regulatory approvals33 hence the ultimate goal is to make the newer therapeutic agents available to the patients as early as possible getting a fast-track status will be a very significant achievement and through the communication channels which are enhanced between the company and the fda the issues regarding the drug are addressed rapidly thus contributing to faster approvals and early access for the patients31 the regulatory bodies and the sponsor should be working closely for ensuring that no therapeutic agent which has the potential for benefitting the patients in the times of urgency are stuck as it might lead to a calamity-like situationas of march 30 2020 the drug controller general of india has issued a notice to all the stakeholders of india regarding the conduct of clinical trial during an outbreak of covid-19 a clinical trial involving a new drug is regulated under the new drugs and clinical trials rules ndct 2019 a clinical trial should be conducted according to the approved clinical trial protocol and adhere to good clinical trial practices guidelines in case of an outbreak like covid-19 there might be various challenges in the conduct of the trial in such cases the central drugs standard control organisation cdsco states that the sponsor in coordination with the investigator and respective ethics committee should make a decision whether to continue the ongoing clinical trial or not the safety well-being and protection of the rights of trial participants is of utmost importance keeping in mind these things any reason for protocol amendmentsdeviations should be maintained and a copy of the same is to be submitted to the concerned cdsco headquartershydroxychloroquine hcq being a less toxic derivative of chloroquine cq has shown a better activity against sars-cov-2 in in vitro and a better antiviral activity compared to cq3435 a study by gautret et al showed that hcq reduced the viral load significantly in sars-cov-2 infections combination of hcq and azithromycin showed a better reduction in viral load when compared to hcq alone36 however small sample size is one of the limitations of this study hcq is known to cause qt prolongation37 and azithromycin has also shown to have pro-arrhythmic potential38 the combination of these two therapies is questionable due to the absence of a strong evidence regarding the safety of this combination there is a need of generating data regarding the safety profile recently the icmr has issued guidelines regarding the use of hcq as chemoprophylaxis for sars-cov2 infection the use of hcq has not been advised for the general population but only for high-risk cases like health-care workers who come into direct contact with suspected or confirmed cases and asymptomatic household contacts of covid-19-positive patients the ministry has also advised the household contacts of positive cases to remain in home quarantine in addition to hcq prophylaxis39 a recently conducted meta-analysis has shown that hcq is associated with less number of patients having radiological progression but the author concluded that more data is required to come to a definitive conclusion40in a randomized controlled trial favipravir has shown some benefit in sars-cov-2 infection in terms of clinical recovery rate and effective reduction in the incidence of symptoms except few antiviral-related side effects41 even remdesivir an antiviral drug has been tried in sars-cov-2 infection sars-cov shares 82 rna sequence identity with sars-cov-2 and their rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp shares 96 sequence identity42 hence drugs that target viral rdrp proteins of sars-cov may probably be useful against sars-cov-2recently remdesivir was found to be effective against sars-cov-2 infection at the stage after virus entry into vero e6 cells thereby exhibiting its antiviral activity43a cohort of severe covid-19 hospitalized patients with the compassionate use of remdesivir showed a clinical improvement in 36 out of 53 patients nevertheless results of the ongoing randomized controlled trials involving remidesivir therapy are required to elucidate the drug efficacy in sars-cov-2 infection44currently clinical trials are ongoing to assess the effect of remdesivir in sars-cov-2 infection nct04302766 nct04280705 nct04315948 nct04314817 nct04292899 and nct04292730 some of these trials are also evaluating the effect of other treatment options along with remdesivir45ribavarin an antiviral drug is generally given in combination with interferons ifns and it has shown to be synergistic with any of the two ifn ifn- or ifn--1a the drug has shown mixed results when studied in patients with other coronaviruses in addition to it the drug exhibits a side effect such as anemia especially at the dose of  8003600 mgday tested for mers4647 this may be an unwanted adverse effect in patients suffering from respiratory disorders hence may not be a better option in sars-cov-2 infectionlopinavir and ritonavir were found to be effective against sars-cov in in vitro studies48 the main action of ritonavir is to prolong the plasma half-life of lopinavir via the inhibition of cyp p450 recently a randomized controlled trial conducted in china to evaluate the effect of combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in addition to standard care in severe covid-19 patients failed to demonstrate any beneficial effect when compared to standard care alone49 however the possible benefit of the combination cannot be excluded as the study included severely ill patients which might have failed to demonstrate efficacy against sars-cov-2 infectionbaricitinib is a janus kinase inhibitor which has already got fda approval for treating moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis patients nonresponsive to tnf inhibitor therapies ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 is a known regulator of endocytosis and the entry of most of the viruses is dependent on the receptor mediator endocytosis hence the disruption of aak1 may block the virus entry into the cells baricitinib has shown to inhibit aak1 with therapeutic dosing and may be a promising therapy for the patients50 the trials are underway where baricitinib is being given in covid-19 patients nct04320277 nct04321993it is believed to modulate the activity of terminal complement to inhibit the formation of membrane attack complex therefore it is believed to be beneficial in patients with ardslung injury51 a trial is ongoing for evaluating eculizumab in covid-19 patients nct04288713in a study by huang et al out of the 41 covid-19 patients admitted six died from ards ards is believed to be one of the main causes of death in covid-1910 cytokine storm is one of the proposed mechanisms for ards it is characterized by the release of large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn- ifn- il-12 il-1 il-18 il-33 il-6 tnf- transforming growth factor-beta etc and chemokines ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 cxcl8 cxcl9 cxcl10 etc by immune effector cells52 the trigger in immune response attacks the body leading to ards and multiorgan failure ultimately death in sars-cov-2 infection53 with previous experience of sars outbreak the chief pathogenesis of organ dysfunction is cytokine dysregulation the same is noted even in case of worsening of sars-cov-2-infected individuals characterized by a decline in peripheral lymphocyte counts and elevated cytokines indicative of a triggered immune response10an open-label nonrandomized study by bellingan et al showed that intravenous ifn beta-1a fp1201 lowered mortality day 28 in patients with ards54 however ifn-associated adverse effects cost and intravenous dosage form would pose major challenges in an outbreak currently a clinical trial is ongoing to assess the safety and efficacy of recombinant human ifn-1 in covid-19 patients in wuhan nct04293887 another trial is being carried out to evaluate the effect of combination of lopinavirritonavir ribavirin and ifn beta-1b in sars-cov-2 infection nct04276688stem cell therapy has attenuated systemic inflammation in phase iii clinical trial in rheumatoid arthritis patients in covid-19 inflammation is one of the driving forces for disease progression therefore there is an immense need to regulate the immune system as quickly as possible a phase ii single-arm nonrandomized study of covid-19 patients 50 years with preexisting comorbid conditions or at high exposure risk has been approved55the fda has approved for the commencement of phase 23 trial for moderate-to-severe ards induced by covid-19 as previous phase iii clinical trials have already assessed therapy in ards56corticosteroids were quite commonly used during the previous two sars and mers outbreaks5758 in addition during the current outbreak of sars-cov-2 corticosteroids are being used along with other agents1059 in both the previous outbreaks histology revealed inflammatory changes and diffuse alveolar damage associated with the infection60 hence corticosteroids might play a role in suppressing the inflammation but in addition they can also hinder the immune response and clearance of pathogens59 just four studies presented definitive evidence in a meta-analysis of corticosteroid use in sars patients all suggesting harm to the patient57 in a retrospective observational study involving mers patients it was found that patients receiving corticosteroids were at higher risk of requiring mechanical ventilation and also it led to delay in viral rna clearance58 the health-care professionals must carefully assess the benefit versus the risks before attempting to use corticosteroids for patients with covid-19 and sepsis there is a small decrease in mortality rate with the use of corticosteroids but the possibility that these agents might prolong the shedding of virus in respiratory tract as with mers patients cannot be ruled out61 there is no conclusive data to determine that corticosteroids might help patients with sars-cov-2 infection in fact corticosteroids might do more harm than good methylprednisolone is being evaluated in a non-randomized open-label clinical trial for evaluating the efficacy in covid-19 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome nct04323592according to a previous study by zhou et al teicoplanin is believed to inhibit cleavage of the viral spike protein by cathepsin l at low ph thereby halting viral replication cycle by precluding the release of genomic mrna on comparing the cleavage site of cathepsin l in sars-cov-2 with sars-cov they observed that it was well preserved62 the authors then produced a 2019-ncov pseudovirus whose entry was inhibited by teicoplanin hence teicoplanin could act as a dual inhibitor in treating sars-cov-2 infection and co-infection with gram-positive bacteria63an in vitro study by caly et al showed that ivermectin a broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent was able to reduce viral replication up to  5000 fold decrease in viral rna at 48 h in sars-cov-2-infected vero-hslam cells64 the postulated mechanism is probably by inhibiting imp1-mediated nuclear import of viral proteins as observed with other rna viruses65 this increases the likelihood that ivermectin can also be one of the potential therapeutic options against sars-cov-2 infection nevertheless further studies in clinical settings are essential to arrive at a definitive conclusiona systematic review by prajapat et al has highlighted upon seven major targets and 16 nonstructural proteins which can be taken into consideration as targets for drug development66recently an in silico study has identified two potential hits one of them being a theophylline derivative and the other a pyrimidine derivative as inhibitors of rna binding to n terminal domain of n protein67 however these compounds need in vitro validation in futureit is been more than a century convalescent plasma therapy cp has been used for the treatment and prevention of several infectious diseases68 the basic principle of this therapy is getting the plasma from a recovered patient if having high titers of neutralizing antibodies in a patient battling the infection it can be transfused serving as reinforcement for the immune system the who had also recommended the use of convalescent plasma as an empirical therapy during the outbreaks obtained from recovered patients suffering from ebola69 in a cohort study of the h1n1-infected patients the mortality was significantly reduced with the use of plasma therapy and there was a decrease in the respiratory tract viral load70 this therapy was also associated with higher discharge rate in patients suffering from sars71 a meta-analysis of 32 studies of sars and influenza showed that there was reduction of mortality associated with plasma therapy however the studies included were not of high quality72in a recent study by duan et al ten patients who were suffering from severe covid-19 were given convalescent plasma 200 ml obtained from the recovered patients with the titers of neutralizing antibodies 1640 all the patients enrolled in the study met the primary and secondary end points such as safety after the transfusion and improvement in clinical symptoms along with the radiological and laboratory parameters within 3 days after the transfusion all the patients received the standard of care and other antiviral medications so there might be a possibility that these medications contributed to the desired effect68 nevertheless the results of this study are promising and more well-designed studies with more number of patients are required to come to a definitive conclusion the icmr has also given its nod to kerala state government for conducting the trials for convalescent plasma therapyin its campaign to control and eliminate sars-cov-2 traditional chinese medicine tcm is highly regarded by the china government around 85 of the patients are on tcm therapy along with the conventional treatment for sars-cov-2 infection73 the use of tcm in sars-cov-2-infected patients is mainly due to the use of such therapies during the previous sars outbreak where there was a dramatic decrease in fatality rate in shanghai which was attributed to the use of tcm therapies7374 tcm treatment was found to be effective in sars-cov-infected patients75 as well as improvement of the adverse effects of conventional therapies7677 many of the studies evaluating the efficacy of tcm in sars patients were of poor quality78 therefore currently ongoing trials evaluating the efficacy of tcm in covid-19 patients should take all these points into consideration in order to generate a robust evidencethe ministry of ayush in its advisory for the prevention of coronavirus recommended the use of arsenicum album 30 as a prophylactic agent against sars-cov-2 one dose of arsenicum album 30 for 3 days empty stomach was advised by the ministry however no scientific evidence is present to show that this agent has efficacy against sars-cov-2 other ayurvedic measures which have been advised are consumption of agastya harityaki samshamani vati tulasi leaves trikatu and pratimarsa nasya as prophylactic measures many unani medicines have also been mentioned for coronavirus infections such as sharbat unnab tiryaq arba and tiryaq nazla among many others79 nevertheless the use of such drugs is controversial with little supporting evidenceuntil now no vaccine has been approved for preventing the infection with sars-cov-2 however clinical trials have been initiated for five vaccine candidates80 one of these candidates is mrna-1273 vaccine being developed by the scientists of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and it was one of the earliest candidates which entered into clinical trials this phase i trial is a nonrandomized open-label study with an estimated sample size of 45 participants nct04283461 another vaccine candidate being developed by cansino biological inc in collaboration with the beijing institute of biotechnology based on a nonreplication viral vector vaccine technology which was formerly used in the development of ebola virus vaccine has entered into phase ii of clinical trials81 there are three other vaccine candidates which have entered into clinical trials and another 71 vaccine candidates are undergoing preclinical testing80 although the requirement of a vaccine is the need of the hour and governments all over the world are desperately waiting for approval of the vaccine it should not mean that the vaccines should be approved even before their safety and efficacy is evaluated fully in experimental or clinical studies hastening of the development of the vaccines without proper evaluation may be of no value82an epidemiological study by miller et al has also shown that countries without universal policy for bacillus calmettegurin bcg vaccination have shown an increased risk of morbidity and mortality with covid-19 when compared to countries with universal bcg vaccination policy they also found that countries that have established bcg vaccination policy earlier showed a decline in the number of deaths per million inhabitants83 in a study by moorlag et al bcg vaccination has shown to be protective against viral infection and sepsis84 hence there can be a possibility that bcg might confer some protection against covid-19 as observed by the epidemiological study83 however there is no evidence that bcg vaccination boosts up immunity in the elderly it is also contraindicated in the immunocompromised and pregnant women therefore high-level evidence such as randomized controlled trials are essential to explore the role of bcg vaccination in covid-19 table 2as there is no specific treatment against covid-19 till date preventive measures play a crucial role at health-care level as well as community level in fighting against this pandemic many health-care workers have been affected across the world even the doctor who first raised an alarm against this outbreak in china is no more protection of health-care workers is important to avoid the spread of infection among colleagues and to other patients they should be provided with personal protection equipment ppe such as n95 masks protective suits and goggles similar to other covs sars-cov-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat in addition these viruses can be inactivated by lipid solvents such as ether 75 ethanol chlorine-comprising disinfectant peroxyacetic acid and chloroform except for chlorhexidine21the infected person should be isolated in a separate room special care has to be taken while performing procedures such as intubation suction and tracheostomy regular decontamination of the equipment preferably with sodium hypochlorite is recommended careful monitoring of all the close contacts is essential to check for covid-19 symptoms a patient is said to have recovered only when heshe tests negative twice by pcr done at 24 h intervalat the community level people should wear masks maintain social distancing and follow proper hand hygiene measures suspects patients and their families should be educated regarding the disease and instructed to follow the guidelines strictly so as to prevent the spread of disease in the community they should be educated to cover their mouth with tissue paper or handkerchief whenever they sneeze or cough as this would generate multiple droplets carrying virus repeated hand washing with soap and water or use of sanitizer is also critical avoid public gatherings and unnecessary travel to covid-19-hit areas special care should be taken even in case of immunocompromised patients as there are chances of them having severe disease outcomes hence they should avoid public exposure unless it is an emergency avoid close contact with pets as there were few cases reported by media where the animals tested positive for covid-19the who has also recommended of collaboration with private and academic sectors for laboratory testing and if possible the setup of mobile laboratories for testing in remote areas89 india can also develop strategies such as singapores disease outbreak response system condition dorscon in order to fight against the pandemic dorscon was drafted in singapore for the crisis management after the outbreak of sars in 2003 and swine flu h1n1 pandemic in 2009 dorscon is a color-coded framework that provides us information about the present disease situation it takes into consideration about the disease severity and spread to predict its impact on the community90 india being a developing nation and the second most populous country can fight the pandemic successfully only if each one of us follow the preventive measures strictly media reports of the suspectedconfirmed cases of covid-19 fleeing from airports hospitals not being in quarantine though asked to do so and violence against the health-care professionals would only lead to more burden on the health-care system and then it will be very difficult to contain this pandemicethics preparedness is the ability of the public health system to safeguard and swiftly respond keeping in mind an ethical framework that would build trust and escort with measures to recuperate from public health emergencies the most recent version of the national ethical guidelines for biomedical and health research involving human participants was launched in october 2017 for the very first time a separate section has been included which talks about research during humanitarian emergencies and disaster conditions91 these guidelines include the actions taken to ensure the safety and dignity of the affected population and prevent any stigmatization toward the affected individual however the burden of the outbreak is to be notified by public health authorities during such outbreaks the ethics committee can conduct unscheduled meetings either through video conference or teleconference even if physical presence would not be possible within a given timeframeresearch requiring ethics preparedness during an outbreak involves details about the epidemiology of the disease hostvector description validation of diagnostics potential treatment strategies along with safety and efficacy data preventive measures to be undertaken storage and transportation of biological samples teamwork at either regionalnationalinternational levels as well as publicprivate sectors and lastly monitoring of all these in order to obtain a rewarding result robust ethical review should be carried out by the ethics committee during an emergency informed consent is a must if any clinical trial is to be conducted and the participant should be able to read and understand it well in case of infectious disease outbreak patients need to be quarantined in such a situation apart from the routine standard care and treatment the patient has to be given supportive care so that heshe is able to overcome the mental stress disclosure of patient information to any unauthorized person is not at all acceptable under the drugs and cosmetics act 1940 the ndct rules was launched in march 2019 which includes provisions to permit fast-track approval process for the usage of unapproved drugs during public health emergencies92crucial areas of ethics preparedness during an outbreak such as sars-cov-2 infections have been discussed below building public trust by maintaining transparency accountability maintaining their societal value and proper communication with the patients and representatives are of utmost importance in addition to it the community has to be educated regarding the outbreak mode and rate of transmission and preventive measures such as maintaining social distancing and hand hygiene in order to prevent the rapid spread of infection every measure should be taken at the earliest to prevent community transmission people should be informed and educated regarding the false information floating in various social media platforms the who and icmr have been playing an important role in educating people regarding covid-19 by drafting guidelines and answering to frequently asked questions by the general public media has also a major role to play in providing correct information about the ongoing disease in the country and across the globe apart from protecting the public rights ethics preparedness should also take into consideration the safety of the health-care workers or any frontline workers they should be provided with ppe as they come into contact with the patients while treating them it is the responsibility of every citizen of india to follow the rules laid down to fight against this pandemic therefore ethics preparedness ensures standard of care in all the aspects without compromising on human safety and ethical values in order to deal during public health emergenciesnilthere are no conflicts of interestseveral antiretroviral drugs are being considered for use in the treatment of covid19 the disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus sarscov2 protease inhibitors have been considered as candidate therapy because they inhibit enzymes that activate envelope glycoproteins as part of the process of viral entry into cells 1 the use of lopinavirritonavir lpvr has been supported by data from in vitro studies animal models and positive clinical outcomes when lpvr was given to patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers diseases also caused by coronaviruses 2 3 4 5 other antiretrovirals have been proposed based on virtual screening and in vitro studies and several clinical trials are planned lopinavirritonavir lpvr is included in rapid guidance issued by researchers from wuhan university based on clinical use during prior epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and mers coronavirus cov infections 6this systematic review summarizes the clinical outcomes of using antiretroviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of coronaviruses and planned

design that reported clinical outcome data was included and there were no language restrictions clinicaitrialsgov and chictrorgcn were searched for ongoing and completed trials data are summarized per study but not pooled in metaanalysis due to the limited number of studies reporting outcomes for each disease the review was conducted by a single reviewer nf with data extraction validated by a second reviewer ar the quality or certainty of the evidence was assessed using the grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation grade approach 12from an initial screen of 433 titles two randomized controlled trials and 21 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treatment and 3 studies reported outcomes for prevention three studies were excluded one because cause of infection was unclear 13 one because the original study was retracted during the conduct of this systematic review 14 and one because lamivudine was given to control chronic hepatitis b infection and its use could not be linked to sars outcomes 15 among the included studies the majority reported outcomes using lpvr as treatment two two studies reported outcomes among hivpositive individuals who were on a combination antiretroviral drugs for management of hiv 16 17characteristics of included studies and patient outcomes are summarized in table 1two observational studies and one case report among patients with sars 2 17 18 reported outcomes of patients who were given antiretrovirals a study from china reported a reduction in mortality in patients receiving lpvr of 23 95 ci 0 to 68 compared to matched controls 156 98 to 228 2 a second study from china reported that none of the 41 patients given lpvr died compared with seven of 111 patients in the control group 18 the third study also from china was a case report of a 30yearold hivpositive man who recovered he was receiving abacavir efavirenz tenofovir and lpvr as antiretroviral therapy 17 all patients also received ribavirin and steroids of varying dose and durationsix observational studies including two retrospective observational studies 3 21 and four case reports 16 19 20 22  one was from greece one from austria two from saudi arabia and two from the republic of korea  provided data on patients diagnosed with mers there were 42 deaths among 165 patients who were given lpvr together with other interventions including ribavirin and pegylated interferonone randomized controlled openlabel study reported on the efficacy and safety of lpvr for treating hospitalized adults with severe covid19 23 in this trial 99 patients received lpvr 400100 mg twice a day median time between symptom onset and randomization 13 days and 100 patients received standard care for 14 days lpvr was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement 28 day mortality was numerically lower in the lpvr group 1499 compared to the control group 25100 but this difference was not statistically significant in the intentiontotreat analysis accelerated clinical recovery and reduced mortality were observed in those treated within 12 days of symptom onset but not in those treated later almost half of patients in the lpvr group 46 patients 484 and control group 49 patients 467 reported one or more adverse events gastrointestinalrelated complaints including nausea vomiting and diarrhoea were more common in the lopinavirritonavir group a second randomized trial assessed patients admitted to hospital with mildmoderate covid19 and compared outcomes of 21 patients given lpvr 200mg50mg twice a day with 16 patients given ardibol and 7 patients who were not given any antiviral therapy 24 in this trial lpvr did not show any benefit in terms of time to viral clearance pcr negativity or progression to severe disease for both trials certainty of the evidence was low due to risk of bias investigators not blinded to the intervention and imprecisionin the observational studies three case reports 25 26 27 three case series 28 29 30 and six observational studies 31 32 33 34 35 36 reported outcomes of patients with covid19 who received lpvr nine studies were from china one was from singapore and two from the republic of korea among the 361 patients in the nine studies where outcomes could be associated with receipt of lpvr three patients died one study reported that 53 of 56 patients received lpvr and three patients died however it was unclear how many of the patients who died had received lpvr 31lpvr is recommended by who as part of secondline antiretroviral therapy 37 among people living with hiv receiving lpvr diarrhoea nausea and vomiting are commonly reported side effects at start of treatment 22 these side effects were reported by four out of five individuals who received lpvr for the treatment of covid19 in singapore and only one individual completed the 14day treatment course as a result of adverse events 29the certainty of the evidence for outcomes across these three diseases is very low the sample size was small and only two studies provided comparative outcomes one using historical controls and none used a randomized design to be able to assess the comparative effectiveness of different interventions timing duration and dose of treatment varied and in the majority of studies patients were provided with other interventions which may have contributed to the reported outcomes grade tables are provided in appendix s2three studies reported a possible protective effect of lpvr against coronavirus infection 38 39 40 the first a retrospective observational study from china noted that 0 out of 19 patients hospitalized on same floor as sars patients contracted the disease of the 19 patients 11 were on differing regimens of antiretroviral therapy none received lpvr 38 the second study from south korea retrospectively enrolled health care workers considered at high risk of mers infection of 22 healthcare workers given postexposure prophylaxis pep comprising ribavirin and lpvr none were infected this compared to 9 of 21 healthcare workers not given pep who became infected 39 the third study from china compared characteristics of 8 hivpositive individuals on different antiretroviral regimens who had contracted covid19 infection with 1166 patients who had not been infected 40 no statistically significant relationship was found between type of antiretroviral regimen and infection status the certainty of the evidence across outcomes was again very low due to uncertainty due to limited sample size lack of uniformity of regimens being used to treat patients and lack of information regarding intensity of exposure appendix s2of 85 titles screened 25 registered trials were identified that plan to assess the safety and efficacy of antiretrovirals  20 assessing lpvr including 1 for the treatment of mers and one for sars the rest for covid19 two ritonavir two darunavir and cobicistat and one tenofovir alafenamide fumarate estimated completion dates are from march 2020 to january 2022 appendix s3this systematic review identified two randomized trials and 21 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of lpvr for the treatment of covid19 sars and mers the randomized trials showed no clinical benefit the observational studies were inconclusive and the certainty of the body of evidence across all important outcomes was low or very low based on available evidence it is uncertain whether lpvr and other antiretrovirals improve clinical outcomes in severe symptomatic disease or prevent infection among patients at high risk of acquiring covid19 any differences in potential therapeutic effect of lpvr between sars mers and covid19 may partly be due to different clinical presentations many of the patients had complicated courses including stays in intensive care units and were on multiple concurrent unproven treatmentsseveral randomized trials are planned to assess the safety and efficacy of antiretroviral drugs including lpvr for the treatment of covid19 merscov and sarscov while the conduct of such trials is challenging 41 high quality evidence is needed to improve clinical and programmatic decisions to use antiretroviral drugs for current and future coronavirus outbreaksthe procurement and use of lpvr or other antiretroviral drugs to treat or prevent covid19 infection should take into consideration the need to ensure continued availability for people living with hiv who need lpvr as part of their antiretroviral therapy overuse of lpvr for covid19 in the current epidemic runs a risk of shortage of a drug that is currently used as a second line treatment for people living with hivwho plans to update this review at least monthly throughout 2020 and longer as needed to update the evidence as new studies are completedthe authors have no conflict of interest to declarenf and sn conceived

final versionthe authors alone are responsible for the views expressed in this article and they do not necessarily represent the views of the organizationin wuhan capital of hubei province china in late december 2019 there were clusters of cases with severe pneumonia due to unknown causes most of the initial cases were identified to have common exposure to the huanan seafood market which was involved in selling dead seafood animals and trading of live animals as china had a quick surveillance system after the sars outbreak the patients respiratory samples were sent to reference labs for etiological examinations assessment of the patients for viral pneumonia was done by testing the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid using polymerase chain reaction whole-genome sequencing and cell culturing chinese government notified the world health organization who and meanwhile closed the huanan seafood market on the 1st of january 2020 the number of cases started increasing drastically since then even to those with no exposure to the seafood market thus indicating human to human transmission 7 the first fatality was reported on 11th january this turned out to be an epidemic initially spreading to other countries like thailand south korea and japan as there was massive chinese migration due to chinese new years evethis virus was identified as -cov on 7th january it had 962 homology to bat coronavirus namely ratg13 genome whereas 795 homology to sars coronavirus the samples taken from the surroundings of the huanan market showed positive results for this virus confirming its origin this cov used the same receptor as of sars-cov ie angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace 2 receptor to infect the humans 8 on 12th january who officially named this cov as 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov later on the 11th february who termed the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and csg coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses changed the virus name officially from 2019-ncov to sars-cov-2 due to a lot of similarities with sars-cov 9 10 11 preliminary finding projected the r0 value basic reproduction number for sars-cov 2 in a range from 14 to 65 12 r0 value represents an average of new infections produced by an infectious person in a total population gives the warning for virus transmission with respect to an epidemic ie if r0  1 the infected number could escalate and if r0  1 the transmission will die out soonthe transmission from patients to healthcare workers was seen on 20th january after this wuhan and other cities of hubei province were placed under complete lockdown there were cases of covid-19 in individuals who did not travel to china which further suggested transmission between humans all the domestic and international airports had a screening mechanism in place in order to detect any symptomatic travelers who were kept under quarantine and were allowed to go if they tested negative for the covid-19 test it soon became apparent that the disease could transmit from an asymptomatic person before the commencement of any related symptom all the countries evacuated their respective citizens from wuhan and travelers from china and other affected countries were kept under quarantineisolation for 14 days and went through the covid-19 test on 1st february who declared covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern cases have continued to exponentially increase since then on 11th march who finally acknowledged covid-19 as a pandemic as of april 16th the total coid-19 cases are almost 2 million worldwide it is to be noted that the number of cases has reduced in china with a drastic increase in countries like the usa with 644 lacs cases spain and italy with almost 18 and 16 lacs cases each most of the affected countries have declared a lockdown with travel restrictions of any kind and border control measure taken to control the pandemic and reduce the transmissionmers-cov and sars-cov are considered extremely pathogenic and were transmitted by palm civets or dromedary camels to humans by means of bats the characterization and genomic sequencing of the sars-cov-2 showed that the novel covs was 88 identical to the two earlier reported bat-derived sars-like covs but were different from sars-cov by 79 and mers-cov  by 50 indicating that it evolved from bats but the intermediate source is not yet known the phylogenetic analysis revealed that sars-cov-2 belonged to the genus betacoronavirus and was genetically dissimilar from mers-cov and sars-cov 15 the size of the coronavirus genome varies from approx 26000 to 32000 bases and contains a 6 to 11 number of orfs the first orf that encodes 16 non-structural proteins comprises of approx 67 of the total genome while remaining orf encodes the structural protein and accessory proteins among the four major structural glycoproteins as shown in fig 1
16 spike glycoproteins plays a vital part in binding to the host receptor homology modeling showed that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov enter the lung and utilize the same human cell receptor ie ace-2 despite amino acid variation at key residues while mers-cov enters the host cell via dpp4 17 six mutations arose in the variable sections of the receptor-binding domain rbd of sars-cov-2 but no amino acid replacements were observed in rbd that directly interacts with ace-2 receptors of the host cell 14 receptor affinity analysis claims that the sars-cov strain binds less efficiently than the novel sars-cov-2 strain and further mutation in the nucleotide sequence of rbd may increase its pathogenicity 17 it is uncertain whether higher sars-cov-2 affinity to ace-2 receptor than sars-cov could lead to more severe lung connection this should be further investigated since in vitro studies by inoculating sars-cov-2 in human airway epithelial cells have shown a cytopathic effect with the cessation of cilia movements 18 other than the lung the ace-2 receptors are highly expressed in the small intestine kidney testis and liver hence these organs may also get affected by sars-cov-2 19with comparison to the current clinical characteristics of covid-19 it does not appear to be different from sars and far less lethal than mers even though it spreads in the community at a rapid pace common symptoms include cough sore throat fever and dyspnoea with at least one symptom in all the infected patients however the chinese centre for disease control reports 81 of cases to have mild indications while 12 was asymptomatic 20 research laboratory results do not vary significantly in patients infected with covid-19 than those diagnosed with other covs infections the most common being lymphopenia together with low platelet amount and lower levels of albumin while the levels of creatine kinase aminotransferases lactic dehydrogenases and c-protein increased 21 patients diagnosed with sars-cov-2 and sars-cov had an adverse clinical path with the onset of dyspnoea within 5 days followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome within 30 of the cases within a span of 5 days and need of mechanical ventilation in 17 of the cases due to the abundance of ddp4 receptors in tubules and glomeruli a serious complication for mers appears to be acute kidney injury however it rarely occurs in covid-19 and sars 22 as symptoms commence the viral loads in covid-19 were found to be higher in the nose than in the throat and gradually decrease within days contrary to sars where the maximum shedding is observed after 10 days from onset of indications 2324 through the experiences of the mers and sars epidemics the lessons the world has learned are the finest cultural tools to tackle this novel worldwide dangersars-cov-2 is a positive-sense rna virus with a genome scope of 30 kb consisting of flanking untranslated regions utrs at both 5 and 3 ends the open reading frames orf1a open reading frame and orf1b present at 5 proximal rna genome encodes for a polyprotein which upon proteolytic cleavage results in 16 putative nonstructural proteins nsps such as viral proteases nsp3 cysteine protease and nsp5 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp nsp12 helicase nsp13 and other nsps which are expected to be tangled in the viral transcription and replication the distal portion of the viral genome towards 3 end consists of 12 nested orfs which code for the structural proteins namely spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n and other accessory proteins genome analysis has tremendously helped in gaining more insights about the sars cov-2 sequence analysis revealed a major distinction in spike orf3b and orf 8 regions which were previously reported as recombination hotspots 35 several transcriptional regulatory elements such as stem-loop structures present in 5 and 3 utrs and frameshift elements contribute to the complex transcription and translational properties to the viral rna 36 37 38 39besides understanding about the genetic annotation understanding the sequences in the sub-genomic mrnas and more insight into the secondary structures of the genomic rna would enable in development of genome targeted therapeuticsspike protein is a densely glycosylated class i fusion protein on the surface of virus particles it comprises of a large ectodomain a single-pass transmembrane domain that anchors the protein to lipid bilayer and a small intracellular segment the ectodomain has two subunits s1 and s2 both forming homotrimers the c-terminal functional domain of s1 subunit is involved in receptor binding and s2 subunit includes a fusion peptide hr1 and hr2 hepted repeat 1 and 2 a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain that aids in viral envelope fusion with host cell membrane via the endosomal pathwaythe s protein on the surface of a virus particle is present in a pre-fusion form 40 upon contact with host cell s protein undergo a priming by host cell membrane proteases such as tmprss2 serine protease to induce membrane wrapping and efficient internalization 4142 structural analysis demonstrated that the rbd of sars-cov-2 bound with 10 times advanced affinity to ace-2 than that of sars-cov and in receptor unbound state the s2 domain was more flexible 43 another notable change in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is the presence of the s1s2 furin-like rift spot that is absent in sars-cov several reports suggest that the presence of this proteolytic site increases the pathogenicity of the virus furin like rift spot is also reported to increase the tissue tropism of viruses 4445 so far sars-cov-2 was thought to infect upper respiratory tissue surprisingly a recent report shows the ability of the sars-cov-2 to infect t-lymphocytes also through membrane fusion process 46spike protein being the first contact site between viruses and cells is subjected to tremendous evolutionary pressure any changes in spike protein would have a profound effect on the infectivity and transmission of viruses in the spike protein of the present pandemic sars-cov-2 changes acquired such as furin-like cleavage site structural changes at the receptor binding sites are being correlated for the species jumping and efficient human-to-human transmission the virus is also found to form syncytium which enables virus spreading by cell-cell fusion which might also leads to the rapid infectivity of the sars-cov-2 virus 47the main protease mpro also recognized as 3c-like protease is encoded by nsp5 it is the first protein that is auto-cleaved and it further cleaves the polyprotein into individual members of non-structural proteins at the cleavage site leugln ser ala gly it attains a stable active form as an octamer while its monomer and dimer exist in equilibrium 48 sars-cov-2 shares 96 arrangement resemblance with sars-cov the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 mpro showed that polar amino acids in the dimer interface have been replaced with non-polar ones this mutation has resulted in the increased catalytic activity of the dimer while dimer dissociation constants have remained the same 49 protease is essential for virus proteome production and replication therefore mpro is considered as one of the potential targets to treat covid-19viral replication and transcription of sars cov-2 is carried out by complex protein machinery proteins of this complex are translated from orf1a and orf1b and are the part of large polypeptide chain overall architecture of rdrp complex of sars-cov-2 is found to be analogous to that of sars cov the key constituent of this enzyme complex is rna-dependent rna polymerase nsp12 it forms the complex with other co-factors such as nsp7 and nsp8 and catalyses the development of viral genomic rna the complex has a central groove where template-directed rna synthesis id catalysed the nascent rna strands exit path is positively charged which bring about electrostatic interaction between nascent rna strand and enzyme complex this exit path is also accessible to the solvents 1050rna polymerase unit nsp12 is the promising target to develop viral inhibitors and the promising drug remdesivir which has entered into clinical trials now for the treatment of covid-19 also inhibits the activity of rdrpmetal ions are an essential part of some viral proteins and play a vital part in their pathogenesis and existence binding of metal ions might activate or inactivate the protein because metal ions can bind to viral proteins different metal ion-conjugates were tested for their inhibitory properties of 3cl protease of sars-cov hg2 zn2 and cu2 exhibited inhibitory properties with zn2 being more effective these metals exhibited non-competitive inhibition 51 many of the putative enzymes coded from the nsp cluster of the sars-cov genome have a zn2 binding domain 52 a detailed molecular interaction study demonstrated that zn2 ions and zn2 ionophores effectively inhibited replicase and also rdrp at the elongation phase 53 helicase is one of the enzymes from the nsp group of proteins in sars-cov it is involved in unwinding the dsrna or dsdna in 5 to 3 polarity the activity of helicase is vital for replication and also the transcription of the viral genome bismuth compounds efficiently inhibited the helicase activity 54 metals being versatile in their utility can be used to minimize the survival of viruses fig 3
 in the current pandemic metal ion based coating to the hospital surfaces and personal protection equipment ppe are being extensively explored however molecular interactions and mechanism of the inhibitory properties of metal ions need to be explored in detailbesides targeting viral proteins the cellular mechanisms involved in virus internalization can also be a viable therapeutic strategy fig 3 the entry mechanism and internalization process for sars-cov-2 into cells have not been clarified yet since sars-cov-2 binds to the similar receptor as sars-cov and is also vulnerable to chloroquine a lysosomotropic agent hence there is an increased probability that the sars cov-2 also utilize the similar endocytic mechanism for the entry into the host cells clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the most prevalent process of internalization including that of sars-cov therefore drugs such as chlorpromazine inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis are tested for their potential in inhibiting sarscov-2 55the sars-cov-2 covid-19 host interactions can be modulated by small-molecule agents authorized for other human diseases chloroquine cq a commonly used anti-malarial drug and authorized immune modulator has been recently identified as a possible broad-spectrum antiviral drug 6263 cq is reported to prevent virus infection by elevating the endosomal ph needed for viruscell fusion and by interacting with the glycosylation of sars-cov cell receptors 64 in one of the recent findings cq demonstrates inhibitory activity towards covid-19 ec50  113 m in vero e6 cells 65 and is examined in an open-label trial chictr2000029609 66 subsequently a number of clinical trials chictr2000029542 chictr2000029559 chictr2000029609 chictr2000029740 chictr2000029760 chictr2000029761 chictr2000029762 chictr2000029803 chictr2000029826 chictr2000029837 chictr2000029868 chictr2000029898 chictr2000029899 chictr2000029935 and chictr2000029939 were immediately carried out in china for the safety and efficacy of cq and hydroxychloroquine for treating covid-19 linked pneumonia 66 reports have so far shown that chloroquine phosphate is preferred in managing the treatment by constraining the worsening of pneumonia increasing lung imaging tests encouraging virus-negative transformation and reducing the duration of illness 67 cq is an inexpensive and effective drug and has been in use for over 70 years making it potential and clinically beneficial towards covid-19hydroxychloroquine hcq which demonstrates a highly related structure as shown in fig 4
 and antiviral activity to that of cq may function as a safer treatment method for covid 19 as it demonstrates anti-sars-cov activity in vitro 68 with better clinical safety profile as that of cq during long-term use which will allow high daily dose 69 both compounds can interact with ace-2 glycosylation and decrease the binding capacity between ace-2 on the host cells and the covid-19 surface spike protein they may also raise the ph of lysosomes and endosomes by preventing the virus fusion mechanism with host cells and corresponding replication when hcq enters antigen-presenting cells apcs it inhibits the development of antigen and the autoantigen exposure to t cells controlled by major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii it represses subsequent stimulation of t cells and cd154 expression and other cytokines furthermore hcq disrupts dna  rnas interaction with toll-like receptors tlrs and the cgas nucleic acid detector and thus the expression of pro-inflammatory genes cannot be triggered consequently cq and hcq administration is not only expected to alleviate covid-19s extreme development by preventing its replication and invasion but it also reduces the risk of cytokine storm by blocking t cell stimulation as depicted in fig 5
70 in a more recent study an open-label non-randomized study investigating the impact of hcq eu clinical trial number 2020-000890-25 reported on a group of 36 patients it stated a substantial decrease in nasopharyngeal swab viral positivity relative to control 6 days following inclusion in the hcq group however 16 patients were assigned as controls in a deviation from their chart defined protocol and 6 patients obtained simultaneous azithromycin azm treatment to avoid bacterial superinfection patients who received azm were chosen based on clinical assessment after 6 days the subgroup getting azm had negative virus swabs relative to 57 814 with hcq alone and 125 216 with control 71 it shows that azm added to hcq has been significantly more effective in eliminating the virus however this study is constrained by its low sample size and lack of randomization which gives a lot of room for study with a larger sample sizeseveral kinds of research have concentrated on repurposing existing antiviral therapies in particular those that have shown previous effectiveness towards mers-cov and sars-cov authorized protease inhibitors were confirmed to be effective towards sars-cov and mers-cov such as lopinavir lpv and ritonavir rtv clinical trials eg chictr2000029539 are conducted to test hiv protease inhibitors like lpv and rtv in patients with covid-19 infection 66 initially lpv and rtv were suspected to suppress sars and mers 3-chymotrypsin-like protease and proved to be linked with better clinical results of sars patients in a non-randomized open-label study 72 however it is up for debate that lpv and rtv could efficiently block the covid-19 3-chymotrypsin-like and papain-like proteases hiv protease is from the family of aspartic proteases while the two coronavirus proteases belong to the family of cysteine proteases in fact hiv protease inhibitors have been precisely designed to match the c2 structure in the hiv protease dimer catalytic site however this c2-symmetric structure is missing in coronavirus proteases 57 assuming that hiv protease inhibitors modify host pathways to interact with coronavirus infection indirectly their potency remains a matter of concern in the recent study 51 covid-19 patients with conventional chinese medicine interferon lpv rtv and brief-term 3 to 5 days corticosteroids were successfully treated and 50 patients were recovered and discharged 73 a 54-year-old man having covid-19 was successfully treated with lpv and rtv from day 10 of infection 2 tablets lpv 200 mgrtv 50 mg every 12 h was mentioned in a study by lim et al the viral -coronavirus load was begun to decrease after the first day of administration and since then few to no significant coronavirus titers were identified 74 the observation suggest that although there are no drugs for covid-19 at present the repurposing of antiretroviral drug which have been previously approved by united states food and drug administration fda is really helpful in supressing the virus as well as treating already infected individual similar combination of other retroviral agents with appropriate dose and dosing frequency will be quite helpful in facing this situationremdesivir rdv is a broad-spectrum anti-viral and an adenosine triphosphate nucleoside analog it is an investigational small molecule developed by gilad sciences inc in 2015 primarily for the treatment of ebola and it is in phase -ii trials for its activity against the ebola virus-induced hemorrhagic fever 75 in vivo and in vitro animal study data shows that rdv is active against a host of virus-like filoviridae parmyxoviridae and the coronaviridae middle east respiratory syndrome-corona virus mers cov severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus 2 sars-cov-2 776 the prodrug of rdv gs-443902 constrains the viral rna dependent rna polymerase at the early stage of the viral infectious cycle chain termination and lethal mutagenesis are the other possible mechanisms of action of rdv 77 rdv is an antiviral that is known to reduce the viral load by decreasing viral replication the animal studies showed that the rdv efficiently decrease the viral load in the lung tissue of mers-cov infected mice and further it improved the pathological damage done to the lung tissue and lung function 78 another study showed that the metabolite of rdv gs-5734 was operative against an array of covs like pre-pandemic bat covs bat covs and circulating contemporary human cov in primary human lung cells 79 they also showed that gs-5734 halts the replication of mers-cov and sars-cov and thereby reduces the viral load in primary human epithelial cell cultures rdv blocks sars-cov infection at a micromolecular and at a half cytotoxic concentration 65 there is no sufficient data available on the pharmacokinetics of rdv however the data is extrapolated from in vivo mouse and non-human primate data rdv is metabolized into its prodrug by anabolic intracellular kinase 80 once-daily dosing was found to reach a maximum concentration with a half-life of approximately 20 h in vivo non-human primate model and an in vitro human lung cell model 81 the data relating to protein binding hepatic clearance adverse effects and dosing information is not yet available as per the clinical study data currently a loading dose of 200 mg intravenous rdv is given followed by 100 mg intravenously for 5 to 10 days 82 in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rdv in covid-19 patients several clinical trials have been started a randomized double-blind controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rdv in hospitalized patients with moderate to mild covid-19 respiratory disease has been initiated by china-japan friendship hospital china the trial consists of 08 patients divided into 2 groups with one group receiving active rdv and the other control group receiving rdv placebo the results of the trials are expected to be obtained by the end of april 2020 83 gilead lifesciences has initiated a phase-3 randomized study to evaluate the efficacy of rdv regimens with respect to clinical status by a 7-point ordinal scale on day 14 with 2400 participants the study completion date is expected to be may 2020 84 national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid has initiated a multicenter double-blind randomized adaptive placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of rdv in hospitalized adults diagnosed with covid-19 85ribavirin rbv is an antiviral purine nucleoside analog approved for chronic hepatitis c virus hcv it is a broad-spectrum anti-viral drug having activity against hepatitis b and respiratory syncytial virus mers-cov sars-cov-2 86 rbv is metabolized by adenosine kinase to its prodrug mono di and triphosphate metabolites the synthesis of viral mrna polymerase is inhibited by the direct binding of rbv triphosphate rtp to the nucleotide-binding site of the enzyme which results in the reduction in the production of defective virions and decreases the viral load 87 rbv also competitively inhibits host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase impdh which further inhibits the guanine nucleotides synthesis the decrease in guanosine triphosphate leads to the depletion of viral protein synthesis and halts the process of viral genome replication 88 rbv also has an immunomodulatory effect on the host by promoting the production of cytokines which stimulates the humoral response and enhances immunity towards the virus the mechanism of action of rbv that includes the inhibition of mrna capping which results in induction of mutation in the viral replication is the main reason for considering rbv as a potential treatment approach to treat sars-cov-2 89 high doses of rbv are required for treatment rbv when given as a monotherapy shows resistance against sars and mers and therefore its given in combination with other antiviral drugs like lopinavir chloroquine analogs and with interferon- 90 a study on vero and llc-mk2 cells showed that the combination of rbv with interferon- inhibits the replication of novel coronavirus ncov isolate hcov-emc2012 in the cell lines with a lower concentration of both rbv and interferon- thus making rbv as a promising treatment for covid-19 90 the pharmacokinetic profile of rbv is well established it is rapidly and extensively absorbed orally with an oral bioavailability of 64 it is metabolized in the liver by adenosine kinase to its mono di and tri phosphate metabolites the half-life of rbv is about 120170 h for the treatment of covid-19 intravenous rbv is given in a dose of 500 mg 23 times daily in combination with lopinavirritonavir or interferon- for not more than 10 days 91 the main adverse effects of rbv are hypocalcemia hemolytic anemia and hypomagnesemia 92 rbv should be avoided in patients with preexisting cardiac disease and in patients with poor renal function rbv is known to cause teratogenic effects and therefore it should be avoided in pregnant women 93 several clinical trials to assess the potency of rbv in treating covid-19 are underway a randomized open labeled controlled phase-2 trial to assess the efficacy of combination therapy of lopinavirritonavir rbv and interferon beta-1b has been initiated by the university of honkong china the aim of the study is to assess the effect of combination therapy in suppressing the viral load shorten the hospitalization time recovery and reduce the mortality in patients with covid-19 infection compared with lopinavir ritonavir 94arbidol arb or umifenovir is an antiviral drug currently approved in china and russia for the prophylaxis treatment of respiratory viral infections and influenza 95 it is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that has demonstrated activity against many other viruses like the lassa virus zika virus ebola virus flavivirus herpes simplex and in food  mouth disease 96 furthermore it has shown activity in vitro against a host of other viruses like hantaan virus chikungunya virus hepatitis b and c virus reovirus and coxsackievirus 97 arb has shown activity against sars-cov-2 virus and thus its been currently investigated for its potential to treat covid-19 prophylactically 95 the broad-spectrum activity of arb is mainly because of its dual action as a host targeting agent hta that acts on one or multiple stages of the viral life cycle and as a direct-acting antiviral daa which induces direct virucidal effects on virus 95 the daa action is mainly because of the ability of the arb to form interactions with amino acid residues arb interferes with intracellular trafficking clathrin-mediated endocytosis and directly with viral lipid envelope 98 the interaction of arb with viral glycoprotein aromatic residues that are involved in fusion and cellular recognition is the main reason for arbs antiviral activity 99 because of its ability to interact with both viral proteins and lipids arb can interfere with the later stages of the viral life cycle 100 the antiviral activity of arb against sars-cov-2 has gained the attention of researchers in the use of arb as a potential treatment therapy alone or in combination therapy to treat covid-19 currently china is conducting various studies to evaluate the potential of arb in treating covid-19 and has recommended the use of arb as a treatment option a study conducted in china reveals that arb effectively inhibits sars-cov-2 infection at low concentration of 1030 m in vitro the national health commission nhc of the peoples republic of china has included arb in the latest version of the guidelines for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia for the tentative treatment of covid-19 arb is rapidly absorbed following its oral administration the maximum concentration of the drug in plasma is estimated to be 415467 ngml and the time taken to reach maximum plasma concentration is between 06518 h 101 it undergoes cytochrome p450 dependent hepatic metabolism and it is also metabolized by intestinal microsomes 102 phase-1 metabolic pathways include hydroxylation sulfoxidation and n-demethylation whereas the phase-2 pathway is mainly due to glucuronide and sulfate conjugation reactions 103 the plasma half-life of arb is 1721 h and it is eliminated majorly through feces currently to treat covd-19 a dose of 200 mg of arb 3 times a day is given orally for not more than 10 days 104 a phase-4 for pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 randomized multicenter open study has been initiated by jieming qu rujin hospital china to observe the safety and efficacy of arb in the treatment of pneumonia induced by sars-cov-2 105 another randomized open study to assess the safety and efficacy of bromhexine hydrochloride tablets given in combination with arb and recombinant human interferon- 2b in the treatment of mild to moderate covid-19 pneumonia has also been initiated 106favipiravir fpv a derivative of pyrazine carboxamide is a promising broad-spectrum antiviral drug initially developed for influenza several years ago it acts by preventing the influenza viral rna-dependent polymerase rna thus blocking the replication process by acting negatively on genetic copying it has been screened against many rna viruses including h1n1 ebola arena virus and bunyavirus because of its action against rna viruses it was however approved in japan and france and not in other countries for a few indications 107in order to determine the viability of fpv for covid-19 repurposing we carried out a literature survey of clinical trials using fpv as an investigational drug for different indications results of the research published for a multi-centric phase ii study nct01068912 showed clinical effectiveness of fpv in influenza in low-dose and high-dose treatment modalities with no mortality and no substantial possibility of severe adverse reactions 108 results of the multi-centric phase iii study nct02026349 released on eudract showed that fpv could reduce symptoms and overcome influenza fever without any mortality or significant adverse effect 109 evidently fpv in influenza could contribute to positive treatment interventions fpv may also have possible antiviral activity on sars-cov-2 which is an rna virus a clinical study on fpv for the treatment of covid-19 conducted by the shenzhen third peoples hospital and the clinical medical research centre of the national infectious diseases obtained positive results on 14 february preliminary outcomes from a total of 80 patients along with the experimental group and the control group showed that fpv had a more potent antiviral action than lpv  rtv there were no major adverse reactions in the treatment group fpv and there were slightly less adverse effects than the lpv  rtv group in terms of disease development and viral clearance fpv demonstrated stronger therapeutic responses to covid-19 110darunavir drv is a second-generation protease inhibitor against hiv-1 scientists in china declared on 4 february 2020 that drv prevented in vitro sars-cov-2 infection cell research demonstrated that drv reported to inhibit viral replication at a concentration of 300 m in vitro and its inhibition efficacy was 280 times that of the untreated group 111 in patients with covid-19 pneumonia drv is used in trial number nct04252274 in combination with cobicistat 112 such a combination is currently approved by the fda in treating aids drv is a hiv protease inhibitor and cobicistat is a supplement to enhance drvs pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics by inhibiting cytochrome p450 cyp3a 113114the other antiviral drugs are also widely used in covid-19 treatment around the world oseltamivir is another medication licensed for the treatment of influenza a and b it prevents the viral neuraminidase and thereby prevents the releasing of viral particles from host cells thus minimising the spread throughout the respiratory tract 115 usage of oseltamivir with or without antibiotics and corticosteroids is reported in china 116 oseltamivir is also used in clinical trials with chloroquine and fpv in multiple combinations 117interferons inf are a cluster of cytokines that are secreted by dendritic plasmacytoid and other types of cells 118 these are the bodys natural defense against viral infection and also play an important role in combating tumors and regulating immunity fda has approved infs for the treatment of various conditions like multiple sclerosis hepatitis b and c viral infection hairy cell leukemia and acquired immuno deficiency syndrome aids 119 infs are the first cytokines released during a viral infection the interferon stimulating genes isg which are mainly involved in immunomodulation signaling and inflammation are activated by the inf fixation on interferon  receptor ifnar receptors present on the plasma membrane of most of the cells 120 the isgs activates the adaptive immunity by decreasing the secretion or metabolism of cytokines by interfering with viral replication isgs further prevents membrane fusion by decreasing the membrane fluidity and sensitize the cells to pathogens thereby inhibiting the virus-cell cycle steps 121 inf when given as a monotherapy showed that higher serum concentration of inf is required to halt viral replication whereas the in vitro studies of inf given in combination with ribavirin showed a potent synergistic effect in treating sars 122 the combination of inf and ribavirin at a lower dose showed an inhibitory action on the replication of mers-cov 90 among the subtypes of infs inf1b and inf1a are the most potent inhibitors of sars-cov 123 and mers-cov 124 with respect to coronavirus infection inf1 plays an important role because of its protective role in the lungs it maintains the endothelial barrier function of the lungs by up-regulating cluster of differentiation 73 cd73 in the endothelial cells of lungs and results in the secretion of anti-inflammatory adenosine 125 these studies showed that inf can be used in the prophylactic treatment of covid-19 inf is an investigational drug and hence its complete pharmacokinetic profile is not yet established however the half-life of the pegylated form of inf is 4622 h as of now there is no established dosage regimen for inf in treating covid-19 several clinical trials with inf alone and in combination with other drugs have been initiated an early phase randomized open blank control study has been planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recombinant inf1b as monotherapy in treating corona virus infection 126 in another case an randomized open-label controlled trial on the combination therapy of lopinavir ritonavir ribavirin and inf1b in comparison with monotherapy of lopinavir ritonavir as a treatment for novel coronavirus infection has been planned 94 peginterferon alfa-2a marketed as pegasys has been used in the treartment of chronic hepatitis c in combination with ribavirin with repect to covid-19 several clinical trials with using pegylated interferon alfa have been initiated open label controlled randomised phase ii clinical trial to estimate the antiviral efficacy and safety of pegylated inf lamda nct04343976 and pegylated inf lamda-1a nct04388709 in patients with covid-19 infection have been initiated 127128azithromycin az is a semi synthetic broad spectrum macrolide antibiotic approved by fda for the treatment of genitourinary tract infections enteric and respiratory tract related infections 129 along with its anti-bacterial activity az has also shown antiviral activity by inducing the production of interferon-stimulated genes in a rhino virus infected bronchial epithelial cells 130 studies showed that az is also effective against zika and ebola virus az acts against the virus by a host of multiple mechanism az inhibits viral genetic shedding from lysosome and blocks endocytosis by getting accumulated intracellularly in the lysosomes and endosomal vesicles leading to the increase in ph levels and thereby limits the replication of viral genetic material 131 the anti-viral activity of az is also attributed to its ability to induce interferon mediated antiviral response which reduces the replication of the virus 132 az also decreases the mucus secretion and enables lung function by directly acting on bronchial epithelial cells 130 az has shown a potential action against sars-cov-2 it interacts among sars-cov-2 spike protein and host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 protein and thereby inhibits the viral entry into the host cell 133 the bioavailability of az following oral administration is 37 it has a high tissue penetration and a longer half life 68 h it is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted through biliary excretion the volume of distribution of az is 31 lkg the side effects of az include macrolide antibiotic resistances hearing loss and cardiac arrythmias qt prolongation 129 there are several reports suggesting that a combination of chloroquine and az is effective in reducing the viral load in the treatment of covid-19 usually a dose of 12 g of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is used in the treatment of covid-19there are around 81 clinical trial registered for testing the efficacy of az in combination with several other drugs for treating covid-19 an open label randomized interventional study has been initiated to compare the efficiency of the two drugs hydroxychloroquine and az to see which one is better in the treatment of confirmed or suspected cases of covid-19 134 a multicentre randomized open labelled clinical trial has been started to assess the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab given in combination with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of sars-cov-2 135 a phase ii b double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial has been initiated to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and az to prevent the hospitalization or death in symptomatic adult outpatients with covid-19 136 gautret et al conducted a non-randomized observational open-label external control trial on covid-19 patients of 12 yrs age to deduce the efficacy of combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and az 137 they concluded that hydroxychloroquine 500 mgday and az 250 mg day for 5 days successfully reduced the viral load the activity of hydroxychloroquine in reducing the viral load was further reinforced by aztetracyclines doxycycline tetracyclines minocycline are a class of polyketide antibiotics having a broad-spectrum bacteriostatic activity against various bacterial infections the bactericidal activity of tetracycline is mainly due to its ability to reversibly bind to the bacterial ribosomes and there by leading to the leakage of the intracellular components from the bacterial cell by altering the cytoplasmic membrane 138 several studies have shown that along with anti-bacterial activity tetracyclines also possess a potential antiviral activity against a host of virus including sars-cov-2 tetracycline act by three possible mechanism against sars-cov-2 virus coronavirus depends on matrix metalloproteinases mmps for replication survival cell to cell adhesion and cell infiltration having zinc as a part of mmps complex 139 tetracyclines are known to chelate with the zinc compounds present on the mmps complex and thereby helps in decreasing the severity of covid-19 infection secondly tetracyclines decreases the levels of cytokines and other inflammatory agents by down regulation of nfkb pathways 140 and thereby aiding in the treatment of covid-19 as corona virus causes an elevated release of cytokines il-6 tnf- and il-1 and triggers the release of inflammatory agents like protease and histamine along with cytokines by inducing proliferation of the respiratory submucosa mast cells the third possible mechanism of tetracycline in treating covid-19 is by inhibiting the replication of viral dna in the lungs which is mainly attributed to the high tissue penetrating ability and lipophilic nature of tetracycline the bioavailability of tetracycline upon intramuscular injection is 40 and the oral bioavailability is around 6080 it is a highly protein bound drug with a half-life of 612 h vomiting diarrhoea loss of appetite and oral sores are the possible adverse effects of tetracyclines nantes university hospital france has been given approval to start a double blinded randomized placebo controlled multi centred clinical trial the aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of doxycycline in reducing abolishing the cytokine storm which is induced by the sars-cov-2 virus in the covid-19 positive patients upon hospitalization 141teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic produced by the actinomycete actinoplanes teichomyceticus 142 it is currently approved to treat gram-positive bacterial infections like staphylococcal infections 143 teicoplanin has also shown its activity against an array of viruses like the influenza virus hepatitis c virus ebola hiv flavivirus and on corona virus-like sars-cov and mers-cov 144 teicoplanin inhibits the transpeptidase activities and transglycosylation reaction by nonspecifically binding to the outside layers of the peptidoglycan structure followed by binding to the terminal amino acids which constitute the building blocks of the peptidoglycan cell wall 145 thus teicoplanin specifically stops bacterial growth by inhibiting the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall 146 teicoplanin binds to peptidoglycan and inhibits the cell wall lytic enzymes resulting in cell freezing 145 teicoplanin acts against coronavirus by inhibiting the genome viral rna release and thereby preventing the replication of the virus-cell cycle this inhibition activity is because of teicoplanin acting on the early stage of the viral life cycle by inhibiting the low ph cleavage of viral spike protein by cathepsin l in the late endosome 144 in the case of sars-cov-2 teicoplanin acts in the same way by targeting to the cleavage site for cathepsin l present in the spike protein a study to test the efficacy of teicoplanin on 2019-ncov showed that teicoplanin efficiently inhibits the entry of the 2019-ncov spike pseudovirus into the cytoplasm in a dose-dependent manner 147 teicoplanin is poorly absorbed after oral administration it has 90 bioavailability upon administering intramuscularly the protein binding of the drug is 9095 and it is metabolized in the liver by hydroxylation reaction to give metabolites 1 and 2 148 the mean volume of distribution at steady state for teicoplanin was found to be 4070 l it is eliminated by the renal pathway 149 hypersensitivity at the site of injection is the major side effect associated with teicoplanin other than this it may cause bronchospasm and anaphylactic shock teicoplanin can also cause nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity tachycardia fatigue headache tremors diarrhea and elevation of liver enzymes are the other reported side effects 149sirolimus is a potent immunosuppressive agent obtained from streptomyces hygroscopicus it is commercially available as rapamune pfizer and is mainly used in treating lymphangioleiomymatosis and as a prophylactic agent to prevent organ transplant rejection the immunosuppressive activity of sirolimus is mainly due to its ability to inhibit t-lymphocyte proliferation activation and cytokine production by selectively blocking the transcriptional activation of cytokines along with possessing antineoplastic and anti-fungal properties it also has anti-viral activity sirolimus binds to immunophilin in the cell to form a immunosuppressive complex and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin mtor kinase which in turn halts the formation of mtorc1 protein complex which is said to play an important role in viral replication studies showed that sirolimus successfully inhibited mtor signalling pathway and there by inhibited mers-cov 150 thus making sirolimus a suitable candidate to further test and use in treating covid-19 the university of cincinnati has been granted approval for performing a double blind randomized placebo controlled clinical trial on the use of sirolimus in treating covd-19 the aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of sirolimus in improving the clinical outcomes among the patients hospitalized for the treatment of covd-19 pneumonia 151 a placebo controlled two-arm double blinded randomized phase-i clinical trial has been initiated to assess the virological efficacy of sirolimus the main of this trial is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics virological efficacy tolerability and safety of sirolimus as an adjuvant therapy in treating patients with covid-19 152baricitinib is an immunosuppressant approved by the fda for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis it is a janus kinase jak inhibitor which acts by selectively and reversibly binding to jak receptors there by inhibiting jak1 and jak2 this inhibition leads in halting the signal transduction from growth receptors or cytokines leading to reduction in immune cell function and haematopoiesis baricitinib also prevents the formation of viral particles and intracellular passage of viral cells by binding to associated protein kinase 1 aak1 15 baricitinib is considered as one of the drug candidates to test against covid-19 the patients with covid-19 are prone to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis shl 153 which leads to an elevated inflammatory and ferritin marker levels in the covid-19 patients resulting in hyperinflammation the use of jak inhibitors like baricitinib will aid in reducing the inflammation and it also prevents the viral infection and endocytosis by inducing a inhibitory effect o aak1 receptors 77 the pharmacokinetic profile of the baricitinib is well established the bioavailability of baricitinib upon oral administration is 80 and it reaches a peak plasma concentration within 1 h the half life of baricitinib is 125 h with a volume of distribution of 76 l and its 50 protein binding it is metabolised in liver by oxidation mediated through cyp3a4 and it is eliminated unchanged from the urine 154 the main side effects associated with baricitinib are thrombosis upper respiratory tract infections and malignancy there are several ongoing clinical trials for determining the exact role and the efficacy of baricitinib in the treatment of covid-19 a phase-ii non-randomized open labelled clinical trial has been initiated to investigate the safety and efficacy of combination therapy of lopinavirritonavir hydroxychloroquine sulphate and baricitinib in the treatment of moderate to severe covd-19 in hospitalized patients 155 another randomized phase-ii open labelled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of drugs in treating sars-cov-2 associated pneumonia has been initiated the aim of this current study is to design a study design with drugs of different classes and investigate their efficacy in treating covid-19 a combination of hydroxychloroquine 200 mg ritonavir 50 mg baricitinib 4 mg and imatinib 400 mg will be administered to the patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia for 7 days and the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy will be evaluated 156cyclosporine is a immunosuppressive agent isolated form the fungus beaueria nivea it is widely approved for the treatment of lupus nephritis vasculitis psoriatic arthritis and as a immunosuppressant agent in organ transplantation 157 cyclosporine acts as a calcineurin inhibitor it binds to cyclophilin receptor in the cells and forms a cyclosporine-cyclophilin complex this complex will further block the calcium dependent interleukin il-2 production pathway and suppresses the gene transcription of il-2 thereby reducing the inflammatory responses 158 in the case of covid-19 cyclosporine blocks rna-dependent-rna polymerase and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of sars-cov-2 virus there by inhibiting the cyclophilin function of the virus 159 to enter into the cell corona virus bids to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ace-2 at a low cytosolic ph cyclosporine s known to maintain the cytosolic ph at normal levels and there by aids in decreasing the viral load 160 cytokine storm in sars-cov-2 infection is mainly caused due to shl and cyclosporine is the choice of drug to treat shl as cyclosporine blocks the production of il-2 and inhibits the proliferation and survival of t-cells 161 cyclosporine is absorbed variably with a volume of distribution 0f 48 lkg the half-life of cyclosporine is 19 h and its metabolized in intestine and liver by cyp450 enzymes 158 gingival hyperplasia nephrotoxicity and hyperlipidaemia are the possible side effects of cyclosporine despite of its activity against sars-cov-2 virus it is not yet recommended for the treatment of covid-19 as there is no proper pre-clinical and clinical data proving the safety and efficacy of cyclosporine in the treatment of covid-19 availabletocilizumab is the first humanized recombinant mab which is used to treat autoimmune and inflammatory conditions like cytokine release syndrome giant cell arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis tcz targets and binds to the membrane bound il-6 receptors thus preventing the interaction of il-6 with il-6 receptors this leads to the reduction of the cytokines pro inflammatory activity resulting in the blockade of antibody production and induction of t-cell proliferation by il-6 162 in the course of covid-19 disease progression the patients develop conditions like acute interstitial pneumonia fever lung injury arthralgia leukopenia thrombocytopenia myocarditis and biological inflammatory changes which is caused due to the hyper production of cytokines resulting in a cytokine storm 163 this cytokine storm is induced by the replication of the virus which activates the innate immune system to produce ils tcz binds to these il receptors and blunts the hyper secretion of ils thereby reducing the inflammation and other related conditions 164 the half-life of tcz is concentration dependent and unlike other mabs tcz is also metabolized to smaller proteins by the action of proteolytic enzymes 165 a dose of 400 mg of intravenous tcz once daily is administered in patients with covid-19 163 skin reactions headaches hypertension and gastrointestinal perforation are the major adverse effects associated with tcz a host of clinical trials have been initiated to investigate the use of tcz in the treatment of covd-19 a multicentred open-labelled phase-ii single arm clinical trial study has been initiated by the national cancer institute naples to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of tcz in treating covid-19 pneumonia 166 another open-label multi-centre clinical trial has been initiated with the main aim to evaluate the use of tcz when given in combination with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in treating the patients hospitalized with covid-19 135 a clinical study design to investigate the use of tcz in manging covid-19 patients with suspected pulmonary hyperinflammation has been initiated it is an open-label randomized multi centred two arm study with the aim to test the hypothesis that tcz can effectively reduce the inflammation caused as a result of virus induced cytokine storm and resulting in the rapid improvement of clinical conditions 167ivermectin is a broad-spectrum anti-parasite drug which is approved for the treatment of onchocerciasis and intestinal strongyloidiasis ivermectin acts by selectively binding to the glutamate-gated chloride on channels of the parasite and leads to hyperpolarization of the cell which results in the paralysis and death of the parasite the anti-viral activity of ivermectin was first discovered with its ability to block the interaction between the nuclear transport receptor importin imp and integrase molecule of hiv 168 it is also known to block the viral replication of host of viruses including influenza flavivirus and dengue virus 169 the in vitro study of ivermectin anti-viral activity against sars-cov-2 virus showed an inhibition of the viral replication up to 5000-fold within 48 h which is mediated by inhibiting the imp  mediated nuclear import of viral proteins 170 a phase-iii double blind randomized clinical trial has been started with a aim to determine the safety and efficacy profile of the combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin i the treatment of hospitalized covd-19 patients 171ace-2 inhibitors captopril ramipril are widely used in treating hypertension ace-2 receptors are overexpressed on the epithelial cells of the oral mucosa and they are also present immune reactive cells like lungs blood vessels macrophages and intestine 172 in the case of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 ace-2 receptors serves as a door way for the virus to enter into the host cell 173 sars-cov has a transmembrane spike glycoprotein s-protein on its outer shell which binds to the ace-2 receptors once the virus is attached to the ace-2 receptors of the host cell the cellular proteases starts priming the s-protein and allows the virus to get fused into the cellular membrane of the host cell which results in the entry of the virus and replication in the host target cell 41 the amino acid configuration of sars-cov-s protein is almost 80 similar to that of sars-co-2-s-protein and thus shares the same binding affinity to ace-2 receptors as like sars-cov hence sars-cov-2 also utilizes ace-2 receptors as an entry point into the host cell 174 thus treating with ace-2 inhibitors and blocking the entry of sars-cov-2 virus into the cell has been considered as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat covid-19 and in this regard many clinical trials have been initiatedin particular corticosteroids are not approved for treating covid-19 or any viral pneumonia 175 in septic shock corticosteroids benefit from blunting the hosts immune reaction to the release of bacterial toxins the frequency of shock is remarkably low in patients with covid-19 5 of cases having to deliver oxygenated blood flow and thoracic pressure from breathing results in increased heart activity leading to cardiogenic shock corticosteroids can cause damage via immunosuppressant activity during the infection treatment and have failed to offer an advantage in many viral epidemics including influenza infection respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection mers and sars 176 with covid-19 early recommendations for treating chronically ill people indicate when to use minimal-dose corticosteroids and when to stop using corticosteroids recommendations rely on the particular clinical condition eg refractory trauma artificially ventilated acute respiratory distress syndrome ards patients however they are based on data identified as weak 177 indeed a study was performed in wuhan china identifying clinical outcomes of patients infected with covid-19 n  201 eighty-four 418 patients acquired ards and 44 524 of those died methylprednisolone therapy reduced the risk of mortality in ards patients 178 a retrospective open-label trial chictr2000029386 is planned to examine clinical progress in patients administered with methylprednisolone iv 66179 in another study zhou et al indicated that in 10 covid-19 patients the brief-term optimum-dose corticosteroid 160 mgday and immunoglobulin 20 g  day substantially decreased lung damage stabilized body temperature c-reactive protein lymphocyte and oxygenation levels 180 however when examining 416 covid-19 patients shang et al observed that corticosteroid treatment and the administration of gamma globulin raised fatalities and considered only effective in patients with low lymphocyte levels 181 the delivery of corticosteroids for covid-19 patients is also uncertain according to the above scientific findingsthe fda provides access to convalescent plasma cp materials abundant in antibodies obtained from suitable donors who are healed from covid-19 the fda indicates that evaluating its safety and effectiveness by clinical trials is necessary prior to clinically prescribing cp for patients with covid-19 and for the same fda has issued guidelines to investigators and health care providers for investigators seeking to review cp for use in patients with extreme or imminent life-threatening covid-19 the fda has posted details through the use of the single-patient emergency investigational new drug ind application process for particular patients also the fda is closely interacting with investigators to explore the prospect of cooperation on creating a master protocol for the use of cp with the aim of minimizing duplicative attempts 182 cp composition is complex and involve a wide range of components deriving from blood plasma includes a mixture of inorganic salts organic compounds water and over 1000 proteins the others factors identified are albumin immunoglobulins complements coagulation and antithrombotic factors main convalescent plasma components are depicted in fig 6a 183184 additional protective antibodies including immunoglobulin g igg and immunoglobulin m igm are found in plasma in addition to neutralizing antibodies nabs which might show antiviral effect igg and igm are the key isotypes although immunoglobulin a iga can also be important especially for viral mucosal infections non-nabs which bind to the virus but do not affect its ability to replicate could contribute to prophylaxis andor improvement in recovery the humoral immune response targets mainly spike s protein fig 6b 184185 cps anti-inflammatory effects include the autoantibodies network and the regulation of an overactive immune system additionally some antibodies prevent complement cascade ie c3a and c5a and limit immune complex formation fig 6c 184186187 researchers have investigated the effectiveness of cp therapy on 10 severe covid-19 adult patients aged 3478 years the pilot study findings indicate cp treatment could be a safe and effective therapeutic alternative for severe covid-19 infections a group from china administered a single 200 ml dose of cp to 10 patients with severe covid-19 with elevated levels of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies clinical symptoms such as cough fever chest pain and shortness of breath substantially improved three days after the injection as per the investigators the patients have had elevated numbers of lymphocytes better liver function and decreased inflammation the researchers also reported that the levels of neutralizing antibodies in the patients either increased or stayed elevated following cp transfusion 188after the covid-19 outbreak was stated pandemic by the who director-general dr tedros on the 11th of march the world started noticing the alarming levels of the upswing in the covid-19 cases hitherto the patients suffering from covid-19 are receiving symptomatic treatment due to the unavailability of a specific therapy in severe cases the treatment includes support to the functioning of the vital organs 189 the understanding of the whole genome sequence of covid-19 allows the refinement of current technologies in developing the potent and targeted therapeutics 190 though several clinical trials are presently in progress in various parts of the world to meet the vital requirements in developing the effective therapeutics and vaccines who recently launched a global mega-trial called solidarity which emphasizes on the four most assuring therapies the antimalarial medications chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine an antiviral compound remdesivir a combination of two anti-hiv drugs ritonavir and lopinavir and lastly the same combination along with an immune system messenger interferon-beta that can aid in paralyzing the virus 191 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine prevent the entry and transport of the virus by altering the ph of endosomes remdesivir a nucleotide analog likely terminates the rna synthesis leading to the induction of mutagenesis both ritonavir and lopinavir being protease inhibitors block the viral cellular entry where ritonavir inhibits cyt-p450 and prolongs the half-life of lopinavir interferon-beta inhibits viral replication 192 in quest of an effective therapeutic moiety various research institutes and pharma companies are repurposing several antivirals antibiotics and their combinations if the efficacy of these repurposed drugs reveals beneficial outcomes against covid-19 it would be a case of good fortune rather than good preparedness the current strategy for pandemic drugs is to develop or repurpose a drug right after the discovery of a novel outbreak several aspects of the pandemic seem to have shown good progress using this strategy within weeks viral genome sequences were understood and published which helped in identifying the suitable drug candidates clinical trials of interferons ace inhibitors remdesivir hydroxychloroquine and monoclonal antibodies are under progress 193  though the window of the usefulness of steroids for covid-19 patients is narrower they are still preferred because of their capability of preventing lung fibrosis and stopping cytokine storm 194 testing of the proposed drugs takes more time particularly when it is performed on humans as a part of clinical trialson the other hand the development of vaccines is hard and takes relatively more time than repurposing an existing drug especially when the novel technologies available have not been tested for safety in the pipeline of vaccines an mrna-based vaccine developed by modera and vaccine research center at nih expresses target antigen after being injected in the form of lipid nanoparticle encapsulated mrna it has reached a phase i clinical trial nct04283461 curevac is currently in the preclinical phase working on a similar vaccine additional strategies which are still in the preclinical phase include s protein-focused vaccines such as viral-vector based vaccines geovax cansino biologics vaxart and the university of oxford recombinant-protein based vaccines novavax university of queensland and biopharmaceuticals dna vaccines applied dna sciences and inovio inactivated virus vaccines and live attenuated vaccines serum institute of india with codagenix johnson  johnson is working on an experimental adenovirus vector that is not yet a licensed vaccine 195 biontech se in collaboration with pfizer very recently april 29 2020 started recruiting humans to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rna vaccine candidates through phase i and ii of clinical trials nct04368728 to combat this pandemic covid-19 vaccines might enter the market lately but will be useful in the ultimate eradication of the virus in table 2
 we have exemplarily summarized the various therapeutics for covid-19 which are under clinical trialsconsiderable progress was made in the in vitro diagnostic test ivd for covid-19 real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr is the basic ideology for ivd which takes a few hours for the results few industries have managed to reduce the test time from 3 h cepheid to 5 min abbot a wide array of serology immunoassays ias that primarily detect igm and igg were also developed automated chemiluminescence ia manual elisa rapid lateral flow ia complementing the covid-19 diagnostic molecular assays 196 the production of sars-cov-2 antiviral drugs remains problematic as there are no officially approved drugs and vaccines for the treatment of covid-19 hence we must rely solely on implementing preventive and stringent control measures to reduce the possibility of potential transmission of diseases furthermore the currently limited knowledge for therapeutic drugs must be used thoroughly to establish strategies for drug application to inhibit and manage sars-cov-2 transmission while research is underway to improve covid-19 prevention treatment and control the reported clinical data on various therapeutic approaches are limited several preclinical trials show that s protein is a key viral antigen for vaccine development detailed clinical trials for already licensed products are being performed on covid-19 affected patients since they have a well-established safety profile studies performed in vitro for an antiviral and antimalarial drug namely remdesivir and chloroquine have shown promising results in suppressing the virus in a recent study dated 9th april 2020 1061 patients were treated for covid-19 using a combination of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin hzq-az for 3 days and a follow up of 9 days the results depict that 917 of the patients were cured while 43 required intensive care units and 047 of patients died the authors reported that hzq-az combination is a safe and effective treatment if begun immediately after diagnosis and in most cases clears up the virus persistence and contiguity 197 in the future research must be carried out using an effective animal model that analyses the viruss replication transmission and pathogenesis also integrating the imaging and molecular diagnosis will help to efficiently track and treat covid-19 19198199with the rapid increase in covid-19 cases through out the world the research for development of drugs and vaccines have gained a momentum during this prevailing condition of pandemic the fast development of vaccines is required but it will take time as ongoing clinical trials are necessary for assessing the biocompatibility and toxicity of developed vaccines drug repurposing has proved to be the most efficient approach towards the treatment of covid-19 drugs from various therapeutic category alone or in combination have been explored and many combinations specially antivirals have proved to be effective against the disease although the dose and combination of repurposed drugs has been selected on trial basis and clinical trials on many repurposed drugs have been called off sighting toxicity and efficacy issues the concept of drug repurposing is quite useful and may have demonstrated effectiveness but this might vary with the severity as well as with subjects on which treatment is being done in case of vaccines multiple vaccines have demonstrated positive results and will be goining to next phase soon giving hope for early commercial launch of vaccines against covid-19 amongst alternative therapeutic strategy indian council of medical research recently approved clinical trial for use of herbal formulation against covid-19 while plasma therapy has demonstrated significant results and may be explored more in near future with the ongoing pace of research being conducted in this area the world will be able to tackle this pandemic and life could be normal like before very soonthe authors report no conflict of interestearly december 2019 and an epidemic pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus infection later named as covid-19 by who was recorded in the city of wuhan hubei province china the viral infection was soon to spread widely across china as of 28 feb 2020 78 959 cases have been confirmed including 1500 healthcare workers and there have been over 2791 deaths with an estimated mortality rate of 2 in china this compares with mortality rates of 10 for middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and 37 for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov more urgently this novel coronavirus is spreading across the globe and has affected 46 countries with 3664 cases confirmed outside china and 57 related deaths recorded particularly the abruptness and speed of the covid-19 outbreak in japan iran korea and italy in late february 2020 indicating that a global catastrophe is unfolding 1 is of great concernviruses of the coronaviridae family possess a single-strand positive-sense rna and have been identified in various avian hosts and mammals seven of which could cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as mers-cov and sars-cov sars-cov-2 a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified is similar to the coronavirus responsible for sars-cov with 79 sequence identity but it is more distant from mers-cov only 50 homology 2 for all coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 at least three structural proteins are shared on the membrane spike s the membrane protein m and small membrane protein e also another four functional proteins were found in almost all coronaviruses 3-chymotrypsin-like protease 3clpro papain-like protease plpro rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and helicase during the viral infection process including intracellular transport of virions proliferation and assembling of virions in the infected cell  not only structural and functional proteins but also some proteases  play a key part suggesting that targeting these proteins or enzymes as a therapy against sars-cov-2 infection could be a promising strategy to date no special drugs or vaccines have been used to deal with human coronaviruses considering the seriousness and suddenness of the covid-19 outbreak 200 clinical trials on covid-19 have commenced in china and it is promising to report that certain targets and their agents have displayed strong antiviral potential of which some have been permitted to be used in an attempt to combat the disease in clinical trialsremdesivir and favipiravir interfere with the synthesis of viral mrna targeting rdrp remdesivir is being developed by gilead as a monophosphoramidate prodrug gs-441524 it was intended to be an intravenous treatment for ebola but it also shows potential against coronavirus and nipah virus infection the results from evaluating the antiviral efficiency of remdesivir against a clinical isolate of sars-cov-2 in vitro suggest that it could inhibit sars-cov-2 strongly with an ec50 ranging from 077 to 176 m 3 remdesivir cured the first case of sars-cov-2 infection confirmed in the usa which prompted gilead and the chinese authorities to move the phase iii trial ahead and expand it to a lot more patients who desperately need treatment final results of the clinical trial will be announced in april 2020 in contrast to remdesivir the activity report of favipiravir in vitro and in vivo is limited however there are still three active clinical trials regarding favipiravir that have begun enrolling patients in china lopinavir and ritonavir targeting 3clpro were used to treat sars patients from china in 2003 shortly after the emergence of mers-cov researchers identified lopinavir and ritonavir as mers-cov inhibitors the national expert group has recommended lopinavir and ritonavir as effective anti-covid-19 agents in china and most clinical trials on covid-19 select both drugs as positive controls emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are reverse transcriptase inhibitors that were approved to treat hiv and hepatitis b virus hbv currently only one trial combines emtricitabinetenofovir-alafenamide and lopinavirritonavir to treat covid-19 patients arbidol as a 2-5oligoadenylates synthesis oas inhibitor against severe pneumonia and virus-associated cytokine dysregulation has displayed anti-sars-cov-2 potential in clinical trials 4 however the mechanism needs to be clarified in the near future chloroquine and its derivatives including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate have elicited antiviral effects on several viruses such as sars-cov and hcov-229e by interfering with endosomal acidification based on the advantage of known broad-spectrum activity and rarely occurring adverse reactions a series of clinical trials on chloroquine and its derivatives have been advancing rapidly presently chinese government authorities have approved chloroquine phosphate to be used to treat adult patients suffering from sars-cov-2 infection further treatments combining traditional chinese medicine tcm and chemical molecules popularly known as western medicine in china have shown some exciting results in view of inconclusive clinical evidence on tcm efficacy pharmacologists should separate active pharmaceutical ingredients and identify explicit targets as soon as possible 5 surprisingly various drugs are also in clinical trials despite the lack of biological rationale such as the anti-influenza drugs umifenovir and oseltamivir targeting neuraminidase baloxavirmarboxil targeting cap-dependent endonuclease that is not found in  asc09 targeting protease with no anti-coronavirus research reported and cobicistat targeting cyp3a4 with only unpersuasive predicted activity by computer virtual docking as the crystal structures of sars-cov-2 spike 6 dimeric full-length human ace2 7 and sars-cov-2spike receptor-binding domain bound with the ace2 receptor 8 are published in succession the lead drug discovery strategy such as structure-based hts and molecular dynamics simulation to discover inhibitors with affinity to ace2 the s protein or the proteinprotein interaction will be possible in the near futurethere have been three major outbreaks of coronaviruses in the 21st century sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 drawing experience from effective screening strategies on antitumor drug development the credible and large-scale screening system of the especially deadly coronaviruses must be set up at the molecular level and in animal models as soon as possible although the clinical safety of old drugs has been proven some of them can cause serious adverse reactions for example hydroxychloroquine has the side effect of arrhythmia which can itself lead to death thus special attention needs to be paid to the safety of old drugs in new indications some drugs have displayed potent inhibitory effects on the virus in vitro and in vivo however the mechanism is unclear and existing theories cannot explain this phenomenon moreover basic research efforts should be devoted to the molecular mechanisms and separation andor purification another disturbing fact is that some unreasonable clinical trial schemes are consuming precious patient resources and some others have not even been approved by an ethics committee clinical trials must be undertaken actively carefully and scientifically reflecting the basic principles of the helsinki declaration and its relevant laws and regulations despite the urgency generated by the emergence of a new coronavirus the researchers should maintain rigorous evidence and follow the guidelines for clinical trial statistics and the basic principles including randomization control and repetition first do no harm should still be the top priorityan epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has spread rapidly throughout china and the world since 2019as of march 3rd 2020 china had reported a total of 80304 cases of covid-19 including 2946 deaths outside china there are now 10566 cases in 72 countries and 166 deaths of the deaths reported so far most of them have been elderly men 14 adults are more likely to be infected with novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 than children and symptoms are relatively milder in pediatric patients than in adult patients the same conditions occurred during the sars and mers outbreaks it is still not clear why children seem to be escaping the worst effects of the coronavirus infection 57unlike adults who can actively protect themselves children are less likely to protect themselves by avoiding touching things or covering their faces when they cough or sneeze 8 if children with underlying health conditions such as leukemia tumor or other immune deficiencies are infected with covid-19 the severity of conditions and difficulty of treatments may be unpredictable 9 in addition whether the virus will exist for a long time remains to be verified if sars-cov-2 acts like many other viruses that is remains long-lived relative to the lifespan of humans antiviral treatments will face a great challenge especially in pediatric patientsthe treatment guidelines are very cautious about recommending antiviral drugs for children almost all guidelines highlight that there are no effective antiviral drugs for children at present the interim guidance for diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 infection the sixth version issued by the national health commission of china is only available for adults in the field of antiviral treatments the recommended antiviral drugs are interferon- ifn- lopinavirritonavir ribavirin chloroquine diphosphate and arbidol 2 which have been used in the treatment of covid-19 in adults based on the available evidences ifn- nebulization can be used in children and it has shown good safety profiles under most circumstances however children are particularly sensitive to the accumulation of chloroquine phosphate in the body which could possibly induce severe retinopathy ototoxicity and cardiotoxicity on the other hand it lacks data on the safety of using lopinavirritonavir and abidor for children under 2 years of age in the absence of adequate evidence for efficacy and safety experts have not reached on an agreement on using ribavirin in the pediatric population guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 in children second edition recommend the use of ifn- lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin in children without specifying age limitation 10 the recommended dosage of ribavirin infusion varies in different medical literatures some suggest intravenous infusion of ribavirin administered at a dose of 10 mgkg every time maximum 500 mg every time 23 times daily 10 whereas others recommend 1015 mgkg per day divided into 23 times daily 11at present the efficacy and safety appropriate dosage course of treatment and mechanism of action for childrens anti-coronavirus drugs need to be studied and that special attention should be paid to the particular adverse reactions and drug interactions in children 1013based on the current epidemiological survey the ages of the confirmed covid-19 cases in children range from days to 17 years old these children may have no clinical manifestations such as fever fatigue dry cough abdominal discomfort nausea vomiting abdominal pain diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms etc a case of a 15-month-old infant diagnosed with covid-19 experienced frequent vomiting 1 2 4 1418 the clinical characteristics of covid-19 in children are different from those in adults and it is likely that differences also exist between children at different agesit is unknown whether the disease process treatment response and exposure response relationship of children with covid-19 are like those of adults according to the guidelines for clinical trials of pediatric drugs it is not suitable to perform extrapolation on drug efficacy from adults to children and children are not little adults so comprehensive and systematic drug safety and efficacy clinical trials in pediatric population should be planned and conducted as early as possible once the clinical trial data of preliminary safety and potential benefits for adults have been acquired 19at present more than 200 clinical trials for covid-19 treatment have been carried out in medical institutions all over china the drugs and the therapies include anti-aids drugs influenza medications glucocorticoid traditional chinese medicinesinjections stem cell transplantation etc however drug clinical trials for covid-19 children are very limited as of february 28 2020 one registered drug clinical trial of traditional chinese medicine for the prevention of covid-19 infection in children was found in the china clinical trial registry center another clinical trial of darunavir and cobicistat for treatment of covid-19 in children has been registered in clinicaltrialsgov the designs of the two clinical trials are not so scientific with unclear age range defined in the inclusion criteriaalthough the proportion of infected children in the pediatric population to the whole population is relatively low children are still at high risk of infection and should not be neglected we should take precautions beforehand to carry out the clinical trials of pediatric drugs for the treatment of covid-19it should be emphasized that the ethical principles of pediatric clinical research must be followed before conducting pediatric clinical trials experimental drugs should be selected first from the drugs that have already been on the market and have been used in children all clinical trials designed for pediatric population should follow the principle of minimum sample size and minimum pain as much as possible 20 21in conclusion sars-cov-2 infected covid-19 is a new and pandemic disease there are differences in clinical manifestations between children and adults it is very necessary for the government industries and institutes to prepare well in the early stage and to conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pediatric medications on the infected childrencovid-19 is the disease caused by a novel betacoronavirus the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov2 the disease was first reported in december 2019 wuhan china 1 and the full genome was sequenced and published by january 05 2020 2 by march 11 2020 covid-19 had spread globally and was declared a pandemic with at the time of writing june 6th 2020 there has been over 6 million people infected and 380000 deaths 3the disease primarily affects the respiratory tract and disease severity can range from very mild rhinorrhoea to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and death 4 5 6 a substantial minority of infections are asymptomatic non-respiratory symptoms such as anosmia diarrhoea rash thromboembolic disorders myocarditis and vasculitis have also been associated with covid-19 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 the median incubation period is estimated to be 5 days with a majority developing symptoms by 115 days 14 covid-19 patients have been shown to excrete viral nucleic acid at highest levels at the onset of symptoms 15 this and other epidemiological data 16 suggests transmissibility within an as yet undefined pre-symptomatic period 16 clinical deterioration is usually delayed into the second week of illness and associated with laboratory features of an immune-mediated cytokine storm causing widespread inflammation and disseminated intravascular coagulation usually with low level viraemia 17 18the case fatality rate death amongst persons with disease is consistently reported to be age dependent with a higher percentage in elderly aged 70 years cases dying although other factors are also associated with intensive care admission and mortality 9 6 19 including sex malefemale hypertension obesity and diabetes the reported case fatality rates cfr have been between 082 and 964 with variability in cfr likely due to the testing frequency and access as well as other health system capacity factors in different locations 20 the infection fatality rate ift death amongst all people infected  asymptomatic and not tested is a better estimate of population mortality and is modelled to be between 01 to 041 20sars-cov-2 is one of three coronaviruses that may cause severe respiratory diseases including fatality in humans and have been associated with major outbreaks in the last 20 years the other two viruses being severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov sars-cov and mers-cov mers-cov although there were some development of vaccines against sars and mers including a small number of human phase 1 clinical trials there are no licenced vaccines for any coronavirus as yetin addition to these novel epidemic viruses with zoonotic origins there are four other endemic human coronaviruses in circulation hcov2-229e -hku1 -nl63 and -oc43 all predominantly causing mild symptoms of the common cold 21coronaviruses have a large 30 kb single-stranded positive sense rna genome encased by a helical nucleocapsid n and an outer envelope comprised of matrix protein m envelope protein e and spike proteins s 22 the s protein which naturally occurs in a trimeric form contains the receptor-binding domain rbd responsible for binding onto the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and entry into the cell figure 1
 in sars-cov of all the structural proteins s protein was found to elicit neutralising antibody and is a major target antigen for vaccine development 23 24there have been difficulties in the development of coronavirus vaccines historically coronavirus vaccines in animal models that mimic human disease have been immunogenic but generally not shown to effectively prevent acquisition of disease 25 further there is a concern that vaccination as with natural coronaviral infection may not induce long lived immunity and re-infection may be possible 26 in some ways more concerning has been vaccine associated disease enhancement previous use of coronavirus vaccines sars-cov and mers-cov in some animal models raised safety concerns regarding th2 mediated immunopathology 27 mice vaccinated with two inactivated whole virus vaccines a recombinant dna spike protein vaccine or a virus-like particle vaccine developed lung pathology including eosinophilic infiltration 2 days after being challenged with sars-cov which were not seen in the lungs of challenged unvaccinated mice 28 similar lung immunopathology was observed in several other studies particularly in aged mice compared to younger mice 29 that were challenged following vaccination 30 31 mice immunised with sars-cov n protein vaccine developed severe pneumonia or lung eosinophilic infiltrate upon viral challenge whereas mice immunised with viral replicon particles expressing glycoprotein did not suggesting that the n protein antigen may be the antigen linked to this immunopathology similar enhanced immunopathology has been seen in mice vaccinated with inactivated mers-cov vaccine when challenged with live virus 32 vaccine associated disease enhancement may be more of a concern with certain vaccine types enhanced disease caused by viral challenge has been notable following administration of inactivated measles and rsv vaccines 33 34 with the possible mechanisms being a th2 skewed response resulting from formalin inactivation as well as lack of affinity maturation of the antibodies produced 35developing and scaling-up mass production of a vaccine rapidly in a global pandemic setting is challenging as it requires many activities to be well-coordinated and occurring in parallel in contrast to the usual decade long sequential process with pre-clinical testing phased clinical trials planned production and distribution these challenges result in an aggregation of invested resources and elevated financial risk 36 in outbreaks delay in vaccine distribution can result in considerable mortality and morbidity as illustrated by the 20132014 west african ebola epidemic which killed more than 11000 people 37 and resulted in economic and social burden costing over 53 billion dollars 38 tragically a vaccine had been in development and was later shown to be effective in the prevention of ebola and may have contributed to controlling the outbreak 39 40 unfortunately the sars 2003 epidemic ended before vaccine development was complete disappointingly funding agencies then reallocated funds that had been committed to vaccine development leaving manufacturers with financial loss and setting back other vaccine development programs 36 in 2017 the coalition of epidemic preparedness innovation cepi was formed to address these past failures with a mission to develop a coordinated response to emerging infectious disease threats to ensure vaccine development and early deployment in response to epidemics 41one method for overcoming road blocks has been to through the use of new technology platforms to expedite vaccine development 42 vaccines licensed in humans have traditionally been live attenuated viruses eg measles mumps rubella inactivated viruses eg inactivated polio vaccine protein or polysaccharide conjugated subunit vaccines protein acellular pertussis hepatitis b polysaccharide conjugated pneumococcus meningococcus and virus-like particles over the last decade a range of new technology platforms have been developed and include vaccines composed of nucleic acid dna and rna and viral vectors and recombinant proteinsviral vector technology involves the delivery of one or more genes that encode a target antigen within an unrelated engineered virus the viral vector can be replication competent live attenuated or replication deficient for hiv ebola zika and chikungunya vaccines using viral vectors including adenovirus ad measles virus mv vesicular stomatitis virus vsv alphaviruses poxviruses and herpesviruses allowing for insertion of 5 kb or more of the transgene have shown ability to stimulate cellular and humoral immunity 43 42 concerns with this platform are with the likely slower speed of vaccine manufacturing in an outbreak setting given the need for biosafety level 2 bsl2 laboratories and possible pre-existing immunity in vaccine recipients to viral vectors such as ad5 and mv decreasing the effectiveness of the vaccine approaches such as the selection of low human prevalence adenoviral serotypes ad26 or ad35 have been used to circumvent such an issue 43 42 the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-zaire ebola virus rvsv-zebov ebola vaccine is currently the only vector-vaccine that has been licensed and available for human use and only produced and used to a limited extent 44 45 46a mers-cov vaccine mva-mers-sdf1 using modified vaccinia virus ankara and expressing the spike s protein of mers-cov was evaluated in an open label phase 1 trial on 26 individuals aged 18-55 it showed a favourable safety profile without any severe adverse effects but induced only a relatively limited humoral and t-cell response to the mers cov 47 reassuringly the study showed that although vector specific neutralisation antibody was elicited the vaccine still elicited antibody responses against the transgene following booster immunisation 47 results of the phase 1 clinical trial for an alternate vaccine chadox1 mers vaccine that uses a replication deficient simian adenoviral vector expressing the spike s protein in 24 individuals aged 18-50 years showed that a single dose was able to elicit both humoral and cellular responses against mers cov the majority of solicited and unsolicited adverse events aes reported by participants were mild or moderate and all were self-limiting and there were no serious aes related to vaccine administration which supports progression into phase 1b and 2 trials 48nucleic acid vaccines utilize antigen-encoding plasmid dna or rna messenger rna mrna or viral replicons the nucleic acid once taken up by a cell will initiate protein synthesis to which a humoral and cell-mediated immune response is expected to occur similar to natural infection such vaccines have been trialled for veterinary infectious diseases and demonstrated immunogenicity for example for foot and mouth disease deer powassan virus and rabies virus 49 50 51 phase i trials in humans are underway for nucleic acid vaccines against ebola influenza and zika virus 42 the benefit of a nucleic acid platform is the ease with which it allows antigen manipulation and the speed of production as manufacturing can be synthetic and entirely cell free so circumventing the need for bsl2 laboratories the disadvantages are that nucleic acid especially mrna are fragile and require an uninterrupted cold-chain process for transport and storage 52 phase i clinical trials have been conducted on sars-cov and mers-cov dna vaccine candidates a recombinant sars dna vaccine candidate coding for the sars-cov n protein genome developed by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid was investigated in 10 adults 53 a mers-cov dna vaccine gls-5300 developed by geneone life scienceinovio and coding for the full length s protein genome had a higher number of participants n75 54 both showed acceptable safety profiles and induced humoral and cellular responses the mers-cov dna vaccine has advanced into a phase 2 clinical trial 55 the only other sars vaccine to have entered a phase i trial is an inactivated vaccine iscv produced by sinovac biotech 56 there were no reports of human studies in which vaccinated subjects were challenged by the natural virusas of 1st june 2020 there are currently 124 candidate vaccines that are under development for prevention of covid-19 listed by the who health organization who landscape summary 57 of which 10 candidate vaccines specifically designed for prevention of covid-19 table 1
 have entered phase 1 combined phase 12 or phase 2 human clinical trials in adults most of these trials are enrolling healthy adults from age 18 years only with the upper age limit of inclusion ranging from 50 to 60 years two trials are enrolling young participants one from aged 3 years and the other 6 years with no upper age limit in both one combined phase iii trial includes older adults up to age 85 years while another early phase i trial has been extended in may 2020 to include also older adults to age 99 years 58 59licensed vaccines such as bcg and oral polio vaccine have been shown to have nonspecific modulatory effects on the immune system and provide protection against other infectious diseases 60 61 62 63 64 this has led to the suggestion that these vaccines may have an effect in the prevention of covid-19 65 three multi-centred randomised controlled trials on bcg vaccine administration are underway in health care workers in australia 66 netherlands 67 and south africa 68 a measles vaccine trial to prevent covid-19 in health care workers in egypt has been registered 58 and oral polio vaccines are being considered in the united states of america 69even if sustained immunity is attained after infection by sars-cov2 estimates are that 60-70 of a population would need to be immune to achieve herd immunity against sars-cov2 70 the safest and most controlled way for effective and sustainable prevention of covid-19 in a population is to have an efficacious and safe vaccine and the majority of the population successfully vaccinated in addition the vaccine should also be readily mass-produced inexpensively and be easily transportable with minimal cold chain requirements to have global utility immunity after primary covid-19 infection seems to protect against re-infection in primate models and is likely to occur in humans 71 whether this can be mimicked in vaccines and for how long immunity may last is still uncertain following sars-cov infection igg and neutralising ab was detectable for 1 to 3 years following infection which suggests that vaccine-induced protection is unlikely to be long-lasting and may require re-immunization 72 73 74 75the rapid progression of new vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2 into pre-clinical and clinical studies is encouraging several phase 1 trial results have recently been released ad5-cov vaccine conducted in 108 participants showed reasonable safety or tolerability profile and has now progressed to phase ii humoral and cell mediated responses were seen in participants albeit less in those with pre-existing ad5 vector immunity 76 interim phase 1 data released on may 18 on mrna-1273 demonstrated seroconversion and development of neutralizing antibodies in 8 individuals 77 it is an open question of whether these candidates will display the necessary efficacy and safety profile in humans to progress further into phase 3 trials and subsequently licensure and use to control covid-19 transmission in a review of 11 epidemic infectious diseases only 1 out of 11 21 preclinical vaccine candidates have been shown to go through to end of phase 2a trials at the estimated cost of usd 319-469 million range 137 million to 11 billion 78 in the current climate some vaccine developers are have shown willingness to start or progress later phase trial preparations even before definitive results of earlier phase trials are available 79there have been international collaborative efforts to expedite vaccine development and production the prior establishment of cepi has been an integral existing platform that has supported the rapid development of covid-19 vaccines without having to establish new mechanisms with attendant costs cepi is supporting the nine covid-19 vaccine candidates briefly presented here since its formation it has established measures to finance early development of vaccines up to phase 3 clinical trials however it does not have a role in the manufacturing or deployment of vaccines and a consortium of public and philanthropic funders will be required for complete preparedness for vaccine manufacture and deliveryin addition to cepi the who and the us national institutes of health nih are contributing to global collaborative efforts to accelerate vaccine development the who solidarity trial for vaccines is a large multi-site individually randomised controlled clinical trial to allow evaluation of the benefits and risks of each covid-19 candidate vaccines within 36 months 80 further accelerating covid-19 therapeutic interventions and vaccines activ an international public-private partnership has been established to co-ordinate and speed up the response to the covid-19 pandemic government organisations in the us and one in europe international biopharmaceutical companies and a non-profit organisation are all involved in advancing vaccine development 81vaccine efficacy in under-represented and vulnerable populations also remains an issue a majority of vaccine trials have focused on healthy people between the ages of 18-65 years excluding the elderly pregnant women and children given the disproportionate mortality rate in people over the age of 60 the elderly need to be considered in vaccine trials to ensure safety immunogenicity and efficacy data is collected and are prioritised to receive covid-19 vaccines in outbreak situations pregnancy has not been shown to be a risk factor for disease severity and the disease burden is low in children however much is still unknown especially the role of inducing an adaptive auto-inflammatory response such as paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with sars-cov-2 pims-ts there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the immunopathogenesis of covid-19 to give guidance to the immunological assessment of vaccine responsesthere has never been a more rapid pace to vaccine development the pandemic situation has been a challenge and a trigger to reconsidering the usual approaches to regulatory assessment and licensing processes vaccine companies are showing willingness to commit to scaled-up production prior to definitive phase 3 trial results 79 the implementation of high quality aligned surveillance for covid-19 across multiple regions concurrently with vaccine deployment is critical both for evaluating the real-world effectiveness of a new vaccine against sars-cov-2 but also for monitoring its safety in so-call post-marketing surveillance the association of rotavirus vaccines with intussusception in children was only detected following licensure and deployment of these vaccines 82 83 the experience of the philippines with a novel dengue vaccine should also promote a degree of caution with respect to vaccine safety during their population usage even if they appear safe in phase 1 2 and 3 studies 84 85 there will be considerable uncertainties regarding the safety of vaccines for covid-19 given the new vaccine platforms used without prior licensed examples deployment to population subgroups not included in trials of that particular candidate additional uncertainty arising from novel adjuvants in quite a number of candidatesas we have alluded to the development of a vaccine that shows efficacy in clinical trials is only the beginning of a process to manufacture deploy and monitor the effectiveness of a new vaccine the challenges ahead are numerous as an example in 2016 as part of the global poliovirus eradication initiative gpei 155 countries were planned to synchronously shift from trivalent oral polio vaccine topv to bivalent vaccine bopv 86 this switch was to be coordinated with concurrent inclusion of at least 1 dose of inactivated polio vaccine ipv into routine immunization schedules in 126 opv using countries significant difficulties have been encountered with vaccine manufacturing and supply chains resulting in interruptions and delays in multiple countries 87 this experience will certainly inform and improve a potential global covid-19 vaccine deployment but should influence a level of caution with respect to our expectations even were an effective vaccine developeddespite efforts in fast tracking vaccine development completion dates for early clinical trials are estimated to be late 2020 to mid-2021 and it may still take longer before a vaccine is licensed for use globally although the pandemic has triggered reconsideration of the usual approaches to regulatory assessment and licensing this emphasises the need for proven public health strategies such as physical distancing early detection self-isolation and outbreak control remain as important mitigation toolsthe reader will be able tounderstand of the types of vaccine and vaccine platforms being developed for sars-cov-2develop knowledge regarding the concerns around coronavirus vaccine developmentappreciated the issues of rapid vaccine development in outbreak

at the 2019 years end numerous cases of severe respiratory infections were reported in wuhan china and were initially thought to be a seasonal flu disease given that some patients had a history of attending or working in the wholesale market for fish and seafood the market was immediately shut down on january 1 and environmental sanitation and sanitation were fully implemented a few days later after rejecting the diagnosis of seasonal influenza avian influenza adenovirus coronavirus sars coronavirus and other pathogens on jan 1 the virus was declared a causative agent of the disease in four of the nine hospitalized patients a new coronavirus that has a 5 genetic association with sars and is a subset of sarbecovirus 1 currently the virus has been briefly named sars-cov-2 virus for further information and covid-19 the name was given by the world health organization who to the sars-cov-2 virus-associated diseasethis disease has resulted in that clinicians and researchers from different branches of biomedicine were mobilized to find a solution or treatment for the management of this pandemic according to a recent announcement of the international society for stem cell research isscr currently there are no approved stem cell-based approaches for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 infection however recently mesenchymal stem cells mscs have introduced one of the therapeutic approaches for using in the treatment of covid-19 2 as we know mscs opposes viral infection due to the presence of specific cytokines improved qualities these features are present in mscs in the intrinsic niche before their separation process happens therefore mscs can be expected to survive even if they are transplanted into a patient with a confirmed covid-19 due to there is disagreement in mscs therapy to treat covid-19 we reviewed reported clinical trials and news to present helpful information to researchers and enthusiasts of the stem cell-based therapy field in this study we considered this proposed approach to improve patients immunological responses to covid-19 using mscs and discussed the aspects of this therapeutic approachcovid-19 the word that certainly it isnt forgotten by everybody who lived in the first half of the twenty-first century coronavirus disease 2019 which known as covid-19 is the result of one coronavirus infection in the name of sars-cov-2 coronaviruses cov are a large family of viruses that some of them are more known such as middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov but some of them are not more known like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 that previously known by the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov is a new strain of coronavirus that hasnt been identified in humans up to late december of 2019 however there are reports that demonstrate the sars-cov-2 virus originated from bats and then moving into camels but its exact dynamics are currently unknown moreover much of the pathogenesis information regards to sars-cov-2 is not fully knownsars-cov-2 is from the nidovirales order a member of the genus -coronavirus -cov 3 -cov includes five subgenus including in embecovirus including hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 4 nobecovirus including btcov-hku9 4 hibecovirus including bat hp-betacoronavirus zhejiang2013 4 sarbecovirus including sarsr-cov and its strains such as sars-cov sars-cov-2 and bat sl-cov-wiv1 merbecovirus including middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov btcov-hku4 and btcov-hku5 httpstalkictvonlineorgtaxonomy 4 5sars-cov-2 is enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna virus with nucleocapsid by 796 sequence identity the same to sars-cov 6 that that known as the largest discovered rna viruses by approximately 30 kb in length genome structure the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 has been submitted to gisaid httpswwwgisaidorg accession number epiisl402124 it was first isolated using human airway epithelial cells 7 but can be isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a covid-19 patient 6 7 generally both of the sars-cov and the sars-cov-2 are isolated and grew readily in vero cells 7 8 a lineage of cells that was isolated from kidney epithelial cells of an african green monkey 9 also this virus as sars-cov enters its host cell by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor 10 11on march 11 2020 the world health organization who characterized the spread of covid-19 as a pandemic that it has caused unreasonable fear and led to unnecessary suffering and death 12 to date 29 march 2020 according to the worldomete site httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus report more than 199 countries and territories around the world have been affected with major outbreaks respectively in the usa italy central china spain germany and iran the mortality rate of covid-19 has been reported from 07 13 to 152 14 according to different studies in diverse territories and countries as well its maximum incubation period has been assumed 2 weeks 15 to 8 weeks 14 16 covid-19 has resulted in that many researchers from different branches of biomedicine were attracted to find a solution or treatment for the management of this pandemic however to date havent been discovered the standard cure for this diseaseseveral studies have shown that the first stage of the pathogenesis of this type of virus is the identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace2 receptor by its spike protein 17 for this reason ace2-positive cells are infected by this virus 17 another study has shown that the cellular protease tmrrss2 is also required to allow the entry of coronavirus into host cells 18 it is conceivable that the ace2 receptor is widely distributed on the surface of human cells especially alveolar type 2 at2 and capillary epithelium and at2 cells largely express tmprss2 18 on the other hand interestingly bone marrow lymph nodes thymus spleen and immune cells such as t and b lymphocytes and macrophages are always negative for ace2 fig 1 19 these findings suggest that immunoglobulin therapy can help treat patients with the virus infection therefore it should be noted that the capacity of the virus is greatly diminished by the cytokine-induced storm of the virus the current hallmark of sars-cov-2 pathogenesis is the cytokine storm in the lung virally-triggered acute cytokine release of gscf ip10 mcp1 mip1a il-2 il-6 il-7 and tnf results in pulmonary edema dysfunction of air-exchange acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and acute cardiac injury and leading to death 2to date there is no specific cure for covid-19 although clinical management of these patients currently includes prevention or control of the infection and supportive care including supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation support when needed recently in the viral surface glycoprotein several epitopes including in 5 ctl epitopes 3 sequential b cell epitopes 5 discontinuous b cell epitopes of immune cells 20 and 13 mhc-i and 3 mhc-ii antigenic epitopes 21 have been reported via immuno-informatics approach that some of these epitopes maybe had potential candidates for the development of 2019-ncov vaccinesa series of approved drugs for other symptoms is currently underway in clinical trials for these patients including chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir worldwide this because safe timely and effective supportive treatments are the inevitable principle in patients who develop severe manifestations of covid19currently cell-based therapy and especially stem cell therapy has become a promising therapeutic field in which many see opportunities to cure incurable diseases 22 despite the significant development of the stem cell-based therapy field immunogenicity limited cell source and ethical issue as the main limitations of this therapeutic approach have not been solved yet among these mscs has attracted attention due to source potential a high proliferation rate low invasive procedure and free of ethical issues there is much superiority in using msc therapy in comparison with other treatments 23 including in i they are easily accessible and can be isolated from various tissues such as bone marrow and adipose tissues including in umbilical cord dental pulp menstrual-blood buccal fat pad fetal liver etc ii they are multipotent stem cells iii mscs can easily expand to clinical volume in a suitable period of time iv mscs can be stored for repetitive therapeutic usage v clinical trials of mscs so far havent shown adverse reactions to allogeneic msc vi safety and effectiveness of mscs have been obviously documented in several clinical trials 23as mentioned following the covid-19 may trigger a destroying immune overreaction in the body in covid-19 patients the immune system produces large amounts of inflammatory factors causing a cytokine storm including in an overproduction of immune cells and cytokines 24 here it is the beginning of the msc therapy idea in the treatment of covid-19 patients probably msc therapy can prevent the storm release of cytokines by the immune system and promote endogenous repair by reparative properties of the stem cells fig 2after intravenous injection part of the msc population entraps in the lung which often in systemic infusion it is remembered as a limitation but here these mscs could recover the pulmonary microenvironment protect alveolar epithelial cells intercept pulmonary fibrosis and cure lung dysfunction and covid-19 pneumonia 25 however one of the main restrictions in this approach is the suppling source of clinical-grade mscs and subsequently the speed of preparation for clinical usage that here stem cell banks can play an important role also mscs can be isolated from different adult tissues including preferably bone marrow bm peripheral blood pb and adipose tissues at such as abdominal fat infrapatellar fat pad and buccal fat pad and neonatal birth-associated tissues including placenta pl umbilical cord uc warton jelly wj amniotic fluid af and cord blood cb and then stored for future possible applications therefore it seems mscs-based therapy may possibly be an ideal candidate for clinical trials or at least the combination of treatment to treat covid-19 patientsrecently china usa jordon iran and several other countries have begun cell-based therapy clinical studies and some reports have been published table 1 interestingly one of the available methods to evaluate its efficacy in the maintenance or repair of damaged vital organs is the use of mesenchymal stem cell mscs therapy that widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes autoimmune disease spinal cord injury gvhd and several other diseases specially with high immunity rates have been used 23 2628 mscs using their immunomodulatory properties and their differentiation ability can prevent lung tissue death by counteracting the cytokine storm and regeneration and reconstruction of damaged tissues fig 2 recently the use of these cells in the clinical treatment of h5n1 viral infections that have similar effects on the lung has also been suggested 29 in addition recently a case study was reported in china on a female patient with an acute covid19 syndrome that the results of laboratory tests and ct images provided extremely effective results after 21 days of treatment with umbilical cord mscs a recent case study of a case report of a 65-year-old female patient diagnosed in critical condition with covid-19 then identified the exact 2019ncov variant now called sars-cov-2 30 the patient had a neutrophil increase of 87 and a lymphocyte decrease of 98 and was treated with antiviral drugs such as lopinavir  ritonavir ifn- and oseltamivir as well as intravenous injection of moxifloxacin xuebijing methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin the patient was also subjected to non-invasive mechanical ventilation to facilitate breathing and relieve muscle fatigue due to poor oxygenation as the vital signs worsened the patient was treated with cord mscs alone and with 1 thymosin 5  107 cells each three times the results of the study showed that after the second injection serum albumin crp and alt  ast gradually decreased as well as other vital signs improved thereafter the patient was removed from the ventilator and able to walk and the number of white blood cells and neutrophils in the patient decreased to a normal level while the number of lymphocytes increased to their normal level most importantly cd3 t cell cd4 t cell and cd8 t cell numbers were significantly increased also the qualitative results obtained from ct images after the second and third injections of cord stem cells showed that the pneumonia was very relieved 2 days after the third injection the patient was discharged from the icu ward and most of the vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters in the they were normal the results suggested that umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells could be an ideal treatment option alone or in combination with other immune modulators for acute covid-19 patients 30 in another study released recently in china and in collaboration with the united states 7 patients with covid19 pneumonia in beijing youan hospital from january 23 to february 16 underwent mesenchymal stem cell transplantation and clinical manifestations changes in immune function levels 25 also inflammation was assessed within 14 days after transplantation the results showed that the clinical symptoms of all patients improved significantly 2 days after stem cell transplantation among the patients studied one was very acute and two patients with milder conditions were discharged from the hospital 10 days after transplantation their results also showed that peripheral lymphocyte levels increased activated cytokine-secreting immune cells such as cxcr3 cd4 t cells cxcr3 cd8 t cells and nk cxcr3 cells disappeared on day 66 a group of cd14 cd11c cd11bmid regulatory dc cell populations also increased dramatically at the same time tnf- levels were significantly decreased whereas il-10 was increased in patients treated with mscs compared with patients treated with conventional therapy in addition gene expression profiling of mesenchymal stem cells showed that these cells are ace2- and tmprss2- which showed that mesenchymal stem cells are free of covid19 infection 25 therefore they concluded that mscs would be safe and effective for treating patients with covid19 pneumonia especially for patients with very acute conditionsimmunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of mscs in the treatment of respiratory diseases were confirmed by 17 completed clinical studies and also more than 70 trials are registered in this regard httpsclinicaltrialsgov to date 20 clinical trials have been registered in the chinese clinical trial registry site httpwwwchictrorgcn in addition 9 clinical trials have been registered in clinicaltrialgov umbilical cord umbilical cord blood whartons jelly menstrual blood dental pulp and the company produced-mscs are the important msc sources that will be used in these trials however the process of developing new therapeutic and bringing it to clinical application has important practical implications and not over for msc therapy of covid-19 however the cost-effective and speed of therapeutic preparation are the capable discussed topic for msc-based therapy for covid-19 but certainly the life of a human is more worthy and covid-19 is so dangers therefore the clinical use of mscs therapy to treat covid-19 is still some time away but there are some promising reports to apply stem cell therapy and especially mscs may possibly be is one of the most ideal therapeutics or a combination of treatment to treat covid-19 patients however scientists are trying incessantly to develop a vaccine for covid-19 as well as therapeutics to treat this diseasecoronaviruses are rna viruses and may infect the respiratory gastrointestinal hepatic and central nervous systems of humans livestock species avian species many mammals and wild animals1 in humans infection by four coronaviruses namely hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 usually lead to mild self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections2 however other coronaviruses such as those associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers may cause severe respiratory disease and have caused a total of more than 10000 laboratory-confirmed cases globally in the past two decades with a 10 and 344 case-fatality rate respectively34 in december 2019 a novel coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov emerged in wuhan hubei china with clinical manifestations in humans resembling that of viral pneumonia5 by february 25 2020 about 77780 confirmed cases have been identified in china with 2666 deaths worryingly 2459 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 have now been identified outside of china6symptoms of infection are non-specific and include fever cough and myalgia7 with diarrhea with or without the subsequent development of dyspnea8 severe cases with respiratory distress sepsis and septic shock have been reported9during the sars epidemic of 2003 therapeutic systemic glucocorticoids were widely administered in patients who were infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and who subsequently developed severe respiratory disease one cohort study of patients during the sars outbreak showed that the use of pulsed high-dose methylprednisolone was associated with clinical improvement in patients with sars10 in another study of 20 patients with sars certain cytokine levels interleukin-8 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and th1 chemokine interferon--inducible protein-10 were found to be reduced after 5 to 8 days of glucocorticoid therapy11 however a previous retrospective study indicated that pulsed doses of methylprednisolone was a risk factor associated with increased 30-day mortality adjusted odds ratio 260 95 confidence interval 441548 p  000112 in addition a further retrospective observational study found that glucocorticoid therapy in patients with mers was associated with delayed middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov rna clearance13 the clinical therapeutic and other effects of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in patients with covid-19 is not currently clear and the case for and against the use of systemic glucocorticoids in severe cases of covid-19 warrants further investigationour study proposes to investigate the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with severe covid-19 our major objective is to observe whether there is a clinical necessity or therapeutic justification for the use of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with severe covid-19the study was approved by the ethics

group18 this study only enrolled a total of 17 subjects because it was conducted at the end of the sars outbreak and fewer appropriate patients were available to be recruited taking into account the uncertainty of the duration of the outbreak the final sample size may be adjusted unlike wuhan chongqing currently has a relatively small number of confirmed cases of covid-19 and an even smaller number of severe cases of covid-19 it is hoped that we do eventually recruit a cohort of 48 patients for our study but we may have to settle for an even smaller cohort should suitable subjects not be availablethe primary outcome analysis will be presented for the intervention group and control group using descriptive statistics the normality of the data distribution will be evaluated by the kolmogorov-smirnov test continuous variables will be described as mean values with standard deviation mean  standard deviation and will be analyzed using the t test for independent samples categorical

its potential for propagating large-scale human infection and economic disruption systemic glucocorticoid therapy could be considered for critically ill patients with covid-19 but their impact on clinical outcomes is uncertain16 available data on systemic glucocorticoid therapy among coronavirus-infected patients mainly comes from studies of patients with sars and mers but whether glucocorticoid therapy is definitively beneficial in the clinical management of these two coronavirus infections is still being debated132021glucocorticoid therapy was used in the treatment of severe sars because early anecdotal experience supported it and radiologic findings and histologic features of critically ill patients with sars were similar to those of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards22-25 as early as march 2003 china first summarized its experience in the management of sars and suggested that high-dose glucocorticoids should be used if patients had fever persisting for more than 3 days or radiologic findings were suggestive of persistent lung involvement or progressive deterioration26 there were three different regimens used by physicians in hong kong china including methylprednisolone 12 mgkg qid or 24 mgkg tid iv followed by oral prednisolone for varying periods and of disparate dosages as per clinical evaluation hydrocortisone 2 mgkg qid or 4 mgkg tid iv followed by oral prednisolone for varying periods and doses as per clinical evaluation and pulsed methylprednisolone 500 mg iv daily for 5 days followed by maintenance oral prednisolone 50 mg bid reduced to 2030 mg daily on day 21 and as per clinical evaluation27some suggested glucocorticoid therapeutic doses during the sars outbreak were very high approximating the treatment doses for acute severe asthma and some prescribed doses were similar to those prescribed for organ rejection in transplant patients or for ards23 one study compared pulsed glucocorticoid therapy methylprednisolone 500 mgday with non-pulsed glucocorticoid methylprednisolone 500 mgday therapy finding that pulsed glucocorticoid therapy appeared to be a more efficacious with patients using pulsed glucocorticoid therapy having lower oxygen requirements better radiographic outcomes and decreased likelihood of requiring rescue unfortunately the stated study was not a randomized controlled trial and is thus open to the possibility of bias having an impact on outcomes23 however there were also staunch advocates for not using systemic glucocorticoids in these patients one systematic review of studies on patients with sars-cov including 29 studies documenting glucocorticoid use found 25 studies that were inconclusive regarding the role of the adjunctive use of glucocorticoids and four studies demonstrated that the use of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with sars may cause possible harm28 a prospective randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial compared early hydrocortisone treatment before day 7 of the illness with placebo finding that early hydrocortisone therapy was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load18 meanwhile many possible complications of glucocorticoid use such as profound immunosuppression with the possible emergence of severe commensal and other viral and bacterial infections invasive fungal infections osteonecrosis and psychosis may occur with prolonged and high-dose glucocorticoid therapy29-34glucocorticoid therapy was also commonly used for critically ill patients with mers in one study hypoxemic patients with mers-cov pneumonia who had moderate levels of positive end-expiratory pressure were initiated on glucocorticoid therapy13 in these patients there was no difference in 90-day mortality and these patients were associated with delayed mers-cov rna clearance many patients with severe mers were treated with systemic high-dose glucocorticoids intending to reverse the progression of respiratory distress and to prevent lung fibrosis however this approach has not been proven to be successful35 one study including a total of 314 patients with symptomatic mers-cov found that glucocorticoid use was associated with increased mortality in these patients36 a retrospective cohort study compared 151 patients in the glucocorticoid group with 158 patients in the non-glucocorticoid group finding that mortality in the glucocorticoid group was similar to that of the non-glucocorticoid group but that glucocorticoid therapy was associated with delayed mers-cov rna clearance after adjustment for baseline and time-varying confounding factors13after infection with 2019-ncov occurs some patients develop mild symptoms but a significant fraction of patients progress to severe ards and require intensive care737 the use of glucocorticoids in patients with ards is still controversial because of divergent results in the existing literature38 high-dose glucocorticoid is one of the most frequently used adjuncts in ards 179 in 50 countries even though their effectiveness in the management of acute lung injury is not yet clear39 one systematic review conducted an analysis of individual patient data from randomized trials and demonstrated that compared with the placebo group prolonged glucocorticoid treatment did improve clinical outcomes40 another randomized controlled trial showed that glucocorticoid therapy could down-regulate ards-related inflammation and was associated with significant improvements in lung and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction as well as reduce mechanical ventilation duration and intensive care unit hospital admission duration41 studies by meduri et al4243 found that prolonged methylprednisolone treatment may complement positive modulation of systemic inflammation by inducing recovery from induced glucocorticoid resistance and co-existing decreased production of endogenous glucocorticoids4243 animal experiments in recent years have provided evidence for the use of glucocorticoids to reduce inflammation the attenuation of acute lung injury and reduction in mortality during the acute phase of severe disease4445 however other studies have suggested that glucocorticoid therapy in ards is not necessary and may even aggravate the clinical picture the use of hydrocortisone improves lung function in sepsis-associated ards but no significant survival benefit has been observed in these patients46 a higher mortality rate has been observed in patients with ards who took high-dose glucocorticoids within 7 days after hospital admission compared with those who were treated without high-dose glucocorticoid47existing studies on ards have not assessed the effects of glucocorticoids in identical types of patients or identical processes of the disease48 therefore the results for these studies cannot be considered to be congruent adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy in specific diseases causing ards such as pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia has been shown to reduce mortality in adult patients49additionally the dosage of the glucocorticoid used needs to be factored in high-dose glucocorticoid therapy may increase ventilator dependence and may possibly induce a worse outcome50 the development of osteonecrosis was discovered in patients receiving high-dose glucocorticoids during the sars epidemic in 2003 and the number of osteonecrotic lesions was directly related to the dosage of the glucocorticoid prescribed5152 additionally high-dose glucocorticoid use is one of the causes for neuropsychiatric outcomes in patients with sars53 it has been noted that if lung injury has been effectively controlled appropriate doses of glucocorticoids based on disease severity may be beneficial for better outcomes of sars1021 in our study we will investigate whether the use of mid-dose and short-course adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy to treat severe covid-19 is advantageous safe and effectivethis work was supported by the chongqing special research project for prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia no cstc2020jscx-fyzx0074nonewhile the first case of sars-cov-2 causing covid co stands for corona vi for virus and d for disease- initially called 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov may have occurred as early as november of 2019 the earliest reported symptoms have been traced to december 1 2019 1 on december 31 2019 the world health organization who china country office was informed about cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in wuhan city hubei province of china an initial evaluation of these cases was undertaken four lower respiratory tract samples including broncho-alveolarlavage bal fluid were collected from patients in wuhan and compared with seven samples collected from patients in beijing who had pneumonias of known cause 2 more than 20000 viral reads from individual specimens were obtained and most matched the genome from lineage b of the genus beta-coronavirus showing greater than 85 identity with a bat sars-like covbetween december 31 2019 and january 3 2020 44 cases of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were reported to the who by national authorities in china on january 11th and 12th of 2020 the chinese national health commission identified the source of exposures at a seafood market in wuhan city huanan seafood wholesale market fig 1 a cohort of forty-one cases caused by sars-cov-2 was reported by huang et al 1 a majority 3073 were men with a median age of 490 years iqr 410580 common initial symptoms included fever 4098 cough 3176 and

care center after 4-days of cough and subjective fever 3 he had recently returned to washington state after visiting family in wuhan china viral panels for routine respiratory pathogens were negative nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were sent to the center for disease control and prevention cdc following notification of the washington state department of health both swabs were positive for sars-cov-2 progressive bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray a new requirement for supplemental oxygen and persistent fevers on day 6 prompted initiation of treatment with remdesivir see subsequent section on potential treatments under study serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative cultures for bacterial pathogens prompted discontinuation of vancomycin and cefepime rapid clinical improvement was observed over the next 2448 hcoronaviruses belong to the subfamily coronavirineae in the family of coronavitidae of the order nidovirales the subfamily includes alpha coronavirus beta coronavirus gamma coronavirus and delta coronavirus 4 5 the genome is a single-stranded positive-sense rna 30 kb with a 5 cap structure and a 3-poly-a tail the sars-cov-2 virus belongs to the cluster of beta coronaviruses originating most likely from horseshoe bats homotrimers of s proteins make up the spikes on the virus surface and enable binding to host receptors in the case of covid-19 oral-pharyngeal cell angiotensin converting-enzyme ace-2 is the primary receptor of the 20 other known pathogenic coronaviruses 6 of which can infect humans an overwhelming majority are associated with respiratory infections and syndromes of varying severity-the most pathogenic coronaviruses that can cause fatal pulmonary infections and multi-organ system failure are sars-cov mers-cov and sars-cov-2 68coronaviruses contain at least 6 open-read frames orfs orfs near the 3 terminal of the genome encode primary structural proteins spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n as mentioned previously s proteins are responsible for attachment to host receptors m proteins contain transmembrane domains that contribute to virus shape curvature and binding to the nucleocapsid the e protein is involved with virus assembly and pathogenesis n proteins package and encapsulate the genomes into virions and antagonize innate proteins and silencing rna 912the trimeric sars-cov-2 surface s protein consists of three s1s2 heterodimers that bind the cellular receptor ace2 and mediate fusion at the viral and cellular membranes through a pre-to-post fusion conformational change the available information obtained by cryo-electron microscopy shows that only one receptor-binding domain binds ace2 and adopts an upward conformation 13 fig 2 moreover binding to the receptor opens up the receptor binding domain of s1 and promotes the release of the s1-ace2 complex and s1 monomers soluble complexes can bind to host cell unoccupied ace2 receptors the available data suggest that the combinant receptor binding domain rbd portion of the sars-cov-2 s protein has evolved to effectively target ace2 the sars-cov-2 s protein is so effective at binding human cells that the scientific community has concluded it is the result of natural selection 1416 the same is true of its backbone and overall molecular structure 17population genetic analyses of 103 sars-cov-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types designated l and s that are well defined by two different single nucleotide polymorphisms snps further the analyses showed near complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date although the l type  70 is more prevalent than the s type  30 the s type is believed to be the ancestral version whereas the l type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in wuhan china the frequency of the l type decreased after early january 2020 human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the l type which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly 16 18the unique characteristics of sars-cov-19 as initially determined in december 2019 suggested strongly that humans would not possess herd immunity ie an absence of prior exposure made existing antibodies to sars-cov-19 unlikely this in turn should have signaled alarms about potential infectivity and robust immune and resulting inflammatory responses to infection the burst of inflammatory cells and proteins often referred to as cytokine storm is believed to have been responsible for many deaths during the 1918 flu pandemic h5n1 bird flu outbreaks and the 2003 sars outbreak 19 20 the unique characteristics of the virus to include its stability and large scale of infected people also suggest strongly that there will be second or multiple waves of sars-cov-2 in the coming yearsangiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 is the receptor to which sars-cov-2 binds and invades human cells 21 zou et al constructed a risk map of human organs utilizing single-cell rna sequencing data sets derived from major human physiological systems analysis of the available data identified the organs at risk for sars-cov-2 infection and specific cell types with ace2 expression the most vulnerable organs and cell types are as follows lung type ii alveolar cells heart myocardial cells kidney proximal tubule cells ileum and esophagus epithelial cells and bladder urothelial cells fig 3ace2 receptors are also found in both venous and arterial endothelial cells and in arterial smooth muscle cells 22 the expression of ace2 receptors increases with age but varies little by either sex or race under normal circumstances 23 24the binding of srs-cov-2 to ace2 is a necessary step for virus entry followed by multiplication spread and ultimately the phonotypic expression of disease rna sequencing data from human hearts show that nearly 80 of myocardial cells have positive ace2 expression this finding is of particular relevance in patients with sars-cov-2 viremia 8 and may hold the key to a better understanding of cardiac injury heart failure arrhythmias and circulatory shock in covid-19at the time of this writing there were 972203 confirmed cases of

based on published reports is  2040 however the statistics are changing hour-by-hour and day-by-day what is clear and consistent is that morbidity and mortality increase significantly with age rising to  80 for patients between the ages of 7079 and  148 in patients greater than 80 in addition to a recognized impairment in immune response that increases with age comorbid illnesses including heart metabolic and lung disease are also more likely among older persons access to health care may also be impacted by age to varying degrees around the worldthe initial cohort of hospitalized patients

162716myocarditis is known to occur in a wide range of acute viral infections including adenovirus human immunodeficiency virus hiv epsteinbarr virus and influenza virus to name a few observational data coupled with virologic and molecular diagnostic techniques suggest that enteroviruses including coxsackieviruses parvoviruses and adenoviruses are among the most common causes of myocarditis given the duration of viral shedding in sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 as well as the relatively high density of ace2 receptors expressed in cardiomyocytes one would expect to see cases of myocarditis and myopericarditis chen et al 33 highlighted the potential for sars-cov-2 to be a cause of fulminant myocarditis citing the frequency of cardiac injury and robust inflammatory response cytokine storm as a core pathophysiological mechanism of fulminant myocarditis as with other viral causes of myocarditis the presenting signs symptoms and diagnostic features will vary from chest discomfort and shortness of breath with electrocardiographic st-t wave abnormalities elevated ctni and nt-pro-bnp levels to heart failure and cardiogenic shock an appropriate clinical index of suspicion will be required in addition patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and either ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathies will be the most vulnerable to progressive or precipitous change in ventricular performance and clinical decompensationthe pivotal questions that the medical and scientific communities must answer are why do elevated cardiac biomarkers portend a worse prognosis among patients with covid-19 are they an epiphenomenon of infection severity do they reflect vital organ viral load viremia andor direct myocardial or microvessel invasion of sars-cov-2 might they be a marker of a systemic inflammatory response and a red flag for impending cytokine stormwhile adults have been the most severely affected by covid-19 emerging data show that infants children and adolescents have contracted sars-cov-2 as well 36 in a nation-wide case series of 2143 pediatric patients reported to the chinese center for disease control and prevention there were 731 laboratory-confirmed and 1412 suspected cases the median age was 7 years interquartile range 213 while 90 of cases were considered mild in severity there were severe and critically ill patients as well the proportion of severe and critical cases was greatest for the age group  1 year 106 and 1-5 years of age 73 with critical illness features including ards encephalopathy myocardial injury heart failure and circulatory shock case series from other centers and from other countries have underscored the potential impact of covid-19 on neonates infants children and adolescents 3740 there is also an impact on neonates born to mothers who are infected at the time of delivery 41in addition to early diagnosis and supportive care the american college of cardiology has emphasized the importance of cardiac complications in patients with covid-19 and their optimal management to include assisting other clinical specialties being prepared to treat critically ill patients with advanced medical and

parasitic infections as wellthe emergence of a new strain of coronavirus sars-cov-2 as a cause of covid-19 represents an unprecedented period in history for the lay medical and scientific communities while each is working closely together and learning from one-another additional efforts are needed the available information derived from case studies show that covid-19 has both direct and indirect cardiovascular effects ranging from cardiac injury to myocarditis arrhythmias respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and veno-venous ecmo and circulatory failure requiring inotropes vasopressors and veno-arterial ecmo clinicians must also be aware that covid-19 can over-shadow acute cardiac events including st segment elevation myocardial infarction 51 or delay treatment given current strains on emergency rooms and emergency medical services they must maintain an appropriate level of balanced full-field vision in the midst of a global event with a dominating presence in everyones mind last at the time of this writing there were 1528 references on the topic of sars-cov-2 and covid-19 cited in pubmed this represents a 1000  publication increase in the past 5 days while the wealth of information no doubt reflects an extraordinary level of interest and commitment to a world-wide health threat we must all be vigilant in our interpretation of the published literature its source level of scientific rigor and potential translation to scientific and clinical advancescoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by sars coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 those affected may develop fever a dry cough and fatigue1 an outbreak of the virus that causes covid-19 was first detected in wuhan city hubei province china however the source of the virus remains unknown2 as of march 11 2020 the world health organization declared the new coronavirus a global pandemic3 as of 1000cet march 29 china has reported 82356 confirmed cases including 3306 deaths globally 634835 confirmed cases were reported including 29957 deaths4 since the outbreak china has taken unprecedented powerful measures such as putting cities under lockdown or shutting down public transportation to contain the spread of the virus within china5 in a very short time 42000 medics rushed to the city of wuhan from the rest of the country thanks to these efforts the situation in china is now changing for the better unfortunately outside china many countries are facing an enormous challenge to fight against this highly infectious diseasein addition to the above measures chinas treatment protocol using integrated traditional chinese and western medicine also attracted increasing attention of the international community ever since the covid-19 outbreak chinas national health commission has issued seven versions of diagnosis and treatment protocol for covid-19
6 7 8 9 10 traditional chinese medicine treatment was included in the third version of integrative treatment protocol officially released on january 22 2020 clinical trial data have shown that integrated chinese and western medicine has good clinical efficacy for covid-19 and there might be a positive correlation between the patients recovery and involvement of traditional chinese medicine treatment11after the outbreak of covid-19 the national health commission of china issued the diagnosis and treatment protocol and recommended antiviral drug candidates the national administration of traditional chinese medicine recommended traditional chinese medicine based on pattern identification from the tcm perspective so far the protocol has been updated seven timesas of 2400 march 29 china has reported 81470 confirmed cases including 75770 recoveries 2396 active cases 633 severe cases and 3304 deaths the protocol classifies confirmed cases into mild moderate severe and critical and recommends the use of antiviral drugs that might work to combat covid-1912 for example chloroquine phosphate 500 mg bid for adults arbidol 200 mg tid for adults and combination of ribavirin with interferon or lopinavirritonavir there is no specific antiviral medicine yet to prevent or treat this condition these recommendations shown in table 1
 are based on the experience in treating the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mersright after the covid-19 outbreak traditional chinese medicine doctors across china rushed to the frontline of the epidemic to work with doctors of modern medicine to control the disease and collect clinical data from the tcm perspective this firsthand information is essential to pattern identification treatment recommendations and national prevention and treatment protocol their research paper was published online on january 29 202013as we learn more about covid-19 the protocol of traditional chinese medicine treatment is continuously updatingin trial version 3 there were no disease stages just four patterns and four recommended formulas for clinical referencein trial version 4 there were two periods medical observation for suspected cases and clinical treatment for confirmed cases the clinical treatment was further classified into four stages earlymild middlemoderate severe and convalescence the protocol recommended five types of chinese patent medicine for patients during medical observation these include huoxiang zhengqi wan agastache qi-correcting pills lianhua qingwen zhiji forsythiae and honeysuckle flower pestilence-clearing preparations shufeng jiedu keli wind-expelling and toxin-removing granules and fangfeng tongsheng zhiji saposhnikoviae heat-clearing preparations besides individualized traditional chinese medicine decoction the protocol also recommended four chinese medicine injections for patients during clinical treatment these include xiyanping injection xuebijing injection shenfu injection and shengmai injectionin trial version 6 the protocol recommended a specific formula for covid-19  qingfei paidu tang lung-cleansing  toxins-removing decoction along with modified formulas for different stages mild moderate severe critical and convalescence in addition fangfeng tongsheng zhiji was removed from the recommended lists of chinese patent medicine and four chinese medicine injections were added shown in table 2
 these include reduning injection tanreqing injection xingnaojing injection major ingredients moschus borneol fructus gardeniae etc and shenmai injection ingredients red ginseng and ophiopogon tuberthe understanding of pestilence has been documented throughout the history of traditional chinese medicine tcm these theories have evolved over time and played a significant role in epidemic control some examples of great creativity became the inspiration of modern medical breakthroughs such as variolation for the eradication of smallpox and the discovery of artemisinin for malaria from 243 bce to 1949 china suffered at least 500 devastating epidemic diseases unlike the antonine plaque 165-180 bce and spanish flu pandemic in 1918 that killed millions of lives epidemic disease in the history of china had been contained soon after the outbreaks over time these successful experiences contributed to an established system to infectious diseases intervention using herbal medicine non-drug therapies and numerous single or compound formulas or techniques such as the well-known artemisiae annuae for malaria and the use of variolation for smallpox in 2003 tcm and traditional medical physicians made a major contribution to combating sars in chinatraditional chinese medicine shares similar understandings of infectious diseases with modern medicine it believes that the emergence outbreak and threat of infectious diseases are closely associated with three interactive factors  epidemic pathogens pathogenic microorganism living environment and host human being shown in fig 1
most fundamental theories of traditional chinese medicine are founded on the huang di nei jing yellow emperors inner classic an ancient chinese medical text written in the 2nd century bce this text mentioned the idea of prevention before disease occurrence and the strategies of prevention of transmission after occurrence and prevention of recurrence after recovery the measures to prevent before disease occurrence includes staying away from the source of infection cutting off the route of transmission minimizing the environmental impact on susceptible population and building the bodys self-defending ability against pathogens after disease occurrence active measures need to be taken to prevent mild conditions from developing into severe or critical ones it is also important to take precautions to prevent recurrence upon recoveryin traditional chinese medicine the essential principles for disease prevention and treatment are to reinforce healthy anti-pathogenic qi and remove pathogenic qi and treat diseases according to three categories of etiological factors to reinforce healthy qi requires regulating the body functions achieving homeostasis and maximizing the bodys self-defending ability in addition to chinese medicine decoction or patent medicine nondrug intervention methods include acupuncture tuina chinese therapeutic massage qigong mental adjustment and nutrition to treat disease by three categories of three etiological factors requires the physician to conduct individualized precision intervention according to different timing geographic region and population groupsthe shang han lun treatise on cold damage written in the 2nd century is another classic text of traditional chinese medicine which preliminarily established the system of chinese herbal medicine this text recorded a total of 113 compound formulas and usage for infectious diseases like precision medicine these formulas are modified according to individual conditions as most of these formulas are directed at regulating the body functions they have also been widely used for noncommunicable diseases in china and japan they have survived the passage of time and are still regarded as having great relevance in todays environment the recommended formulas shown in fig 2
 in the chinese protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 have all been proven effective in the long history of combating infectious diseasesa search was performed on clinical trial registries of privately and publicly funded clinical trials worldwide we selected chinese clinical trial registries wwwchictrorgcn and us httpsclinicaltrialsgov our search strategy was designed to identify all the clinical trials that were registered for covid-19 the following search terms were used for our search to capture relevant studies 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov covid-19 sars-cov-2 novel coronavirus pneumonia in chinese the eligibility criteria were developed using the patient intervention comparison outcomes study type picos framework20up until march 25 2020 642 registered clinical trials on covid-19-related were retrieved from chinese clinical trial registry chinctr and clinicaltrialsorg among which 514 were registered in chinctr and 133 were about traditional chinese medicineintegrated traditional chinese and western medicine the research subjects of the 133 trials include confirmed cases mild moderate and convalescent suspected cases and those who had been in close contact with a confirmed case the planned sample size was 52744 cases the smallest sample size was 16 cases casecontrol study guangzhou the largest sample size was 20000 cases health service research chengdu 103 of the 133 trials were related to interventions including 13 nondrug therapies such as exercise and acupuncture among which 77 were randomized controlled clinical trials 7476 and only six were double-blind design conventional western medicine was used as control symptomatic treatment or standard treatment these trials measured 416 outcomes including 220 primary outcomes such as time to defervescence routine blood test pulmonary functions chest ct scan st georges respiratory questionnaire sgrq tcm patterns length of hospital stay and the viral negative-transforming time the top three research organizations for registered clinical trials on covid-19 were hubei university of traditional chinese medicine 13 trials shanghai university of traditional chinese medicine 12 trials and chengdu university of traditional chinese medicine 9 trials shown in table 3
ever since the outbreak of covid-19 epidemic ethical reviews have been performed on all related clinical studies to protect research participants on january 30 2020 the consensus on clinical trial management under the first-level response to major public health emergency was issued during the china forums of clinical research capacity building and human research participants protection cchrpd version 1021 this was followed by the consensus on clinical trial management under the first-level response to major public health emergency infectious diseases version 20 on february 2 202022 on february 13 2020 the operation instructions on using teleconference for ethical review was published on chinese medical ethics online23 on february 19 2020 the chinese version of guidance for managing ethical issues in infectious disease outbreaks was officially released by the institutional review board world federation of chinese medicine societies24 on february 25 the guideline on regulating clinical trials of covid-19 drugs among medical organizations was issued by the national ministry of science and technology25 on march 23 2020 chinese scholars published a paper on ethical review online in jama they summarized ethical committee reviews and found that the ethical approval during an epidemic outbreak was more quickly however the review standards were not lowered26according to a retrospective study on 1305 covid-19 cases treated in wuhan university tongren hospital between january 17 2020 and february 25 2020 patients who took chinese medicine preparations had a smaller death risk than those who did not 0273 p  005 severecritically ill patients had 74364 times increased death risk than patients with moderate conditions p  005 and patients with pre-existing medical conditions had 29420 times increased death risk p  00527 in addition we searched medline embase wanfang data and cnki manually removed papers irrelevant to traditional chinese medicine or clinical trials and retrieved 16 clinical trial papers on traditional chinese medicineintegrated traditional chinese and western medicine for covid-1928 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 involving a total of 1591 cases shown in table 4
 preliminary study findings have shown that integrated traditional chinese and western medicine had a shorter time to defervescence than standard western medicine treatment alone according to a study on 201 covid cases published in jama internal medicine on march 13 by researchers from several hospitals across china high fever was associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with ards43 the significance of defervescence is worthy of further study another retrospective analysis on 308 cases35 have suggested that after receiving traditional chinese medicine treatment all mild and moderate covid-19 cases recovered and none became severecriticalin terms of adverse reactions jinhua qinggan granules caused diarrhea in 3293 2782 of the patients18 zhang lj et al reported qingfei paidu decoction caused excessive sweating in 2 cases gastric pain in 20 causes nausea and vomiting in 8 cases diarrhea in 16 cases elevated serum transaminase in 11 cases palpations in 4 cases elevated blood pressure in 2 cases elevated blood sugar in 3 cases insomnia in 7 cases and skin allergy in 1 case the author advised modification for individual patients for example qingfei paidu decoction is not indicated for patients with a red tongue with scanty coating due to stomach yin deficiency it is also worth noting some adverse reactions are associated with the combination of western medication for example the serum transaminase can be restored normal after discontinuation of arbidol alone or discontinuation of both arbidol and qingfei paidu decoctionon march 18 drifa belhadi et al published a brief review of antiviral drugs evaluated in registered clinical trials for covid-19 in medrxiv44 their study underlines the need to register as much details as possible on clinical trials registries during outbreaks in order to inform the development of future trials and they believe reporting as much details as possible is key to have consistent clinical trials and to enhance the reproducibility of the results especially as studies are more often associated with a low number of planned inclusions and composite or weak outcomes that can limit the efficacy assessment of the treatments our study data found similar limitations in registered tcm clinical trialsas shown in table 4 except for three randomized controlled trials the rest of the published clinical studies are observational whose overall evidence is relatively low due to insufficient studies and a large heterogeneity in outcome measures it is too soon to conduct a systematic review higher levels of evidence are further needed to justify the efficacy of traditional chinese medicine treatment for covid-19 it is worth noting that it is challenging to conduct large-scale rcts during an ongoing pandemic especially the ethical issue of rcts with a double-blind design however it is a unique setting to prioritize the patients safety deliver precision treatment and at the same time conduct pilot studies in clinical researchsince viral pneumonia involves infection inflammation immune response blood coagulation tissue injury and genetic polymorphism ye et al constructed a component-target-pathway to analyze the components in lianhua qingwen capsules and pathways to boost immunity such as t cells b-cell receptor signaling natural killer nk cellmediated cytotoxicity and anti-inflammatory fc epsilon ri erbb and mapk signaling pathways of ten inflammatory and immune signals formononetin rutin emodin 8-o--d-glucoside hyperoside loganic acid salidroside are more important than the other components consequently lianhua qingwen capsules has antiviral effect as well as anti-inflammatory and immune mechanism of action46network pharmacological studies47 have suggested that the compound formula qingfei paidu decoction contains 948 chemical components which act via modulation of 790 potential target proteins the proteinprotein interactions may form a molecular network as modulations of these targets may regulate immunity-related and cytokine-related pathways inhibit the activation of cytokines and thus mediate overactive immune response and reduce inflammation multiple active components of chinese medicine have been found to protect organ damage from virus infection virus replication and secondary inflammatory factors liu w et al48 studied major chemical components in qingfei paidu decoction and tissue distribution in mice using uhplc-q-orbitrap hrms technology they identified 39 chemical components among which 9 can be rapidly absorbed and distributed over multiple tissues except for baicalin exhibited a peak value at 2 h or 4 h the serum and tissue concentrations of the other eight components in exhibited a peak value within 05 h at 05 h the exposed components in the lung tissues in sequence are ephedrine prunasin pseudoephedrine amygdalin hesperidin irisflorentin baicalin hyperin and liquiritin and the concentrations of ephedrine prunasin pseudoephedrine and baicalin remained high at 2 h and 4 h these findings provided pharmacokinetic information for its further efficacy study and clinical use previous studies have suggested that ephedrine pseudoephedrine and amygdalin have notable anti-inflammatory49 and immunomodulatory actions50 and therefore are main components in therapeutic drugs for respiratory disorders zhang et al51 found that amygdalin could protect acute lps-induced lung damage through inhibiting nf-b and nlrp3 signaling pathwaysnetwork pharmacology and molecular docking have also been used in potential targets and action mechanism of recommended formulas in the diagnosis and treatment protocol for covid-19

84 these chinese medicines and their components provided reference for anti-sars-cov-2 drug screening and clinical treatment as well as the rd of anti-coronavirus drugsuntil today there is no specific therapeutics and vaccines for covid-19 a new emerging infectious disease in such an epidemic context although high quality evidence is still needed to establish the safety and efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine us fda issued limited emergency use authorization for these two drugs to treat patients hospitalized with covid-19 during the fight against the outbreak of covid-19 in china traditional chinese medicine once again showed significant efficacies in alleviating symptoms and preventing disease deterioration it must be pointed out that the updated versions of traditional chinese medicine treatment in the protocol are based more on essential theories and clinical experience rather than high-quality clinical evidences most published tcm clinical studies are observational but the epidemic context is not an ideal setting to conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials historically traditional chinese medicine has been proven effective in combating epidemics of infectious disease despite its often-unknown mechanism of action and low level of evidence the tcm concepts and methods deserve attention for the management of sudden unexpected outbreaks of infectious diseases especially when there is no specific medicine to help cure the illnessthe covid-19 is a stark reminder of the ongoing challenge presented by emerging and re-emerging infectious pathogens the outbreak of this infection was not the first threat and will not be the last we need to be better prepared to cope with these infection outbreaks especially when there are no specific medicineapproaches for management according to traditional chinese medicine sars-cov-2 is the external cause of covid-19 however its contagion and severity are also associated with climate geographic regions and body functions as a result the tcm treatment strategy for infectious disease is to reinforce the anti-pathogenic qi and remove pathogenic factors this is similar to the concept of combining antiviral therapy with hdtin addition tcm doctors with their experience and understanding on infectious diseases can often notice special manifestations during an early stage that may not be considered by conventional medicine for example the traditional chinese medicine treatment in the trial version 3 protocol clearly stated that covid-19 cases do not necessarily develop a fever6 whereas conventional medicine lists fever as one initial symptom necessary to identify patients modern medicine also confirmed the predictive analytics of tcm for this infectious disease such as dampness tends to affect the spleen and stomach indicating the nature of virus and its effects on gastrointestinal tract and over time pathogens may also affect the heart in severe stage all these analyses are consistent to the autopsy report on the first patient who died of covid-1985 the diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary hyaline membrane formation as in ards pathologic pulmonary changes as in sars and mers mild liver fatty degeneration and abnormal hepatic lobules and portal vein by liver biopsy indicating liver damage might be induced by virus or drugs and presence of a small amount of inflammatory monocyte infiltration without substantial damage indicating the heart tissue is also affected by the virus another example is the association with gastrointestinal symptoms some covid-19 cases experienced diarrhea during an early stage which has later been confirmed by stool samples nucleic acid positive in fecal specimens or virus isolation indicating viral multiplication in the gastrointestinal tract upon infection of covid-1986 timely and effective communication between tcm and western medical doctors is helpful in managing infectious diseases like covid-19 furthermore tcm concepts may be beneficial to the identification of herbal active components useful as antiviral drugs tcm can thus help to improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseasesdespite the large number of registered clinical trials there are still many limitations we believe that it is necessary to avoid duplicate studies and conduct appropriate clinical trials to satisfy the rd characteristics of chinese medicine epidemic control and previous studies a rational design of clinical trials for covid-19 should put the patients interests first an emergency censorship policy should be set up during major public health events to mobilize and integrate resources to ensure reliable research findings87we also believe that the future advancement in tcm lies in getting high-quality evidence using modern scientific approaches to explore the scientific value in tcm therapies it is important to discover specific active herbal ingredients like artemisinin but it is equally important to highlight the synergistic effect of tcm via multidisciplinary approaches a chinese medicine formula no matter it contains a single ingredient or multiple ingredients is a complex system involving multiple ingredients targets and pathways despite its advantage in overall regulation it is inevitably challenging to study its effective components and assess its clinical safety and efficacy using the method to study a single chemical substance either in laboratories or a clinical setting however the particular tcm value cannot be overlooked simply because it is hard to be assessed scientificallythe ongoing studies of tcm on mechanism of action for covid-19 represent the future research orientations in chinese medicine these include the conservation and sustainable use of chinese medicine resource and studies on their active components and mechanism of action standardization and quality control techniques new compound chinese medicine efficacy evaluation and clinical studies and modern industrial technologies traditional chinese medicine is playing a significant role in the fight against covid-19 its essential theories and clinical experiences are worthy of further studies using modern concepts and approaches today with the help of big data technology systems biology integrative pharmacology network pharmacology and progress in computer chemistry and the life sciences we can now develop multidisciplinary and multi-tiered screening and evaluation to better understand the effective components action mechanism and pattern of prescriptionsthanks to clinical practice and in-depth basic studies we are closer to understanding sars-cov-2 some scholars believe it may not go away on its own consequently in addition to the development of a vaccine a good management option is to control its progression and prevent it from becoming severe or critical from the ongoing fight against covid-19 the integration of traditional chinese and modern medicine may be a wise choice since it can contribute to an all-around progress in human medicinethis study was sponsored by major new drug creation gcp platform construction for

14 15 16all authors declare that they have no conflicts of interestsviruses cannot replicate outside cells they therefore need access to the cells of a host organism before they can spread transmission of a zoonosis to humans implies the existence of a new route by which it infiltrates human cells the sars virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 in the lungs as receptor docking by means of the spikes on its envelope in the reninangiotensin system ace2 serves to counter the action of ace which is well known in pharmacology as a target structure for antihypertensives ace inhibitors ace2 can metabolize both angiotensin i and angiotensin ii the resultant angiotensin- 1 7 exerts an anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory action via the mas receptorgenome analysis of the new viruses has shown thatdespite a number of mutationsthere are structural analogies between the binding sites of the sars virus and sars-cov-2 for the new viruses too ace2 serves as receptor and thus as entry point to the human body 3 4 a crucial part is also played by a serine protease in the host cells this enzyme known as transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 enables fusion with the host cell and is thus an important factor in the dissemination of influenza viruses and coronaviruses in the cells of the human bodypotential candidates for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection are therefore peptides or small-molecular substances that block the membrane-associated enzyme ace2 or alternatively inhibitors of tmprss2 figure camostat an inhibitor of this protease is licensed in japan for treatment of chronic pancreatitis 4 but no clinical trials of camostat in coronavirus infection have yet been conducted among the clinical trials initiated to date one project is investigating the administration of recombinant ace2 enzyme to treat the infection table 1 soluble ace2 might slow the spread by competitive binding to the virus on the other hand ace2 antibodies might be a suitable means of blocking the viruss access to the patients cells 5according to preliminary reports the antimalarial drug chloroquine prevents the terminal glycosylation of ace2 moreover chloroquineor its derivative hydroxychloroquineincreases the ph in the endosomes involved in the uptake of the virus into the cells in cell cultures the replication of sars-cov-2 was inhibited at a chloroquine concentration ec50  concentration with half-maximal effect of 113 m 6 several clinical trials are investigating the efficacy and tolerability of chloroquine in the prevention and treatment of covid-19 table 1although vaccination strategies were developed in the context of previous epidemics such as sars and mers no vaccine for coronavirus infections is yet available potential vaccines are directed against the viral proteins the spike s protein is of particular interest as a possible antigen for vaccination because of its crucial role in viral dissemination different types of vaccines can be distinguished for instance they can contain inactivated viruses which induce neutralizing antibodies a plausible alternative is administration of rna- or dna-based vaccines with nucleic acids coding for the s protein in these cases the human organism produces the protein by which an immune response is induced subunit vaccines contain the s protein or another viral protein without carrier virus however the immunogenicity is relatively low so an adjuvant is needed vector-based vaccines comprise a protein eg the s protein that is coupled to non-replicating carrier virus particles this concept was pursued in the development of a vaccine for mers but no finished vaccine for this coronavirus infection ever became available in any case it will take some time until we have a vaccine for covid-19 it goes without saying that the safety of a vaccine is extremely important 7 8no specific treatment for covid-19 is yet known but the search for a suitable drug is well under way on 11 march 2020 84 trials were listed on wwwclinicaltrialsgov under the keyword covid-19 the substances under investigation range from immunomodulatory approaches with immunoglobulins interferon thalidomide and glucocorticoids to treatment with virustatics such as oseltamivir darunavir and umifenovir which was developed in russia for the treatment of influenza table 1 in view of the possibility of resistance developing it would certainly be desirable to have more than one option for treatment on the basis of experience with antiviral therapeutics to date it is to be expected that evolutionary mutations of the viral genome will endow sars-cov-2 with new properties including resistance to certain substancesglucocorticoid treatment was tried two decades ago in patients with sars but turned out not to be beneficial because it delayed elimination of the virus treatment with corticosteroids is also not recommended for covid-19 9 11 the nucleoside analog ribavirin was used at the beginning of the sars epidemic in 2002 this substance can be administered to treat infections with respiratory syncytial rs viruses or chronic hepatitis c in patients with sars it was usually given in combination with glucocorticoids clinically and also radiologically confirmed successful treatment was reported but none of the studies included a control group so it remains uncertain whether the medications took effect or whether recovery was spontaneous the situation is similar for the administration of some antiretrovirals such as lopinavir and nelfinavir that were developed for the treatment of hiv infectionthe protease inhibitor lopinavir has been usedtogether with a small booster dose of ritonavirto treat patients with covid-19 in the current pandemic five of 18 patients with worsening clinical symptoms received this medication in a singapore hospital improvement was seen in three patients but not in the other two details of the disease course were published but yielded no clear evidence for the potential efficacy of lopinavir 12 in wuhan 41 21 of 181 patients were treated with lopinavirritonavir but no decrease in virus excretion was seen 13a detailed report of the treatment of a 35-year-old man with covid-19 in the usa was published on 5 march 2020 14 this was the first instance of treatment with the as yet unlicensed nucleoside analog remdesivir the otherwise healthy patient first a cough and fever followed by vomiting and diarrhea four days after onset of the symptoms he was admitted to the hospital the initial treatment was unspecific with antipyretics such as ibuprofen and paracetamol chest radiography then indicated pneumonia upon which the antibiotics vancomycin and cefepime were given they were discontinued a day later however because the suspicion of bacterial pneumonia was not confirmed remdesivir was infused on the evening of day 11 the patient was no longer febrile the next day and could be discharged a few days later whether the recovery was effected by remdesivir or occurred spontaneously is unknown efficacy can be determined only in randomized controlled clinical trials large clinical studies of remdesivir were initiated in february 2020 and the first results can be expected in a few weeksno specific treatment has yet been developed for coronavirus infections despite the enormous advances in antiviral drug therapy in recent years chronic diseases such as infections with hiv or hepatitis b virus can now be treated with virustatics these substances bring about long-term suppression of viral replicationand in the case of chronic hepatitis c cure drugs are also available for acute viral infections treatment with aciclovir can save the life of a patient with herpes encephalitis nucleoside analogs may shorten the course of a herpes simplex infection but the effect tends to be minor in patients with an intact immune system the course of influenza can be slightly abbreviated by neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir but only if treatment is initiated very early as a number of placebo-controlled studies have shown no additional benefit is achievedin a patient with functioning immune defenseswhen administration of the drug is delayed to even just a few days after onset of infectionno account of pharmacotherapy for viral infections would be complete without a mention of the numerous setbacks that have occurred right at the beginning of the nucleoside era in the 1970s it was recognized that cytarabine could not be used as a virustatic in disseminated herpes despite its high antiviral activity dissemination of the virus persisted for longer in the treatment group than in the placebo group 15 decades later the nucleosides fialuridine and clevudine were tested for possible use against hepatitis b in both cases the treatment had to be discontinued owing to toxicity with long-term intake and research was abandoned 16 17 trials of various combinations for hiv infection were also discontinued because the treatments were insufficiently effective or poorly toleratedsome pharmacological substances are known to possess high activity against coronaviruses in vitro but their efficacy and tolerability remain to be explored since most cases of covid-19 run a mild course it has to be clarified whether administration of virustatics would be advisable in such cases and whether early initiation of treatment would be essential this requires careful consideration of the benefits versus the risks in most cases of covid-19 it first becomes clear after a few days whether the infection is spreading to the lower respiratory tract ie whether pneumonia will ensue trials are therefore necessary to determine whether efficacy can be demonstrated also when treatment is commenced laterthe first data on inhibition of sars-cov-2 by various substances in cell culture were published online on 4 february 2020 table 2 seven different pharmaceuticals were investigated in vero-e6 cells a renal cell line from primates the concentration that evoked a half-maximal response ec50 varied between 1 m and 100 m as shown in table 2 the nucleoside analog penciclovir had a relatively weak effect ec50 96 m favipiravir licensed for the treatment of influenza in japan exhibited moderate activity as did nafamostat a striking finding was the relatively high in vitro activity of nitazoxanide a drug that was developed mainly for the treatment of protozoal infections but also acts against some bacteria and viruses the highest activity under the experimental conditions described in this publication was displayed by remdesivir with an ec50 of 077 m and an ec90 of 176 m 1 m  06 mgl 6remdesivir is a nucleotide analog that is intracellularly metabolized to triphosphate 18 as well as ebolaviruses remdesivir inhibits coronaviruses and a range of other viruses 19 it was developed as a substance to treat ebola infection it was effective in an experiment on non-human primates but the results of a clinical trial in patients with ebola were not convincing after a preliminary analysis revealed that monoclonal antibodies offered better protection from a fatal outcome no further patients were treated with remdesivir the reasons for remdesivirs poor efficacy against ebola in this clinical trial remain unexplained 20in the past few weeks a number of clinical trials have been initiated to investigate the efficacy of remdesivir chloroquine and other substances against covid-19 table 1 since no specific treatment for this infection has yet been established and in the light of previous experience some of these trials are planned as placebo-controlled double-blind studies they differ with regard to their inclusion criteria eg severity of disease and time from diagnosis to randomization the first trials are expected to reach completion by the end of april 2020 details of all these studies can be found at wwwclinicaltrialsgovnone of the medications mentioned in this article is yet licensed for the treatment of covid-19 any administration of drugs approved for other indications constituted off-label use in an individual attempt to achieve cure that deviates from standard medical practice it is not yet known whether any of the the substances currently undergoing clinical testing will prove to be beneficial and have no adverse effectsthe outbreak of infection with a novel coronavirus is the latest reminder of the dangers associated with zoonoses several drugs are known to inhibit the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 in vitro since no treatment has yet proved efficacious the strengths and weaknesses of the new substances must be established in clinical trials until an effective therapy is developed the spread of sars-cov-2 must be restricted as far as possible and patients with severe covid-19 must be treated with the means at our disposalthe pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 continues to spread all over the world and has a significant impact on global public health and economies according to the covid-19 situation report published by the world health organization a total of 462 684 confirmed cases and 20 834 deaths were identified globally until march 26 20201 however there is no antiviral medication or vaccine of proven efficacy to treat or prevent human coronavirus infection hence the crucial and urgent need to identify effective safe and available treatment strategy for the diseasesars-cov-2 is a novel human coronavirus identified in 2019 it is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna beta-coronavirus and is structurally similar to sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov which were identified in the 2003 sars and 2012 mers outbreak respectively2 considering the threat of the covid-19 epidemic and past experience with the treatment of sars and mers many efforts in vaccine and treatment strategy development are being made vigorously this review focuses on the potential therapeutic agents that have been reported with experience in treating sars-cov-2 infectionlopinavirritonavir lpvrtv are antiretroviral protease inhibitors used in combination for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection since 2000 rtv is used together with lpv to increase the lpv half-life via inhibition of cytochrome p450 and acts only as its pharmacokinetic enhancer3 lpv acts against the viral 3-chymotrypsin-like protease and has been reported with promising results against sars-cov-1 and mers-cov46 lotus china trial lopinavir trial for suppression of sars-cov-2 in china which is a randomized controlled open-label study was initiated to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral lpvrtv for sars-cov-2 infection in 199 adult patients hospitalized with severe covid-19 patients were randomized in a 11 ratio to receive either lpvrtv 400 mg100 mg twice a day in addition to standard care n  99 or standard care alone n  100 for 14 days the result showed no difference in clinical improvement between the two groups hazard ratio  124 95 ci 090 to 172 mortality at 28 days was also similar in both groups 192 vs 250 95 ci 173 to 57 the author concluded that no benefit was observed with lpvrtv treatment beyond standard care in adult patients hospitalized with severe covid-197remdesivir rdv is a novel antiviral drug developed by gilead sciences originally for the treatment of ebola virus disease and marburg virus infections rdv is an adenosine nucleotide analogue with broad-spectrum antiviral activity which acts as an inhibitor of rna-dependent rna polymerases rdrps8 rdv inhibits viral replication through premature termination of rna transcription and has been demonstrated to improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral loads in mice infected with mers-cov9 a recent in vitro study indicated that rdv potently inhibited sars-cov-2 ec50  077 m in vero e6 cells10 a single case report by holshue et al11 described clinical improvement after rdv used to treat the first us case of covid-19 there are several randomized

cq and hydroxychloroquine h0 are aminoquinolines which have been used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases for over 50 years these two drugs are weak diprotic bases and can elevate the ph of the endosome which prevents viral fusion into the cell14 recent in vitro studies reported cq and hcq against sars-cov-2 at a multiplicity of infection moi of 001 with ec50  271 and 451 m in vero e6 cells respectively15 several clinical trials are being conducted in china to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cq and hcq in covid-19 one of which revealed that chloroquine is superior to the control group in clinical improvement promoting virus-negative conversion and shortening the disease course16 meanwhile the preliminary study in france evaluated the efficacy of hcq in covid-19 patients there were two groups in this study 26 patients received hcq 200 mg tid for 10 days and 16 patients received standard of care six hcq group patients lost to follow up due to early cessation of treatment six patients in hcq group received additional azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 250 mg once daily for 4 days to prevent bacterial superinfection the result showed the virologically cured rate was significantly higher in hcq combined with azithromycin-treated patients compared with the hcq only group or control group 100 vs 571 vs 125 p  000117 although this study demonstrated promising results further larger trials are still needed to verify the efficacy and safety of hcq alone or in combination with azithromycin in covid-19 in addition hcq as postexposure prophylaxispreemptive therapy for sars-cov-2 infection is now under evaluation in the usa nct04308668 using the regimen of 800 mg orally once followed in 6 to 8 hours by 600 mg then 600 mg once a day for four consecutive days the

chictr2000029387 is currently being conductedinterleukin il-6 was reported to be released considerably in sars and mers patients and might play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases2324 a recent report on the clinical features of covid-19 patients also found higher plasma levels of cytokines in intensive care unit icu patients25 tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody which acts as il-6 receptor antagonist and is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis26 one study in china recruited 21 patients with severe or critical covid-19 75 of patients had lowered their need for oxygen supplement after receiving tocilizumab 400 mg once through iv infusion three patients had another dose administered due to continued fever within 12 hours nineteen patients discharged on average 135  31 days hospitalization time after the treatment with tocilizumab27 the us food and drug administration fda also approved a phase iii clinical trial for evaluating tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia nct04320615 meanwhile sarilumab which is another il-6 receptor antagonist has also launched phase iiiii clinical trial to evaluate its efficacy in patients with severe covid-19 infection nct04315298the spread of covid-19 is continuing at a rapid pace as confirmed cases exceed 460 000 until march 26 2020 measures to stop the pandemic through discovering and identifying effective treatment or prophylactic agents are crucial to date several agents have demonstrated with some efficacy to covid-19 in humans but mostly through case reports or preliminary data from clinical trials with small sample sizes many ongoing randomized controlled trials are currently being conducted to further confirm these results with the joint effort of the healthcare professionals and the scientific community worldwide new evidence for managing covid-19 is expected to be revealed shortly although the potential treatment agents discussed here may provide clinical benefits it should also be noted that each of the medications may lead to substantial side effects healthcare professionals should take great caution during practicecoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is an acute respiratory infection disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars coronavirus 2 or sars-cov-2 that was first identified in december 2019 in wuhan hubei china the incidence of covid-19 has grown dramatically in china and the virus has rapidly spread to more than 200 countries of the world since the late february 2020 on 28 feb 2020 world health organization raised the global covid-19 risk to highest level covid-19 outbreak has become a potential threat to the global public health the impact of economic burden imposed by covid-19 is substantial and considerable in medical resources quarantine measures restriction of trade disruption of production loss of job deteriorated finance etc indeed this pandemic highlights the need for effective therapeutics for sars-cov-2 infections that can improve patients clinical conditions although mountains of novel findings on covid-19 are accumulating the pathogenesis of covid-19 remains to be fully elucidated for development of better intervention strategies in this review we will give a general overview of the existing studies on the epidemiology virology clinical presentation pathophysiology diagnosis and treatment of sars-cov-2 infectioncovid-19 cases were firstly reported in wuhan city hubei province china in september 2019 from then on cases have been distributed globally except for antarctica by june 12th 2020 more than 75 00000 confirmed cases of covid-19 have been reported approximately 3500000 cases were cured and more than 421000 infected people were died with global death-to-cases ratio 561 updated cases throughout the world can be found in the following websites httpscoronavirusjhuedumaphtml
and
httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019situation-reportsestimation of the incubation period and viral shedding duration is helpful to assess the risk of transmission make measures of isolation and quarantine and provide rational antiviral interventions for treating patients based on the current epidemiological investigations the incubation period of covid-19 is about 1-14 days with a median time of 3-7 days and can be up to 24 days in a tiny minority of cases from exposure to symptoms onset 1 2 3 viral shedding may begin 2-3 days before the presence of the first symptom 4 median duration of viral shedding has found to be 200 days and the longest duration could be up to 37 days in survivors while the viral rna in non-survivors could be detected until death 5 in the cases of severe covid-19 patients the median duration of viral shedding has shown to be 310 days from illness onsetnovel coronavirus is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplet aerosol direct or indirect contact several studies have provided epidemiological evidences that human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus in family hospitals and even across cities were occurred 6 7 8 guan et al found that patterns of human-to-human transmission included familial aggregation 6 asymptomatic virus carrier 9 and the three-phase outbreak 10 which were in accordance with other findings the super-spreaders may occur in this pandemic 1 prominently infected persons without symptoms during the incubation period could be sources of infection suggesting the asymptomatic transmission of sars-cov-2 911 12 13 14 15 the rapid and uncontrollable spread of this virus may ascribe to the silent transmission by some patients with atypical symptomsmore and more evidences have proved that this virus can spread through multiple routes as well to et al detected the self-collected saliva a non-invasive specimen by one-step real-time rt-qpcr assay targeting the s protein 6 they obtained the positive results that were consistent with those detected through nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens which may be due to the infection of epithelial cells in saliva gland ducts or the secretions from nasopharynx and lung in the saliva therefore virus in saliva may allow transmission via speaking or coughing 16zhang et al firstly reported the presence of viral nucleotide in anal swabs and blood during the later stage of infection the level of viral rna was higher in anal swab than in blood suggesting the possibility of multiple routes transmission of virus including oral-fecal or body fluid route17 studies of xiao et al have shown that the viral rna tested in feces was positive even in gastrointestinal tracts was negative 18 another two findings emphasized that the diarrhea as onset symptom should not be ignored and the fecal-oral transmission route should be taken seriously 1920 chen et al analyzed the viral rna levels in pharyngeal swab blood and the anal swab by real-time pcr the concentrations of viral rna in blood and anal swabs were positively correlated with the severity of covid-19 since the spike protein of novel coronavirus interacts with the host ace2 receptor for viral attachment and entry to establish infection the presence of viral rna in digestive tract in which ace2 is abundantly expressed confirmed the viral replication in extrapulmonary sites early detection of viral rna in the blood and digestive tract may be helpful in predicting the progression of covid-19 21a clinician who wore an n95 mask but not safety goggles was infected with sars-cov-2 while working with covid-19 patients in wuhan suggesting the potential transmission through mucous membranes in the eyes 22 despite no detectable viral rna was in the conjunctival swabs samples from infected patients reported in the further studies 23 deng et al have confirmed that sars-cov-2 could be transmitted through ocular conjunctival route in a rhesus macaques model cautioning us the necessity of eye protection to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 24chen et al reported potential vertical transmission in nine pregnant women with laboratory confirmed covid-19 infection when the newborns were delivered by caesarean section amniotic fluid cord blood throat swabs from newborns and breastmilk were collected for testing and all of them were negative for the novel coronavirus currently there is no conclusive evidence supporting that women with covid-19 in the late trimester of pregnancy could cause intrauterine infection due to vertical transmission however this investigation is restricted to the small number of cases and the pregnant women in the third trimester 2526 it should be noted that infants and pregnant women remain susceptible to covid-19 infection special care should be taken to prevent neonatal infections from mothers with covid-19overall the above studies warn the virus transmission through multiple routes including respiratory tract alimentary tract nasolacrimal system oral-fecal and body fluid route and that the potential maternal-fetal vertical transmission should not be ignored the properties of viral shedding before symptoms appear and via multiple routes indicate the strong infectiousness of sars-cov-2 and pose a huge challenge in controlling the spread of diseasesars-cov-2 belongs to the family coronaviruses and subgenus sarbecovirus beta-cov lineage b and is a new strain virus distinct from severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov the genome sequence of sars-cov-2 shows more than 85 identity to a bat sars-like cov bat-sl-covzc45 mg7729331 27 its genome is a positive-sense single-stranded rna of about 30 kb with structured untranslated region utr on the 5-end poly a on the 3-end and 11 open reading frames encoding 27 proteins the gene order is as follows 5 utr nt 1-265-replicase orf1ab nt 266-21555-spike nt 21563-25384-orf3a nt

proteins orf3a orf6 orf7a orf7b orf8 orf10  28 29 30 31 currently more than 40000 sars-cov-2 genomes publicly available httpswwwgisaidorg
httpsbigdbigaccnncovreleasegenome  represent the genomic diversity of the virus in the world though all sequenced sars-cov-2 genomes share more than 99 similarity it has been found that there are at least two hypervariable genomic hotspots one is a silent mutation in the orf1ab the other one is an amino acid polymorphism serineleucine in orf8 which is predicted to induce structural disorder of the protein in the c-terminal portion 30 149 mutations were identified in 103 sars-cov-2 genome sequences and through population genetic analyses investigators uncovered two major types of sars-cov-2 in circulation l and s type based on two tightly linked snps at position 8782 and 28144 the s type 30 is the ancestral version while l type 70 is derived from s type although l type is more prevalent and more aggressive in the outbreak based upon the evolution of novel coronavirus there may be great distinctions in transmissibility pathogenicity and virulence between s and l type 32 forster et al analyzed 160 complete sars-cov-2 genomes by phylogenetic network and found three central variants named a b and c the genome of type a is the most closely related to the bat coronavirus which is supposed to be the root of the outbreak type a is mainly found in united states and australia type b is distinguished from type a by two mutations t8782c and c28144 t and is prevalent in wuhan and east asia it seems that type b is resistant outside ease asia populations since type b is not intended to spread outside east asia without further mutated type c is derived from type b by the mutation g26144 t and mainly found in europeans and also found in singapore hong kong taiwan and south korea but absent in mainland china 33in addition to the viral mutations mentioned above the human genetic variation may partly contribute to the geographical variations in the prevalence and mortality of covid-19 pandemicdelanghe et al have investigated the role of the di polymorphism in intron 16 of hosts angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 ace1 in the epidemiology of covid-19 infections prevalence and mortality data of the covid-19 infections from european african mediterranean middle east and asian countries were included in the study they found that the frequency of ace1 d-allele was negatively correlated with prevalence of covid-19 suggesting the confounded role of ace1 di polymorphism in the circulation of sars-cov-2 and the outcome of the infection 34 35 36 37 while complement component 3 c3 polymorphism a central component of the innate immune system has been found to be a principal component of gene frequencies among european populations and a crucial determinant for covid-19 prevalence and mortality 37 dais paper suggested infected patients carrying a allele of abo blood group type especially those with cardiovascular diseases in particular hypertension tend to develop severe covid-19 38 sars-cov-2 virion particles are enveloped roughly spherical or moderately polymorphic with diameter ranging from 80-160 nm 39 sars-cov-2 has four structural proteins including spike s envelope e membrane m and nucleocapsid n proteins necessary for virion particle formation and four highly conserved nonstructural proteins including papain-like protease plpro nsp3 3cl-protease 3clpro nsp5 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp nsp12 and helicase nsp 13 40 that are needed for viral rna replication 4142 the n protein forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with viral rna the s protein is responsible for virus entry to the host cell by binding to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the width of the s protein is about 7 nm and the length is about 23 nm 39 s protein has unique insertion of four amino acids prra which is a furin-like or tmprss2 cleavage site 4344 s protein can be cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits when the s1 subunit is dissociated s2 undergoes a conformational change extending itself from a compressed form to a nail shape s1 is the receptor binding domain that helps the virus attach to the surface of the host cell then the cellular proteases prime the s protein and cleave it at specific site thereby promoting the s2 mediated fusion process of virus with host cell membrane the incorporation of prra resulting in the cleavage of s protein and triggering fusion distinguished from other beta-coronaviruses may greatly affect the regulation of the pathogenicity and transmissibility of sars-cov-2 4546understanding how sars-cov-2 hijacks the host cells during infection is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies a global collaboration have identified 332 high-confidence interactions between sars-cov-2 proteins and human proteins these protein interactions participate in several complexes and biological processes including dna replication epigenetic and gene expression regulators vesicle trafficking lipid modification rna processing and regulation ubiquitin ligases signaling nuclear transport machinery cytoskeleton mitochondria and extracellular matrix around 40 of these interacting proteins were bound up with endomembrane compartments or vesicle trafficking pathways the sars-cov-2 main protease nsp5 may affect the transport of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria some viral proteins also showed interaction with natural immune signaling proteins involved in ifn pathway nf-b pathway etc which may take part in cytokine storm 69 compounds were found to target these protein interactions including fda approved drugs compounds in clinical trials and preclinical compounds based on screening assays two broad sets of drugs and compounds mrna translation inhibitors and sigma1 and sigma2 receptor modulators were showed to exert antiviral activity 47the clinical manifestations of covid-19 range from asymptomatic infection to flu-like illness such as fever cough dry cough and fatigue to pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome and even multi-organ failures with high morbidity and mortality the clinical diversity of non-specific signs and symptoms is poorly understood and seems to be correlated to the age underlying comorbidities and immunity status of the individualwang et al reported 138 hospitalized cases of 2019-ncov infected pneumonia in which most patients had fever fatigue dry cough lymphopenia prolonged prothrombin time and higher level of lactate dehydrogenase 14 specifically abnormal coagulation features including higher d-dimer and fibrin degradation product levels longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are significantly associated with poor prognosis 48 chest ct scans in the lungs of all patients showed ground glass opacity or bilateral patchy shadows 14 but a larger scale of research on 1099 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces throughout china showed that a certain amount of patients did not have fever or abnormalities on chest ct making the diagnosis more complicating 1 severe patients who received intensive care unit icu care were more likely to have two or more underlying comorbidities that usually associated with poor clinical outcomes hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes were the most common comorbidities while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd was less common other comorbidities include pharyngeal pain dizziness abdominal pain dyspnea anorexia cerebrovascular diseases hepatitis b infections chronic kidney diseases and malignancy and complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome 47 arrhythmia and shock 1449the fact that sars-cov could attack the nervous system was confirmed by the viral genome sequence detected in the infected patients cerebrospinal fluid in the findings of mao et al more than 30 patients showed the neurological manifestations including central nervous system symptoms headache dizziness disturbance of consciousness epilepsy etc peripheral nervous system symptoms decreased taste decreased smell decreased appetite neuralgi etc and skeletal muscle injury the neurological symptoms were more frequent in severe patients than in non-severe patients it is worth noting that the first symptoms of some patients occurred in the nervous system such as facial paralysis hallucinations etc the virus circulation in the blood and crossing the blood-brain barrier as well as the highly expression levels of ace2 in vascular endothelial cells of nervous system and in smooth muscle cells of skeletal muscle may contribute to the viral infection in nervous system 50 on march 4 a 56-year-old covid-19 patient in china was firstly reported to present with viral encephalitis httpswwwcaixinglobalcom2020-03-06new-research-sparks-debate-over-whether-coronavirus-can-infect-the-nervous-system-101524986html though this is a rare case in terms of clinical treatment it provides some important indications when the central nervous system is infected cerebral edema or even hernia may occur which is life-threatening it is necessary to monitor the neurological indicators to avoid the death since the primary damage of sars-cov-2 infection is mainly in the lungs whether viral infection leading to pathological damage in other tissues and organs is primary or secondary remains to be further investigatedlaboratory abnormalities provide some vital implications that may serve as predictors for severity of disease older age higher sequential organ failure assessment score and levels of d-dimer greater than 1 gml were three potential risk factors related to poor prognosis as reported by zhou et al 5 white blood cells count neutrophil count and levels of d-dimer creatine kinase and creatine were higher in icu patients compared to non-icu patients 14 liu et al found that the viral load of sars-cov-2 from patients respiratory tracts was positively correlated to the lung disease severity albumin percentage of lymphocytes and neutrophils lactate dehydrogenase and c-reactive protein were highly associated to the acute lung injury and may be useful to predict the disease severity notably the angiotensin ii levels in the plasma of the infected patients were markedly higher than that in healthy persons and strongly related to viral load and pulmonary injury suggesting the potential treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers for covid-19 51ones own immunity serves as a powerful defense against pathogens imbalance of immune function occurs if the immune system of the individual to the infection is less active or hyperactive than normalduring the sars-cov-2 infection the induced responses are two phased fig 1
 in the viral response phase virus infected cells activate an innate immune response recruiting neutrophils macrophages and monocytes to clear the virus the specific immune response priming the adaptive t and b cell subsequently is required to promote in most cases of incubation and mild to moderate stages normally this process is able to resolve the infection however in some cases virus can inhibit the inherent immunity and thus evade the acquired immune response this imbalance of immune function occurs resulting in propagation of virus and damage of tissues xu et al reported that the counts of peripheral cd4 and cd8 t cells of a patient with severe immune injury caused by covid-19 were reduced but their status was hyperactivated 52 zhang et al reported a couple cases and found that the levels of immune cells cd3 cd4 cd8 cd19 and cd1656 were declined during the onset period of infection cd19 and cd1656 cells the cytotoxic natural killer cells exerting antiviral activity were increased when the patients condition obtained improvement suggesting the predictor role of cd19 and cd1656 as progression of infection 53in the host inflammatory response phase damaged cells caused by sars-cov-2 infection in the lungs induce inflammation that is mainly regulated by pro-inflammatory macrophages and granulocytes hyperactive immune response of the individual to the infection may trigger a cytokine storm resulting in life-threatening widespread pulmonary inflammation huang et al reported that cytokine storm was closely related to the disease severity in sars-cov-2 infection initial concentrations of il1b il1ra il7 il8 il9 il10 basic fgf gcsf gmcsf ifn ip10 mcp1 mip1a mip1b pdgf tnf and vegf in plasma were higher in infected patients than in healthy persons among the infected patients levels of il2 il7 il10 gcsf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf in plasma were higher in icu patients as compared to non-icu patients 54 however the questions that remains unanswered are how does the body perceive the virus and release cytokines why and how higher levels of cytokines cause the deterioration of clinical conditions and even mortality which cytokines and their pathways can be potential therapeutic targets in response to viral infections the host needs to effectively mobilize the immune system to clear virus and avoid the cytokine storm triggered by over activation our understanding of virus-induced cytokine storms and the balance between immune system and virus is still limited to address these problems we still have a long way to gocurrently nucleic acid testing kits are commercial available and still the gold standard to confirm the presence of the sars-cov-2 chus group has established two one-step quantitative reverse transcription-pcr assays primers binding to the orf1b and n genes of subgenus sarbecoviruses respectively were used to amplify the viral genome but these developed assays couldnt distinguish sars-cov sars-cov-2 and other sarbecoviruses further sequence analyses of amplicons that are positive in rt-pcr results are required to confirm the species 55 shirato et al have developed two nested rt-pcr assays with primers bounding to the orf1 and s protein and two real-time rt-pcr assays with primers binding to the sequence encoding n protein successfully detecting 25 sars-cov-2 positive infected patients in japan 56 corman et al have designed a workflow for diagnosis of novel coronavirus without the virus isolates available making use of the genetically similarity to 2003 sars-cov and synthetic nucleic acid technology they have developed three rt-pcr assays as follows primers binding to e gene can detect bat-associated sars-related coronaviruses specific probe hybridizing to rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp was used to make a distinction between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov the rt-pcr assay designed to amplify the region of n gene was less sensitive so that it was not further validated 57normally the throat and nasal swab in the upper respiratory tract of the patients are sampled for nucleic acid testing which is fast and convenient for physicians to operate and causes no trauma to the patients nonetheless novel coronavirus mainly infects the lower respiratory tract and the viral load in the upper respiratory tract may not be high enough for detection resulting in false negatives 58 in addition given the viral replicative activity is influenced by the host immune system it is possible that one has clinical symptoms but the quantity of virus is not sufficient for detection leading to the occurrence of false negative results as well whats more the progression and severity of pneumonia cannot be concluded based on the real-time rt pcr results infected patients with false negative rna results bring enormous challenges for medical workers to provide appropriate treatment and take isolation measures in time diagnosing the confirmed covid-19 cases merely by nucleic acid testing is obviously not accurate enoughthe most common manifestations of chest ct in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia are ground glass opactities and patchy consolidation in bilateral lungs according to the distributions and types of lesions chest ct manifestations can be divided into three stages at the early stage only a single ground-glass opacity or irregular solid nodules of varying sizes can be seen as the infection progresses ground-glass opactities with a rounded morphology reticulation or crazy paving pattern and patchy parenchyma or mixed consolidation distributed in the middle and peripheral area of bilateral lungs may present nodules involving multiple lobes are increased and enlarged a few patients may have small pleural effusions when the disease progresses to a critical stage more extensive pulmonary consolidation and ground-glass opactities diffuse pulmonary lesions increased density of bilateral lungs and even white lung may appear pleural effusions lymphadenopathy and an air bronchogram sign may present in a small number of patients 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 a clinical trial involving in using ct scores to predict the mortality of patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia have been completed nct04284046it is not surprising that patients have false negative results in nucleic acid testing but the ct images show some features of novel coronavirus infection 65 therefore in the latest edition of chinas diagnosis and treatment guidelines for new coronavirus pneumonia chest ct scan is one of the clinical diagnosis standards of suspected cases and the nucleic acid testing kit is then used to make a clinical diagnosis of confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infectionnot as nucleic acid testing or chest ct images that can detect acute infection antibody tests detects the person ever infected especially those with asymptomatic infection igg and igm antibodies in serum of sars-cov-2 infected patients arise simultaneously or sequentially within around 1 to 3 weeks after illness onset 66 n and different forms of s protein are the major antigens for detecting the antibodies induced by sars-cov-2 infection different types of assays for antibody testing can be applied to assess different aspects of immunological response and function of antibodies induced by virus infectionzhao et al have developed a serology elisa kit using cho cell expressing fully glycosylated full length sars-cov-2 s1 protein for surveillance of the infection at the early stage glycosylation of s1 protein is important to facilitate the protein folding properly and increase the proteins affinity to the receptor ensuring the great sensitivity and high specificity of the elisa kit 67 padoan et al have developed a chemiluminescence immunoassay using maglumitm 2000 plus for simultaneously detecting sars-cov-2 iggigm in sera using this system serum tubes with a gel separator can be the primary samples for direct viral inactivation which is safe for the operators they measured the kinetics of immunoglobulin time and showed the rapid increase of igm and igg on 6-7 days since the symptom onset 68 perera et al have developed an elisa assay using recombinant receptor-binding domain of the s protein for screening the sars-cov-2 infection and plaque reduction neutralization tests using live virus for confirming the induced protective immunity this strategy could be used to evaluate infection attack rates in the population and estimate the severity of illness and herd immunity 69 nie et al have developed a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay using a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudovirus production system for determining neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 full-length spike protein of sars-cov-2 was pseudotyped in the virus mimicking the viral attachment and entry during infectious process this assay is much safe and can be performed in bsl-2 laboratories 70except for the methods mentioned above other diagnosis methods are expected to increase the detection rates of infection a clinical trial on evaluation of rapid diagnostic kit detecting igmigg for novel coronavirus pneumonia is ongoing in china chictr2000029870 crispr-cas system applied as a diagnostic tool is characterized by fast speed highly specificity and sensitivity hou et al have developed a rapid diagnostic assay based on crispr-cas13a with a near single-copy sensitivity for sars-cov-2 detection 71 zhang et al have published a detailed protocol using the crispr-based sherlock system for detection of covid-19 without pcr amplification the results can be read out in less than an hour httpswwwbroadinstituteorgfilespublicationsspecialcovid1920detection20updated pdflamb et al have developed a rapid diagnostic test for covid-19 virus using revers transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp that can be applied to rapidly detect the virus in serum urine saliva oropharyngeal swabs and nasopharyngeal swabs in 30 minutes 72 yu et al have established an isothermal lamp based system coupled with a ph indicator allowing the colorimetric detection for covid-19 coronavirus ilaco this ilaco is rather sensitive that can detect as low as 10 copies of the targeted orf1ab gene in 15-40 minutes compared to rt-pcr these two approaches are more rapid accurate and can be conducted with limited facilities 73remdesivir as a nucleotide analogue inhibiting rna-dependent rna polymerase has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activities against rna viruses including sars-cov mers-cov and ebola virus 4074 xiaos group firstly found that remdesivir and chloroquine are potently effective against sars-cov-2 infection with rather low ec50 value and high selective index in vitro 75 notably intravenously administration of remdesivir after development of pneumonia remarkably improved clinical condition reported in the first case of novel coronavirus infection in the united states 76 though this could not be definitely ascribed to the effect of the drug currently clinical trials are ongoing evaluating the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild moderate nct04252664 and severe nct04257656 covid-19 up to now several results of clinical trials on the efficacy of remdesivir for covid-19 have published beigel et al have reported a multicenter trial enrolling 1063 patients that conducted in 60 sites and 13 subsites globally 77 in the remdesivir treated group the time to recovery was significantly shorter compared to the placebo nct04280705 gilead sciences company reported the improved clinical outcomes of the patients with severe covid-19 treated with remdesivir in a compassionate-use program no new safety signal was observed during the therapy 78 in contrast in a multicenter trial conducted at ten hospitals in hubei china use of remdesivir in severe covid-19 patients was not statistically significantly correlated to improve the time to clinical improvement mortality or time to eliminate virus 79 the opposite clinical outcomes resulting from various studies may mainly ascribe to different clinical parameters setting outcome measures and eligibility criteria for enrollment larger sample sizes and more rigorous clinical trial designs are required to further confirm the potency of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 infectionarbidol is licensed in russia and china mainly for treatment of influenza infection and other respiratory viral infections 80 it is both a direct-acting antiviral and host-targeting agent with broad-spectrum activity interacting with membrane and viral or cellular proteins exerting inhibition ability involved in viral entry viral fusion replication assembly budding and stimulation of host immune responses 81 in february 2020 li lanjuan a famous chinese epidemiologist claimed that arbidol and darunavir in preliminary tests could inhibit the replication of new coronavirus in vitro she proposed using arbidol and darunavir for treating pneumonia patients suffering from sars-cov-2 infection prominently novel coronavirus infected patients in wuhan and shanghai receiving arbidol showed significant signs of improvement in pneumonia 5382 phase iv clinical trials involving arbidolarbidol hydrochloride alone or in combination with interferon atomization oseltamivir or lopinavirritonavir for treatment of sars-cov-2 viral pneumonia are under investigation nct04255017 nct04260594 nct04254874lopinavirritonavir is a fixed dose combination medication approved by fda acting as a potent protease inhibitor for hiv-1 infection 83 lopinavirritonavir are potential candidates for sars-cov and mers-cov infection 8485 molecular dynamics simulations studies have showed that lopinavirritonavir could bind to the active site of sars-cov 3clpro 86 an open clinical trial conducted in hong kong during the sars-cov outbreak in 2003 revealed that patients treated with lopinavirritonavir had a lower viral load and were associated with better clinical outcomes and fewer adverse effect 84 lopinavirritonavir combined with recombinant interferon beta-1b is also being investigated for treatment of mers-cov infection nct02845843 87 since the protein sequence of main protease of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are closely related with 96 identity it is possible that lopinavirritonavir can be applied to novel coronavirus infection however a clinical trial conducted in hospitalized adult patients with severe covid-19 in china showed no benefit with lopinavirritonavir treatment over standard care chictr2000029308 88 whether combination of lopinavirritonavir with other antivirals would have improvement of clinical outcomes remains to be further determinedchloroquine a fda-approved drug for anti-malarial and autoimmune disease 89 is also known as a potent antiviral of sars-cov infection in vitro for interrupting the glycosylation of cell surface receptor ace2 90 chloroquine also showed inhibitory effect on the replication of mers-cov in vitro 91 recently chloroquine were tested against sars-cov-2 with ec90 at low micromolar concentration and may restrict the viral entry and post entry processes in vitro 75 chloroquine is an immunomodulation agent that may enhance its antiviral activity as well in light of the safety and potent efficacy clinical study testing chloroquine against pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 is being conducting nct04261517 preliminary results from the multicenter clinical trials conducted in china have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate effectively inhibited the progression of pneumonia eliminated the virus and shortened the duration of diseases without any severe adverse effects 9293 however data of an open label randomized controlled trial conducted in china chictr2000029868 enrolling patients with mild to moderate covid-19 and two observational studies involving a large number of consecutive hospitalized patients with covid-19 in new york city did not support the use of hydroxychloroquine because it was not associated with either a significantly higher or lower risk of intubation or death or lower in-hospital mortality 94 95 96 in the absence of evidence of therapeutic effects we particularly need to understand whether the drugs safety risks are worth takingace2 an important regulatory component in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system raas not only mediates virus infection but also directly participates in the progression of acute lung injury that highly correlated with the high mortality 97 sars-cov-2 infection has been shown to significantly reduce the expression of ace2 in lung resulting in aggravated acute lung injury conversely overexpression of ace2 in the knockdown mice model of acute respiratory distress syndrome offered some protection suggesting the potential therapeutic effect of rhace2 in sars-cov-2 infection 98 on the one hand elevated expression of ace2 may increase the risk of viral infection on the other hand higher expression of ace2 may have a protective effect against acute lung injury so far the exact role of ace2 expression remains unknown and the impacts on susceptibility of sars-cov-2 and prognosis of patients need more basic and clinical studies for further confirmation nct04287686except for ace2 as a receptor of host cells for sars-cov-2 attachment and entry it is reported that cd147 which expresses in many human cell types including epithelial cells endothelial cells and leukocytes also facilities the invasion of sars-cov-2 via binding to spike protein 99 blocking the interaction between spike protein of sars-cov-2 and cd147 via anti-cd147 humanized antibody was proved to be able to inhibit the replication of sars-cov-2 in vitro offering a novel target for antiviral therapy nct04275245 100methylprednisolone is a corticosteroids medication for inhibiting the immunity and reducing inflammation 101 new coronavirus infected patients are complicated by acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome which are partly caused by host overactive immune responses 102 corticosteroids can decrease inflammation of the lungs but also suppress the immune response and increase viral replication treatments of sars and mers-cov infected patients with corticosteroids showed that inflammation persisted after clearance of virus no sufficient evidence supported that sars-cov-2 infected patients would benefit from corticosteroids and contrarily they may suffer from this therapy 103104 two trials are recruiting critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory failure caused by novel coronavirus infection to test the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone nct04263402 nct04244591 however corticosteroids should be used with caution for treating novel coronavirus while considering the possible benefits the risk of complications including psychosis diabetes avascular necrosis must be balanced againstimmunoglobulin therapy is to use a mixture of normal human immunoglobulins for improving the immunity which is especially effective for acute infections this passive immunity through immunoglobulin injection can be acquired immediately but the duration is short 105 intravenous immunoglobulin suggested for treating severe and critically ill covid-19 patients was proved to improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis 82 whereas sars-cov-2 is a novel virus and almost no antibodies are present in the healthy populations intravenous immunoglobulin acting as a non-specific immune enhancer on mild or common patients may only have limited efficacyafter virus infects the body many different antibodies against viral proteins can be produced in the body but most antibodies do not actually have an antiviral effect except for those that recognize proteins on the surface of the virus particles 106 during the outbreak of sars-cov infected patients treated with convalescent plasma carrying sars-cov-specific antibodies from cured patients have been suggested to yield clinical benefits with reduced viral load and lower mortality rate 107 the underlying mechanism for the protective effect of convalescent plasma seems to be that the neutralizing antibodies produced in previously infected patients can directly bind to the spike protein on the virus particles to prevent them from entering the cells 108 in addition to the neutralizing antibodies other surface antibodies can bind to the virus and mediate the phagocytosis of the virus by macrophages and further hydrolyze the viral nucleic acids and proteins however virus can also evolve a set of strategies to escape the degradation through macrophages and replicate to form new ones worse still the viral replication in macrophages may promote the release of excess pro-inflammatory factors leading to cytokine storms which is the major cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure 109at present several clinical trials are ongoing testing the efficacy and safety of the anti-sars-cov-2 inactivated convalescent plasma eg nct04292340 and the immunoglobulin from patients who recovered from sars-cov-2 pneumonia nct04264858 on the treatment of patients with acute severe sars-cov-2 pneumonia though the use of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin may be a new strategy especially effective for the treatment of sars-cov-2 pneumonia the potential risks of promotion of cytokine storms and transfusion-transmitted infection should be taken seriouslyvirus attacking the respiratory system and immune system causes the damage of immunological function with lymphocytopenia decreased cd8 and cd4 t cell count that associated with severe sars-cov-2 pneumonia 145154103 the host fights against the viral infection through virus-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes reversion of t cell exhaustion is helpful to promote the antiviral immunity pd-1 blocking antibody is one of the anticancer drugs that prevents the interaction between pd-l1 on the tumor cells and pd-1 on the t cells blocking the interaction of these cell surface proteins can modulate the immunological tolerance of tumors thus preventing the cancer cells from evading the surveillance of immune system 110 diao et al reported that the expression levels of t cell exhaustion marker pd-1 from covid-19 patients were much higher as compared to healthy controls 111 therefore blocking pd-1 to prevent t cell exhaustion resulting in activation of antiviral immune responses may be a novel therapeutic strategy for covid-19 however before applying the pd-1 blocking antibody for treatment of lymphocytopenia induced by sars-cov-2 infection nct04268537 the correlation between pd-1 and t cell function should be measured to predict the response rate and the adverse effects such as cytokine-release syndromes and pneumonitispatients infected with sars-cov-2 admitted to the intensive care unit had cytokine storms with increased secretion of il2 il7 il10 gscf ip10 mcp1 mip1a and tnf associated with severe illness including acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure 102 mesenchymal stem cells mscs can be an immunomodulatory agent inhibiting the secretion of cytokines suppressing the overactive immune responses and decreasing the inflammation mscs are safe and seldom induce rejection reactions to human body due to the inherently poor immunogenicity properties 112 regenerative potential of mscs is helpful to repair the alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells leading to reduction of lung damage113 owing to the immunoregulation anti-inflammation damaged tissue repair and regeneration properties mscs-based treatments have been applied to a variety of refractory diseases and are expected to have a critical role in novel coronavirus-induced severe pneumonia nct04293692 nct04288102 nct04252118 nct04273646 nct04269525mscs-derived exosomes contain abundant biologically active substances such as signaling lipids growth factors cytokines and rna recent studies have revealed that exosomes are also important mediators for cell-cell communication via paracrine or endocrine manner 114 mscs-derived exosomes have similar biological functions as mesenchymal stem cells for example repairing and regeneration of tissues suppression of inflammatory response and regulation of immunity115 mscs-derived exosomes have been applied to the treatment of various lung diseases including pulmonary fibrosis pulmonary arterial hypertension lung cancer bronchopulmonary dysplasia and acute respiratory distress syndrome 116 studies have demonstrated that mscs-derived exosomes could significantly reduce lung pathologic damage and increase the survival rate of mice with pulmonary fibrosis 117 compared to mscs-based therapy its derived exosomes as cell-free therapy is much safer and easier to pass through the physical barriers due to their nano size 118 suggesting a broad application prospect in a variety of diseases especially the pulmonary diseases nct04276987tcms have a long history of medical use and are frequently used for the prevention and treatment of infection diseases in china based on tcm therapy concept of multiple compounds-multiple targets-multiple effects a tcm prescription often contains multiple herbs working together to battle a disease within these mixture components some work directly on the viral targets involving the life cycle including attachment entry transcription of viral mrna replication of viral genome translation of viral protein and the assembly maturation and release of progeny virus particles119 to infect the host efficiently viruses have evolved a series of strategies to escape the hosts innate and adaptive immune responses against viral infection on the other hand to fight against the virus the host may release excessive or uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokines that correlated to tissue damage or organ failure 102 except working as direct-acting antivirals most of the molecules in tcm are immunomodulators that could block the viral immune evasion or enhance the host antiviral immune responses while the others may contribute to reducing the toxicity or enhancing the bioavailability 119 despite not often being recognized as a real medicine tcms actually have exhibited excellent anti-sars-cov-2 efficacy during the outbreak of covid-19 as evidenced by the high recovery rate and low mortality rate of confirmed cases taking tcm in china 82120 xiyanping is a licensed tcm injection in china used in the treatment of bronchitis tonsillitis bacterial dysentery it mainly contains active compounds extracted from andrographis paniculata chuan xin lian 121 in the 7th edition of the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for the covid-19 issued by chinese health authorities xiyanping injection is recommended for treating severe and critically ill patients with bacterial co-infection attributed to its antiviral anti-inflammatory antibacterial and immune regulation activities in addition to the significant antiviral efficacy what calls for special attention is that the indication dosage and solvents of tcm injection should be used rationally to reduce the occurrence of side effects 122strategies to develop vaccine for covid-19 are mainly focused on the spike protein of sars-cov-2 which is crucial for virus entry zhu et al have reported a first-in-human clinical trial of a replication defective adenovirus type-5 ad-5 vectored covid-19 vaccine expressing the full-length spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 nct04313127 this vaccine was showed to be tolerated and the adverse reactions were transient and self-limiting vaccination could induce humoral and t-cell responses rapidly but partly diminished in some participants by reason of pre-existing anti-ad5 immunity 123 mckay et al have developed a self-amplifying rna encoding pre-fusion stabilized spike protein of sars-cov-2 encapsulated within a lipid nanoparticle as a vaccine immunizations of self-amplifying rna lipid nanoparticle have been shown to induce large amount of sars-cov-2 specific lgg antibodies robust cellular responses and secretion of pluripotent cytokines in mice vaccination was also found to be capable of potently neutralizing a pseudotyped hiv virus expressing the spike protein unlike messenger rna based vaccine nct04283461 self-amplifying rna is able to encode any antigen of interest and only requires a minimum dose more importantly not as plasmid dna requiring electroporation this lipid nanoparticle-formulated vaccine is more convenient to use because it can be injected directly with a syringe and needle 124 smith et al have reported the preclinical development of a synthetic dna-based covid-19 vaccine encoding sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein and an n-terminal ige leader for enhancing the expression and immunogenicity immunization of mice and guinea pigs could promote durable production of functional antibodies that strongly neutralize the pseudovirus and live virus and block the ace2 binding to spike protein of sars-cov-2 specific antibodies of anti-sars-cov-2 were found to mainly distribute in the lungs after immunization sars-cov-2 s protein-specific t cell responses were also stimulated in immunized mice 125except for targeting s protein sars-cov-2 inactivated vaccine nct04383574 nct04352608 nct04412538 and sars-cov-2 rna vaccine nct04368728 are also being investigated in the clinical trials whats more repurposing other vaccines such as bcg vaccine nct04384549 nct04348370 and mmr vaccine nct04357028 may be a potential alternative strategy for treating covid-19 for the outbreak that likely to stage a come back in the future clinical trials of sars-cov-2 vaccines have been launched in many countries around the world but it still takes time until the safe and effective vaccine against covid-19 is availableace2 not only expresses in the lung tissue but also distributes in the intestinal epithelium 126 apart from invading the hosts lung tissues sars-cov-2 also interferes with the absorption of nutrients in the human body by binding to ace2 of the intestinal epithelium causing gastrointestinal discomfort 14 the intestinal flora can regulate various lung diseases through the intestinal-lung axis with immunomodulatory effect including viral pneumonia asthma tuberculosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease maintaining the normal communication of intestinal-pulmonary axis is helpful to alleviate lung disease 127128 intestinal malnutrition often occurs in patients with covid-19 and sometimes develops to secondary bacterial infections and antibiotic-related diarrhea suggesting the crucial connection between intestinal tract and respiratory tract washed microbiota transplantation as a rescue therapy for critically ill patients with diarrhea may have important clinical benefits nct04251767vitamin c a kind of antioxidant is essential for tissue repair and immune system function 129 vitamin c can prevent oxidative damage induced by virus infection and improve the immunity of patients with pneumonia it has been reported that enterovirusrhinovirus infection can cause devastating acute lung injury high dose of intravenous vitamin c could attenuate the acute respiratory distress syndrome and relieve lung damage produced by enterovirusrhinovirus infection down-regulation of reactive oxygen nitrogen species and pro-inflammatory genes by vitamin c may contribute to these curative effect 130131 nevertheless the role of vitamin c as monotherapy in the recovered patients is still uncertain before vitamin c can be applied as a therapy the side effects of high dosage such as nausea indigestion abdominal cramps and diarrhea owing to the unabsorbed vitamin c in the intestine should be considered since the leading causes of death of sars-cov-2 infected patients are associated with acute respiratory distress and multiple organ failure further investigations and larger trials should be performed to uncover the underlying mechanism and evaluate the exact efficacy of vitamin cthe strong infectivity of sars-cov-2 highlights the need of early intervention with effective treatment although abundant clinical trials are registered and underway since the outbreak of covid-19 the exact pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 has not been elucidated clearly yet along with no approved drug or vaccine for either sars-cov or mers-cov as a reference raising a significant challenge for specific and effective anti-sars-cov-2 drug development1 sars-cov-2 infections currently have spread to more than 200 countries across 6 continents and is posing a profound threat to the global public health and economy proper managements to decrease the prevalence rate of covid-19 patients have become more urgent with the expanding geographic distribution unfortunately control measures available to prevent sars-cov-2 infection are very limited owing to the strong infectivity of the virus and the pattern of person-to-person transmission2 currently there is no vaccine or specific antivirals available for covid-19 though mountains of novel findings on covid-19 are accumulating it is clear that there are still fundamental gaps in our knowledge a better understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of covid-19 will help us to develop effective

community settings no study evaluated masks for preventions of sars-cov-2 infections in community settings
health care settings two cohort studies evaluated mask use and risk for sars-cov-2 infection but had important limitations 52 56 one study 493 participants of hcws in higher- and lower-risk hospital units found n95 respirators to be associated with decreased infection risk versus no mask but mask use was based on whether the hcw worked in a department in which masks were used not on assessment of individual use 52 in addition departments with n95 respirator use differed from departments that did not use n95 respirators in other infection control measures such as handwashing and use of protective clothing and exposure to patients with covid-19 there were also few hcw cases and serious imprecision the other study was small 37 participants and evaluated hcws with inadequate personal protective
equipment during exposure to a patient with unrecognized sars-cov-2 infection 56 it reported 3 cases of sars-cov-2 infection in hcws resulting in very imprecise estimates
community settings three observational studies 2857 participants evaluated masks and sars-1 risk in community settings supplement table 4 31 51 54 the studies did not compare mask types or provide details regarding mask type wearing a mask was associated with decreased risk for infection in persons without known sars-1 contacts in 1 study 54 and in household contacts of patients with sars-1 in 2 studies supplement table 6 31 51

masks were generally used in addition to handwashing though details on use of personal protective equipment for example eye protection gowns and gloves were limitedthree rcts 3532 participants compared n95 respirators versus surgical masks in higher-risk settings such as emergency departments respiratory wards pediatric wards and intensive care units 34 39 40 one trial 422 participants found both n95 respirators and surgical mask to be associated with a very similar likelihood of a physician visit for acute respiratory illness 62 vs 61 34 two trials 3110 participants found an n95 respirator to be associated with decreased risk for clinical respiratory illness with absolute differences that ranged from 28 to 77 39 40in all 3 trials there were few cases of influenza-like illness resulting in imprecise estimates 34 39 40 for laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections 1 trial 34 that did not require hcws to have symptoms found no difference between an n95 respirator and a surgical mask in infection risk in the other 2 trials only symptomatic laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections were diagnosed the number of cases was small and estimates were imprecise one trial reported no difference in the subgroup of laboratory-confirmed not necessarily symptomatic viral infections by nonpandemic coronaviruses but was underpowered for this outcome with a total of 21 cases 34 the other 2 trials did not report nonpandemic coronavirus
infectionstwo trials described above included 2 n95 respirator arms 39 40 one trial found that the effects of an n95 respirator versus surgical mask on clinical respiratory illness were similar for fit-tested and nonfit-tested n95 respirators 46 vs 33 39 the other trial found continuous use at all times while working of an n95 respirator to be associated with a small decrease in clinical respiratory illness risk versus intermittent use only during high-risk procedures or barrier situations of an n95 respirator 72 vs 118 40one trial 1868 participants of hcws in higher-risk settings found a surgical mask to be associated with decreased risk for clinical respiratory illness influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed viral infections versus cloth masks but estimates were imprecise and not statistically significant 38one trial of hcws 2862 participants in lower-risk outpatient settings found no differences between an n95 respirator and a surgical mask in risk for clinical respiratory illness influenza-like illness laboratory-confirmed viral illness or laboratory-confirmed influenza 46reporting of harms in the rcts was suboptimal but did not indicate serious harms with mask use supplement table 9 when reported the most common adverse events were discomfort breathing difficulties and skin events one trial found use of an n95 respirator to be associated with increased risk for headache and breathing difficulty compared with a surgical mask in hcws 39 but 1 trial found no difference between a p2 mask n95 respirator equivalent versus surgical mask in adverse events in persons in the community 37 one trial reported no differences in harms between a surgical versus cloth mask in hcws 38this rapid living review summarizes the evidence on the comparative effectiveness and effectiveness for preventing coronavirus and other respiratory infections figure 2 is an evidence map summarizing the strength of evidence for key comparisons by setting and infection type supplement table 10 the map shows that direct evidence on the comparative effectiveness of masks for preventing covid-19 due to sars-cov-2 infection is lacking therefore it was necessary to also consider evidence for other respiratory infections though the applicability to covid-19 is uncertain in addition the strength of evidence varied from moderate to insufficient no comparison was graded high strength of evidencein community settings one rct found no difference between n95 or equivalent respirators versus surgical masks in risk for noncoronavirus respiratory illness 37 the rcts in community settings typically conducted during influenza seasons also did not indicate effectiveness of mask use versus no mask use for reducing viral respiratory infection risk though mask compliance was suboptimal observational data on mask use effectiveness in community settings for preventing infections associated with epidemic coronaviruses were limited but suggest possible reduced risk for sars-1 the difference in findings could be related to higher mask compliance in pandemic outbreak settings greater effectiveness of masks for sars-1 or residual confoundingin hcws observational studies suggest that n95 masks might be associated with decreased risk for sars-cov-1 infection compared with surgical masks and mask use in general appears to be associated with decreased risk for sars-cov-1 infection all studies were conducted in high- or moderate-risk settings with uncertain applicability to low-risk settings those without direct care of infected patients review of rcts indicates that n95 respirators and surgical masks are probably associated with similar risk for influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed viral infections in high- and low-risk settings however there was some inconsistency in effects of n95 respirators versus surgical masks on clinical respiratory infections in high-risk settings with 1 trial 34 showing no difference in physician visits for respiratory illness and 2 trials 39 40 showing n95 respirators to be associated with a small decrease in risk the only trial comparing n95 respirators versus surgical masks in a low-risk primary care setting found no difference in risk for clinical respiratory illness 46 there was no evidence to address effects of extended or reuse of n95 respirators on infection risk evidence on nonclinical outcomes for example measures of filtration contamination and mask failure is summarized elsewhere 5our findings are generally consistent with those of recent systematic reviews on mask use in community and health care settings that found n95 respirators and surgical masks to be associated with similar risk for influenza and influenza-like illness 5862 it differs from prior reviews by considering both randomized trials and observational studies evaluating mask use in community and health care settings considering harms comparing effects of consistent versus less consistent mask use and including a more comprehensive set of relevant studies we also implemented living review processes in order to incorporate new evidence on an ongoing basis there was some overlap between this review and our living review on risk factors including various types of personal protective equipment for coronavirus infections in hcws 12 this review
differed from our prior review by including studies conducted in community settings focusing on mask use and including effects on noncoronavirus viral respiratory infectionsthe evidence base has important limitations as noted the evidence on mask use and risk for sars-cov-2 infection is very sparse in randomized trials adherence to mask use was suboptimal potentially reducing estimates of effectiveness compared with use during pandemic outbreaks when adherence may be higher observational studies were retrospective susceptible to recall bias and confounding and did not address correlations between mask use and other infection prevention and control measures applicability of evidence on masks and risk for sars-cov-1 mers-cov and other viral respiratory illness to sars-cov-2 is uncertain the applicability of evidence on influenza and influenza-like illnesses to sars-cov-2 could be reduced owing to differential transmission dynamics lower mask adherence or limited use of other personal protective equipment 63the review process had limitations in particular we used streamlined rapid review methods for searching and selecting studies we did not perform critical appraisal of observational studies by using a formal instrument though key methodological limitations were highlighted we included 1 nonpeer-reviewed study 21 which could reduce data quality meta-analysis was not attempted owing to study limitations and heterogeneity in study designs comparisons and analysesresearch is urgently needed to clarify the comparative effectiveness of masks for transmission of covid-19 in community and health care settings randomized trials are in progress 64 65 observational studies that prospectively measure mask use other infection prevention and control measures accounting for potential correlations and exposures could supplement randomized trials given limitations in the supply of n95 respirators understanding the effects of reuse or extended use of n95 respirators is a priority 66in conclusion evidence on the effectiveness of masks for prevention of respiratory infection is stronger in health care than community settings use of n95 respirators might reduce sars-cov-1 risk versus surgical masks in health care settings but applicability to sars-cov-2 is uncertainsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 the cause of coronavirus disease-19 covid-191 was first reported to the world health organization who on december 31 20192 and declared a global pandemic on march 11 20203 to date there are approximately 58 million confirmed cases and over 350000 deaths globally4 there are no food and drug administration5 or european medicines agency6 approved vaccines or medications for the treatment of covid-19 no specific therapies are recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention7 infectious diseases society of america8 society for critical care medicine9 or who10 outside of clinical trials the national institutes of health nih11 guideline was recently updated to recommend remdesivir in certain patients based on preliminary evidence from clinical trialsdespite absence of guideline-supported recommendations several therapies thought to be effective for covid-19 are in use around the world however access to these treatments is not equitable among all populations12 remdesivir and chloroquinehydroxychloroquine are drug therapies that have received the most attentionremdesivir was initially available through individual compassionate use requests this pathway was halted for the majority of patients due to the overwhelming numbers of requests and the need to focus on clinical trials remdesivir access was then limited to these clinical trials and expanded access programs13 however not all patients had the equal opportunity to enroll due to study site locations and eligibility criteria1415 it was only on may 1 2020 that the fda granted emergency use authorization eua for remdesivir it is now available for suspected or confirmed disease in hospitalized adults and children with severe disease which is defined as low blood oxygen levels or needing oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation16 however allocation of remdesivir through eua has not been transparent and fears grow as healthcare providers are faced with rationing the limited drug supply1718chloroquine and its metabolite hydroxychloroquine are widely prescribed for other indications however when reports emerged of their possible activity against sars-cov-2 shortages quickly developed in the united states us1921 these drugs can be obtained for covid-19 treatment through the fda eua but use is reserved for only the sickest patients in certain hospitals22 additionally chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are associated with potentially severe cardiac side effects23 furthermore an early clinical trial failed to demonstrate efficacy24another potential therapy showing promise is the 14-day combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg orally every 12 h ribavirin 400 mg orally every 12 h and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days when compared to 14 days of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h this multicenter prospective open-label randomized phase 2 trial conducted at six sites in hong kong demonstrated that the triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir and ritonavir alone25due to concerns over equitable access and adverse events of notable experimental treatments we aimed to investigate potential alternative agents for treatment of covid-19 that may have better availability and side effect profiles vitamins and essential nutrients are well known for their overall tolerability and requisite role in immune function thus they were a natural choice for our investigation this narrative review summarizes current and ongoing clinical trials of high-dose vitamins and supplements alone or in combination with each other or other therapies for the treatment of covid-19 while not the focus of this review vitamins and supplements may have an additional benefit in

assess these agents as potential treatment options andor additive therapies to current treatment choices that vary around the world as there is no definitive treatment at this point in time depending on the formulation vitamins and herbal supplements are relatively affordable and accessible availability in certain markets may be limited as this novel virus has caused patients and providers to stockpile medications vitamins and supplements for later use without proven efficacy and unknown safety profiles at higher than normal doses leading to imposing limitations on the quantity that can be purchased84although the use of remdesivir has been expanded in the united states its role in the fight of covid-19 has not provided patients and providers with the relief they expected although no difference in clinical outcomes was observed between 5 and 10 days of remdesivir treatment a study conducted in hubei china failed to demonstrate clinical improvements in adults with severe covid-19 in the remdesivir arm8586 interestingly time to clinical improvement in patients treated earlier was observed but needs confirmation in larger studies85 in an exploratory analysis the sponsor of remdesivir gilead sciences inc found that patients who received remdesivir within 10 days of symptoms onset had improved outcomes compared with those treated after more than 10 days of symptoms additionally when data were pooled across treatment arms by day 14 62 of patients treated early were discharged from the hospital compared to those who were treated late yet statistical analysis was not performed86 furthermore notable exclusion criteria in these moderate-to-severe covid-19 patients included mechanical ventilation at screening as well as patients receiving mechanical ventilation  5 days or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase  5 x upper limit of normal uln and creatinine clearance crcl  50 mlmin1415 therefore the true potential and efficacy of remdesivir therapy require expanded investigation into additional populationsalthough doses of vitamins in these ongoing clinical trials are higher than normal use of vitamins at higher doses compared to recommended dietary allowance is safe and upper limits for the use are defined in addition the use of vitamins and herbal supplements likely has more benign side effects when compared to self-medicating with unproven remedies lacking adequate investigations for use in the instance of chloroquine phosphate and its derivative hydroxychloroquine a wife and husband ingested chloroquine phosphate in the united states in march 2020 after hearing from a press conference that this medication was likely a very promising treatment option the couple consumed hydroxychloroquine based on the intended use for their aquarium because they feared contracting the virus and it was easily accessible they were both hospitalized shorty after ingesting the product and the husband ultimately died87 meanwhile hundreds in iran died after drinking neat alcohol in early 2020 which was publicized on social media as a cureprevention for covid88 it is not clear how many of these deaths can be directly tied to social media misinformation as a larger problem of contaminated bootleg alcohol was revealedthe most studied supplement in the acute care setting has been vitamin c where it has been used as treatment for multiple conditions including sepsis acute bronchitis cardiovascular disease postoperative infection and prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy a meta-analysis published in 2019 reviewed 18 trials to evaluate the effect of vitamin c on intensive care unit icu length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation the most commonly studied populations were patients undergoing cardiac surgery followed by sepsis lung contusions and burn patients of 12 trials containing 1766 patients intravenously administered vitamin c reduced the length of icu stay by 78 95 confidence interval ci 42112 p000003 orally administered vitamin c in doses of 13 gday was evaluated in 6 studies and was associated with reduced length of icu stay by 86 p0003 of the 3 studies evaluating patients requiring mechanical ventilation for 24 h vitamin c reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation by 182 95 ci 7727 p000189these authors also performed a meta-regression analysis in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation and found that in 5 studies consisting of 471 patients vitamin c 16 gday was most beneficial in reducing ventilation time by an average of 25 p00001 in patients requiring more than 10 h of mechanical ventilation90 these findings can serve as a foundation for analyzing the role of vitamin c in potentially reducing the time spent on mechanical ventilation in patients with covid-19vitamin c infusion for treatment in sepsis induced acute lung injury citris-ali a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial conducted in 7 medical icus in the usa evaluated the effects of vitamin c infusion in 167 patients and its role in organ failure along with biomarkers of inflammation and vascular injury in patients with sepsis and severe acute respiratory failure patients were assigned to receive either an infusion of vitamin c 50 mgkg or placebo dextrose 5 in water every 6 h for 96 h although this study failed to improve organ dysfunction scores or alter markers of inflammation and vascular injury vitamin c was associated with a significant reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality as well as significantly increased icu-free days to day 28 and hospital-free days to day 6091 these findings also suggest that further research may be warranted to determine whether vitamin c has a role in the care of patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards which has been associated with covid-19vitamin d is currently under evaluation for its role in covid-19 for its immunomodulatory effects a trial conducted in guinea-bissau investigated vitamin d as supplementary treatment for tuberculosis in 365 patients the intervention was 100000 iu of cholecalciferol or placebo at inclusion and again at 5 and 8 months after the initiation of treatment findings from this study failed to demonstrate improvements in clinical outcomes or mortality in patients receiving vitamin d as part of tuberculosis treatment but this may be due to the dose not being high enough or given consistentlyadditional studies evaluating the role of vitamin d supplementation in the prevention and reduction of acute respiratory infections copd exacerbations and pneumonia were analyzed in the vitamin d3 supplementation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease vidico trial this trial investigated whether vitamin d3 supplementation would reduce the incidence of moderate or severe copd exacerbations and upper respiratory infections in 240 patients across clinics in london patients received six 2-month oral doses of 3 mg of vitamin d over a 1-year period vitamin d3 was associated with protective effects against moderate or severe copd exacerbations in participants with baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentrations of less 50 nmoll p0021 but not in those with baseline concentrations  50 nmoll baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentrations had no effect on time to first upper respiratory infection92a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 24 randomized controlled trials of supplementation with vitamin d in regard to incidence of acute respiratory tract infection protective effects were observed in subjects receiving daily or weekly vitamin d supplementation without additional bolus doses and were stronger in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin d levels 25 nmoll serum 25ohd concentration was inversely associated with risk and severity of acute respiratory tract infection where for each 10 nmoll decrease in 25ohd concentration the odds of acute respiratory tract infection increased by 102 09710793 therefore some protective effects of vitamin d in those with lower baseline levels have been seen however the role of vitamin d for the treatment of acquired infections including covid-19 requires further investigation especially in subjects with low baseline levels of vitamin d this concept is currently under investigation in france94when evaluating proposed studies of vitamins and supplements throughout the world there are notable limitations in currently available information such as standard of care while many of the studies report a comparator arm as standard of care there is no definition of what that actually means as there is no widely recognized treatment for covid-19 in addition much like other clinical trials key populations are excluded in many of these ongoing trials as well this includes women who are pregnant or lactating as well as patients with chronic diseases ie kidney disease or patients with short life expectancies ie cancersthe greatest promise in combatting this life-threatening virus appears to be through reducing the cytokine storm associated with covid-1995 this is where anti-inflammatory and antioxidant vitamins and supplements may play a potential role results of these ongoing clinical trials are urgently neededat this time we recommend vitamins and supplements as specific covid-19 treatment in the context of a clinical trial this recommendation is in-line with the major organizational guidelines for potentially effective covid-19 treatments at the time of this writing while the vitamins and supplements under investigation for covid-19 described in this manuscript are generally without serious adverse effects and drug interactions no therapy is completely free of risk additionally while also being generally affordable broad recommendation and implementation of unproven treatments are likely not cost effective that being said vitamins and supplements with existing evidence supporting their use in conditions associated with covid-19 such as sepsis or ards can be considered when potential benefit is determined to outweigh riskwith the rapidity of hypothetical treatments data being generated for covid-19 clinical investigations up until this point have not provided efficacious treatments in eradicating the virus while it is important to investigate treatments with the potential to reduce the severity and consequences of covid-19 vitamins and supplements should be continued to be evaluated to provide the much-needed evidence for possible treatment modalities a systematic review will be conducted once results from ongoing and recruiting clinical trials are availablecovid-19 is a new acute infectious disease caused by corona virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 21 world health organization has listed it as a public health emergency of international concern people of all ages are vulnerable to infections and it will have a negative impact on psychological health2 the symptoms of covid-19 patients mainly include fever fatigue cough shortness of breathrespiratory distress etc3 chest ct with pneumonia4 covid-19 is now spreading rapidly and have negative impact on mental health5 however there is no effective treatment for this disease currently symptomatic treatment and supportive care are considered as the major treatment methods6 therefore psychological intervention is being considered as adjuvant therapy to provide more help for covid-19 patientspsychotherapy uses psychological methods to educate and treat patients it can eliminate physical symptoms and improve mental health78 covid-19 may cause public panic and mental stress9 some covid-19 patients feel anxious and difficult to reintegrate into society in addition quarantine has been used in covid-19 outbreak10 it will have negative emotions such as fear depression boredom etc11 using psychological intervention will reduce psychological stress and help to integrate covid-19 patients into society whats more it will relieve the patients anxiety and prevent immunity decline1213 however most of the clinical trials provided insufficient evidence due to the small sample sizes it lacks sufficient evidence to prove the effectiveness of psychological intervention on covid-19 patients therefore we will conduct

respiratory rate and oxygen saturation and alleviation of cough sustained for at least 72 hours effective rate is based on whether psychological intervention can improve patients condition such as fever respiratory rate and oxygen saturation and cough additional outcomes of patients condition are as follows changes of patients physical condition 1 time until covid-19 rt-pcr negative in upper respiratory tract specimen 2 time until cough reported as mild or absent 3 time until dyspnea reported as mild or absent 4 frequency of requiring supplemental oxygen or non-invasive ventilation 5 frequency of requiring respiratory 6 incidence of severe cases 7 proportion of re-hospitalization or admission to icu 8all-cause mortality 9frequency of seriously adverse events and changes of

effectiveness of psychological intervention on covid-19in the prevalence of covid-19 there is no effective medication many reports suggested that more attention should be paid to psychological intervention on covid-19216 if psychological intervention as complementary treatment can improve the symptoms of covid-19 it will bring benefits for covid-19 patients this analysis aims at deeply understanding the involvement of psychological intervention in covid-19 adjuvant therapy as well as looking forward to providing reference for clinical treatmentstrengths and limitations will be highlighted during identifying evidence the data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be completed by 2 researchers independently which will provide accurate evidence for psychological intervention in addition this analysis will solve the hot research topic of covid-19 and provide reference for clinical guideline limitations will mainly originate from different clinical situation and different basic treatment on covid-19 patients it may lead to high heterogeneity and lower the quality of the evidence however subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis will be used to overcome these heterogeneities in the meta-analysis the results of this meta-analysis may help to establish a better approach to treating covid-19 and to provide reliable evidence for application of

coronaviruses are a cause of respiratory tract infections in humans 1 a novel coronavirus emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 2 subsequently called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 3 coronavirus disease covid-19 is caused by sars-cov-2 3 and since march 2020 this outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the world health organisation who 4 fever cough and shortness of breath are the main reported symptoms of covid-19 5 but it also has a concerning case mortality rate among certain populations such as older adults and those with underlying health conditionscurrently there is a need to identify effective safe treatments for covid-19 as quickly as possible due to the ongoing pandemic one such proposed treatment is remdesivir which is an investigational antiviral medicine with proven activity against rna viruses 6 7 remdesivir was originally developed for treatment of ebola virus disease and results from the phase iii randomised clinical trial for this indication have been published 8 it has been shown to have broad spectrum in-vitro activity against several coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 6 9 10 in-vivo activity against mers-cov in animal models 11 12 and has been made available for patients with covid-19 through compassionate use programmes 13 14 several clinical trials are ongoing to examine the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir in covid-19 in humans 1518 most recently remdesivir was granted an emergency use authorisation in covid-19 by the us food and drug administration 19 whilst there is considerable interest in the use of remdesivir for covid-19 there has not been a systematic benefitrisk assessment on the use of remdesivir for covid-19 treatment using a structured descriptive framework a key objective of this study was to provide a platform for a dynamic systematic benefitrisk evaluation which starts with inevitably limited information to meet the urgent unmet public health need worldwide then update the benefitrisk evaluation as more data become availablethe ongoing monitoring of the benefitrisk balance for remdesivir in covid-19 treatment is strengthened by use of a systematic assessment the benefitrisk action team brat framework facilitates identification and summarisation of the key benefits and risks of a product in a defined disease context within a structured descriptive framework further quantitative assessments can then be applied and conducted according to the availability of relevant data at that time 20 the brat framework was also specifically designed to assist communication with regulatory authorities 21 22 the decision-making process is transparent due to the framework design while any assumptions can be explored further by sensitivity analysis through a quantitative component 20 23this benefitrisk assessment has been conducted based on publicly available publications to date data-lock april 30 2020 it is however acknowledged that there is extremely limited data available at this timepoint the benefitrisk assessment has been designed to be implemented regardless of the quantity of data available but the intention is that the framework will subsequently be readily available to repeat the assessment as further data arise eg results from new and ongoing clinical trials allowing for rapid decision makingthe objective of this study was to examine the benefitrisk profile of remdesivir in covid-19 patients compared with standard of care placebo or other treatmentsthe population of interest were patients with severe covid-19 while the exposure of interest was remdesivir the comparators of interest were standard of care placebo or other treatments for covid-19regardless of importance all potential benefits and risks related to remdesivir were initially identified key benefits and risks were then selected by clinician judgement which were those considered to drive the benefitrisk balance of remdesivir the key benefits and risks were used to construct a value tree ranking benefits and risks in order of considered importance ranking was performed by two clinicians after discussion of the importance of each benefit and riskwe searched pubmed google scholar and government agency websites to identify suitable data for inclusion the search strategy for pubmed and google scholar wasremdesivir and coronavirus or covid or sars-cov-2 or 2019-ncovfor government agency websites we searched for any mention of remdesivir on the national institute of health nih us food and drug administration and european medicines agency websites papers were included if they reported quantitative data on effectiveness andor safety of remdesivir and a comparator in patients with severe covid-19 case reports were excluded because they did not provide comparative data results were restricted to english language only abstracts in english language were acceptable where sufficient data was provided and peer-reviewed publications for pubmed and google scholar since 2019 to 30 april 2020 where a control group was included data were extracted for each benefit and risk for both remdesivir and the comparator standard of care placebo or other treatmentswe also searched clinicaltrialsgov to identify background information for the manuscript and to identify ongoing clinical trials since there are no results currently published on clinicaltrialsgov there were no useable data available for extractiondue to paucity of data a fully quantitative assessment was not undertaken however the risks and risk difference per 1000 patients were calculated for each benefit and risk the outcomes identified in the value tree were ranked so that swing weighting can be applied in future assessments the weighted net clinical benefit wncb can subsequently be calculated using these weights if sufficient data on both risks and benefits become available in the future 2325 we would propose using the sutton et al method where benefits have a positive contribution to the wncb and risks have a negative contribution 25 the overall wncb would be considered positive benefit outweighs the risk where wncb is  0 a sensitivity analysis can also be used to examine the robustness of the assigned weights and whether significant changes would alter the benefitrisk profile 22 analysis using wncb was not undertaken at this time due to the limited release of clinical trial datathe benefits listed in the value tree represent key clinical endpoints included in clinical trial protocols these have been ranked in order of perceived clinical importance from the clinical endpoint of mortality risk through to the surrogate endpoint of viral clearance many studies have utilised ordinal scales which include a spectrum of the clinical status of the patient the primary endpoint used in the recently published study by wang et al 27 was time to clinical improvement up to day 28 this was defined as the time in days from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status from 1  discharged to 6  death or discharged alive from hospital whichever came first the six-point scale was as follows death  6 hospital admission for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical ventilation  5 hospital admission for non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy  4 hospital admission for oxygen therapy but not requiring high-flow or non-invasive ventilation  3 hospital admission but not requiring oxygen therapy  2 and discharged or having reached discharge criteria  1the primary endpoint in the multicentre adaptive randomized blinded controlled trial of the safety and efficacy of investigational therapeutics for the treatment of covid-19 in hospitalized adults known as the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial sponsored by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid 28 was time to recovery time frame day 1 through day 29 day of recovery was defined as the first day on which the subject satisfied one of the following three categories from the ordinal scale 1 hospitalized not requiring supplemental oxygenno longer requires ongoing medical care 2 not hospitalized limitation on activities andor requiring home oxygen 3 not hospitalized no limitations on activities other key clinical outcomes included duration of ventilation duration of oxygen support and duration of hospital stay in addition to time from randomization to discharge or death surrogate endpoints assessing viral load clearance are likely to be less robust forms of endpoint data and accordingly have been ranked lower in terms of clinical importanceas remdesivir is an unapproved medicine in most countries its safety profile has not yet been fully characterised known key risks at the current time have been included in the value tree identified from a variety of sources including recently published clinical trial data in the context of covid-19 27 these have also been ranked according to perceived seriousnesscardiovascular outcomes including hypotension and arrhythmias have been documented following the use of remdesivir 8 26 29 however the risk of cardiovascular outcomes with remdesivir remains largely unknown 30 hypotension was reported in one patient in the phase iii study investigating remdesivir in the context of ebola virus disease this patient subsequently suffered a cardiac arrest although the manuscript states that this death could not readily be distinguishable from underlying fulminant ebola virus disease itself 8 cardiac arrest was also reported in a further patient in the remdesivir group reported in the covid-19 study by wang et al 27 multiple organ dysfunction septic shock acute kidney injury and hypotension have also been reported as adverse events amongst patients provided with remdesivir either on a compassionate-use basis or in a clinical trial 26 27 respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome has been cited as an adverse event in patients taking remdesivir 27 31 and as such has been included here although it is acknowledged that this may be related to underlying disease covid-19 rather than to remdesivir elevations in liver transaminases and gastrointestinal events including diarrhoea have also been reported with the use of remdesivir 8 13 26 32 in addition to reports of haemorrhage of the lower gastrointestinal gi tract 27 33where available clinical trial data relating to any efficacy or safety outcomes included in the value tree for both remdesivir and a comparator group in the context of severe covid-19 were extracted and included in table 2 based on this data summary metrics including risks per 1000 patient years and risk differences are presented in table 3 we identified 68 papers through literature searching from pubmed and 384 papers from google scholar we also identified results from one clinical trial on the niaid website after initial review one paper 27 and results from one clinical trial on the niaid website 28 were included in the final benefitrisk assessmentin the wang et al trial the benefit of time to clinical improvement was not statistically significant 21 vs 23 days hr 123 95 ci 087175 in the niaid trial a statistically significant shorter time to recovery in patients treated with remdesivir was observed 11 vs 15 days p  0001 with non-significant reduced mortality risk 8 vs 12 p  0059 other non-significant benefit data were identified from the wang et al trial including invasive ventilation and oxygen use at day 28 1 vs 4 and 12 vs 17 respectivelyrisk data were only available from the wang et al trial which reported fewer serious adverse events in patients taking remdesivir 18 compared with the placebo group 26 however more patients in the remdesivir group discontinued treatment as a result of an adverse event compared with those patients receiving placebo 12 vs 5a serious adverse event is any event that results in death is life-threatening requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or is a birth defectsample sizes for each outcome were limited to those available in the original studies and may not have adequate power to detect differences in risk between groups especially where the outcomes examined were not the primary outcome of interest the benefitrisk assessment is limited by the availability of data which currently consists of two studies within severe covid-19 the generalisability of these results to other populations is unknown for example application of the wang et al results outside of china 27 however this assessment can be subsequently updated once further data from clinical trials are available in addition given the public health urgency of the covid-19 pandemic it is important to provide a systematic assessment of the benefits and risks of remdesivir treatment with evidence available to date and establish a framework that can be used to rapidly update the assessment once further data become availabledata quality is not reflected in this benefitrisk assessment though all data was extracted from peer-reviewed manuscripts with the exception of data included from the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial these data were obtained from the niaid website a government agency website and included time to recovery and mortality data safety data have not been published on the website at this time since the full results of this clinical trial were not made available at the time of datalock april 30 2020 a wncb analysis was not undertaken because there was a concern that only including efficacy outcomes from the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial may bias the wncb results it is anticipated that such an analysis can be undertaken in the future when results are made available to provide further evidence on the benefitrisk profile our conclusion is based on a qualitative assessment of the available data and subject to change based on further data availabilityconfirmation of causality was not a requirement for inclusion of data in the brat assessment patients may have been on other concomitant medications or had other medical conditions at the time of remdesivir treatment finally we considered hospitalisation of patients to reflect severe covid-19 but we acknowledge that severity of disease may vary regardless of hospitalisationpreliminary clinical trial results suggest that there may be a favourable benefitrisk profile for remdesivir compared with placebo in severe covid-19 infection and further data on benefits would strengthen this evaluation there is limited safety data for remdesivir which should be obtained in further studies the current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks for which further data are needed ongoing clinical trial data can be incorporated into the framework when available to provide an updated benefitrisk assessmentrecently coronavirus disease covid-191 emerged in wuhan hubei province china and has since become a pandemic currently the situation in many countries such as south korea italy and iran is critical the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever and cough2 in severe cases the infection can cause pneumonia severe acute respiratory syndrome kidney failure and even death the mortality in the elderly ie over 65 years old with underlying diseases is high the coronaviruses belong to a new rna virus strain from the coronaviridae family3 and sars-cov-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans4 at present there are no effective antiviral drugs confirmed for treating covid-19 and symptomatic support and comprehensive intervention are the main treatment methods however treatment with the traditional chinese medicine tcm and the combination of tcm and western medicine have produced satisfactory therapeutic effects in china and vellingiri et al also suggested that traditional indian medicinal plants may be a novel treatment for covid-195 lu reviewed the possible treatments for covid-19 and stated the safety and effectiveness of such treatments remain to be confirmed6 additionally iyer et al have reviewed efficient diagnostics and therapeutic approaches for covid-197in medical research clinical trials are essential for promoting human health clinical trials on new drugs and interventions are registered to provide the public health professionals researchers and sponsors with reliable information rendering the design and implementation of clinical trials transparent and enabling the search and evaluation of such trials on the internet89 people can retrieve crucial information about the initial stages of the trials from clinical trial registries and learn from the methods used to conduct them registering clinical trials also facilitates international cooperation and enables sponsors to use funds in meaningful ways in addition registration prevents researchers from making biased decisions because of publication bias or incomplete reports wherein the negative results are withheld or ambiguous results have been presented1011clinicaltrialsgov is the largest registry of clinical trials which has been established and is operated by the us national institutes of health and the us national library of medicine all types of clinical trials conducted worldwide can be registered in advance on clinicaltrialsgov besides this website enables users to search for all ongoing international multicenter clinical trials12 by the end of 2019 327525 clinical trials had been registered on clinicaltrialsgov with 209 participating countries the chinese clinical trial registry chictr was established in 2005 and was recognized as the representative registry of china to be a part of the world health organization international clinical trials registry platform in 2007 the chictr has the highest number of registered clinical trials than any other clinical trial network in china based on the registered clinical trial data we have successfully researched for the sample sizes for clinical trials investigating the dosage13 reviewed the clinical trials on ginseng14 and studied the characteristics of tcm clinical trials15 although zhang et al analyzed the clinical trials their study period ended on february 12 2020 and only 87 intervention trials were studied16the number of covid-19 clinical trials registered with clinicaltrialsgov and chictr has grown considerably over the past 3 months in the present study the content from clinical trials registered in china was summarized and analyzed from various perspectives as a reference for the design of clinical trials for covid-19covid-19 and china were used as the keywords to search for all covid-19 clinical trials registered from china on clinicaltrialsgov and chictr on march 10 2020 all retrieved records were downloaded and the following data were collected chictr or clinicaltrialsgov identifier study title study type study design primary outcome measures condition number of groups and sample size a standard microsoft-excel database was created for the analysisall continuous values are expressed as median and interquartile range and categorical variables are expressed as percentages all statistical procedures were performed using the sas software v94 sas institute cary nc usain total 429 covid-19 clinical trials were registered from china 359 in chictr and 70 in clinicaltrialsgov after the exclusion of 127 observational trials and 40 other trials based on basic science epidemiology health services prevention prognosis diagnosis and treatment studies 262 clinical trials were defined as interventional clinical trials figure 1 and supplementary data fileinterventional clinical trials stratified by the study design were as follows randomized parallel 200 763 nonrandomized parallel 21 80 and single-group assignment 41 156 the clinical trials according to the type of blinding were as follows double-blind 24 92 single-blind 12 46 open-label 96 366 and not provided 130 496overall 35 trials involved a single group 134 181 trials involved two groups 691 32 trials involved three groups 122 and 14 trials involved at least four groups 54 the clinical trials stratified by the severity of symptoms were as follows mild and moderate 213 813 and severe and critical 49 187 table 1
the sample size among the 262 intervention trials was between 9 and 1000 cases and the cumulative statistical sample size was 36406 cases of which the minimum sample size was 9 cases chictr2000030300 two clinical trials had the largest sample size of 1000 cases chictr2000030386 and chictr2000029578 and were the tcm clinical trialsin summary 603 of the trials included 100 participants 355 of trials involved 100400 participants and 42 involved 400 participants figure 2in most clinical trials symptom improvement was the primary outcome measure which included the symptom improvement rate and recovery time covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by a virus and hence the negative effects of the virus are the key indicators for identifying a cure for this disease the mortality rates are higher in the elderly and critically ill patients than in the young subjects however some trials have used mortality as the primary endpointwhen classifying the studies by primary outcome measures 229 studies focused on the improvement in clinical symptoms 164 on the rate or time at which the subjects became virus-free 118 on the change in pneumonia severity 69 on the time required for a fever to subside 65 on the cure rate and 57 on the mortality rate table 2

the covid-19 outbreak has been listed by the world health organization as a major public health emergency of international concern that seriously endangers public health and safety no effective antiviral therapy has been identified yet for covid-19 symptomatic supportive therapy and comprehensive intervention are the main treatment methods for covid-19 during the pandemic front-line medical staff are required to constantly improve the treatment methods therefore many clinical trials are necessary clinical trial registration is the primary link ensuring clinical trial transparency crucial content for medical research ethics and researchers responsibility and obligations as the research on prevention and control of covid-19 progresses the number of registered clinical trials has continued to grow as of march 10 2020 429 clinical trials for covid-19 have been conducted in chinaoperating double-blinded trials in the current emergency covid-19 situation is difficult particularly for the cell therapy and other behavioral intervention trials however regarding the design type the proportion of randomized controlled trials remains the largest because this design type has the potential of causing the least the bias and the level of evidence is the highest in clinical studies17 without any reliable evidence single-arm trials are an acceptable trial design18 although single-arm tests can be used before and after the control single-arm trials are closer to clinical practice in operation most retrieval trials are exploratory and their sample size is not supposed to be too large13 thus the expected sample size can be completed in a short time and the trial results can be obtained faster these clinical trials were conducted with the main features of the current outbreak therefore they should be accepted during this pandemic period the clinical trial design must adhere to the basic principles of randomization control and replication use objective primary endpoint and blind evaluation as far as possible and follow statistical guidelines for clinical trials to avoid hasty analysis leading to incorrect conclusionsthe currently registered studies have had many primary endpoints including improvement of clinical symptoms time or rate of becoming viral-negative and mortality given the high cure rate of the disease improving symptoms is critical for reducing the critical illness rate and mortality these indicators of efficacy can be evaluated in the near future as a crucial discharge standard the rate at which the subjects become virus-free represent the recovery rate of the patients and the duration infected with the virus respectively the absence of detectable virus nucleic acid can reduce the spread of the virus because the mortality rate of mild to moderate patients with this disease is low the mortality rate is suitable as the primary endpoint for severe patientsalthough no effective therapy has been developed for covid-19 various intervention measures have been adopted including tcm antiviral drugs cell therapy plasma therapy behavioral intervention and psychological intervention in the retrieved studies even with the administration of antiviral therapy further interventions were still required the antiviral drugs included azvudine ganovoritonavir danoprevir favipiravir ritonavirritonavir baloxavir marboxil remdesivir oseltamivir arbidol ritonavir darunavircobicistat and lopinavirritonavir these antiviral drugs are potentially effective for treating covid-19619 a trial using favipiravir an anti-influenza drug used to treat life-threatening rna viral infections20 has been carried out registration number chictr20000029600 and the results will soon be publishedremdesivir is an investigational antiviral drug developed by gilead sciences foster city ca usa to treat covid-19 and ebola21 holshue et al reported the entire diagnosis and treatment process of the first confirmed patient in the united states and the patients symptoms improved after remdesivir use as an emergency treatment22 at present two clinical trials nct04252664 and nct04257656 of remdesivir in china have attracted much attention both trials were randomized double-blind and placebo-controlled studies one trial involved 308 mild to moderate covid-19 patients and the other involved 453 severe covid-19 patients under the registration number nct04257656 453 severe covid-19 patients were scheduled for admission with the outbreak under control in china 237 cases remdesivir group 158 and placebo group 79 were enrolled in the trial and the study results showed no significant clinical benefit among adult patients admitted for severe covid-19 treated with remdesivir23 also antimalarial drugs potentially treat covid-1924 the results by gautret et al showed that hydroxychloroquine is significantly associated with virus elimination in covid-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin25a limitation of the present study is that the results of the clinical trials were not included as viral spread is currently being controlled the number of patients will greatly decrease in china thus meeting the needs of all patients registered in clinical trials may be difficult as the current pandemic worsens the more we will have to adhere to the evidence-based medicine for the recovery of the patients and the effective prevention and control of the pandemic at this time it is necessary for the national and local administrative departments to strengthen the management the relevant departments should organize research in a scientific standardized and orderly manner and call on the relevant departments to conduct on-site inspection supervision and research in future research we will analyze the safety and effectiveness of covid-19 clinical trials in china and other countries the efficacy and safety of these clinical trials can provide strong evidence for other countries to fight against covid-19based on the registration data obtained from chictr and clinicaltrialsgov in china this study revealed the basic characteristics of anti-covid-19 trials in china including the study designs samples primary end points and intervention measures this study also provides useful information to guide future clinical trials on covid-19 in other countriesin late 2019 a cluster of pneumonia cases reported in wuhan china was associated with a novel coronavirus initially called the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov 1 posteriorly the sequence of the 2019-ncov genome revealed high similarity to sars-cov the causative agent of the epidemic of severe and acute respiratory syndrome sars between 2002 and 2003 in asia then the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv renamed 2019-ncov as sars-cov-2 and the world health organization who defined that this pathogen causes the coronavirus disease of 2019 covid-19 25sars-cov-2 is responsible for a respiratory infection that can progress to severe pneumonia covid-19 has an estimated mortality rate of approximately 235 which increases with age and the presence of comorbidities eg hypertension cardiac insufficiency diabetes and asthma by april 15 2020 the novel coronavirus had affected 2033406 people and caused more than 130000 deaths worldwide 6 the public health calamity caused by covid-19 has led to the exhaustion of health systems worldwide forcing countries to adopt extreme measures such as the closure of their land borders and initiating social distancing policies to slow down the spread of the disease 7currently laboratories and medical teams worldwide have focused on the repurposing of food and drug administration fda-approved drugs to treat the most severe cases of covid-19 since there are no specific chemotherapeutic agents to treat this infection 1 indeed drug repositioning might be a short-term alternative to fight this disease since the efficacy safety and toxicity of these drugs are already well known the initial phases of clinical trials could be skipped which would reduce the cost and duration of the process 8 in general drug repurposing is a cheaper faster and accessible way to make drugs available to the clinic 9 10in this context several clinical and preclinical studies have searched for new pharmacological alternatives against covid-19 in clinically available drugs however current studies remain decentralized and no recent review has been able to summarize the available evidence of the anti-sars-cov-2 activity of these fda-approved drugs thus in this systematic review we aim to describe the drug repositioning strategy against sars-cov-2 and its clinical impact in the current context of the covid-19 pandemicwe performed a systematic review according to the cochrane handbook 11 the search and selection of articles as well as extraction analysis and interpretation of data were conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma statement 12 pubmedmedline scopus cochrane library and biblioteca virtual de sade bvs were searched for articles investigating the antiviral activity of clinically available drugs published until march 23 2020 we aimed to select articles describing clinical and pre-clinical tests in vitro in vivo and in silico to include the largest amount of data in this review additionally we searched the clinicatrialgov website to identify ongoing trials with potential candidates for the drug repositioning strategy against sars-cov-2indexed keywords from medical subject headings mesh were used to build search strategies the terms antiviral agents or drug repositioning or drug repurposing were combined with the keywords covid-19 or sars-cov-2 or 2019-ncov by the use of boolean and between the terms as in the example drug repositioning and covid-19 all details about the search strategies can be found in the supplementary file to avoid losing any possible study the reference list of all included studies and relevant reviews regarding this topic were also screenedtwo authors wgl and jcmb independently screened the databases and extracted relevant information following the prisma flowchart the degree of agreement between the evaluators was determined by the kappa coefficient performed with a 95 confidence interval 13 discrepancies about the relevance of the sources were resolved by a third researcher wscn finally all data of interest were summarized in tables tables 1 2 3 and 4 for further critical analysis and interpretationas shown in figure 1 we identified 33 articles during the initial search 30 from pubmedmedline two from biblioteca virtual de sade and one from scopus after the exclusion of repeated records and the selection of articles by the inclusion criteria fig 1 15 relevant studies were pre-selected of these 11 were excluded following the criteria described in figure 1 and four were selected for extraction of variables of interest 1417 the reference lists of included articles were analyzed and eight new studies were identified 1825 totaling 12 papers 1425 the degree of agreement between the two authors was considered substantial kappa

sedative-hypnotic 35 257 and anti-venous insufficiency 35 257 agents was also investigated other classes of drugs have also been studied against sars-cov-2 ie anthelmintic antiallergic antiemetic antiepileptic antifungal antihypertensive antipsychotic anti-hemolytic-uremic syndrome anti-angioedema lipid-lowering immunomodulatory and anti-pulmonary-hypertension drugs however only one agent of each class was evaluated 157 17 fig 2amost of the drugs with potential activity against covid-19 were identified by molecular docking 53 3057 fig 2b 2024 using the main protease 3clpro of sars-cov-2 as the molecular target table 3 moreover 39 2257 fig 2b of the drugs showed an anti-covid-19 effect in clinical trials table 4 and 10 of them showed evidence of action in clinical practice 10 657 1417 table 1 additionally 19 1157 18 19 fig 2b of the drugs studied showed antiviral activity in vitro for instance remdesivir showed the highest activity against sars-cov-2 inhibiting 50 of the virus at a concentration of 077 m 18 while ribavirin showed a less pronounced effect 10950 m 18 table 2 therefore the antiviral activity of only 27 compounds 47 2757 has been experimentally evaluated the remaining 30 reported drugs were identified only by theoretical methods in silico and need proof of antiviral efficacy in further studies table 3regarding the clinical trials of new therapeutic options against covid-19 most drugs are in phase ii 36 822 or iii 27 622 table 4 only seven drugs chloroquine tetrandrine umifenovir arbidol carrimycin damageprevir lopinavirritonavir are in phase iv of clinical trials table 4 interestingly two of these agents in advanced clinical studies umifenovir arbidol and the association lopinavirritonavir have demonstrated previous evidence of action wang et al 14 reported that the use of arbidol in combination with lopinavirritonavir inhibits the aggravation of pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 and promotes a virus-negative conversion in patients from china arbidol has also shown a potent in vitro effect against sars-cov-2 inhibiting the virus up to 60 times compared to the untreated control at concentrations ranging from 10 to 30 m 26the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 the causative agent of covid-19 has quickly become a threat to the public health and economy worldwide 7 27 recent clinical reports have shown that sars-cov-2 causes mild self-limiting respiratory tract illness as well as severe progressive pneumonia which can progress to multiorgan failure and death 1 despite the severity of some cases there are no current pathogen-specific antivirals available to treat this disease 1 therefore many studies have focused on the evaluation of the anti-sars-cov-2 activity of clinically available drugs 1after the analysis of the selected studies we identified 57 molecules with potential antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 of these only six drugs lopinavirritonavir umifenovir arbidol remdesivir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown promising results in preclinical trials and have clinically lessened the symptoms of covid-19 since the other fda-approved drugs reported in this review showed weak activity against covid-19 we have chosen to discuss only the most promising moleculeslopinavir and ritonavir are antiretrovirals widely used as a combination drug to treat human immunodeficiency virus hiv infections lopinavir is an hiv type 1 aspartate protease inhibitor and ritonavir increases its plasma half-life through the inhibition of cytochrome p450 28 previous studies showed that lopinavir inhibits the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease which is involved in viral replication and is highly conserved among members of different viral species 29 lopinavir inhibited the replication of mers-cov and sars-cov in huh7 cells human liver strain in a dose-dependent manner with an ec50 of 80 m for both viruses 29 moreover lopinavirritonavir significantly reduced the mortality rate of mice infected with mers-cov suggesting a strong in vivo antiviral effect 30little is known about the activity of lopinavirritonavir against sars-cov-2 and its effectiveness table 1 for instance wang et al 14 showed that the use of lopinavirritonavir considerably improved the clinical condition of patients with covid-19 however arbidol a broad-spectrum antiviral with activity against several enveloped and non-enveloped viruses eg influenza virus adenovirus avian coronavirus and hepatitis b and c viruses 31 was also administered to the patients n  4 the combination of lopinavirritonavir with arbidol makes it difficult to associate the observed antiviral effect to lopinavirritonavir or to its synergistic effect with arbidol in contrast mo et al 16 showed that the clinical improvement of patients with covid-19 was more associated with supportive measures such as mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation than with the use of lopinavirritonavir likewise a study of 199 hospitalized adult patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection showed that the use of lopinavirritonavir does not increase the effectiveness of the standard treatment 15 these findings confirm that lopinavirritonavir has low clinical efficacy and is not a therapeutic option to treat covid-19 however the efficacy related to the use of these antiretrovirals as a combination therapy with other drugs should be elucidated in future studiesarbidol umifenovir is an anti-influenza agent that has been used in china and russia for many years it interacts with the viral hemagglutinin ha and inhibits the fusion of the viral particle with the plasma membrane 32 this drug inhibited crucial stages of the sars-cov-2 replication cycle in vitro in a concentration ranging from 10 to 30 m 26 also a study has indicated that arbidol significantly lessened pneumonia associated with covid-19 14 these results have stimulated the initiation of clinical trials with this medicine table 4 for instance a chinese group of the ruijin hospital is currently conducting a phase iv study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of arbidol hydrochloride tablets in treating pneumonia in 380 patients with covid-19 clinicaltrialgov nct04260594previous in vitro studies have indicated that arbidol shows significant activity against other coronaviruses herein a research group showed that this compound negatively affects the early stages of viral replication of sars-cov at a concentration of 50 gml this study also highlighted the stronger antiviral activity of arbidol mesylate compared to arbidol as an alkaline preparation 33 these preliminary results indicate that arbidol is a promising candidate for drug repositioning against sars-cov-2 however further studies are required to assess the difference in the effectiveness of arbidol and arbidol mesylate in patients with covid-19remdesivir is a broad-spectrum prodrug developed to treat infections caused by ebola virus and marburg virus its active ingredient gs-441524 decreases the production of rna by interfering with viral rna polymerase and evading proofreading by viral exonuclease 34 recent studies have shown that remdesivir inhibits the replication of sars-cov and mers-cov in human lung cells 35 wang et al 18 showed that remdesivir has potent activity against sars-cov-2 in kidney cells with an ec50 of 077 m additionally this drug induced the clinical remission of the symptoms of covid-19 in the first reported case in the usa table 1 17 due to these promising results a phase iii clinical trial has evaluated the antiviral activity of remdesivir and its safety in patients with severe covid-19 this study is assessing the ability of remdesivir to normalize body temperature and oxygen saturation in 400 hospitalized adult patients clinicaltrialgov nct04292899 therefore the results of this clinical trial can guide the prescription of remdesivir as an anti-sars-cov-2 agent in the futurechloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are antimalarial agents widely used to treat rheumatic diseases and have also shown promising activity against covid-19 36 the first evidence of their antiviral effect against coronavirus was reported in 2004 when keyaerts and collaborators showed that chloroquine inhibited the in vitro replication of sars-cov on vero cells e6 in this study chloroquine negatively affected sars-cov-2 at a concentration of 8 m 37 interestingly chloroquine inhibited the virus when the cells were treated with the drug before or after exposure to sars-cov suggesting prophylactic and therapeutic effects 38 this drug also affects the entry and replication of sars-cov-2 with an ec50 of 113 m 18 moreover hydroxychloroquine a less toxic derivative of chloroquine is also able to inhibit the entry and replication of sars-cov-2 with an ec50 of 451 m table 2 19 additionally the preclinical results have suggested that this antimalarial blocks the transport of sars-cov-2 from endosomes to endolysosomes which is a process required to release the viral genome 18 19the promising in vitro results of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have motivated the initiation of clinical studies of these substances table 4 one of these studies evaluates the prophylactic effect of the oral use of chloroquine in 10000 patients against sars-cov-2 clinicaltrialgov nct04303507 additionally several clinical trials have evaluated the prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine clinicaltrialgov nct04318015 and nct04318444 its therapeutic use in monotherapy clinicaltrialgov nct04315896 or the effect of its combination with other antivirals clinicaltrialgov nct04303299 nct04321278 and nct0430127 and nct0430127 and nct0430127 against covid-19the rapid popularization of these preliminary results has led to a massive and irrational demand for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in brazil for example after the first reports of the clinical effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine against covid-19 this drug quickly sold out in pharmacies which has compromised patients who use this drug continually to treat autoimmune diseases this irrational demand caused the agncia nacional de vigilncia sanitria anvisa to include these two drugs in the list of controlled substances to prevent their use to treat covid-19 without prescription or proof of effectiveness this situation highlights the importance of controlling the release of preliminary results especially in the panic scenario created by the pandemicalthough several studies have identified clinically available agents that are active against sars-cov-2 infections supportive therapy remains essential for instance mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation have been critical to the survival of patients with severe covid-19 mo et al 16 showed that that oxygen supplementation and noninvasive or invasive ventilation have generated similar results to the use of an antiretroviral with known in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 additionally wang et al 14 showed that the clinical recovery of patients with covid-19 is more associated with supportive therapies than with the use of antiviral agents however the identification of available drugs with anti-sars-cov-2 activity and their use in association with supportive therapies should be considered also the development of faster diagnostic tools to test for covid-19 might be crucial since some of the candidates for drug repositioning must be administered early in the course of infection thus better testing methodologies could lead to the early administration of drugs and improve the treatment of covid-19the rapid spread of sars-cov-2 worldwide has put pressure on research centers to develop effective therapies and vaccines for the treatment of sars-cov-2 drug repositioning is a promising short-term strategy in the fight against the novel coronavirus however supportive measures are essential mainly for severe covid-19 patients and the implementation of drug repositioning should be done only if the efficacy of the drugs have been proven although lopinavirritonavir had low anti-sars-cov-2 activity arbidol remdesivir and chloroquinehydroxychloroquine showed promising effects against this coronavirus therefore the outcomes of the ongoing clinical trials are urgently needed to evaluate the best treatment options for covid-19 furthermore additional studies of the antiviral activity of molecules that have shown a promising in silico effect may increase the therapeutic arsenal against the novel coronaviruson march 18 2020 the world health organization launched the solidarity trial and soon after an add-on trial a european initiative of the reacting consortium the discovery trial was announced 12 currently there are no approved therapies specific for any human cov trials are based on repurposed drugs that are already approved for other diseases have acceptable safety profiles or have performed well in animal studies against the other two deadly coronaviruses which cause sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers solidarity includes research looking at four possible therapeutics with direct antiviral actions remdesivir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine lopinavir plus ritonavir and lopinavir plus ritonavir and interferon-beta while chloroquine will not be included in the discovery trial additionally the discovery trial will include a placebo arm with standard of care while the solidarity trial will not be blinded and patients will know they received a treatment that would cause a placebo effect as stated by ana maria henao restrepo a medical officer at the who department of immunization vaccines and biologicals additional information regarding lung imaging and blood gases will be monitored in the discovery trial besides data on hospitalization length and requirement for oxygen or ventilation to be collected by the solidarity trial 3sars-coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 the etiologic agent of the new lung disease covid-194 is closely related to sars-cov and together with mers-cov are three new human coronaviruses that emerged in the last 20 years 5 the three viruses are associated with increased risk of acute lung injury 6 as of april 15 2020 more than 2 million people have been infected worldwide in 200 countries resulting in a death toll that surpasses 135000 people in this ongoing pandemic httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus sars-cov-2 is an enveloped positive sense single stranded non-segmented rna virus of the betacoronavirus family 7remdesivir targets virus replication through inhibition of the viral rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp required for the copying and synthesis of novel viral genomes and viral mrnas for the expression of viral proteins remdesivir incorporation in the nascent viral rna by the rdrp results in premature chain termination and because of the high conservation of the core rdrp enzyme among coronaviruses it has a broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy against multiple genetically distinct coronaviruses including the sars-cov and mers-cov in vitro and in vivo 8 furthermore it has shown prophylactic action against infection of corona viruses in animal models 8 notably remdesivir potently blocked sars-cov-2 infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high selectivity index in vero e6 cells a monkey epithelial cell line ec50  077 m cc50 100 m si 12987 9 it should be noted that remdesivir resistance is already documented for sars-cov and other coronaviruses that lead to reduced viral inhibition 10the outcomes in a cohort of patients hospitalized for severe covid-19 who were treated with remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis were recently reported by grein et al 11 fifty-three patients received 10-day course of remdesivir consisting of a loading dose of 200 mg intravenously on day 1 plus 100 mg daily for the following 9 days improvement in oxygen-support status was observed in 68 of patients and overall mortality was 13 over a median follow-up of 18 days although no data on viral dynamics were documented throughout the study clinical improvement was less frequent among patients receiving invasive ventilation than among those receiving noninvasive ventilation and among patients aged 70 years or older as compared with patients younger than 50 yearschloroquine and hydroxychloroquine a less toxic derivative represent potential broad-spectrum example of inhibiting viral cell entry chloroquine is a weak base that becomes entrapped in membrane-enclosed low ph organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes and inhibits their acidification low ph in the endosomes regulates the action of proteases that lead to conformational changes of the virus envelope proteins allowing for the fusion of cellular and viral membranes and the escape of the viral genome into the cytosol attachment and entry of sars-cov-2 on host cells requires interaction of the spike protein subdomain 1 s with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and its proteolytic cleavage by tmprss2 and to a lesser degree by the acid activated cathepsin bl 12 although the exact mechanism of sars-cov-2 entry is not completely understood and a new study has suggested that ph-dependent fusion of viral and cellular membranes is dispensable for viral genome entry into host cells chloroquine similarly to remdesivir inhibited sars-cov-2 infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high selectivity index in vero e6 cells ec50  113 m cc50 100 m si 8850 9chloroquine is also used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as sle and ra 13 although the precise mechanism of action is not documented inhibition of endosome acidification also interferes with innate immune response signaling from endosomal tlrs such as tlr 3 7 8 and 9 that mainly detect nucleic acid pamps and damps and in this way reduce inflammatory responses therefore chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may also protect the host from overt inflammatory responses driven by the activation of immune cells such as macrophages by the increased load of viral rna or cellular nucleic acids released from infected cellsresults from clinical trials using chloroquine have provided promising results despite the limitations of these studies and suggest that chloroquine may represent a line of defense in the protection of medical stuff and patients with increased risk for severe covid-19 symptoms chen et al 14 evaluated the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine hcq in the treatment of 62 patients with mild covid-19 from february 4 to 28 2020 at renmin hospital of wuhan university patients were randomized either in a control group receiving standard treatment or in the hcq group in which the patients received standard treatment plus hcq 200 mgbid between days 1 and 5 the study focused on time to clinical recovery ttcr clinical characteristics of patients and pulmonary recovery as it was depicted on chest ct results one day before day 0 and one day after day 6 a beneficial effect of hcq in the treatment of covid-19 was pointed out despite the small number of the cases more specifically body temperature recovery time and cough remission time were significantly reduced in the hcq treatment group moreover the study of the chest ct scans revealed larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the hcq group 806 compared with the control group 548gautret et al 15 from france conducted a single arm protocol from early march to march 16 patients received 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily azithromycin was added to the treatment regimen as the clinical presentation required and the control group was represented by untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol patientsviral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was evaluated on daily basis virus clearance at day-6 post-inclusion was the primary endpoint while virus clearance during the study period clinical parameters and occurrence of side-effects were considered secondary outcomesregarding the effect of hydroxychloroquine on viral load the study showed that a greater proportion of patients from the treated group had negative pcr results at days 3-6 post-inclusion compared with the control group interestingly at day 6 post-inclusion the percentage of negative pcr patients in the treated group was 70 while it was 125 in the control group p0001 the addition of azithromycin in the therapeutic regimen enhanced the beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine more intensely patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were all 100 clear of virus at day 6 post-inclusion comparing with 571 in the group that was treated with hydroxychloroquine only and 125 in the control group p0001the last two arms of solidarity and discovery trials include kaletra which is a combination of two antiviral drugs - lopinavir and ritonavir - normally used to treat hiv lopinavir acts against the viral 3cl protease responsible for the cleavage of the viral structural proteins from a polypeptide chain in order to produce new virions lopinavir has modest antiviral activity against mers and is significantly less potent than remdesivir 16 however in combination with ritonavir and the antiviral immunomodulator interferon  it is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of mers 17 the efficacy and safety of oral lopinavir-ritonavir for sars-cov-2 infection was tested through a randomized controlled trial in china but found no benefit beyond standard care 18 kaletra with or without interferon 1 will be tested in the solidarity and discovery trialsfavipiravir brand name avigan is a type of rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp inhibitor which acts through blocking the replication of rna viruses and is a potential antiviral agent against sars-cov-219 a prospective multicenter open-label randomized superiority trial examined the efficacy of favipiravir n120 versus arbidol n120 for treating covid-1920 there was no difference in the 7-day clinical recovery rate primary endpoint for favipiravir versus arbidol in the overall population 6121 versus 5167 p014 however this difference existed for a subgroup of non-critical patients without hypertension or diabetes favipiravir 7143 versus arbidol 5586 p002 20 three registered clinical trials are planned regarding the use of favipiravir against covid-19 21-23several promising theurapeutic options are emerging such as a protease inhibitor specific for tmprss2 cell protease required for virus entry 12 the broad spectrum orally bioavailable -d-n4-hydroxycytidine nhc eidd-1931 that is incorporated in the viral genome by the rdrp leading to the accumulation of deleterious mutations and viral inactivation 24the four current regimens in solidarity and discovery focus on antiviral drugs rather than treating ards symptoms that are actually the cause of the virus morbidity and mortality hyperinflammation in coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 could be a driver of severity that may be managed with immunomodulatory therapeutic options 2526 low-dose corticosteroid therapy shock-reversal over no corticosteroid therapy is suggested for adults with covid-19 and refractory shock in mechanically ventilated adults with covid-19 and respiratory failure but without ards the routine use of systemic corticosteroids is not suggested however in mechanically ventilated adults with covid-19 and ards using systemic corticosteroids is suggested 27-29 importantly the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without the co-administration of azithromycin may not be beneficial for the treatment of critically ill patients admitted to the icu 30 and is not recommended 2731immunomodulatory drugs such as tocilizumab actemra anti-il6 have been tested during the pandemic however great caution in inhibiting host antiviral responses should be taken 26 tocilizumab actemra is a recombinant humanized anti-human il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody currently used for rheumatoid arthritis 32 xu et al demonstrated that giving tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy to patients diagnosed as severe or critical covid-19 is an effective treatment 33 covacta is a newly initiated randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase iii study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous actemraroactemra added to standard care in adult patients hospitalized with severe covid-19 pneumonia compared to placebo plus standard care the primary and secondary endpoints include clinical status mortality mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit icu variables 34finally the use of stem cell therapy to treat covid-19 is currently considered with multiple clinical trials from china registered at wwwclinicaltrialsgov 35 in a recently published clinical trial with a limited number of patients 7 patients 1 critically serious 4 serious and 2 common infected with the coronavirus received one dose of stem cell therapy with 3 patients in the control group 3 serious did not all patients with stem cell therapy recovered whereas in the control group one patient died while another patient developed ards and only one patient in the control group was stable 36important considerations in the successful testing and use of currently available and future therapies for covid-19 are the timing of the treatment the viral load of the patient and markers predictive of lung injury antiviral treatment is more efficient as a prophylactic measure and at earlier times during the infection when virus replication is at its peak conversely immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory treatments may be more effective later and may be combined with careful monitoring of the patient viral loadsthe emergence of zoonotic human viruses causing pandemics are probably not going to be limited to the sars-cov-2 and represent enormous threats to global health pandemic preparedness in the future broad-based vaccines and therapeutics which are active against the higher risk virus families prone to emergence are desperately needed as well as global efforts to minimize their emergencecoronaviruses covs belong to the genus coronavirus in coronaviridae family covs are enveloped positive-stranded rna viruses with a nucleocapsid capsid with nucleic acid reported size of 300400 nm under the electron microscope 6 all covs are pleomorphic viruses that usually produce 80160 nm and 2732 kb positive polarity of crown-shaped peplomers 7 cov recombinations are very large as rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp jumps and transcription errors are continually increasing which might lead to genetic drifting within the same strain 8 with their rapid mutation rates covs are zoonotic viruses found in humans as well as other animal species with a broad array of clinical symptoms from asymptomatic to the hospitalization in an intensive-care facility 3 covs were not known to be highly pathogenic in humans until they were first detected in guangdong in 2002 and 2003 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 9 there were two more common types of covs cov-oc43 and cov-229e that trigger moderate infections in people with an adequate immune system before these outbreaks about 10 years ago since sars appeared mers-cov in the middle east countries another extremely pathogenic cov virus has evolved 910 in december 2019 a novel coronavirus ncov was established in wuhan huanan province of hubei and has become a significant global priority because of the outbreak of pneumonia where livestock was exchanged traded 11 the novel new virus sars-cov-2 is the seventh known cov to infect humans from this viral family at first on 12 december 2019 an unexplained case of pneumonia was identified in wuhan laboratory tests eliminated suspected influenza and other covs on 7 january 2020 the authorities in china declared the isolation of the new cov type 12 on 12th january 2019-ncov was designated by who and on 11 february 2020 was assigned covid-19 name a total of 2355853 recorded cases were registered with 164656 fatalities as of the 20 april 2020 13 on 29 january 2020 li et als case study reported in the new britain journal of medicine summarizes the 425 first documented cases in wuhan 314once the first case was identified the infection was possibly spread from animal to human as a zoonotic agent a second human-to-human route of transfer confirmed a surge in cases in wuhan and globally after the shutdown of the wuhan market and relocation of cases in china at the time of writing this review although china declared that it is free of new cases but have been reported at the beginning of april of 2020 of viral re-emergence a surge in the reported cases in europe italy france spain and uk and the usa had been reported 15 this review is intended to provide an informed opinion on the epidemic and forms in which this initial outbreak may be handled and avoided with expert insight into the current and potential available therapies scientists at the scripps research institute have found no proof that sars-cov-2 is a product of bio-engineering manipulation in laboratory facilities by conducting a comparative analysis of genomic data 16 therefore this virus is possibly novel and subsequent natural results of the mutations that the covs family is renowned for havingthis epidemic has spread exponentially across the globe ever since the advent of the latest coronaviral epidemic covid-19 triggered by the sars-cov-2 virus 1718 in consideration of the possibility of a pandemic scientists and physicians have been trying to grasp this emerging virus and its pathophysiology to recognize potential therapeutic protocols and to find therapeutic agents and vaccinations that are successful in the disease management several pneumonia cases that were localized in wuhan in december 2019 were identified and sources were checked on 12 december 2019 the first case of covid-19 was identified with apparent pneumonia while on 31 december 2019 27 cases of extreme viral pneumonia were officially confirmed 15 etiological studies of people that came to the hospital due to specific viruses have been conducted the medical history of these patients has increased the likelihood of a virus outbreak novel sars-cov-2 from wild bats and group 2 -covs which comprises severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov was announced to be developed on 22 january 2020 this was the case although covid-19 and sars belong to the same category of -covs genome-overlap between the two species is only 70 the research group led by bao s has reported that there are some genetic differences with sars-cov 17 this outbreak has occurred in similar ways to the sars epidemic during chinas spring festival which is chinas most prominent traditional festival where almost 3 billion citizens fly around the world to witness it this created ideal conditions for the transmission and resulted in severe problems in the prevention and control of this extremely infectious disease from 17 january till 23 february 2003 the chinese spring festival ended in the sars outbreak and from 10th january to 18th february 2020 the festival was conducted once more the number of covid-19 reports from 10 to 22 january has risen rapidly wuhan is also a significant node of the spring festival transport network the center of the outbreak with approximately 10 million inhabitants the number of tourists expected at the spring festival in 2020 rose 1 seven-times over 2003 the same festival from 182 billion up to 311 billion the massive population flow has often provided ideal conditions for this problem to spread 19about 2355853 cases were reported globally after the start of the outbreak the evidence provided by the who safety specialist website 20 april at 2251 cet and 164656 of these were deadly approximately 83817 cases were recorded in china where nearly all fatalities were registered in 4636 with the highest level of reported cases in usa at the time of preparing this review with around 759687 reported cases and 40682 fatalities on 20 april at 2251 cet the who current coronavirus board of directors covid-19 is the most modified source of outbreaks in this evolving pandemic that has updated statistics of the virus epidemiologybased on the structural studies of - and -coronavirus the viral genome encodes many structural proteins including the spike s protein glycosylated which serves as a critical inducer for the host immune response with a functional polybais furin cleavage site at the s1s2 boundary through 12 nucleotides that have been reported 16 the s protein mediates host cell invasion by sars-cov as well as sars-cov-2 through binding of the host cells membrane protein receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 620 a detailed study conducted has shown that this cellular invasion includes the production of s-proteins facilitated by serine protease tmprss211 formed by the host cell the viral genome also encodes a variety of nonstructural proteins such as rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp coronaviral principal protease 3clpro and papain-like protease plpro 21 the viral genome is discharged as a positive sense of a single-strand rna ssrna into the cell subsequently it uses host cell protein translation machinery ribosomes to produce the viral polyprotein and then cleaves it into effector proteins through viral proteases 3clpro and plpro 22 the most complex component of the cov genome is the receptor-binding domain rbd in s protein six rbd amino acids were found to be important for ace2 binding and the host spectrum of viruses close to sars-cov 23 the y442 s472 n479 d480 t487 and y4911 which are l455 f486 q493 s494 n501 and y505 in sars-cov-2 are the co-ordinates centered on sars-cov sars-cov-2 and the sars-cov are five or six residues sars-cov-2 tends to have an rbd that connects humans ferrets cats and other highly-receptor-homologated animals with elevated ace2 affinity 624as there were several new sars-cov-2 cases in association with the huanan market in wuhan 2526 an animal host could be identified as a source of virus transmission since sars-cov-2 is identical to previous bat sars-cov 26 bats are possibly the host for their progenitor while ratg13 sampled with rhinolophus affinis bat is approximately 96 identical to sars-cov-2 indicating that it cannot effectively bind to human ace2 27 furthermore illegally smuggled infected animals into guangdong province such as malayan pangolins manis javanica can carry covs that is identical to sars-cov-2 28 besides while there is no animal cov quite close to sars-cov-2 the range of the covs is greatly undersampled in bats and other animals in the s1s2 junction of the cov mutations insertions and removals of nucleiotides may occur  this demonstrates that a normal evolutionary cycle will lead to a polybasic cleavage location in order for the precursor virus to obtain the polybase site of cleavage and the spike protein mutations necessary for the human binding of ace2 it will possibly need an animal host with a large population density for natural selection to occur effectively and an ace2 gene close to that present in human 16 the sars-cov-2 progenitor has probably jumped to humans gaining the mentioned genomic features by evolving during unrecognized human-to-human transmission such adaptations allowed the pandemic of the disease once it has been acquired 2628sars-cov-2 infection is primarily thought to transmit from human-to-human among individuals nearby about 6 feet with each other through direct contact and droplets 17 such droplets may fall or be inhaled by a cough or sneezing onto the mouths or throats of surrounding people furthermore it has been reported that people are known to be more infectious when they are most sickest symptomatic besides an individual may get sars-cov-2 by contacting a surface or entity contaminated with the virus by rubbing ears nose and maybe eyes after direct contact the sars-cov-2 virus in some of the infected populations community spread appears to be circulating quickly and sustainably among individuals 29information from public care bodies reviews and guidelines provide for separating the clinical cases according to the seriousness of the clinical photos the sars-cov-2 might be mild moderate or severe based on the strength of the immune system of the infected individual acute influenza ards sepsis and septic shock are among severe health symptoms a definite pattern in the bulk of cases tends to reflect the scientific development of the disease in a proportion that has yet to be identified after around a week infected individual health outcomes have unexpectedly worsened as respiratory failure has declined rapidly the extreme respiratory failure conditions and medical requirements of sepsis and septic shock should be taken seriously 3patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate illness usually have signs that include mild fever dry cough sore throat respiratory irritation fatigue stomach aches and malaise whereas reported dyspnea in patients were asymptomatic 15 nonrespiratory signs such as diarrhea are challenging to identify relative to prior hcov infections moderate pneumonia respiratory signs such as cough and shortness of breath or childrens tachypnea etc were reported for patients with some cases 13 extreme pneumonia fever is caused by heavy illnesses respiratory depression or hypoxia spo2 90 in the room fever is consistent with extreme pneumonia 30 nevertheless fever signs thought to be correctly recognized as mild or sometimes missing even in extreme cases of the disease in children cyanosis can occur the description includes a psychiatric condition and radiological terminology is used to remove complications with clinical and ventilatory requirements that are needed for this diagnosis 13 this condition indicates a severe new respiratory problem and a deterioration of a respiratory feature that has already been established the degree of hypoxia in various types of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards is distinct 31furthermore sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host responses to suspected or proven organ dysfunctions 32 the clinical pictures of patients with sars-cov-2 and sepsis are particularly severe with a wide variety of signs symptoms cardiac disorders such as extreme dyspnea and hypoxemia abnormal vomiting acidosis altered mental state and functional organ changes and signs of multi-organ shock presented as hyperbilirubinemia laboratory results 31just as the sars-cov-2 appeared real-time polymerase chain reactions rt-pcr remained the primary diagnostic tool for the latest viral strain among the different diagnostic platforms one research addressed the usage of rt-pcr in diagnosing patients with sars-cov-2 from 16 experimental trials 3342 the respiratory tests were shown to be positive for the virus although the serum in the early days of infection was negative this has indicated that patients had elevated virus rates amid minimal signs in the early days of illness 43 besides commonly used rt-pcr for the diagnosis of mers-cov several diagnostic procedures have been reported in four clinical trials such as rt-lam rt-lamp rt-insulated isothermal pcr rt-iipcr and rrt-pcr rt-pcr as one-step test focused on unique taqman kit rt-lamp is as responsive as rt-pcr as summarized in table 1 it is also extremely sensitive and can be used for mers-cov strain identification it is comparable to the standard diagnostic tests and is fast easy and comfortable rt-iipcr and a one-step rrt-pcr study were equally responsive and demonstrated strong mer-cov specificity finally a review based on validating the six consumer rt-pcr kits was carried out 3843the university of hong kong used two monoplex assays that were reactive sarbecovirus sars-cov-2 sars-cov and sars coronavirus like with coronaviruses 11 extracted viral rna from sars-cov would be used as a supportive positive control for the recommended procedure if sars was successfully eradicated 3744 the n-gene is recommended to be used as the screening tool in rt-pcr analysis whereas the orf1b tool serves as the confirmative measure the protocol has only been evaluated for the sars-cov rna control samples the synthetic oligonucleotide was used as a positive control whereas sars-cov-2 endogenous sequence is yet to be evaluated 44the us cdc distributed the real-time rt-pcr for the detection of sars-cov-2 with reaction primers and specifically engineered probes to detect sars-like coronavirus in general the same primer and protocol could be used for the detection of sars-cov-2 in particular based on high genomic similarities 15 additionally aside from this protocol mentioned above this protocol has not been evaluated on other platforms or reaction conditions chemistries each procedure has certain drawbacks the analysis technique will be qualified and familiarized with and understood by the participating analysts inappropriate processing distribution or treatment may result in false-negative results due to insufficient viral biological material in the sample rna viruses may also display major genetic variation and genetic drifts 45 this may lead to a discrepancy between the pcr primers and the detection probe sequence that may decrease the test efficiency or contribute to false-negative outcomes 45 the point of care poc evaluation kit can presumably mitigate such limits that should be given the highest priority in the next few months for research and development of diagnostic kits to increase the sensitivity and the reliability of the test 15 it may contribute to a discrepancy between the first and the goal series sensors which may reduce the test output or contribute to incorrect adverse outcomes the point of care test kit can mitigate these limitations which should be highly prioritized in the next few months for research and development 15cdc is said to have a two-serological study procedure by way of two screening tests and a confirmation check to identify mers-cov antibody 15 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa is a screening procedure used to determine the existence and amount of particular antibodies nucleocapsid n and spike s  that are bound to a viral protein 3345 if either elisa confirms whether a clinical sample is antibody-positive the cdc recommends the microneutralization method to validate the positive tests 715 the microneutralization procedure is an exact serological method designed to evaluate neutralizing antibodies or antibodies which may neutralize the virus this procedure is considered a gold-standard for the identification of sars-cov-2 antibodies in serum samples the microneutralization method though relative to elisa is time-consuming and labor-intensive require at least 5 days to produce results 15 fda has approved the first fast test by cepheid for the latest coronavirus on 23 march 2020 46the level of contamination including measurement of asymptomatic incidence and the attack intensity is easily calculated through serological measures including elisa iift and neutralization studies the serological experiments identify proteins and antigens in addition to the identification of the virus genome using biochemical approaches 45 there is a pause since the virus usually aimed at anti-corps from 14 and 28 days after the start of the disease furthermore evidence indicates that low titers of antibodies may be correlated with high viral load in a second week or with delayed antibody development serological diagnosis is more likely to be employed if nucleic amplification tests naat are not given or available 30the first and complete genome sequence of sars-cov-2 which provides the key to the possible structure and glycosylation pattern of viral proteins and thus modes of association with a host cell has been recently reported 25 january 2020 ncbi genbank mn9089473 47 this is an essential step in developing a vaccine for sars-cov-2 all the coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 encodes nucleocapsid protein n protein and s protein 20 as shown in figure 1 the n-protein is a structural protein bound to the rna genome of coronavirus and thereby forms a capsid around the enclosed nucleic acid the n-protein has the following roles in viral life-cycle associates with the viral membrane protein during viral assembly and facilitates the production and folding of rna this plays a part in viral budding s protein has two main tasks that enable host infection it facilitates the interaction between viruses and host cells throughout the surface receptors and it enables their entrance into the hosts cell by helping to connect the viral cell membranes with the hosts membranes 2047 ace2 is an intrinsic protein membrane that enables the entry of sars-cov-2 throughout invasion by binding its extracellular peptidase domain to s protein 26the glycoprotein of the outer membrane renowned for its glycosylation is identical to many other coronaviruses 20 the primary host interacting protein is essential for cell adhesion such as ace2 cd26 ezrin cyclophilins and other cell adhesive factors the specific host cell factors or proteins that make the current sars-cov-2 simpler are therefore still elusive 48 therefore the undertaken research at the present moment to investigate sars-cov-2 spike structures for glycoprotein and glycan shield patterns that have significant effects on viral camouflage and mode of cell entry which could help the production of new infection screening vaccinations and treatment another report of the covid-19 and sars-cov clustalw sequential coordination of glycoproteins reveals a 91 similarity in the s2 domain region aa570aa1278 but in three other regions aaa677690 wing aaa877884 and aa930943 stalk there are no structural correlations however in the s1 domain with a 51 difference in aa01aa550 known for its hostcell interaction involving cell adhesion and virulence 49 the potential molecular associations between s protein of sars-cov-2 and human cd26 receptors are considered to investigate structural variations or similarities in the interaction between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 s proteinto this end the researchers used cluspro-protein-docking wwwclusprobuedu and frodock httpfrodockchaconlaborg servers for establishing a model of sars-cov-2 spike and human cd26 model to predict the amino acids involved in the binding between the s1 domain and the cd26 receptor as shown in figure 2 49the n-terminal s1 domain of spike glycoprotein interacting with several host cell proteins is the primary motive for the trafficking in and the hijacking of coronaviruses in the host cells 20 host cellular receptors cd-26 is the crucial component in the immune regulatory pathway of viral infections responsible for the cleavage of amino-terminal dipeptides from polypeptides with either l-proline or l-alanine in the penultimate position of the sequence 13 as sars-cov-2 has gained global interest some 1520 possible vaccine candidates worldwide have been in the pipeline utilizing a range of technologies eg messenger rna dna nanoparticles synthetic and modified virus-like particles it can take more than 1 year to complete clinical trials for most candidates with the exception of those sponsored by the coalition for epidemic preparedness technologies cepi however the bgi kit met the national medicinal devices authorization test and is actually in use in chinas therapeutic and testing centers 50 out of 570 original research reviewed for sars-cov-2 sars cov or mers-cov vaccinations only four have been included 3 in the majority of the sars and mers research as carried out in cell or animal models they were omitted the four trials used in this analysis included the phase-i sars or mers clinical tests no population style studies were carried out at the screening point on the sars-cov-2 cell species human the clinical trials released were conducted mostly in the usa but one on sars in china 5153 both sars and mers vaccine candidates have been documented to be healthy well-tolerated and capable of stimulating appropriate and suitable immune response among participantsmoreover another research paper illustrates six clinical trials of phase i listed in the list of clinicaltrialsgov 54 the health and immunogenicity of their respective mers-cov vaccine applicants are both checked but have yet to be released 55 the trials will be finished by december 2020 two russian studies 54 and december 2021 german study 54 medicago company has announced the development of a plant-based vaccine for the sars-cov-2 release in march 2020 besides further attempts for vaccine development from moderna utilizing mrna platform inovios dna vaccine and college of medicine and university of queenslands utilizing subunit recombinant expression of potential vaccines 5663sars-cov-2 based on full-length phylogenetic genome review is found to be similar to sars-cov much more than mers-cov 16 at the level of each structural protein s e m and n the findings are reported here indeed this was supported by a direct comparison sequence-based study that sars-cov-2 and sars-cov proteins are genetically identical in their m n and e protein although s protein has dramatically reduced its reproductive similarity but still high in this same study the resemblance of sars-cov-2 and mers-cov for both proteins were reported on the other hand was considerably lower which is also apparent from the phylogenetic trees involved 2028
31the spike glycoproteins composed of two subunits s1 and s2 are among the structural components of covs the spikes on the viral surface are produced by s protein homo-trimers which direct the connection to the host receptors as depicted in figure 2 the s2 domain including a fusion peptide a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain  is firmly retained in sars-cov-2 27 it may also be a candidate for antiviral agents anti-s2 on the other side only 40 of the sars-cov-2 produces an amino acid identity in the spike receptor-binding domain 328 researchers published a variety of sars-cov-2 gene sequences in foreign gene banks such as genbank this gene mapping is essential to allow researchers to track the phylogenetic tree of the virus and particularly to identify strains that differ by mutation a spike mutation possibly occurred at the end of november 2019 caused jumping to human beings according to recent studies ciccozzi et al in particular contrasted the gene sequence of the sars-cov-2 to the genome of sars-cov 364the latest approach to minimize the distribution of incidents is proactive steps thanks to a growing outbreak when r0 approaches 1 sars-cov-2 is 22 regulation strategies need to work on reducing the value down to less than 1 13 preventive approaches rely on hospital separation and diligent infection management including effective preventive intervention and emergency treatment for an affected hospital for starters during the processing of specimens droplets touch and airborne measures should be taken and the usage of sputum induction prevented the who and other organizations have made the following general guidelines prevent intimate contact with people having severe respiratory infections always wash hands especially after being in contact with contaminated individuals or environment stop unsafe field touch or wildlife interaction people with severe airway diseases should remain away coughs or sneezes should be protected with jetty tissue or fabric and their hands should also be cleaned strengthen the implementation of strict hygiene measures to avoid and manage infections particularly in the emergency medicine departments 17 immunocompromised individuals should not attend public meetings the most effective technique is to use handheld sanitizer wash hands avoid interaction with face and mouth after engaging in contaminated areas infected caregivers should use ppe gloves eye cover gowns and face mask n95 or ffp3 to avoid the spread of the pathogennews of sars-cov-2 spread over the internet with broad coverage and social media transported the news of the disease much faster than previously reported over the years websites such as flutrackerscom promed promedmailorg and others have allowed disease knowledge to be gathered from all around the world and encouraged its distribution to stakeholders mers-cov first attracted the attention of scientific researchers virologists and public health authorities as to the novel coronavirus embedded in promed mail in 2012 and afterward 11 8 years later a closer related network rapidly circulated claims regarding potential causes from the wuhan municipal health board early in an epidemic rumors with elements of fact and baseless paranoia can hardly differentiate the linguistic barriers and record sources may intensify this reality in this case however speculation of a new coronavirus was fueled by well-formulated statements that explicitly excluded individual families of viruses influenza adenovirus but exclusively excluded coronavirus sars-cov and mers-cov following sars experiences others became worried that the facts should be preserved the planet behaved both with fear and alleviated as the agent was ultimately identified as a sars-cov-2 the epidemic will not be cached although far from flawless the governments reaction to sars-cov-2 compares strongly with the early sars epidemic the rapid release of sars-cov-2 sequences provided for rapid interaction review and the creation of diagnostic tests within the scientific community 16 both the chinese cdc and wuhan municipal health board have frequently reported reports of the incidents and patient condition to the public health officials so that they can track the situation in real-time online media also enabled researchers from all over the world to link up-to-date sequential details and illustrate critical disease acknowledgements the opportunity to exchange news reports and pieces of evidence in real-time with experts and public health professionals around the globe does not necessarily deliver accurate findings and it is a massive improvement in the approach to outbreaks such openness has rendered the global science community aware of new partnerships and reacted rapidly while several unknowns remain present with sars-cov-2 the environment is dedicated to fighting the sars-cov-2 virus imminently perhaps this indicates that the experiences from the epidemic of sars were learneduntil the time of this review there are no specific therapeutic regimens approved for treating sars-cov-2 infection the development of novel compounds or vaccines that work correctly against sars-cov-2 is a time-consuming process thus efforts are focusing on repurposing the use of drugs available on the market to act against sars-cov-2 6567 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine stand as excellent examples and are being adopted at the moment in the standard clinical practices of china for sars-cov-2 infection 27 however the validity of using these compounds should be further confirmed accordingly agents with confirmed curing potentials are still lacking all the therapeutic agents are still under evaluation and the outcomes derived from clinical trials will determine future winners of the race currently patients are still managed adjunctively standard care is composed of isolation and prevention measurements supportive care for symptoms and complications as well as advanced organs supports in patients with severe illness status 68 the patients with mild illness and no risk factors can be managed in outpatient settings however due to risks of deterioration in health sudden respiratory failure and isolation failure inpatients setting are preferred when possible outpatients settings include sporadic cases or small clusters or in repurposed nontraditional settings or at home 69 the isolation and prevention measurements include isolating patients and all suspected cases in a separate area the isolation should be continued for at least 2 weeks after symptoms relief 70the supportive care includes oxygen therapy conservative fluids supply managing complications according to what each patient develops empirical antimicrobial drugs antipyreticanalgesics mechanical ventilation and corticosteroids if indicated for other reasons 70 oxygen therapy is indicated at a rate of 5 lmin to counteract respiratory distress hypoxemia or shock it should be continued to reach target oxygen saturation 94 during resuscitation 90 in stable cases for most patients and 95 for pregnant women mechanical ventilation should be given for patients with severe deterioration in respiratory functions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 43 complications should be expected including sepsis acute respiratory distress syndrome septic shock acute kidney injury acute cardiac injury acute liver injury and should be managed according to their protocols empirical antibiotics should be given based on local epidemiology common pathogens and discontinued after lab testsantipyreticanalgesics should be prescribed as needed for pain and fever and should not be administrated on routine bases these agents might mask fever and delay diagnosis and treatment 71 both paracetamol and nsaids can be considered to relieve pain the reports for avoiding ibuprofen are not validated yet 6970 these reports suggest that nsaids may upregulate ace receptors which could worsen the disease progression 71 examples of supportive management are described briefly in several studies for example 199 patients in a clinical study conducted in jin yin-tan hospital received a supportive therapy of supplemental oxygen noninvasive and invasive ventilation antibiotics vasopressor support renal-replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo 72 another clinical study at the national clinical research center for infectious diseases the third peoples hospital of shenzhen shenzhen china has reported the use of oxygen inhalation oral or intravenous rehydration therapy electrolyte correction antipyretics analgesics and antiemetic drugs as supportive therapy for the patient 73 another example of supportive care is what is given to the first diagnosed case of sars-cov-2 in washington usa the dosage of 650 mg acetaminophen every 4 h and 600 mg ibuprofen every 6 h was administered as prescribed to the patient in the first 6 days of hospitalization he was also given 600 mg guaifenesin for persistent coughing and around 6 l of regular saline 74 as mentioned above the used empirical antibiotics are varied depending on local epidemiology and common bacterial pathogens 17 for example a retrospective study from jinyintan hospital in wuhan china showed that antibiotics were given to 70 patients 71 about 25 patients received a single antibiotic while 45 patients received a combination of antibiotics used antibiotics included cephalosporins quinolones carbapenems tigecycline andor linezolid 75 another study on 139 patients has shown that antibacterial therapy is given as moxifloxacin 644 ceftriaxone 246 and azithromycin 181 76 there are still no detailed guidelines for sars-cov-2 patients with comorbidities including cardiovascular diseases asthma and cancer however current recommendations are still according to the conventional guidelines for each comorbidity 70lopinavir lpv is a hiv type 1 aspartate protease inhibitor while ritonavir rtv is usually combined to it to increase the plasma half-life of lpv by inhibiting cyp450 enzyme 14 since the outbreak several clinical trials have been investigated on the potentials of this combination lpvrtv on sars-cov-2 patients outcomes a clinical trial was conducted in jin yin-tan hospital wuhan on 199 seriously ill patients of sars-cov-2 infection 80 male and nonpregnant patients of 18 years or older were included the patients have an oxygen saturation of 94 or less with pneumonia confirmed by chest imagining they were divided into two groups a control group received the standard care in hospital and the other treatment group received a combination of lpvrtv 400 and 100 mg respectively twice daily plus the standard hospital care for 14 days the treatment group showed no improvement in survival compared with control patients the mortality percentage in lpvrtv patients was not significantly different from control 192 and 25 respectively 81 no differences in the percentages of viral rna detection was found at different times points in the members of the two groups 72 another clinical trial was conducted at the third peoples hospital of shenzhen to measure the effectiveness of favipiravir fpv compared with lpvrtv combination as control fpv is a novel rna-dependent rna-polymerase rdrp inhibitor that showed promising in vitro results on sars-cov-2 82 it blocks the replication of several viruses other than influenza the included patients have an age range of 1675 patients with severe conditions including rr 30 oxygen saturation 93 respiratory failure shock and end-stage kidney or liver diseases were excluded the fpv group included 35 patients and received fpv day 1 1600 mg twice daily days 214 600 mg twice daily plus interferon alpha ifn- by aerosol inhalation 5 million u twice daily the lpvrtv group received days 114 400 mg100 mg twice daily plus ifn- by aerosol inhalation 5 million u twice daily standard care was given to both groups clinical outcomes include viral clearance two constitutive negative results on qpcr detection throughout 24 h changes in chest imaging improvement in ct scan for lung parenchyma based on well-defined scales as well as adverse drug effects by questionaries and lab results the median time of viral clearance was significantly lower in fpv group compared with the lpvrtv group 4 and 11 days respectively the improvement rate in ct scans was only higher in fpv group on day 14 of the treatment compared with lpvrtv group 914 and 622 the fpv group showed fewer adverse drug reactions compared with lpvrtv group and no patients needed to discontinue the treatment 73 therefore fpv stands as a promising agent in the management of sars-cov-2 currently three clinical trials are being conducted to validate further the role of fpv in the management of sars-cov-2 infection nct04303299 nct04310228 and nct04273763 fpv is being investigated as monotherapy or in combination therapy it is also being compared with placebo or other antiviral regimens examples of combinations are lpvrtv plus fpv darunavirritonavir chloroquine and fpv combined with tocilizumab 83clinical trials are also being conducted on the antiviral drug remdesivir rdv phase iii after reports on its significant effect when given intravenously to some sars-cov-2 patients 77 rdv is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent by acting as a nucleoside analog that was initially developed to treat ebola a molecular modeling study suggested that rdv could be a potential therapeutic agent as the active form chembl2016761 of rdv has shown perfect docking scores among other antiviral agents 79 it also showed promising in vitro activities by blocking the viral infection of sars-cov-2 as demonstrated by wang m et al ec50  077 m cc50 100 m si 12987 84 a clinical case study for the first patient diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection in usa has shown promising effectiveness of rdv 74 infusion with rdv was administrated to patients on day 7 after developing worsening in clinical conditions pneumonia the patient showed improvement in clinical symptoms oxygen saturation and ct imaging scans 74 thus rdv is currently one of the most promising antiviral agents for reversing sars-cov-2 infection currently about seven clinical trials are registered for investigating rdv at clinicaltrialsgov and being conducted in usa and china nct04292899 nct04292730 nct04252664 nct04257656 nct04280705 nct04315948 and nct04302766 the studies have differences in patients disease conditions mild moderate and severe treatment durations 5 9 and 10 days as well as the control group rdv is being compared with placebo lpvrtv or lpvrtv plus ifn--1a 85 the safety profile for rdv is acceptable with gi symptoms and has the most common side effects including nausea vomiting and rectal bleeding some patients also experience elevations in liver enzymes 86 a very recent case study was published showing the advantage of delayed administration of rdv to patients with severe sar-cov-2-associated pneumonia the patient received rdv on day 13 of symptoms and showed significant improvement in respiratory symptoms extubation after 6 h of rdv first dose 87 an nih-supported clinical trial is being conducted in the usa rdv will be provided to patients as a loading dose of 200 mg on the first day of the study then the drug will be given as 100 mg in the following days for 10 days the patients clinical outcomes from full recovery to death will be compared with the placebo group 88ribavirin rbv is another broad-spectrum antiviral agent and acts as a nucleoside analog 78 in vitro cytotoxicity of rbv against sars-cov-2 was evaluated with ec50  1095 m 89 rbv is being given for sars-cov-2 patients in different hospitals however the clinical outcomes from its administration are still not clear rbv was given to 80 patients referred to the first peoples hospital of yancheng city the second peoples hospital of yancheng cit and the fifth peoples hospital of wuxi from 22 january to 14 february 2020 in china rbv was given intravenously for periods of 312 days 28 it is recommended to be given at a dose of 500 mg each time two- to three-timesday in combination with other drugs such as ifn- or lpvrtv 90 currently one clinical trial nct04276688 is recruiting patients to determine the efficacy of rbv for sars-cov-2 infection at the university of hong kong queen mary hospital in the study rbv 400 mg twice daily for 14 days was administrated in addition to lpvrtv and inf beta-ib compared with the control group with lpvrtv alone 91arbidol is another antiviral that is being considered for sars-cov-2 infection a retrospective study from the fifth affiliated hospital of sun yat-sen university has shown that the addition of arbidol to or lpvrtv treatment significantly provided additional benefits on viral clearance and patients clinical outcomes arbidol was administered at 200 mg every 8 h for the entire study group of 16 patients and lpv 400 mgrtv 100 mg orally every 12 h until coronavirus had been reported three-times with negative results while the control group 17 patients received and lpv 400 mgrtv 100 mg orally every 12 h the combination group achieved higher viral clearance rates at days 7 and 14 compared with the control group 75 and 94 vs 35 and 529 respectively lpvrtv combined with arbidol have shown antiviral effects in sars-cov-2 in other reports from the first affiliated hospital of zhejiang university school of medicine 92 this is maybe important as earlier viral clearance is associated with more prevention of severe lung lesions indeed the patients ct imaging at day 7 was significantly better in a combination group compared with control 69 vs 29 respectively 93 current ongoing clinical trials are further investigating the role of arbidol in the management of sars-cov-2 pneumonia in different combinations including nct04260594 and nct04286503 94 clevudine is another antiviral agent that is currently being investigated in phase ii clinical trial for its potentials against sar-cov-2 95chloroquine cq is currently being investigated extensively for its promising activity against sars-cov-2 infection 9697 cq is an old antimalarial drug with limited use due to its resistance as well as poisoning risk rhythm disturbance qt interval prolongation 98 the derivative hydroxychloroquine hcq was developed later and showed better clinical safety and lower risks of toxicities 99 hcq is also an option for the management of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis ra and systemic lupus erythematosus hcq is a highly available drug with a low cost and an acceptable toxicity profile 80 moreover hcq has good oral bioavailability allowing it to reach significant blood concentration that is sufficient to inhibit sars-cov-2 these properties nominate hcq as a great candidate to be applied on large scale use such as the sars-cov-2 outbreak on the in vitro level hcq showed significant inhibition of the sar-cov-2 infection 46 cq and hcq resulted in significant antiviral cytotoxicity in african green monkey kidney veroe6 cells atcc-1586 cc50 27320 and 24950 m respectively the two compounds reduced the viral rna copy number with cq being significantly more potent 100 another in vitro study has shown the potency of cq and hcq against sars-cov-2 with hcq with enhanced potency ec50  072 m vs 547 m 101 suggested mechanisms of action include interfering with the ph-dependent steps of viral replication by increasing the ph of intracellular vesicles such as lysosomes and endosomes 96 cq also blocks the ace2 receptor glycosylation and thus prevents the s protein binding 102 wang et al have demonstrated potent blocking of sars-cov-2 viral infection by cq ec50  113 m cc50 100 m si 8850 84 cq and hcq also have immunomodulatory effects that might help in reversing the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm associated with sars-cov-2 pneumonia 102on the clinical levels until 22 march several active clinical trials are currently conducted in china according to the chinese clinical trial registry to test the cq or hcq efficiency on sars-cov-2 infection 97 the clinical outcomes include time to clinical recovery all-cause mortality length of hospital stay length of icu stay relapse after discharge liver function tests c-reactive protein crp the incidence of adverse effects days on mechanical ventilation cost among others these trials are investigating cq or hcq alone or in combination with other therapies some of these trials published its outcomes and some are still waiting for the results reports from over 100 patients in studies demonstrated that cq showed excellent results compared with control cq treated patients showed lower viral load better ct imaging and shorter disease period 97 the ongoing clinical studies efficacy and safety of cq or hcq alone in treating sars-cov-2 are being investigated in chictr2000030054 a total 80 patients are enrolled chictr2000029992 three groups cq hcq and control chictr2000029988 severe patientscritical illness cases chictr2000029975 cq is given as aerosol inhalation chictr2000029935 100 patients chictr2000029899 hcq vs cq chictr2000029898 hcq vs cq chictr2000029803 hcq as prophylactics to prevent sars-cov-2 chictr2000029741 cq vs lpvrtv chictr2000029559 hcq vs placebo and chictr2000029542 cq vs placebo 103in parallel studies are being conducted all over the world investigating cq and hcq effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of sar-cov-2 clinical trials were registered to the clinicaltrialsgov from usa korea mexico among others 104 interestingly a clinical prevention study copcov is intended to administrate cq in healthy not previously infected by sar-cov-2 volunteers cq is to be initially given as a loading dose of 10 mg basekg followed by 150 mg daily 250 mg cq phosphate salt will be taken for 3 months 104combinations of other drugs with cq are also being investigated in ongoing clinical trials fbv tablets combined with cq phosphate in the treatment of coronavirus pneumonia is being investigated in the chictr2000030987 clinical trial in chictr2000029609 the efficacy of cq alone lpvrtv alone and cq plus lpvrtv is being investigated in mild and severe patients 103 two or more drug combinations with cq are also being investigated in other countries for example in thdms-covid19 oseltamivir 300 mg per day plus cq 1000 mg per day or darunavir 400 mg every 8 h rtv 25 mgkg plus oseltamivir 46 mgkg plus cq 500 mg are being studied 105the dosing system and duration of treatment are still varied between different studies for example in chictr2000029992 the dosing of cq is 10 g x 2 days for the first dose 05 g x 12 days from the third day for hcq is 02 g twice daily x 14 days in chictr2000029975 150 mg cq phosphate is dissolved in 5 ml of normal saline twice daily and inhaled by atomization for 1 week the dosing in chictr2000029899 and chictr2000029898 is for hcq day 1 first dose 6 tablets 01 gtable second dose six tablets 01gtablet after 6h day 25 two tablets 01 gtablet twice daily and for cq day13 500 mg twice daily day 45 250 mg twice daily in chictr2000029559 hcq is given in two doses and one group received 01 oral 2day the second group received 02 oral 2day while the third group is a placebo in chictr2000029542 cq is given as 05 g every time twice daily for a 10-day course more clinical trials are needed to determine the effective dosing regimen as toxicities cardiomyopathy and retinopathy are still possible after prolonging and high doses of hcq 103 the application of cq and hcq for sars-cov-2 should also consider contraindications including patient allergies glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd deficiency previous history of retinopathy cardiomyopathy qt prolongation or end-stage kidney disease 96a recent protocol approved by the office of national clinical advisor acute hospital division recommended the use of cq 500 mg twice daily for 10 days for patients diagnosed as mild moderate and severe cases alternatively hcq in a regimen of day 1 400 mg twice daily then days 25 200 mg twice daily total duration 5 days another alternative is rvd as an intravenous infusion 200 mg on day 1 then 100 mg on days 210 total duration 10 days 77 a novel combination of cq and azithromycin was used recently in a small french clinical trial 46 about 36 patients were included including asymptomatic patients patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms and patients with lower respiratory tract symptoms were included about 20 patients received hcq sulfate 200 mg three-times daily for 10 days out of the hcq-treated patients six patients received azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg for the following 4 days on day 6 virological clearance was significantly higher in hcq compared with the control group 70 vs 125 azithromycin  hcq group showed 100 virological clearance on day 6 however this combination is not established yet the risk of developing severe qt interval prolongation may be a limiting factor the sample size in this study is small and more significant studies are needed 99 a very recent study utilized global affinity purification-mass spectrometry apms analysis to identify the host-pathogen interferences for sars-cov-2 further validate the possible efficacies of cq and azithromycin the study showed that the sars-cov-2 nsp6 protein interacted with the sigma receptor the sigma receptors interact with cq azithromycin has also been shown to be an off-target activity to human mitochondria and ribosomes subunits that interacts with the sars-cov-2 nsp8 protein mrps27 mrps5 mrps25 and mrps2  106 another unusual combination that was proposed recently is nitazoxanide and hcq the studies on sars-cov-2 showed that the virus interfered with host pathways that are needed to activate the innate immune system of the patient to fight the infection immune senescence sars-cov-2 blocks the interferon pathway and prevents its upregulation in the host system nitazoxanide is antiprotozoal that upregulates the innate antiviral mechanisms and activates interferon pathways in the host 46107 accordingly the study is proposing that dual use of the hcq with nitazoxanide would have synergistic effects against sars-cov-2 102 the proposed dosing system is 400 mg twice a day for 23 days loading then 200 mg twice a day for 4 days for hcq and 600 mg sustained-release sr tabstwice daily of nitazoxanide for 7 days 102the rationale of using immunosuppressants in the management of sars-cov-2-associated pneumonia comes from several reports of cases of hyper inflammation and cytokine storms in the lungs of sars-cov-2 patients 108 these agents have been investigated in previous coronavirus outbreaks and are currently being investigated for sars-cov-2 with promising preliminary results for some of these agents 109tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-human il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody it acts by inhibiting the binding of il-6 to il-6 receptors it has potent anti-inflammatory effects and already approved for the treatment of ra 110 tocilizumab is a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug bodmard and recommended as an alternative to methotrexate or tnf- antagonists in ra patients 111 tocilizumab is well tolerated and associated with an acceptable safety profile 112 investigating its role in the management of sars-cov-2 associated pneumonia is based on the inflammation and cytokine storm detected in those patients key inflammatory mediators including il-6 il-2 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ifn- inducible protein 10 and tnf- were found to be highly involved in the inflammatory storm inducing severe alveolar destruction and dysfunction in sars-cov-2 infections elevations in il-6 levels in particular were found as a significant predictor of fatality in patients 113 therefore interfering with il-6 and other mediators may have potential clinical benefits in reversing respiratory dysfunction in those patients a retrospective study from china hospitals demonstrated the benefits of tocilizumab in addition to the standard therapy of 26 patients with severe and critical care conditions 148098 tocilizumab was given at a dose of 400 mg once through an intravenous drip in 18 patients another dose of tocilizumab was given for the last three patients due to the fever treatment with tocilizumab resulted in a significant relief of fever 100 lowering of oxygen intake 75 and improvement in respiratory function tocilizumab normalized lymphocytes levels 526 significantly decreased the c-reactive protein level 842 and improved the ct imaging 905 the results from this study are suggesting tocilizumab as promising therapeutic agent for severe and critical sars-cov-2 infections however this study is observational study with limited number of patients according to clinical trials are currently conduced to validate these results 114a clinical trial tocivid-19 nct04317092 supported by the national cancer institute was recently registered in clinicaltrialsgov to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with sars-cov-2 infection tocilizumab is to be injected as two doses 8 mgkg up to a maximum of 800 mg per dose with an interval of 12 h 115 another clinical study nct04315480 has been conducted in italy is investigating the early administration of single-dose injection of tocilizumab 8 mgkg in patients with sars-cov-2 severe multifocal interstitial pneumonia 116 two more chinese studies are also investigating tocilizumab effectiveness chictr2000029765 is a multicenter randomized controlled trial for the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia sars-cov-2 the study is being conducted in the first affiliated hospital of the university of science and technology of china about 94 patients are receiving standard care therapy and 94 patients were receiving standard care therapy along with tocilizumab chictr2000030894 is another clinical trial investigating the use of fpv combined with tocilizumab versus fpv alone versus tocilizumab alone for treatment of sars-cov-2 infection 117 sarilumab is another il-6 blocker that is used in moderate-to-severe ra 118 it is also being investigated for its effectiveness in the management of sar-cov-2 patients in the chinese clinical trial nct04315298 119 however the use of these agents is usually associated with several risks including the development of secondary infections and severe allergic reactions such risks should be considered while using these agents in sars-cov-2bevacizumab is another monoclonal antibody humanized that blocks the vegf and interferes with its binding to its receptors thus it inhibits angiogenesis which is an essential process for the development of new blood vessels to supply cancer cells with oxygen and nutrients 120 bevacizumab showed productive anticancer activities against colorectal kidney lung breast and head and neck cancers 111 bevacizumab is also being studied as a candidate to manage the sars-cov-2 outbreak 23 an ongoing multicenter clinical trial in qilu hospital of shandong university china nct04305106 is investigating the use of bevacizumab for a severing of critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 the study is enrolling 118 patients bevacizumab will be administrated in a regimen of 500 mg 09 nacl 100 ml intravenous drip not less than 90 min 121 nct04275414 is another similar clinical study that is also established in the same hospital with similar settings on 20 patients however the therapeutic benefits of bevacizumab are limited by possible serious events associated with its use bevacizumab was reported to result in new-onset hypertension bleeding delaying wound healing thromboembolic events and bowel perforations 111 these risks should be considered while repurposing the use of this drug for sars-cov-2 infectionother immunomodulators are being considered including adalimumab as mentioned above tnf- is an inflammatory mediator that is upregulated in sars-cov-2 adalimumab is a tnf inhibitor and may show effective inhibition of sars-cov-2 pneumonia 71previously corticosteroids have been used to treat the sars-cov outbreak with proven efficacy accordingly it is valid to evaluate the role of corticosteroids in the recent sars-cov-2 outbreak 122 corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone are expected to inhibit inflammatory response that is the main factor inducing lung damage in sars-cov-2 infection on the other hand corticosteroids may suppress the immune response and delay the viral clearance of sars-cov-2 71 to investigate their exact effects a case study by xu et al in a 50-year-old patient that was diagnosed with sars-cov-2 showed that the administration of methylprednisolone 80 mg twice daily to the standard care did not improve patients outcomes the patients symptoms continued to deteriorate over several days after the medications patients developed severe dyspnea and shortness of breath oxygen saturation was dropped to less than 60 and the patient developed cardiac arrest and died 27 a study included 80 patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection received treatment of a single antibiotic moxifloxacin and rbv antiviral therapy only 12 patients received methylprednisolone to improve patients shortness of breath the study did not indicate any advantages for the use of methylprednisolone in those patients 28 another study was conducted on 46 patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection who received standard care of oxygen cough relief antiviral lpvrtv and ifn- and nutritional support of those 26 patients additionally received methylprednisolone at a dose of 12 mgkgd for 57 days via intravenous injection three deaths were reported and two of them received methylprednisolone patients received methylprednisolone showed faster improvement in fever a shorter period of supplemental oxygen and better absorption of lung focus 122 accordingly methylprednisolone did not improve mortality outcomes but may result in a beneficial impact on clinical symptoms and recovery time until the time of this review the role of corticosteroids as adjunctive treatment in the management of sars-cov-2 is still controversial according to the centers for disease control and prevention corticosteroids are not preferred as they may be associated with prolongation of viral replication as noted in previous mers-cov outbreak 68 ongoing clinical trials are being conducted at this moment to confirm their role chictr2000029386 is a randomized clinical trial currently being conducted in china on 48 patients and methylprednisolone to be administrated to half of them like a dose of 12 mgkgday for 3 days 123 other studies also registered for clinicaltrialsgov and currently in the process of recruiting patients these studies include nct04244591 for critically-ill patients with severe acute respiratory failure steroids-sari in beijing china nct04263402 to compare the efficacy of different hormone doses in the treatment of sars-cov-2 severe pneumonia in wuhan hubei china and nct04273321 to determine efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in sars-cov-2 in different areas in china 124in contrast to the above reports about the potential benefits of using immunosuppressants and immunomodulators in the management of sars-cov-2 a very recent study is suggesting the use of immune booster interventions the study is proposing the use of individualized interventions to improve the immune response i4r approach low-level radiation statins and aspirin are suggested for the treatment of sars-cov-2 pneumonia this proposal stems from previous reports about the effectiveness of these interventions in curing pneumonia in general the study urges the implantation of clinical studies to investigate these regimens 125recent in vitro reports demonstrated the potential efficacy of ivermectin against sar-cov-2 5000-fold reduced the viral load in 2-h post-infection with sars-cov-2 vero-hslam cells after 48 h of single ivermectin treatment 5 m 126 an observational study showed the survival benefits of using single ivermectin dose 150 mgkg after initiating mechanical ventilation in critically ill sar-cov-2 patients patients who received ivermectin showed better survival shorter hospital stay and intensive care unit length 127 a recent study from italy is suggesting a synergistic effect of combining hydroxychloroquine with ivermectin against sar-cov-2 the study is hypothesizing that the two drugs have no serious interactions and can be safely studied against sar-cov-2 128inflammation is a response of the immune system during the earliest stages of viral infections 130 as a result the anti-inflammatory drug is a choice for viral infections including sars-cov-2 infection few studies discussed anti-inflammatory therapies as an option to reduce the symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection with baricitinib and melatonin being the most related 131baricitinib a drug approved for ra was identified by in silico screening for anti-inflammatory drugs that could be potential therapies for sars-cov-2 infection 132 sar-cov-2 enters lung cells by ace2-mediated invasion ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 is one of the regulators for this invasion few approved drugs with high affinity to inhibit aak-1 enzymes such as fedratinib and sunitinib were in silico screened with the only barcitinib showing an inhibitory effect on the enzyme janus kinase jak another regulator for the invasion stebbing et al have suggested that baricitinib could be trialed for its anti-inflammatory and entry inhibition effects 132 moreover the patent application reveals the preparation of baricitinib by incyte corporation pharmaceutical company 131melatonin is another drug that has been proposed as a potential anti-inflammatory drug to relieve the symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection viral infections cause injury of the immune system that is commonly associated with oxidative stress and damage of organs 133 melatonin is an old biogenic amine for treating sleep disturbances and circadian rhythm it has an antioxidant effect and has been previously encouraged to be used for ebola viral infection 134 as suggested by cheng et al melatonin could reduce the clinical symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection and prolong the survival time for the patientas mentioned previously sars-cov-2 gets into the pulmonary cells after binding to the ace2 receptor domain 135 however due to the limited number of studies it is still unclear how ace2 is modified in sars-cov-2 infection 32135 kruse has suggested that therapies that block the ace2 receptor domain could be studied for their potential effectiveness against sars-cov-2 infection 136 for example using the small receptor-binding domain rbd from the vital domain of the sars s protein that has shown to bind to ace2 136137 receptor a second option is to administer an antibody that binds to ace2 which could prevent sars-cov-2 particles from binding to the ace2 receptor a third potential option that has been suggested by zhang and liu is using compounds that have shown to inhibit ace2 enzyme such as emodin and promazine 90 emodin is a natural anthraquinone compound that is derived from the commonly used chinese medicinal herbs such as the genus rheum and polygonum 138 emodin was found to block the binding of sars-cov s protein with the enzyme ace2 139 while promazine is an old anti-psychotic drug with structural similarity to emodin promazine has shown inhibitory signs for the replication of sars-cov from these findings ho et al have suggested that emodin or promazine could be considered as potential therapeutics for sars-cov-2 infectionhaving coronaviral principal protease 3clpro as the critical enzyme for sars-cov-2 replication and serine protease tmprss211 for s protein priming has made these proteases attractive targets 140 thus the existing protease inhibitors could be potential drug candidates targeting these enzymes 140 few antivirals were mentioned previously as having a 3clpro inhibitory effect such as lpv and rtvcarboxamide derivatives have been shown to have an antiviral inhibitory effect targeting 3clpro 140 and are undergoing studies in research and development 32 as reported by liu et al from these carboxamide derivatives ml188 analog has ic50 of 15 m and ml300 analog has ic50 of 62 m benzenepropanamide derivatives have also shown a disruption effect for the function of proteases 3clpro and plpro in sars-cov infection 141 these candidates are also undergoing studies in research and development as reported by liu et al few peptidomimetic compounds and gc376 a previously known protease inhibitor have been reported to inhibit protease 3clpro 141142 -ketoamide inhibitors were previously synthesized and tested against mers-cov infection by liu research group -ketoamide derivatives have shown picomolar activity against protease 3clpro of mers-cov hilgenfeld et al have recently reported the x-ray structures of sars-cov3 3clpro and its complex with an -ketoamide inhibitor and considered -ketoamide inhibitors as promising agents for sars-cov-2 infection 140traditional chinese medicines tcms include different types of natural products with each relating to a group of diseases 143 tcms that have shown activity against viral infections specifically lung infections could be potential therapies for relieving the symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection as proposed in the literature by different research groups 43139144 it worth mentioning herein that tcms have been used in the control of several epidemics and pandemic diseases over thousands of years which shows their effectiveness 143145146 moreover tcms were included in the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 by the national health commission of the peoples republic of china 145 results have shown that the symptoms of covid-19 were shortened in 60107 confirmed cases however more clinical studies are needed that require timejian-ping et al have done a study based on historical records on the prevention and treatment of infections using tcm tcm prevention programs issued by chinese health authorities and databases and preliminary literature results about using tcm in other respiratory viral infections 147 based on the results jian-ping et al have confirmed the use of tcm as a preventive therapy for sars-cov-2 infection another trial study that is under process is also using tcm in this study interventional subjects will receive triple therapy includes oxidative therapy an antiviral and tcm 143 zhang et al have concluded that tcms could contain direct constituents for the treatment of covid-19 139 in this study it has been identified as different tcms that have been previously used in treating respiratory viral infections by an in silico screeningin addition to current and potential therapies several others are currently in the research and development process several pharmaceutical companies enter the race to find a treatment for sars-cov-2 infection relieve its symptoms or to reduce the risk of its complications table 2 148the review offers reported information on the global research and advancement of potential and current therapeutic agents and vaccines under development relevant for sars-cov-2 focused on the complete up-to-date generic drug product selection this describes morphology physiology and pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 and focuses primarily on antivirals antimalarials and immunotherapeutics aimed at diverse molecular associations linked to infection and replication this review focuses primarily on agents reported to be beneficial against certain rna viruses such as sars-cov mers-cov influenza ebola and counter inflammatory medications as well as product reuse attempts there is a broad range of products available in recombinant biotechnology to generate antibodies as well as in cytokines targeted at the production and transmission of virus genes and cellular receptors a significant attempt will be made to produce successful drugs and vaccinations against current and possible future sars-cov-2 infections and other potentially pathogenic virus outbreaks to minimize the tremendous effect on human life the epidemic of covid-19 underlines further the importance of developing a relatively broad spectrum of antiviral drugs and the significance of implementing innovative strategies like artificial intelligence to expedite therapeutics development considering the cost and effort involved in developing clinical drugs as highlighted in this review the abundance of publications and the fast publishing race associated with the virus sars-cov-2 outbreak suggests a concentrated initiative on the part of research organizations and the pharmaceutical industry both concerning molecular mechanisms and concerning therapeutic pathways used for current and potential coronavirus outbreaksthis overview of the current covi19 global interest offers a summary of the existing state of the art concerning effects on public health and safety pathophysiology and clinical symptoms of the pandemic infection diagnostics tools available patient management and global response from enforced curfew to total lockdown that we are witnessing around the globe only when the pandemic ceases will we evaluate the health social and economic consequences of this catastrophic event and therefore can draw insights from any possible potential epidemics for future cases particularly in public and global safety the proverb of an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure remains the best for the prevention of covid-19 spreadin december 2019 patients in wuhan china started experiencing a disease with acute respiratory attacks investigations revealed that the disease was due to a novel virus that was later designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the disease was assigned as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 and its global spread has led to the world health organization who declaring it as a global pandemic yuen et al 2020 sars-cov-2 is a member of the coronavirus family which has threatened the lives and health of millions of people around the world as per the who situational report 143 on covid-19 the number of infection cases globally were over 7273958 the number of deaths is increasing exponentially with over 413372 worldwide thus far who 2020bwho 2020ba who 2020bb dcoronaviruses are single stranded positive sense rna viruses with genome sizes of between 28 and 32 kb these viruses have the ability to infect both animals and humans they cause an array of diseases including and not limited to respiratory neurologic hepatic and gastrointestinal disease su et al 2016 based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structure the novel virus belongs to the genera betacoronavirus which has a close similarity to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses sarsr-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov importantly the genomic sequence of sars-cov-2 and its replication cycle has been elucidated and together with our evolving understanding of the host immune response these factors have been the basis for investigating diagnostic and prognostic testing epidemiologic tracking and the initiation of therapeutic strategies wang et al 2020a wu et al 2020athe threat of the virus has reached unimaginable proportions and has exposed the unpreparedness of national healthcare systems and has triggered international solidarity despite covid-19 being declared a global pandemic by who no drug regimen has been shown to be effective in the treatment of the virus moreover numerous completed randomized clinical trials have not produced clear guidelines on treatment options and prophylactic therapy yet currently several active clinical trials for treatment are ongoing other emerging non-conventional drug discovery techniques provides alternative faster and less costly routes to discovering potent anti-sars-cov2 drugs furthermore while drugs are being repurposed and discovered for covid-19 novel drug delivery systems will play a paramount role in designing efficient delivery systems that have virus targeting ability improved pharmacokinetic profiles and avoidance of possible drug resistance leading to superior therapies this review summarizes proposed drug targets for therapy and reviews the various clinical trials that have been reported as well as vaccines that are under development it also highlights emerging therapies and future perspectives for the treatment and prevention of covid-19an understanding of the host response is crucial to implement valid therapeutic strategies as stated previously and it is now apparent that severity of the disease is dependent on both the virus itself and host response host response to sars-cov-2 has been described in the literature however key aspects are still being elucidated notably symptoms of patients range from minimal to severe respiratory failure with multiple organ failure complicating linking pathophysiology with symptoms in a complete picture hence we can report on key findings in each aspect to date berlin et al 2020 magro et al 2020 tay et al 2020 importantly sars-cov-2 is transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets with a possible but unproven faecaloral transmission route tay et al 2020 the median incubation period is approximately 45 days before symptom onset with 975 of symptomatic patients developing symptoms within 115 days lauer et al 2020 the most common symptoms of covid -19 are reported to be fever cough fatigue anorexia myalgia and diarrhea cdc guidelines backer et al 2020 cdc 2020 dyspnoea often accompanied by hypoxemia is a common symptom of severe illness wang et al 2020d zhou et al 2020a which may progress to ards other manifestations of severe covid-19 are lymphopenia disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system acute cardiac kidney and liver injury in addition to cardiac arrhythmias rhabdomyolysis coagulopathy and shock berlin et al 2020notably sars-cov-2 viral load reaches its peak within 56 days of symptom onset and severe covid-19 cases progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards on average around 89 days after symptom onset tay et al 2020 a timeline for symptoms of the severe disease is described by berlin et al 2020the virus enters the cells via ace 2 is internalized as described above and triggers a series of events intracellularly leading to disease manifestation based on the targeting of key regulatory pathways cells and organs however the main target is the respiratory tree and lung tissue and therefore this will be described in more detail notably the characteristic pulmonary ground glass opacification is seen even in asymptomatic patients mason 2020 based on the cells that are likely infected covid-19 can be divided into three phases that correspond to different clinical stages of the disease mason 2020 covid-19 confined to the conducting airways should be mild and treated symptomatically at home when it has progressed to the gas exchange units of the lung it must be monitored carefully with the best support mason 2020
tay et al 2020 describes the chronology of events upon cell entry describing interaction of sars-cov-2 with the immune system leading to either a normal healthy response or a dysfunctional immune response ir in brief the virus enters the cell which has both ace2 and tmprrss2 and replicates leading to more viral release thereafter the cell undergoes pyroptosis and releases damage-associated molecular patterns damps this triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including il-6 ip-10 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 mip1 mip1 and mcp1 other immune cells are attracted to the site viz monocytes macrophages and t cells which produce a proinflammatory loop this can lead to viral clearance and minimal lung damage healthy immune response or a series of events which can culminate in multi-organ damage dysfunctional immune response tay et al 2020an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in cytokine storm damages the lung structure and leads to multi-organ damage as it spreads to other parts of the body the cytokine release syndrome crs or storm is characterized by multiorgan pathology and fever lin et al 2020 importantly non-neutralizing antibodies may further exacerbate organ damage however in a healthy immune response the initial inflammation attracts the following t cells to the site of infection antibodies neutralizing which can block viral infection and alveolar macrophages which phagocytise neutralized viruses and apoptotic cells this contributes to viral clearance minimal lung damage and recovery tay et al 2020the symptoms and pathogenesis are similar to those of sars-cov and mers-cov infections rockx et al 2020 this has helped in understanding of the disease despite a lack of knowledge on sars-cov-2 data attained based upon the first cases in wuhan china indicate that the incubation time is generally between 2 and 7 days however the longest incubation time was seen to be 125 days backer et al 2020 yuen et al 2020 however data from the united states of america has shown some patients have up to 17 days of incubation lauer et al 2020based on the life cycle transduction and signaling process of the virus as well as patient responses various targets can be exploited to combat the virus the following section describes the specific targets and highlights the drugs being investigated to exploit them for overcoming viral infection it also describes the possible targets which can be explored to create vaccines against the virusby understanding cellular factors that aid the entry and fusion of the sars-cov-2 virus it has provided therapeutic targets for drug development against the virus the virus has been reported to use the serine protease tmprss2 for s protein priming and binding to ace2 for cellular entry a tmprss2 inhibitor can block viral entry constituting a treatment option hoffmann et al 2020b computational methods on repurposing existing candidates have revealed candidate inhibitors for tmprss2 rensi et al 2020 amongst these camostat mesylate a clinically proven inhibitor of tmprss2 was used in japan to treat unrelated diseases zhang et al 2020b it has been associated with reduced lung cell line infection with sars-cov-19 and could therefore be used as a therapeutic option in the management of covid-19 hoffmann et al 2020asars-cov-2 has utilized protein-mediated cell-viral fusion as an entry mechanism into the cell providing another potential drug target for management of the sars-cov-2 zhu et al 2020 hence another option may be to target ap-2 associated protein kinase 1 aak1 it is a host kinase that is involved in the regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis yang and shen 2020 based upon artificial intelligence subsets of approved drugs were evaluated the janus kinase jak inhibitor baricitinib is a suitable candidate to inhibit aaki favalli et al 2020 marotto and sarzi-puttini 2020 it demonstrates antiviral as well as anti-inflammatory activity richardson et al 2020a in addition peptides such as the hr2 derived peptides can be potential drug targets for covid-19 as they could inhibit viral entryangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and sars-cov-2 interactions suggest that antihypertensive drugs acei and arbs may reduce the risk and severity of covid-19 as mentioned previously sars-cov-2 exploits ace2 as a co-receptor to gain entry into susceptible cells via the transmembrane spike s glycoprotein and cleavage activates the viral protein for membrane fusion via extensive irreversible conformational changes walls et al 2020 the involvement of raas in attachment makes the system a drug target for management of covid-19 and has raised debates on the benefits and downsides associated with aceiarbs rico-mesa et al 2020 vaduganathan et al 2020 also since ace2 is used for viral entry it has raised concerns on its impact on other components of raasthe debates concern firstly a purported upregulation in ace2 due to acei use since their mechanism of action ultimately leads to decreased ang ii the main effector octapeptide of raas the same would apply to arbs this would then predispose the patient to infection due to increased ace2 however a review by vaduganathan et al 2020 reports that animal studies using arbs and acei are found to be inconclusive and not enough data is available to support translation to humans vaduganathan et al 2020secondly it is contended that since the function of ace2 is to convert ang ii to ang 17 if it is unavailabledownregulated due to viral binding this would then lead to increased ang ii which could then impact on lung pathology this would also lead to lower ang 17 levels notably aceiarbs would then be expected to ameliorate the resultant pathology since it reduces ang ii levels or action the role of ang ii was postulated because of studies for example in patients with covid-19 who appeared to have elevated levels of plasma angiotensin ii which correlated with total viral load and degree of lung injury li et al 2020a the connection between at1ang ii and lung pathology is reinforced by others kai and kai 2020 however others found that restoration of ace2 through the administration of recombinant ace2 appeared to reverse lung-injury in preclinical models of other viral infections gu et al 2016 zou et al 2014 multicenter double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized trials rcts are currently being conducted to investigate the effects of losartan on mortality and hospital admission in covid-19 patients kai and kai 2020
vaduganathan et al 2020 do not recommend withdrawal of the drugs by patients of heart failure and myocardial infarction importantly they recommend that until further data are available raas modulators should be continued in patients in an otherwise stable condition who are at risk for being evaluated for or with covid-19 vaduganathan et al 2020 it is clear that more research needs to be conducted into the impact of ace 2 on infectivity within this context the role at ang ii on lung pathology and role of aceiarbs in covid given the complexity of raas from a systemic and tissue specific perspectivein addition acei is known to potentiate the vasodilator bradykinin bk roche et al 2020 used established and emerging evidence to propose a testable hypothesis that a vicious positive feedback loop involving dysregulated bk signaling is involved in inflammation which likely responsible for the severe respiratory complications in covid-19 hence they propose the fda-approved molecule icatibant that might be able to interrupt this feedback loop and thereby improve the clinical outcomes roche and roche 2020it is widely reported that the host cellular entry involves the endocytic pathway and non-endosomal pathway inhibition of the pathway could be a strategy to inhibit the viral entry and infection mechanism of the drug targets could include drugs that have the ability to penetrate the lysosomes accumulating inside and neutralizing the acidic ph of endosomes and lysosome such targets could inhibit the viral entry the second possible mechanism involves protease inhibitors targeting clathrin-mediated endocytosis zhu et al 2020 zumla et al 2016 these targets could play an important role in developing novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of covid-19multiple antiviral agents are developed in order to disrupt viral replication such as dna methyltransferase mtases polymerases and other entry proteins currently the antiviral with the most potential is remdesivir mahase 2020 it is a synthetic molecule which targets rna synthesis since it acts as an analogue of a dna nucleoside adenosine remdesivir is a competitive inhibitor of adenosine-triphosphate for the incorporation into viral rna strands once it gets incorporated into the viral rna at position i it terminates rna synthesis the anti-viral effects have also been investigated in the rhesus macaque which was infected with mers-cov smith and prosser 2020abeta coronavirus have the ability to infect immune cells such as monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in the activation and secretion of il-6 and other cytokines that have proinflammatory properties severe form of covid-19 disease is characterized by fever and pneumonia that further develops to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards elevation of serum concentrations interleukin-6 il-6 and other inflammatory cytokines results in crs that induces ards a hallmark of sars-cov2 infections developing effective il-6 antagonists inhibits the cytokine-driven hyperinflammatory syndrome for the management of covid-19 moore and june 2020various parasitic drugs are being investigated at different stages of study for combating sars-cov-2 in a recent study ivermectin which is known to inhibit the in vitro replication of several positive stranded rna viruses such as dengue zika chikungunya and yellow fever could be a potential treatment options for covid-19 leon et al 2020 in vitro data shows 50 inhibition of sars-cov-2 replication after 48 h incubation with vero cells at 28 mml equivalent to a plasma concentration of 2100 mgml a concentration of 50-fold less than the concentration of ivermectin proven to reduce viral replication by half this antiviral activity may lead to carefully conducted controlled trialshowever ivermectin can cross into the brain and react with gaba-gated chlorine channels causing neurotoxicity this is usually prevented by the blood brain barrier bbb particularly by the p-glycoprotein p-gp hence ivermectin may not be considered a safe drug if the bbb is compromised in the inflammatory state hy et al 1990 due to the leaky bbb caused by sars-cov-2 wu et al 2020b the use of ivermectin in severely ill patients should be administered with caution interestingly if ivermectin is used in combination with other drugs such as ritonavir which is a very good cyp3a4 inhibitor with some effect on the p-gp as well li et al 2019 this can boost ivermectin concentration increasing cmax and causing further toxicity by crossing the bbb leading to accumulation in the brain edwards 2003 kennedy et al 2014chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine hcq are antiplasmodium drugs approved for malaria treatment they are also a part of the model list of essential medicines declared by who who 2017 cq and hcq antiviral activity is attributed to their ability to elevate the ph of acidic intracellular organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes that are known to be essential for viral-host cell membrane fusion the second mode of action of cq has been reported to be via the change of glycosylation of ace2 receptor and spike protein liu et al 2020bchloroquine is currently under intense investigation albeit controversial as a potential covid-19 treatment wang et al 2020b several in vitro in vivo and clinical tests are being carried out for covid-19 in vitro studies using infected vero e6 cells treated with chloroquine revealed that it cq targets the virus at the entry and post-entry stages during infection furthermore an ec90 value of 690 m against the 2019-ncov in vero e6 cells after 48 h in addition an ec50 of 113 m cc50  100 m and si  8850 was reported for cq this was in keeping with clinical studies where the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients were administered a daily dose of 250 mg of cq bjelle et al 1983 rynes 1997 some cytotoxicity studies confirmed the biosafety of chloroquine cortegiani et al 2020 chloroquine may be potentially clinically applicable against the sars-cov-2 because of the cost and a known safety profile due to long usage for malaria treatment but requires intense scientific scrutiny for covid-19 before usethe immune-modulating activity of cq was hypothesized to enhance its antiviral effect in vivo however its toxicity and side effects such as prolonging qt interval can trigger tachycardias such as torsades de pointes this was proven in brazil where 81 patients of covid-19 were evaluated viz a high-dose group receiving 12 g of chloroquine over 10 days and a low-dose group of 27 g over 5 days borba et al 2020 twenty five  of high dose cq group displayed 500 ms of qt elongation and in 17 of them the qt interval elongation was fatal in comparison to the lower dosage group the toxic effects resulted in termination of the trial and indicate that higher dosage and long duration of the treatment courses 10-day regimen should not be recommended for management covid-19hydroxychloroquine hcq a derivative of chloroquine is a less toxic option that has been widely touted as a treatment option for sars-cov-2 based on various recent trials studies and anecdotal reports in one such study the efficacy of hcq was evaluated in a randomized clinical trial of 62 sars-cov-2 patients chen et al 2020c where the experimental group received 400 mgd hcq treatment for 5 days vs control notably more patients treated with hqc had improved pneumonia 25 of 31 vs untreated groups which showed 548 improvement 17 of 31 notably 2 patients reacted mildly to the adverse effect of hcq in the treatment group while 4 patients progressed to severe illness in the control some showed significant relief through reduced cough and fever supporting hcq as an option in sars-cov-2 infections also a key observation in this study is that by administering hcq the time to clinical recovery ttcr was significantly shortened and promoted the resolution of pneumonia in the group administered with hcq however the methodology was not described the study design was questionable and outcomes were subjective based on an individual clinical opiniondespite hcq efficacy against sars-cov-2 the low cost and ease to access its potential adverse side effects in viral diseases must also be carefully considered major side effects of hcq includes elongation of the qt interval thus being contraindicated in patients with underling cardiovascular disease other side effects include liver dysfunction cns effects like headache dizziness insomnia peripheral neuropathy retinopathy associated with long-term therapy gastrointestinal reactions and itching bordy et al 2018 leon et al 2020the combination of azithromycin and hcq has been proposed to have better treatment outcomes creating a buzz in mainstream media after reports that it may be a treatment option for sars-cov-2 gautret et al 2020a gautret et al 2020b however shortcomings included lack of randomization of the groups and a very small patient cohort and the efficacy of the combination is therefore inconclusive in contrast in another study with similar shortcomings that assessed only 11 patients hcq and azithromycin did not show rapid viral clearance with little clinical benefit 10 out of 11 patients had fever and received nasal oxygen therapy 1 patient died 2 were transferred to the icu in one of the patients hcq and azithromycin had to be discontinued after 4 days because of a prolongation of the qt interval nasopharyngeal swabs in 10 patients 56 days after treatment showed that they were still positive of sars-cov-2 molina et al 2020the side effects associated with hcq treatment are still a major cause of concern on 9th april the le monde newspaper france reported since march 27 of the 54 reported cases of cardiac disorders there were 7 sudden cardiac arrests 37 cases of prolonged qt and 10 arrhythmias accompanied with syncope including 4 fatalities in patients taking hcq and in some cases in combination with azithromycin cabut 2019 based on anecdotal reports hcq is promising for covid-19 however to date there are no robust studies of hcq which adequately demonstrates efficacy absence of toxicity or proper clinical guidelines for usage currently studies examining hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are underway in order to determine the efficacy and safety and it does not seem promising as some institutions like national institute for health are advising against its use in their guidelines for treatment nih 2020 moreover patients currently on hcq and azithromycin treatment need therapeutic drug monitoring to avoid toxic effects associated with the drugbased on the pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 and the viral life cycle several antiviral drugs have been screened and repurposed as targets against covid-19such drugs include remdesivir an analogue of adenosine which interacts with the viral rna chains and leads to premature termination warren et al 2016 the drug has completed phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of ebola thus the data on its safety for use in humans is available and it can be accelerated to clinical trials if preclinical efficacy against sars-cov-2 is proven lu et al 2020 studies have shown remdesivir to have potent antiviral activity against a clinical isolate of sars-cov-2 preliminary trials have indicated that it was effective against sars-cov-19 in vitro 
lai et al 2020
 and in vero e6 cells results indicated that it acted at the post virus entry stage wang et al 2020b an ec50 of 077 m cc50  100 m and si  12987 was reported in vero e6 cells that were exposed to remdesivir treatment the ec90 value of remdesivir against sars-cov-2 in vero e6 cells was reported to be 176 m this implies that at this concentration remdesivir may work in clinical models and that at 10 m it completely 100 prevented ebola virus infection warren et al 2016 the drug was then accelerated to clinical trials by us food and drug administrations fda and two phase 3 clinical studies began to evaluate the safety and efficacy a clinical trial showed that three quarters of patients that were on the drug had better outcomes than those who were not gilead 2020 however setbacks such as cohort size the duration of the follow up lack of information about the patients initially treated as well as lack of a control group hindered this study in a recent well designed trial that was randomized double-blind and with a placebo control no statistically significant clinical benefits of remdesivir administration was observed when adult patients were admitted to hospital with severe covid-19 wang et al 2020e however there was reduction in time to clinical improvement in patients given early treatment although the study showed optimism there is a need for studies with a larger group of patients to confirm the resultsanother antiviral drug being considered as anti-sars-cov-2 is camostat mesylate cm which is a clinically proven serine protease inhibitor in vitro studies investigated the antiviral efficacy of cm in caco-2 293t vero and vero-tmprss2 cells lines respectively hoffmann et al 2020b its ability to inhibit the entry of sars-cov-2 was shown this inhibitory property of the drug was enhanced when it was combined with a catbl inhibitor e64d indicating that sars-2 can utilize catbl and tmprss2 for priming in these cell lines the study also showed that cm treatment significantly reduced calu-3 infection with sars-cov-2 this suggests that sars-cov-2 can use tmprss2 for s protein priming and that cm is a good inhibitor of tmprss2 as it blocked the lung infection these findings are in keeping with studies where sars-2-cov-2 exploits ace2 receptor for cellular entry zhou et al 2020b these results provide an understanding of the transmissibility and pathogenesis of sars-cov as well as major targets for therapeutic interventions nafamostat mesylate a drug used to treat acute pancreatitis has shown some potential to inhibit fusion of the envelope of the virus to the host cell surface membranes it has been utilized in japan for many years and there is adequate data to ensure safety hoffmann et al 2020banother drug that is fda approved and is currently being considered as a treatment as an anti-sars-cov-2 is lopinavirritonavir ritonavir and lopinavir a combination drug which is sold under the brand name kaletra showed promise as a target of the coronavirus protease enzyme the protease enzyme is responsible for the cleavage of the gag-pol polyproteins which plays an important role in the virus replication cycle cao et al 2020 the main role of ritonavir in the combination is to enhance protease inhibitor pi regimens in order to improve the pharmacokinetics of the lopinavir the bioavailability of the second lopinavir is greatly improved by the interaction with cyp3a4 and twice daily dosing is made possible this boosted pi regimen is evident by high levels of viral suppression among antiretroviral nave and prior pi treated patients zeldin and petruschke 2004 the clinical benefits of administering lopinavirritonavir to patients with covid-19 was evaluated via a clinical trial involving 199 hospitalized adult patients the outcomes of the study showed there was no difference in the mortality after 28 days of treatment in the group receiving lopinavirritonavir and the standard-care groups moreover gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavirritonavir group however serious effects were experienced in the standard-care group lopinavirritonavir treatment was stopped early in 138 of the patients because of adverse events leading to the conclusion that no benefit was observed with lopinavirritonavir treatment beyond standard-care cao et al 2020 similar results have been reported in other clinical trials colson et al 2020 however more studies involving high sample sizes of patients at different stages of the disease need to be performed to conclusively determine the efficacy of the drugby tampering with vrna synthesis it is possible to eliminate viruses hence therapeutic drugs such as favipiravir which acts by preventing rna strand elongation and viral proliferation via purine nucleoside inhibition furuta et al 2005 is being considered for sars-cov-2 broad-spectrum activity of favipiravir against rna viruses such as west nile virus poliovirus ebola virus and norovirus rocha-pereira et al 2012 makes it a suitable candidate for sars-cov-2 phase i clinical trials to evaluate its efficacy against sars-cov-2 have begun and doses ranging from 30 to 1600 mgkg have shown no serious adverse effects kobayashi et al 2008 unfortunately a more recent study furuta et al 2017 has shown that favipiravir has teratogenic andor embryotoxic effects favipiravir use has been linked with other mild adverse effects such as diarrhea nausea vomiting and elevation of blood acid levels health 2018 based on these studies favipiravir may be recommended for patients whose condition is not complicated a phase ii chinese clinical trial on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of favipiravir was conducted last year and it is envisaged that the results of this study will shed more light on favipiravir for sars-cov-2combinations of different classes of antiviral drugs are being proposed to manage covid-19 such initiatives include clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol combination against the novel coronavirus infection the outcome of a randomized clinical trial involving 125 participants is expected in may 2020 clinicaltrialsgov 2020a it is proposed and hypothesized that the combination of these drugs will provide better efficacy against sars-cov-2 as a synergistic effect is expectedat the moment most of these therapeutic drugs are still under clinical trials and their efficacy against sars-cov-2 have not been determined holistically other drugs that are currently being investigated at various stages of clinical trials for potential application in sars-cov-2 treatment include pirfenidone targets il-1 and il-4 rintatolimod targets tlr-3 plitidepsin targets ef1a anti-sars-cov-2 polyclonal hyperimmune globulin targets immunoglobulin kevzara targets interleukin-6 brilacidin targets immunoglobulin tak-888 takeda and gimsilumab roivant amongst many others driggin et al 2020 most of the proposed treatment approaches have involved targeting the replication cycle of the virusconvalescent plasma therapy involves antibodies ab transfusion a person who has recovered into an infected person to initiate an immune system response against the disease the possible sources of sars-cov-2 abs are human convalescent sera obtained from individuals who have fully recovered from sars-cov-2 through humoral immunity monoclonal antibodies or they can be acquired from animal hosts such as genetically engineered cows who produce human antibodies beigel et al 2018 the convalescent blood products are able to cause neutralization of the virus and ultimately lead to eradication from the blood circulatory system through induction of artificially acquired immunity marano et al 2016 there are ongoing trials of convalescent plasma in patients with sars-cov-2 smith and prosser 2020a 2020b notably on the march 24 2020 the fda granted clinicians the permission to make use of investigational convalescent plasma for single patient use under emergency investigational new drug applications fda 2020 eligible patients have to be positive for sars-cov-2 the disease must be severe and life threatening and they must be able to provide informed consenta more recent study on convalescent plasma treatment for sars-cov-2 shen et al 2020 was conducted in 5 patients with sars-cov-2 who were transfused with convalescent plasma containing sars-cov-2 specific antibody igg binding with titer greater than 11000 this was obtained from 5 patients who just recovered from sars-cov-2 and the newly infected patients were administered the convalescent plasma 10 and 22 days after admission observations after treatment included normalization temperature within 3 days in 4 out of 5 patients increased pao2fio2 and decreased viral load which subsequently became negative within 12 days was observed in addition after 12 days ards was resolved in 4 patients and mechanical ventilation was stopped for 3 patients within 14 days three patients were discharged after 55 days in another study in china 10 patients who had undergone convalescent therapy showed a shortening of the duration of symptoms improved oxygen levels and a drop in the viral load duan et al 2020 these results show that the administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody lead to improved clinical status due to the limited sample size it is suggested that these observations be evaluated in randomized clinical trials with a larger number of participantsadjuvant therapy refers to treatment that is given in addition to the primary initial treatment to lower the risk of the disease during management covid-19 patients presenting with bacterial co-infection are associated with serious outcomes in a retrospective study on 191 patients from jinyintan hospital and wuhan pulmonary hospital half of the deaths experienced a secondary infection zhou et al 2020a in wuhan china again another cohort of severely ill patients displayed bacterial and fungal coinfections and common secondary infections included a baumannii k pneumoniae a flavus c glabrata and c albicans chen et al 2020b the co-infections have necessitated the inclusion of antibiotics as adjuvant therapy for covid-19 patients which can be utilized based upon institutional antibiograms and as well as after culture sensitivity testing standard therapy has included ceftriaxone 12 g iv daily in combination with azithromycin 500 mg iv for 3 days ruan et al 2020non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids have also been found to be relevant in the symptomatic treatment of sars-cov-2 paracetamol is indicated to manage the high fever associated with sars-cov-2 nsaids such as ibuprofen have been hypothesized to exacerbate the viral activity as it dampens the immune system increases risk of stroke myocardial infarction and nephrotoxicity moreover acute respiratory tract infections are usually associated with increased risk from those effects therefore even short-term use of nsaids by patients with covid-19 was thought to worsen the disease day 2020 however european medicines agency ema has recently stated that currently there is no scientific evidence for the link between the worsening of covid-19 and ibuprofen ema 2020 who supported this after a systemic review o nsaids usage which indicated no evidence of harm in patients with covid-19 who 2020ca coordinated cytokine response forms part an effective host immune response however a dysregulated pathological outcome in some patients manifests as a hyperinflammatory response fig 3 and some patients infected with sars-cov-2 experience this phenomenon known as a cytokine storm li et al 2020b the use of corticosteroids has been pharmacologically effective in reducing the inflammation as of march 2020 there have been no clinical trials on the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of sars-cov-2 however corticosteroids are administered in high doses for a longer treatment duration resulting in side effects yasir and sonthalia 2019 nonetheless in april zhan et al reported the first case of a covid-19 patient with multiple myeloma being successfully treated with tocilizumab zhang et al 2020d the known effects of cytokine storm by sars-cov-2 infection have been attributed to il-6 therefore the management by tocilizumab is considered as a better option than corticosteroids kotch et al 2019 luo et al reports for successful use of tocilizumab in the management of the cytokine storm call for randomized clinical trials with high number of participants so that clinical guidelines can be drawn mehta et al 2020other immune modulators and viral entry inhibitors include monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in addition sirolimus and everolimus are macrolides that have been used to prevent organ rejection their target protein is the mtor which belongs to the family of protein kinases kindrachuk et al 2014 they may be used to prevent a cytokine storm experienced by sars-cov-19 patients kiniksa pharmaceuticals has announced early confirmation of treatment response with mavrilimumab it is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is still under investigatory stages it has been shown to target granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor alpha gm-csf trus et al 2020 the basis of this is the involvement of gm-csf in the mechanism of over activation cellular immune response in the lungs it is thought to be the major contributor of the mortality associated with the disease recent reports suggest that patients diagnosed with sars-cov-2 have higher serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as gm-csf and interferon gamma tsantikos et al 2018 kiniksa is on track to begin phase 2 and 3 clinical development of mavrilimumab for sars-cov-2 pneumonia crotti et al 2019 it is intended to be used in patients suffering from severe sars-cov-2 pneumonia and hyperinflammation thus far 6 patients have been treated with mavrilimumab and all the patients exhibited improved oxygenation as well as early resolution of fever in addition none of the patients required mechanical ventilation furthermore mavrilimumab has shown a high therapeutic index as it was well tolerated bloomberg 2020severe cases of sars-cov-2 have been associated with a cytokine storm that leads to activation of the coagulation cascade leading to thrombotic phenomena henry et al 2020 iba et al 2020 furthermore there are reports of an association between abnormal coagulation parameters that causes coagulopathy and dic which is linked to mortality in covid-19 patients in a clinical trial of 449 patients with severe covid-19 99 of them received low molecular weight heparin lmwh for 7 days or longer the results indicated a better prognosis in severe covid-19 patients with markedly elevated d-dimer on lmwh than non-coagulant users tang et al 2020a the use of anticoagulant therapy with heparin has been recommended as it has shown to decrease mortality in covid-19 patients coppola et al 2020bioinformatics and cheminformatics are newer strategies to screen and design various drug candidates for sars-cov-2 computation chemistry analytical tools have found relevance in predicting the interactions between therapeutic agents and their binding affinitysites within the human body and the disease-causing organisms this strategy could lead to the generation of more accurate approaches and techniques for sars-cov-2 management for instance a simulation study by kadam and wilson revealed that arbidol umifenovir could be a broad-spectrum antiviral agent against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses kadam and wilson 2017 aribidol is an anti-influenza drug and its anti-sars-cov-2 effects were determined in predictive in silico studies vankadari 2020 and its efficacy was reinforced via in vitro studies wang et al 2020c such predictive studies make it possible for faster and cost-effective development of drugs after efficacy was proved the drug has been registered for clinical trials kadam and wilson 2017 mina et al 2020 moreover it has now been included in guidelines for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus by the national health commission nhc of the peoples republic of china wang et al 2020cbaricitinib which is a janus inhibitor was also subjected to molecular modelling predictions for its potential in the treatment of sars-cov-2b richardson et al 2020b amongst the six drugs with high binding affinity to aak-1 baricitinib which also binds the cyclin g-associated kinase endocytosis regulator was shown to be a promising drug target for sars-cov baricitinib is now in clinical trials for sars-cov in a patient population as it has proven to reduce inflammation and inhibit viral entry richardson et al 2020bstudies to date indicate that drugs that have a similar grouping to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may have some activity against sars-cov-2 hu and bajorath 2012 chlorpromazine as well as dasatinib have a similar structure to chloroquine both drugs are also chlorobenzenes and thus can be exploited for potential activity against sars-cov-2 combinations of two or more drugs have a higher probability of achieving the desired targets of viral replication entry and modulation of the host immune responseanother non-conventional method used to search for drug targets of covid-19 is the use of network-based drug methodology for predicting drug targets wu et al 2018 through development of systems biology and network pharmacology there is a paradigm shift in drug discovery from a linear mode of one drug for one target and one disease to mapping multiple drug targets for multiple diseases via the network based method anighoro et al 2014 network based methodologies apply the power of networks to establish correlations between various data sets of interest for drug discovery for sars-cov-2 the methodology can combine systems pharmacology-based network platforms to identify the various interactions between the virus the host cells and proteins that could be possible drug targetszhou et al built the host-virus interactome network of various viruses such as hcov-229e hcov-nl63 mers-cov and sars-cov mouse hepatitis virus mhv avian infectious bronchitis with virus nucleocapsid protein n protein and 119 host proteins associated with corona virus infection signaling pathways obtained from various experimental studies 
fig 2
 zhou et al 2020c the study found that 47 human proteins could be targeted by at least one fda approved and experimental medicines under clinical trials to further refine the results drugtarget networks were built to generate information related to more than 2000 anti cov drugs that are both approved by fda and those in experimental phase from the network 135 drugs were identified as possible candidates to manage the virus from the dataset 200 were further optimized and the top 16 most repurposable drugs for covid-19 with least expected side-effects and targeting specificity were identified the drugs included irbesartan toremefene camphor equilin mesalazine mecaptopurine paroxetine sirolimus carvedilol colcochine dactinomycin melatonin quinacrine eplerenone emodin and oxymetholone most of the drugs that have been shown clinically to have antiviral activity act via different mechanisms moreover integration of drugtarget networks of the top 16 drug candidates produced of potent drug combinations using a complementary exposure technique chen et al 2020b other studies have also shown the potential of using a network based methodology to screen possible drug targets for sars-cov-2 hofmarcher et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 li et al 2020cthe method is a quick way of identifying drug targets however it is not designed to produce drugs but is a useful tool for prediction of new drugs and combinations and reduces the period of drug screening and development once prediction is done extensive in vitro in vivo and human trial studies are still requiredartificial intelligence ai and machine learning ml can contribute to drug development for covid-19 by improving the speed and efficiency of repurposing and proposing new potent molecules to inhibit sars-cov-2 both al and ml can also be employed to predict the spread of the disease application of ai and ml for the development of diagnostic and monitoring techniques for covid-19 has proven to be successful through increasing accuracy speed and protecting healthcare workers from exposure gozes et al 2020 wang et al 2020d with no effective treatment regimen for covid-19 it is paramount to design therapeutic approaches that repurpose clinically approved drugs by designing new therapies via ai and ml zhavoronkov et al recently reported new druglike molecules against sars-cov-2 targets using machine deep learning zhavoronkov et al 2020 ai and ml were used to screen the possibility of repurposing poly-adp-ribose polymerase 1 parp1 inhibitor cvl218 which is currently in phase i clinical trial to inhibit sars-cov-2 ge et al 2020 using ai it was discovered that baricitinib could be used in the treatment of covid-19 and have now started a randomized-controlled trial with the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid to evaluate its efficacy to inhibit covid-19 infection and reduce inflammatory damage due to the disease benevolentai 2020 russell et al 2020 google also recently developed a deep learning system alphafold which was released to predict protein structures associated with covid-19 this usually takes several months via conventional experimental methods to determine and has proven to be a valuable resource for developing covid-19 drug targets and vaccines senior et al 2020 with increased amount of research towards covid-19 and the voluminous data being published this information can be crucial in feeding into ai and ml system for developing potent anti- sars-cov-2 drugspresently antivirals are used to attack viruses after the lungs have been affected it would be advantageous to prevent infection rather than to treat it a novel study has taken on an approach that includes a phage capsid that enveloped flu viruses perfectly so that they cannot infect cells lauster et al 2020 the sars-cov-2 needs a protease called mpro or 3clpro to form its viral replication complex this enzyme can be blocked by a drug which provides a complimentary 3d shape scientists at university of lbeck used high intensity x-rays to elucidate the proteases 3d structure the x-ray structures were reported for sars-cov-2 mpro with -ketoamide inhibitor and resulted in a lead compound that was further developed to produce a potent inhibitor of sars-cov-2 the inhibitor 13b showed that it could be well tolerated in mice via the inhalation route zhang et al 2020c direct administration of the molecule to the lungs has some possibility however a pharmaceutical input is needed and it may be several years before it can be used as a coronavirus treatment ter meulen et al 2004 walter et al 2020in addition to the development of new drugs the design of novel drug delivery systems such as nano-sized systems need to be considered as they have been shown to be superior in the treatment of disease conditions and overcoming drug resistance as compared to conventional dosage forms the identification of suitable drugs will therefore require innovative and superior delivery approaches to maximise their therapeutic efficacy nanosystems provide increased drug accumulation at the target site of the disease increase intracellular penetration protect drugs from degradation increase stability and can prevent mechanisms of drug resistance fig 3
 in addition nanosystems have the ability to incorporate different therapeutic agents which can be released in a controlled manner to the specific target site nanosystems being used for various antiviral drugs can be similarly explored for sars-cov-2 s protein of cov forms the characteristic corona of the virus with distinctive spikes on the viral envelope holmes 2003 as well as complex surface projections with sizes of about 2040 nm ksiazek et al 2003 therefore targeting of the s protein of cov using nanosystems with sizes of about 10100 nm may be a promising approach for early diagnosis as well as treatment hence it is highly recommended that alternate drug delivery systems such as the use of nanomaterials be developed in order to more effectively deliver current and new drugs showing promise in eradicating sars-cov-2 fig 3 below shows a possible mechanism by which nanosystems can be used to target specific sites associated with sars-cov-2 infectionsaccording to available literature plant based remedies have been used for centuries to tackle respiratory tract infections and may therefore be helpful in the treatment of sars-cov-2 ren et al 2020 chinese plant based therapy consisting of a mixture of chinese herbs such as san wu huangqin decoction lianhuaqingwen capsules and yinhuapinggan granules have shown to display antiviral properties li et al 2020d the mechanisms of action of such plants are associated with inhibition of replication of viral particles as well as blocking proliferation ren et al 2020 diammonium glycyrrhizinate which is an extract of glycyrrhiza glabra liquorice has been recommended to treat covid-19 chen et al 2020a murck 2020 however no official guidelines have been issued yet the other commonly used herbs in covid-19 management include glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma gancao atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma baizhu saposhnikoviae radix fangfeng lonicerae japonicae flos jinyinhua and forsythiae fructus lianqiao astragali radix astragali radix huangqi saposhnikoviae radix fangfeng and atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma baizhu which are all components of a traditional herbal formula called yupingfeng powder xu and zhang 2020 certain studies have demonstrated that yupifeng powder has anti-inflammatory antiviral and immunoregulatory effects li et al 2020a a review conducted by cochrane found that the combination of traditional chinese medicine with western medicine demonstrated a great improvement in symptoms of sars-cov-2 liu et al 2004 2020c stilbene-based natural compounds were reported to be effective in inhibiting spike protein and human ace2 receptor complex sar-cov2 in silico wahedi et al 2020 unlike conventional medicines herbal and plant products are not well understood and must be used with extreme caution to prevent herb-drug interactions as of now there are no rigorous peer reviewed clinical trials of plant-based therapies most approvals and use are based upon anecdotal clinical reports based upon historical records and ethnomedical sources plant-based therapies could be an alternative source of an anti-sars-cov2 potent drugfor an innate immune response by the body to viruses to be initiated the cells must have the ability to identify the pathogen trying to invade it currently there are several clinical trials being directed to develop a vaccine based on several different strategies against sars-cov-2 as illustrated in table 2
 such approaches include those that target the spike glycoprotein s protein as the major inducer of the immune response numerous strategies have been trialled which include and are not limited to the use of the full length s protein s1 receptor binding domain rbd dna or viral vectors and finally expression of virus like proteins vlp dhama et al 2020 phase 1 human clinical trials are anticipated to begin in april 2020 and many have commenced the bill and melinda gates foundation have provided a grant to inovio for a large-scale intradermal vaccine entitled ino-4800 on 16th march 2020 moderna inc started phase 1 trials in 45 healthy volunteers at the kaiser permanente washington health research center as of april 2020 there are more than 115 possible vaccine candidates of sars-cov-2 that are being developed globally smith and prosser 2020a le et al 2020some of the approaches that have been involved in creating a vaccine have also included the development of attenuated vaccines by introducing a mutation into orf1ab polyprotein the lack of virulence of the mouse coronavirus was demonstrated mhv-a59 due to attenuation of the virus liu et al 2020a dna based vaccines include patent wo2005081716 which induces and enhances immune responses in particular against antigens of the sars coronaviruses the immune response is induced by chimeric nucleic acids which encodes for an endoplasmic reticulum polypeptide such as calreticulin employing gene gun delivery to deliver dna-coated gold particles it was shown that vaccinated animals displayed both humoral and t cell mediated immune response liu et al 2020aanother approach involves protein-based vaccines capable of invoking an immune response against sars the one patented by glaxosmithkline contains an s protein immunogen together with oil in water emulsion which is also an adjuvant the vaccine showed induction of high levels of anti-sars-cov igg2a and igg2b antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in animal testing virus-like particle vaccines are being tested by moderna they report that mrna-1273 is an mrna vaccine which targets a prefusion stabilized form of an s protein which is associated with sars-cov-2 httpclinicaltrialsgov
clinicaltrials gov 2020balthough the use of vaccines is a generally a better preventive approach unfortunately they are currently undergoing development the few that have been developed are still under different stages of pre-clinical and clinical trials this implies that there is no certainty in respect to their efficacy against sars-cov-2 hence the disease is still a threat globallycovid-19 is a pandemic which is currently threatening the health of the entire human race in addition to the global economy therefore providing a solution and cure has become a matter of urgency which may not allow for the development and evaluation of new biomolecules the approval of which is a lengthy process hence a better alternative is to repurpose therapeutic drugs or approaches that can target pathophysiological pathways that are associated with the disease several potential therapeutic agents and approaches against sars-cov-2 have been highlighted and discussed in detail various successful and unsuccessful in vitro and in vivo studies have been reported for drugs that are currently repurposed to treat sars-cov-2 some of these repurposed drugs have shown some encouraging clinical outcomes and have been taken further to different stages of clinical trials however due to the dire need for therapeutic options some of the reported studies are preliminary pilot studies with lower sample sizes have a poor study design such as lack of randomization and do not include controls and placebos in the evaluations there is a need for further investigations that include larger number of participants evaluate long-term implications on human health and identify the toxicity profile of dosages proposed to be effective against the virus future newly designed therapeutic agents orand approaches must be target specific effective and safe to treat the infected patient the development of novel drug delivery systems that target the virus could go a long way in preventing possible viral resistance the development of various vaccines against this deadly virus as a preventative therapeutic is also ongoing as the world is desperately in need of a solution to this virusdespite significant progress that has been made by scientists based on in vitro animal cohort studies and clinical trials there is currently no definitive cure and vaccine however some studies appear to be very promising a major limitation observed in all of these studies is that no long-term experimental protocol has been undertaken in order to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the proposed anti sars-cov-2 drugs it is therefore strongly advised that long term studies be conducted for each of the therapeutic approaches and vaccines

clinicaltrialsgov 2020bauthors declare no conflict of interestthe recent pandemic of novel coronavirus has already affected thousands of people and is continuing to spread around the world this virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and the disease caused is called coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as of 5 may 2020 a total of 3517345 confirmed clinical episodes of covid-19 and 243401 deaths have been reported worldwide who 2020a most sars-cov-2-infected people experience mild to moderate respiratory distress and generally recover without requiring any special treatment however older people generally 60 years of age and those with underlying medical complications like diabetes cardiovascular disease chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop serious symptoms like acute respiratory disease and multiorgan failure ultimately leading to death lai et al2020sars-cov-2 belongs to the same family as that of sars severe acute respiratory syndrome and mers middle east respiratory syndrome viruses that were responsible for epidemics in 2003 and 2012 respectively lu et al2020 the genomes of sars-cov-2 is a single positive-strand rna and codes for similar structural protein as of sars giving rise to a debate about whether it is a laboratory engineered sars virus or a naturally evolved new virus the sequence analysis of its rna made available by china in the public database showed that it is a novel virus that originated possibly from bats through natural evolution andersen et al2020 however how it got transmitted from bats to humans with such high transmission rates from humans to humans is still ambiguousfor infection into human cells the receptor-binding domain of spike protein s present on the envelope of the virus binds to ace2 protein present on human cells initiating the entry process this binding induces large conformational change in s protein that leads to exposure of its proteolytic site the proteolytic site is then cleaved by a protease causing the fusion of the viral envelope to the host cell membrane completing the entry of the virus into a human cell further it is shown that the s protein of sars-cov-2 has a higher binding affinity with ace2 as compared to sars wrapp et al2020 based on these results it could be concluded that sars-cov-2 is a variant of sars however the sars-cov-2 genome has additional features like the presence of a polybasic rrar cleavage site at the junction of s1 and s2 subunits of the spike protein the presence of a polybasic cleavage site helps in effective cleavage by furin and proteases and determines viral infectivity and host range andersen et al 2020 interestingly in case of the avian influenza virus the gain of this polybasic site in ha that performs a similar function of host receptor binding like spike protein can transform the virus from low virulent to high virulent forms along with this the acquisition of cleavage site is positively selected for fast replication and transmission rates alexander and brown 2009 to better understand the transmission rates the growth rate r0 that defines the natural transmission of a pathogen needs to be calculated for sars mers and sars-cov-2 it is interesting to observe that although they belong to the same family sars-cov-2 has twice the transmission rate when compared to sars along with this the multiplication cycles range is 510 days for sars and mers and 23 days for sars-cov-2 liang 2020 probably this the reason why sars and mers were far more contained whereas covid-19 is highly widespread the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 during the early outbreak in wuhan china was calculated as 14 wu et al2020 however in late february who estimated this rate to increase to 58 on the other hand south korea registered a death rate of 1 or less while the death rate in italy seems to be for now several folds higher rosenbaum 2020 the infection has advanced to more than 210 countries and territories with an average mortality rate of 34 according to recent reports rajgor et al2020 therefore therapeutic and vaccine initiatives in this direction are inevitable efforts have been made in drug therapy as well as vaccine development to combat covid-19till date the us food and drug administration fda has approved an antiviral drug remsdesivir developed by gilead inc usa and an antimalarial drug chloroquine cqhydroxychloroquine hcq for the treatment of covid-19 an array of drugs approved for other diseases are also considered potentially useful while several investigational drugs are under study in several clinical trials conducted across the globe table 1a and b figure 1 in order to clinically manage coronavirus researchers from china france and a team of doctors from rajasthan india have started using antiviral drugs in combination with chloroquine colson et al2020 lai et al2020 liu et al2020 recently who announced a global trial called solidarity to investigate whether this dangerous respiratory disease could be treated with the available therapeutic aids httpsnewsunorgenstory2020031059722 it is however an unprecedented effort that includes thousands of patients across many countries to volunteer for the clinical trials the trials aim to test the effectiveness of the four potential candidates 1 the antiviral drug remdesivir that is known to inhibit rna dependent rna polymerase 2 a combination of two hiv drugs lopinavir and ritonavir 3 lopinavir and ritonavir plus interferon beta and 4 the antimalarial drugs chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine table 1b coronavirus being a rna virus retroviral drugs could possibly have an effect on treatment however cqhcq which was successful as an antimalarial is currently being considered as a part of treatment strategy against covid-19 colson et al2020 cq has also been shown to possess anti-hiv activity through post-transcriptional inhibition of gp120 present on the viral envelope or inhibition of tat-mediated transactivation jiang et al1996 savarino et al2001 moreover chloroquine can also increase the ph of endosomes mauthe et al2018 since coronavirus do not encode for gp120 or tat protein and low ph is essential for uncoating of the virus inside the host cell it is more likely that chloroquine stops viral spread by blocking the process of uncoating and release of nucleic acid however the current data from various small and non-randomized trials show only limited effects of cqhcq or hcq-azithromycin combination on treatment for covid-19 since cqhcq is known to cause toxic effects and unprescribed use has led to human deaths large-scale randomized trials like the solidarity project will be able to convincingly prove the effectiveness of cqhcq as a drug against covid-19 recently it has been shown that combination of lopinavir-ritonavir causes adverse effects on covid-19-infected adults and no benefits are observed cao et al2020 therefore drugs should be used with caution until their mechanisms are well understood and their efficacy is well established it is also known with viruses that mutate at high frequencies give rise to different strains thereby easily gaining resistance to drugs thus in-depth analysis in animal models is required to study their mechanism of action and the ability of the virus to gain resistance against these drugs
further animal testing will also be important to measure absorbance of the drug in the body its dissociation chemistry its metabolomics and the mechanism of drug clearancein principle drugs only help in the treatment of humans once they contract the disease but for long-term protection against the disease vaccines have to be developed to avoid such a global pandemic vaccines will be able to mount an immune response against the virus by generating neutralizing antibodies that would protect humans when again infected with sars-cov-2 and thus avoid another outbreak of such a virulent virusas the key 12 amino acid residues present in ace2 of humans are conserved in ace2 of macaques as well melin et al2020 macaques are a closer model system to humans and hence the choice for animal studies for vaccine testing of covid-19 the studies with macaques have shown that they do get infected with pulmonary infiltrates as observed in radiographs with high viral loads in swabs of nose and throat and shedding in the upper and lower respiratory tract munster et al2020 rockx et al2020 taken together the disease symptoms in rhesus macaques matches with the milder symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection in humans further serum analysis demonstrate an increase in chemokine levels of il1ra il10 il15 mcp-1 il6 and decrease in tgf levels on days 1 and 3 post-infection but with no statistical significance munster et al2020 sars-cov-2 is known to affect older people as compared to young ones similarly it is also observed in macaques that older ones show higher viral loads in nose and throat along with prolonged viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract of old animals rockx et al 2020 thus rhesus macaques can be a promising animal model for challenge studies and studying the efficacy of vaccines as immune responses in monkeys are similar to humans this will further allow us to understand how monkeys challenge coronavirus and protect themselvesferrets are model organisms for influenza virus and have similar lung morphology as humans and can actually cough and sneeze supporting their use as an animal model for sars-cov-2 cameron et al2012 enkirch and von messling 2015 a team of virologists led by ss vasan from australia has already shown that these animals are susceptible to coronavirus callaway 2020 but the virus only causes an increase in body temperature and other symptoms that are the hallmark for sars-cov-2 do not develop and the virus cannot replicate to high levels but interestingly the infected ferrets can spread the virus with high transmission rates even to adjacent cages through direct contact or aerosols kim et al2020 since most of the countries are now under community transmission stage ferrets will act as a valuable animal model to study the transmission of the sars-cov-2compared with the logistics cost and ethical regulations in using monkeys and ferrets laboratory-bred mice always remain a convenient choice as a disease model however coronavirus do not infect mice and rats as 11 of the 29 amino acids in mice and 13 of 29 amino acids in rats differ in the binding region of ace2 compared to humans chan et al2020 in order to solve this problem perlman laboratory developed humanized mouse models for sars where they incorporated human ace2 in mice mccray et al2007 the humanized ace2 mice are successfully infected by sars and develop lethal brain disease making it an obvious choice to test infection with sars-cov-2 as well however due to lack of funding and high cost of maintenance of this mice colony they discontinued breeding of mice in their facility and submitted the sperms of hace2 mice to jackson laboratory but these mice are now high in demand and jackson laboratory is facing a huge pressure to meet these demands however recent results from china have shown that hace2 mice do support sars-cov-2 infection where they reduce weight by 20 and virus replication occur in lungs moreover infected hace2 mice also suffer from interstitial pneumonia where bronchioles are filled with periodic acid schiff pas positive exudation or detached bronchial epithelium but are unable to transmit the disease also the infiltrates are enriched in macrophages t-lymphocytes and b-lymphocytes the authors also confirmed that the mice use hace2 for entry and fulfill kochs postulates indicating that these mice are successful disease model for sars-cov-2 bao et al2020these animals support sars infection and show maximum similarity to human ace2 where only 4 amino acids out of 29 are different in the critical binding region of ace2 making them a testable model for sars-cov-2 infection upon infection of sars-cov-2 syrian hamsters demonstrate weight loss by 11 along with high viral load in nasal turbinate lungs and trachea further the lethality rate in hamsters is 5 and exudative inflammation with hemorrhage and necrosis of alveolae damage is visible during the initial infection period the inflammation of intestinal mucosal epithelium that is the causative agent of diarrohea along with myocardial degeneration is consistent with the pathogenesis observed in humans importantly syrian hamsters show similar immune responses as that of humans where ifn- and pro-inflammatory cytokines are induced at day 2 post-infection followed by the decrease of type ii interferon and il6 and increase of tgf- at day 7 post-infection for an animal to be successful as a model system and perform challenge studies is also dependent on its ability to transmit the pathogen consistent with this syrian hamsters are able to transmit the disease to nave hamsters upon challenge with sars-cov-2 chan et al2020 taken all the data together as syrian hamsters show pathogenesis immune responses similar to humans and are capable of transmission this strengthens their use as one of the most testable models for vaccine studiesthus there are many promising animal models for testing the vaccine candidates for sars-cov-2 but still extensive studies are required to confirm their efficiency as an appropriate model for covid-19 in order to fight coronavirus infection and win the race against time moderna a biotechnological company in collaboration with national institute of allergy and infectious disease niaid usa has already begun phase i clinical trial with experimental vaccine mrna-1273 rna vaccine testing begins 2020 who 2020b their argument for directly going for phase i clinical trial is that the mrna-1273 raised a good antibody response after immunization in mice and a lack of disease model for coronavirus cansino biologics from china has also developed a replication-defective adenovirus expressing spike protein of sars-cov-2 as a vaccine candidate for covid-19 who 2020b beijing institute of biological productswuhan institute of biological products and sinovac are using inactivated method while inovio pharmaceuticals is using a dna-based vaccine approach similarly in order to fast-track vaccine development all of them have skipped animal trials and are currently performing phase i trials the phase i clinical trials will test the safety and toxicity of their vaccine target in humans and in a way help in protecting humans from sars-cov-2 although this looks promising for fast-tracking vaccine development there is division among the scientific community about bypassing animal models before phase i clinical trials in addition agencies like peta are against using animals for research purposes the question remains can vaccine research do without an animal modelin the history of mankind it has been clear that viral pandemics have been common in affecting millions of people the problem is due to its ability to multiply inside the host and produce high numbers by infecting a single cell accompanied by its stability in non-living surfaces which allows them to spread very fast that is why virus pandemics are global with high transmission rates thus to control viruses extreme steps are often needed therefore in the absence of disease model backed by their antibody responses in mice niaid and cansino biologics moved ahead with phase i clinical trials after bypassing animal model studies for vaccines different biotechnological companies are looking forward to come up with a vaccine in around a year to a year and a halfthus the decision by the fda to bypass animal trials is taken positively by entrepreneurs according to them flexibility of laws by the fda could avoid delays in treating as observed in the case of ganciclovir although ganciclovir is successful in treating patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related cytomegalovirus retinitis due to lack of animal studies it did not get approval by fda and was delayed by 4 years van norman 2019besides overcoming the time frame in which a vaccine can enter the market it is also important to note that results from animal studies may not translate to humans both in terms of toxicity and challenge studies isuprel a treatment for asthma was rendered safe in rats guinea pigs dogs and monkeys but still led to deaths in humans with far less dosages in great britain in another instance to treat human autoimmune disease a monoclonal antibody tgn1412 after going through animal models was processed for phase i trials the introduction of tgn1412 led to critical illness within minutes along with long-term complications in phase i volunteers van norman 2019 however tgn1412 is now restored for rheumatoid arthritis after developing better assays for studying immune responses and lowering the dosage of this monoclonal antibody brown 2018 further strengthening the fact that studies with animals may not always translate to use in humansin contrast chemicals that are generally toxic in animal studies may be safe in humans penicillin fatal to guinea pigs would have failed animal studies but due to lack of regulations to perform animal studies at that time it came into use and is presently a successful drug similarly aspirin is toxic to rhesus monkeys and paracetamol is toxic to dogs and cats van norman 2019thus these studies indicate that animal studies do not predict the outcomes to humans although they share a lot of genomic similarities the final response to disease will also depend on the epigenome and environmental differences even with the transgenic humanized models that mimic the human system we must remember that often genes do not work alone in such complex higher-order organismsalthough bypassing animal models can save time effort and money but it is not possible to perform safety and challenge studies for a disease in humans also animal studies provide the foundation to study disease further it is difficult to study the progression of disease in humans but it is easy in an animal model as they can be sacrificed for histopathology in order to follow the course of infection although cell lines can also be used to study the infection process animal models provide the advantage of studying the viral multiplication with respect to symptoms and physiology of an organism thus it becomes really important for a newly originated coronavirus to be studied in an animal model further studying animal models will also provide detailed information about the potential reservoirs of sars-cov-2 in an organismanother problem faced by vaccine efforts against viral diseases especially viruses having rna as the genetic material is that repair mechanisms do not work on rna and thus lot of mutations are accumulated in their rna this phenomenon is known as antigenic drift and is the reason that influenza shots are needed before every seasonal flu infection thus sars-cov-2-possessing rna genome is also prone to antigenic drift hence animal models of coronavirus will help in understanding the selection pressure and antigenic drift and evolution of the virus once a vaccine is administeredone of the major disadvantages of bypassing animal models is that it has been observed in case of viral infections that sometimes the administration of vaccines enhances the susceptibility of the subject to the disease this phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent enhancement or antigen sin and is common for vaccine candidates of hivaids virus and dengue virus once the subject is immunized with the antigen it mounts an immune response against the antigen but when the vaccinated individual is infected again with the virus having a different serotype the pre-existing antibodies are not able to neutralize the virus the formation of antibodyvirus complex helps in attachment to fc receptor on circulating monocytes resulting in the efficient infection of monocytes by the virus halstead 2002 thus instead of protecting the subject it leads to higher complications and death of the subject in case of infection by the pathogen huisman et al2009 therefore the biotech companies that have bypassed animal models should note that antibody-dependent enhancement is also observed with feline coronavirus fcov the immunization of mice with spike s protein of this virus mounts an overall high antibody response but neutralizing antibody levels are low however challenge of these cats results in enhanced susceptibility to infection along with death of cats huisman et al2009 this phenomenon is especially relevant to proteins that are prone to antigenic drift such as the s protein and sars and mers known to be capable of this phenomena liu et al2019 houser et al2017 as s protein is the major vaccine target of sars-cov-2 studies in animal model are really required before establishing it as a vaccine candidatein this global emergency the entire scientific community is attempting effective treatment and prevention of the disease to shorten the time and for the larger interest of humanity some routine yet essetial processes like animal trials are bypassed in the process of development of vaccine and drug development while options like drug repurposing are already adapted with varying degrees of success effective and targeted drugs and vaccines for the sars-cov-2 infection are still awaited moreover agencies like who and fda have already given a green signal for clinical trials of vaccines bypassing the regular process of animal trials hence it is important to access the positive and negative effects of the same choosing a suitable animal model is one of the main concerns for animal testing as the animal should mimic the response and effects to be generated after introduction of the drugvaccine to humans importantly some animal models such as the rhesus macaque ferrets mice and syrian hamster are proving to be successful for challenge by the sars-cov-2 with one or other similar symptoms as humans however a successful animal trial is not the only indicator of the success of any drugvaccine due to physiological barriers hence the decision of bypassing the animal model needs to be taken with utmost caution further saving time should not cost a large number of human lives as a failure of the drugvaccine could have devastating consequencessevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 marks the emergence of the third large-scale epidemic related to the coronavirus after sars-cov in 2002 and middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was first reported in wuhan china in december 2019 among a group of individuals presenting with pneumonia of unknown etiology 1 2 based on the sequencing and evolutionary data bats are the proposed reservoir for the coronavirus 2 3 after its initial discovery the spread of sars-cov-2 worldwide was rapid with over 17 million confirmed cases globally and more than 100000 deaths as of april 2020 4 the severity of this disease can range from asymptomatic disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards requiring aggressive measures to death 5 6 current management strategies involve supportive treatment and protective measures to prevent further transmission of the virus 7 8 though no potential cure has been reported several trials are underway to determine the most appropriate treatment regimenproviding care to immunocompromised patients and those suffering from cancer amidst this pandemic has been extremely challenging data from china thus far have shown that cancer patients infected with covid-19 are at 35 times the risk of requiring mechanical ventilation or icu admission compared to the general population 9 additionally the limitation of resources in outpatient settings including administrative staff and specialists has hindered the routine care of these patients 10 this review aims to evaluate current literature on the diagnosis and management of covid-19 patients and discuss approaches to managing cancer patients in this pandemiccoronaviruses covs were first identified by tyrell and bynoe in 1966 in patients with viral-like upper respiratory illness 11 covs are enveloped positive single-stranded rna viruses that can infect both humans and animals their spherical morphology with core shell and glycoprotein projections from their envelope as seen under an electron microscopy makes them appear crown-like hence termed coronaviruses 12 some human covs can cause self-limiting upper respiratory infections in immunocompromised individuals whereas other covs of beta-covs subgroup such as sars-cov sars-cov-2 covid-19 and mers-cov can result in epidemics with increased mortality 13the fatality rate for infected cancer patients in china is 286 14 compared to a 23 fatality rate for all covid-19 patients 15 ace2 is the common binding site for both the sars-cov of the 20022003 sars epidemic and reportedly also for the sars-cov-2 strain underlying the current covid-19 epidemic 16sars-cov-2 interaction with the reninangiotensinaldosterone system raas through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ace2 is a key factor for infectivity 17 ace2 physiologically counters raas activation and also serves as a receptor for sars-cov-2 16 ace2 is expressed broadly in numerous tissues however lung alveolar epithelial cells are considered the primary targets 17 once cov-2 gains entry into the target cell the host response is a major determinant of severity of the ensuing pathogenesis fig 1 18 the bronchial mucosa is lined by mucosal associated invariant t mait cells and  t cells 19 these innate-like lymphocytes respond rapidly to pathogen invasion and trigger a cytokine response essential for microbial killing 19 the critical role of the host immune system in patients with severe covid-19 infection is highlighted by the characteristics of patients who have died 15 clinical outcomes are dependent upon factors such as age ace2 expression and comorbidities thus cancer patients by virtue of being older median age of a cancer diagnosis is 66 years in the usa 20 and having higher ace2 expression ace2 tends to increase with increasing age 21 and more comorbidities 22 are at a higher risk of adverse outcomes when infected with sars-cov-2 figure 2 highlights the case-fatality rate by age group in the general population diagnosed with covid-19 in china along with possible roles of mentioned factorsafter the initial innate response a specific adaptive immune response is required to eliminate cov-2 23 however in cancer patients on active treatment or even during watchful observation lymphopenia an independent poor prognostic indicator in covid-19 patients 24 is common 25 and hence the required immune response is impaired persistent cytokine release likely mediated by leukocytes other than t lymphocytes 23 may then lead to cytokine storm and cause significant lung damage in addition to this damage subpar specific immune response allows viral propagation destruction of tissues and progression to severe stages especially in ace2-rich tissues eg lung intestine and kidneys 23 therefore strategies that augment immune response at this stage eg immunoadjuvant therapies ifn or convalescent plasma 14 19 block cytokines il-6 il-1 or tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf or early institution of antiviral agents may prove beneficialless immunocompromised and nonlymphopenic cancer patients may mount an adequate response with cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls and natural killer nk cells being crucial for the control of viral infection persistent adaptive immune activation leading to lymphocyte exhaustion is well described in cases of chronic infections tumorigenesis 26 and reportedly even with sars-cov-1 infection 27 functional exhaustion of ctls and nk cells is now reported with cov-2 infection with significantly higher levels of exhaustion markers eg programmed death-1 pd-1 as compared to healthy controls 27 28 functional exhaustion of ctls correlates to 29 and likely results in viral disease progression and rapid decompensation 27 reports of successful use of anti-pd-1 drugs to reinvigorate exhausted t cells by blocking pd-1 in cases of viral bacterial and fungal infections are becoming common 19 foreseeably clinical trials to study the use of anti-pd1 agent against covid-19 are underway table 1tremendous efforts are underway for vaccine development targeting cov-2 74 however virus eliminating immune response may be difficult to illicit in immunocompromised cancer patients vaccine effectiveness in general tends to be lower in patients with cancer much lower for those with hematologic malignancies 75 utilization of long-term immune memory from convalescent individuals may provide alternate strategies for patients with hematological malignanciesthe most common clinical symptoms of covid-19 range from fever cough dyspnea fatigue and in rare cases diarrhea and vomiting 76 based on current evidence cancer patients also present with similar symptoms though are at much higher risk of serious outcomes resulting in death when compared to the general population 9 10 14 emerging data highlighting concerns of coagulopathy in covid-19 patients is becoming available but it is too early to infer if these are more or less common in cancer patients 77 some of the common laboratory findings seen in covid-19 patients are cytopenias specifically lymphocytopenia along with elevation in lactate dehydrogenase ldh 14 76 covid-19 patients should additionally be screened for secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh via hscore 78 this is an often under-recognized hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by a severe cytokine storm often with multiorgan failure this is to identify the subgroup of patients who may benefit from immunomodulatory treatmentgiven general upper respiratory infection symptoms diagnosis of covid-19 often entails ruling out other common respiratory viral infection rvi etiologies nasopharyngeal swab is usually a collection method employed to obtain specimen for testing via polymerase chain reaction pcr increasing frequency of false negatives is being reported as a result hospitals are either repeating the test or treating patients empirically if one presents with classical symptoms of fever fatigue and dyspnea of unknown etiology 79remdesivir is a nucleotide analog that inhibits viral rna polymerases and has shown activity against sars-cov-2 in vitro 61 in a cohort of 53 patients hospitalized for severe covid-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir clinical improvement was seen in 36 68 patients 80 this suggests that remdesivir may have clinical

and chloroquine phosphate historically anti-malaria drugs have been shown to be safe and efficacious against covid-19 in clinical trials conducted in china 35 82 and france 36 the data from france showed a synergistic effect of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine 36 however evidence of efficacy is limited given there are only few small human trials with methodological limitations 37 additionally there is limited safety data available for the use of these drugs in the context of covid-19 especially in the setting of liver and renal impairment which may increase the risk of toxicity from these agents 83 therefore at present time there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of these drugs outside the context of a clinical trialil-1 and il-6 inhibitors may ameliorate severe damage to lung tissue caused by cytokine release in patients with serious covid-19 infections 64 84 one clinical trial using tocilizumab an il-6 inhibitor reported improvement in clinical outcomes in 21 patients with severe covid-19 64 several interleukin inhibitors are being investigated including a phase iii rct covacta nct04320615 to evaluate the efficacy of tocilizumab in severe covid-19 patients and another double-blind adaptive phase iiiii rct nct04327388 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sarilumab il-6 inhibitor has almost completed accrualacalabrutinib calquence is a next-generation highly selective bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor btki used to treat mantle cell lymphoma and cll now being tested for use in covid-19 patients the brutons tyrosine kinase pathway has a role in the production of inflammatory cytokines 85 and early clinical findings showed that acalabrutinib may ameliorate the severity of respiratory distress caused by covid-19 infection through inflammation control the calavi trial will be initiated as a randomized global clinical trial to assess the potential of acalabrutinib in the treatment of the cytokine storm associated with severely ill covid-19 patients 86 additionally other trials are being considered with different btki specifically ibrutinib to reduce the inflammatory response 87baricitinib fedratinib and ruxolitinib are selective janus-associated kinase jak-stat inhibitors that could potentially have anti-inflammatory effects in covid-19 patients with elevated cytokine levels 59 baricitinib is a jak inhibitor as well as an aak1 ap2-associated protein kinase 1 inhibitor that can interrupt the entry of the virus into cells in addition to an anti-inflammatory effect 88 several clinical trials are ongoing to confirm the efficacy of these agentsgm-csf is a pro-inflammatory cytokine found to be elevated in the serum of covid-19 patients there is evidence that gm-csf enhances the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in addition to promoting the differentiation of th1 cells and polarization of macrophages to m1-like phenotype resulting in pulmonary immunopathology and detrimental clinical manifestations in covid-19 patients 70 therefore targeting gm-csf seems to be a promising strategy in ameliorating lung damage while allowing time for the virus to clearmesenchymal stem cells mscs exert anti-inflammatory effects and promote endogenous repair of alveolar epithelium 54 a recent pilot study in seven covid-19 patients who received donor msc in china showed that the intervention was safe and may improve patient outcomes 55 the fda has approved msc treatments for use in critically ill covid-19 patients under the expanded access compassionate usethere is still controversy about the efficacy of glucocorticoids in treating covid-19-associated pneumonia the rationale is that steroids prolong the viral shedding time and maintain a systemic anti-inflammatory state that will minimize the precipitation of ards dyspnea and severe pneumonia however steroid therapy did not improve clinical outcomes for patients with sars or mers 89 90 a small observational study n  31 done in wuhu china showed no association between corticosteroids and outcomes in patients with mild disease 91 another study conducted in wuhan china n  201 showed that methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death from covid-19-associated ards hr 038 95 ci 020072 57 multiple prospective rcts to explore the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia are ongoingconvalescent plasma originates from patients who have previously recovered from the viral infection and are now able to donate their anti-sars-cov-19 immunoglobulin-containing blood once transfused into the patient the antibodies from the convalescent plasma are thought to neutralize the virus and limit its replication this treatment has been used to treat prior sars-cov an exploratory meta-analysis of 32 studies showed evidence of reduced mortality after receiving various doses of convalescent plasma in patients with severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology 92 recent experience and data from china showed that human convalescent plasma is a potential therapeutic option to lessen the severity andor shorten the length of illness caused by covid-19 93 the true clinical effect of this intervention is being verified through several ongoing rcts in addition the fda is supporting a national expanded treatment protocol to provide convalescent plasma to covid-19 patients across the country with the help from the red cross to identify prospective donors and manage the distribution of these products to hospitalsace2 has been identified as the functional receptor for sars-cov invasion into the human body 94 this led to concerns about the use of raas inhibitors in covid-19 patients however published data in humans is inadequate to support or refute this concern 17 vaduganathan et al proposed an alternative hypothesis that ace2 may be beneficial rather than harmful in patients with lung injury from sars-cov 17 clinical trials using raas modulators including losartan are currently underway nct04311177 nct04312009 nct04330300extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo can be a life-saving intervention for covid-19 patients with refractory respiratory failure in the setting of ards while this intervention has been used successfully in some patients 43 95 concerns were raised about the potential harms of ecmo therapy including elevation in il-6 levels and decrease in the number of functioning lymphocytes 96 as a result the immunological status needs to be considered when selecting patients for ecmo especially in cancer patients who are on treatments that often result in lymphopeniaards with concomitant dic was observed in 70 of those who die of covid-19 97 there is evidence that fibrin deposition in the pulmonary microvasculature is a contributing factor for ards and fibrinolytic therapy was shown to improve survival in ards patients three case reports of intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator tpa in critically ill mechanically ventilated covid-19 patients show an improvement in their pao2fio2 ratio from 38 to 100 97 formal studies are planned to determine the efficacy of this agent 98prior evidence has shown that low molecular weight heparin lmwh has anti-inflammatory properties and reduces the biological activity and levels of il-6 99 a retrospective study looked at 449 patients with severe covid-19 of whom 99 patients received heparin mainly lmwh results show that the heparinized group had lower mortality among patients who had an elevated sepsis-induced coagulopathy score and d-dimer 77 a smaller retrospective study looked at 42 patients with covid-19 and analyzed the efficacy of lmwh in slowing their inflammatory response 100 the 21 patients who received lmwh during hospitalization had significantly lower levels of il-6 higher lymphocyte levels and less coagulopathy compared to the 21 patients who did not receive lmwh no difference was seen in the duration of hospitalization between both groups this data is promising however prospective studies are needed prior to its use in clinical practicechinese medicine has played a key role in the treatment of several prior epidemic diseases including covid-19 pandemic 101 qingfei paidu decoction qpd for example was used to treat 701 cases with covid-19 in china improvement and cure was seen in 449 cases and stability of symptoms was seen in 212 cases 101 qpd is thought to alleviate excessive immune and inflammatory responses by regulating immune-related and cytokine actionrelated pathways 102 a rct to evaluate the effects of traditional chinese medicine on covid-19 patients is underway nct04251871a prospective randomized multicenter study immunoncovid is currently recruiting patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who have sars-cov-2 infection in europe the study aims to compare the efficacy of a chloroquine analog gns561 an anti-pd-1 nivolumab and an il-6 inhibitor tocilizumab versus standard of care in this cohort of patients nct04333914 more studies to evaluate the efficacy of such agents in our cancer population are neededcancer patients require timely diagnosis evaluation and treatment even during a pandemic however it is important to consider that cancer patients are immunocompromised and are at increased risk of covid-19-related serious events intensive care admission requirement for mechanical ventilation or death in comparison to the general population 9 10 given the current evolving situation pragmatic approaches are needed to deal with the challenges of treating cancer patients without jeopardizing their careto assist healthcare facilities in these unprecedented times oncology societies around the world namely the european society of medical oncology esmo american society of clinical oncology national comprehensive cancer network nccn and many more have developed guidelines to mitigate the negative effects of the covid-19 pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients 103105 the common theme of these proposed guidelines is to categorize patients into high medium or low priority based on the ontario health cancer care ontario criteria table 2 in order to plan their management course accordingly 106 figure 3 briefly outlines cancer management in the era of covid-19 pandemicin addition to these suggested priority-driven guidelines hospitals around the world have issued internal guidelines for oncologists aiming to decrease patient exposure to covid-19 given the immunocompromised nature of the patient population cancer centers have been adhering to strict infection control guidelines in inpatient and outpatient settings outpatient visits including ambulatory clinics and chemotherapy infusion visits have been reduced 107 utilization of oral therapy regimens is recommended instead of parenteral anticancer therapies if considered equivalent this strategy can hence reduce patients risk of exposure to sars-cov-2 without compromising oncological outcome for instance the use of capecitabine in place of 5-fluorouracil in patients receiving concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for rectal cancer 108 additionally one must strongly consider delaying anticancer therapy in patients with stable cancer zhang et al studied the outcomes of cancer patients with covid-19 on active anticancer therapy and reported more than fourfold higher likelihood of experiencing severe events in those who received therapy in the preceding 14 days of covid-19 diagnosis hr  4079 95 ci 108615322 p  0037 14 however for aggressive cancers it is warranted to have a riskbenefit assessment and proceeding with cancer treatment if benefits outweigh risks as precisely mentioned by wang et al the major risk factor for cancer patients during the covid-19 pandemic is their inability to receive sufficient medical support 109 to further minimize patient exposure to covid-19 clinicians could consider the option of chemotherapy break and the possibility of performing home laboratory draws for toxicity assessment if feasible to avoid patients exposure to pharmaceutical departments patients could use drive-through pick-up or hospitals could utilize a courier medication delivery service 107 110surgery is another vital component in cancer management in the current pandemic the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the american college of surgeons acs have advised rescheduling elective surgeries if possible 111 112 evidence suggests that patients who received surgery and concomitantly contracted covid-19 were at much higher risk of severe clinical events than those who did not have surgery 9 despite these advisories it is important for clinicians and patients to have risk assessment discussions prior to making treatment decisions part of the discussion should also entail resource availability as surgeries often require post-operative care in the intensive care unit icu given the current shortage of icu beds it is important to delegate resources efficiently in instances specifically early stage cancers where surgery is often the first step in management patients could be offered neoadjuvant therapy and surgery could be delayed without compromising patient outcomes 104 evidence suggests that 60-day delays in surgical intervention of early stage breast cancer has been documented without worsening oncological outcomes 113unlike medical and surgical management radiation therapy which is another essential part of cancer management has its unique challenges during a pandemic given the nature of the treatment patients have to attend radiation therapy rt sessions daily and the interruption of therapy is rather unacceptable 107 considering varied clinical scenarios the american society for radiation oncology astro recently published brief guidelines for radiation oncologists dealing with covid-19 pandemic as noted by astro if considered reasonable hypofractionated schedules are encouraged 114 additionally in patients with rapidly progressing disease or potentially curable tumors where rt significantly impacts survival treatment should be prioritized as benefits outweigh risks on the contrary patients receiving palliative rt for symptom control or where interrupting the radiation course would not cause potential harm one should consider delaying the treatment 104 114hematopoietic stem cell transplant hsct recipients are at an increased risk of a variety of infections 107 115 incidence of rvis is seen in about 8 of allogeneic and 2 of autologous transplant recipients with majority of patients developing nosocomial rvis 107 additionally hsct patients receive therapies which result in prolonged cytopenia making the transplant patients who contract covid-19 very vulnerable for severe symptoms 116 117 considering these profound implications the european society for blood and marrow transplantation ebmt recommends evaluating recipients at risk closely and in appropriate cases deferring the transplant therapy until asymptomatic table 3 118clinical trials are an extremely important part of advancing medicine forward and introducing novel therapies the food drug and administration fda plays a critical role in conducting these clinical trials and ensuring participants safety is paramount in any scenario in the midst of the current crisis the fda has issued guidance for the institutions to protect trial participants while administering investigational product with an altered monitoring approach 119 at our institution clinical trial activity during covid-19 is tailored to the changing epidemic scenario all nontherapeutic interventional trials that require in person specimen collection have been suspended until state stay at home order is lifted therapeutic clinical trials are prioritized by the clinical research services crs with weekly meetings conducted to re-prioritize with the evolving epidemic the clinical trials that have remained open continue to obtain all tests and data points required for the primary endpoint of the study additionally all correlative studies imbedded in the research plan except questionnaires are suspended until the state stay at home order is lifted all the covid-19-specific research studies have been prioritized and taken precedence in activation and conduct including the correlative endpoints new studies and proposals continue to be reviewed and processed clinical disease teams and the scientific review committees continue to meet virtually and advance the much needed carethe covid-19 pandemic is potentially the greatest public health crisis since the influenza pandemic of 1918 this crisis has brought unprecedented challenges in the management of those who are afflicted by overwhelming healthcare systems and causing great stress to the healthcare workforce during such crises generation of timely evidence for treatment options is crucial the higher risk of covid-19-related severe disease incurred by patients with cancer prompts the generation of a comprehensive set of pragmatic approaches specifically for cancer patients and an in-depth review of potential treatments options available to patients including cancer patientscurrently there is not any specific effective anti-viral treatment for covid-19 although most of the covid-19 patients have mild or moderate course up to 5-10 can have severe  potentially life threatening course there is an urgent need for effective drugs 1 optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy as new data regarding clinical characteristics treatment options and outcomes for covid-19 emerges approximately every hour

nonclinical models of these coronaviruses in vitro testing has also shown that remdesivir has activity against sars-cov-2 with an ec50 value of 176 m in vero e6 cells suggesting its working concentration is likely to be achieved in nonhuman primate models 8 treatment with intravenous remdesivir showed significant improvement for the first covid-19 case in us 24 and then a trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with 2019-ncov infection in a cohort of patients hospitalized for severe covid-19 who were treated with compassionate use remdesivir clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients 68 25 as there was no placebo or active comparator in this study it is hard to draw any concrete conclusions and measurement of efficacy will require results of ongoing randomized placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy there are 4 clinical trials currently enrolling patients in the united states and two

hiv infection with ritonavir as a booster protease is a key enzyme in coronavirus polyprotein processing and lopinavir andor ritonavir has anti coronavirus activity in vitro most in vitro studies have shown that sarscov could be inhibited by lopinavir and that the ec50 of lopinavir is acceptable lopinavir showed an antiviral effect against sars-cov-2 virus in vero e6 cells with the estimated ec50

28postexposure prophylaxis with lpvr was found to be associated with a 40 decrease in the risk of mers infection although the design of the study was raised some concerns 29 five patients with covid-19 in singapore were treated with lpvr within 1 to 3 days of desaturation but evidence of clinical benefit was equivocal while defervescence occurred within 1 to 3 days of lpvr initiation it was unable to prevent progressive disease in 2 patients a decline in viral load as indicated by the cycle threshold value from nasopharyngeal swabs also appeared similar between those treated and not

recommended for covid19 guo et al 2020 even though there have been a few reports of the use of some of these drugs in patients with covid19 researchers highlighted the importance to not give patients drugs of unknown efficacy which might be very harmful for those with severe covid19 d wang et al 2020recently two other drugs are currently evaluated in patients with covid19 httpswwwguidetopharmacologyorggracliganddisplayforwardligandid6432 and httpswwwguidetopharmacologyorggracliganddisplayforwardligandid4262 these drugs are synthetic protease inhibitors of trypsin prostasin matriptase and plasma kallikrein they are approved in japan for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis and postoperative reflux esophagitis coronaviruses penetrate the cell through the plasma membrane this step requires the activation of superficial proteases such as tmprss2 specifically sarscov2 enters human cells after that the s protein binds to the ace2 enzyme on the cell membrane s protein is divided into s1 and s2 by a protease derived from human cells s1 binds to its target ace2 the s2 is divided by tmprss2 with consequent fusion of the membrane ace2 and tmprss2 are therefore essential for sarscov2 infection both these drugs are able to inhibit the enzymatic activity of tmprss2 hoffmann et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 a randomized placebocontrolled clinical trial camoco19 is evaluating the efficacy and safety of camostat mesilate in 180 patients with covid19 clinicaltrialgov g 2020 furthermore both drugs will also be evaluated in clinical trials launched by the university

that binds the cd147 glycoprotein even though this drug cannot be defined as an antiviral agent its mechanism of action leads to a control in virus replication for this reason it is mentioned among antivirals the preliminary results of the chinese study are promising indeed compared to the control group the treatment with meplazumab was earlier associated with improvement in pneumonia these results although preliminary seem to confirm the involvement of cd147 in the penetration and replication of the virus in the body as well as in the development of inflammatory processes related to the infection clinicaltrialgov h 2020lastly a recent study carried out by the monash universitys biomedicine discovery institute and the peter doherty institute of infection and immunity showed that

24 h and by 998 after 48 h currently tests were carried out only in vitro and clinical trials are strongly needed to evaluate if the drug can be really effective against sarscov2 the author concluded that the early administration of an effective antiviral to patients could limit their viral load contrast the disease progressing and prevent its transmission they suggest that ivermectin could be a useful antiviral in the fight against covid19 caly druce catton jans  wagstaff 2020as previously reported the sarscov2 infection can be associated especially in severe form with the exaggerate activation of inflammatory processes and the development of cytokine storm based on this consideration several drugs with immunomodulatory properties are currently evaluated in patients with covid19

that was described with longterm use easterbrook 1993 mavrikakis papazoglou sfikakis vaiopoulos  rougas 1996 furthermore since the incidence of hepatic abnormalities significantly increases in patients with covid19 an impaired metabolism of both medications can be expected leading to further increase in the risk of liver impairment rismanbaf  zarei 2020 some preclinical studies showed that chloroquine has antiviral activity against sars coronavirus keyaerts vijgen maes neyts  ranst 2004 human coronavirus oc43 keyaerts et al 2009 and influenza a h5n1 yan et al 2013 suggesting a possible

deficiency or the presence of other concomitant therapies agenzia italiana del farmaco c 2020 data from a recent systematic review of six scientific articles and 23 ongoing clinical trials showed that chloroquine seems to be effective in reducing sarscov2 replication in vitro however authors underlined that even though a rationale to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with covid19 exists highquality clinical trials are urgently needed in order to confirm a favourable efficacy and safety profile cortegiani ingoglia ippolito giarratano  einav 2020 on the other hand a further literature review gbinigie  frie 2020 showed that there is limited evidence of in vitro activity of both drugs against sarscov2 while clinical data was derived from only two studies j chen et al 2020 gautret et al 2020 with small sample size overall 66 patients and methodological limitations with no data on medium or longterm followup in conclusion currently scientific evidence on the efficacy and safety of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in patients with covid19 are scarce highquality randomized clinical trials are strongly needed another drug able to reduce the cytokine storm is colchicine

used as an antimalarial drug but is also used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases due to its immunomodulatory activity 5previous studies have shown that chloroquine exerts antiviral effects through the following mechanisms
it can change the ph of acidic organelles 6 such as endosomes so inhibits infections such as borna disease virus 7 avian leukemia virus 8 and zika virus 9it can change the glycosylation pattern of the hiv virus gp120 envelope which inhibits the replication of hiv human immunodeficiency virus virus in cd4  t cells 10it can effectively inhibit autophagy in the lungs of avian influenza h5n1 mice and reduce the damage to the alveolar epithelium 11it inhibits viral replication by blocking the autophagy phenomenon induced by the zika virus and can cut off vertical infection of the zika virus from the maternal-fetal pathway 12multiple studies have found that chloroquine has anti-sars-cov activity
chloroquine can inhibit viral replication by reducing the terminal glycosylation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 receptor on vero e6 cells and interfering with the binding of sars-cov to the ace2 receptor 13 14chloroquine inhibits the replication of hcov-229e and sars-cov both belong to the -group hcovs by inhibiting the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk in the l132 human embryonic-lung-cell line 15the spike protein s protein of sars-cov-2 is similar in structure to that of sars-cov and can bind to the ace2 receptor on the host-cell surface to infect the host epithelial cells 16remdesivir gs-5734 and chloroquine sigma-c6628 can effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 infection 17this study will compare the efficacy safety and impact on patient compliance between the chloroquine phosphate regimen with the lopinavirritonavir regimen in mildgeneral covid-19 infectionthis randomized controlled trial is to be conducted at the fifth affiliated hospital of sun yat-sen university the ninth peoples hospital of dongguan zhongshan second peoples hospital and jiangmen central hospitalthese hospitals are located in guangdong china the clinical research flowchart crf of the research process is shown in fig 1

affiliated hospital of sun yat-sen university zdwy2020 lunzi no k151randomized controlled studies still have some design limitations first the sample size we use is relatively small and the 28-day treatment period is short therefore we will not be able to estimate possible relapses of pneumonia after long-term treatment second the pathophysiology of novel coronavirus pneumonia has not been elucidated as only clinician assessment is used including lung computed tomography ct results and count of viral load there is no objective indicator to judge the effect of treatment on covid-19 infection finally the follow-up period in this study was relatively short in light of these limitations we will develop a more reasonable treatment cycle and follow-up period to explore the efficacy of chloroquine in patients with covid-19we also know that there will be many biases in the open trial and we have taken a number of measures to control the possible bias in the trial as follows1 strict exclusion criteria are formulated to effectively control other confounding factors that may affect the efficacy 2 the trial uses random grouping to ensure that the two groups of patients are comparable 3 before the patient signs the informed consent form the researchers and the patients make full communication to ensure that the patients understand the entire trial content and try to eliminate the impact of the patients psychological state on the trial effect 4 the main and secondary indicators for evaluating the efficacy are objective indicators to avoid the influence of subjective factors 5 before the start of the trial the researchers will conduct unified system training to ensure the uniformity and correctness of data collection and index evaluationthe trial was

fifth affiliated hospital of sun yat-sen university in zhuhai zdwy2020 lunzi no k151 unique protocol id zdwygrbk011 protocol version date 7 february 2020 the first participant was randomized in february 2020 and recruitment is ongoing it is estimated that the recruitment will be completed on 31 may 2020 the final results will be reported next yearthe prevalence of coexisting hypertension has been estimated to be in the 10-25 range amongst patients presenting with covid-1911 12 13 14 the coexisting conditions such as hypertension older age diabetes cardiovascular disease have all been reported to be more common in patients with severe covid-19 requiring intensive care14 15 16 17 the comorbidities including hypertension have also been significantly associated with adverse outcomes in covid-19 such as adult respiratory distress syndrome cardiovascular compromise and mortality14 15 16 17 18
since the comorbidity of hypertension has been associated with severe covid-19 and its consequences the question has emerged about the roles of raas inhibitors such as acei and arbs in the pathogenesis of severe covid-19 given that these raas inhibitors are common therapies for hypertension and that they may up-regulate the expression of ace2 the clinical concern has been formulated that therapy with these agents may increase the risk and severity of coronavirus infection19 20 21 22 there is currently insufficient evidence to address this question in a definitive fashion1

14 the published literature both in preclinical and clinical studies has conflicting results about the potential for harm with respect to the interactions between raas inhibitors and coronavirus 19 further trials will likely focus on the current evidence gaps related to this question in severe covid-19 including mechanisms the prevalence of raas inhibitors and careful correlation of this prevalence with clinical outcomes1

18 19
although hypertension and consequent exposure to acei and arbs are likely common in severe covid-19 this association does link to causality as outlined above23

24 there may also be confounding by association here in that patients with severe covid-19 are more likely to be hypertensive diabetic and older this comorbidity burden rather than the associated drug therapy may better explain the adverse outcomes in coronavirus infection17 18 19
in contrast animal studies have clearly documented that ace2 may have a protective role in acute lung injury related to coronavirus infection25

26 functional ace2 typically converts angiotensin ii to angiotensin 1-7 thereby reducing the adverse effects of angiotensin ii via the angiotensin type i receptor in the lung that lead to acute lung injury1

21 since therapy with acei andot arbs also reduces angiotensin ii levels it follows that these agents may also protect against acute lung injury in the setting of covid-191

21

27
the evidence for the benefits ace2 in coronavirus infection has prompted further investigations the exogenous administration of recombinant ace2 may not only bind circulating coronavirus to acute viral load but also could degrade angiotensin ii to down-regulate activation of the raas and protect against acute lung injury in covid-191

22

28 this fascinating dual function of ace2 has prompted a pilot clinical trial to evaluate recombinant ace2 in patients with covid-19 full details available at wwwclinicaltrialsgov with trial identifier nct04287686 last accessed march 31st 2020 the potential therapeutic effects of arbs in covid-19 have also triggered a set of clinical trials full details available at wwwclinicaltrialsgov with trial identifiers nct04312009 and nct04311177 last accessed march 31st 2020 furthermore there are clinical trials in progress investigating the effects of acei in patients with covid-19 full details available at wwwclinicaltrialsgov with trial identifiers nct04322786 and nct04318418 last accessed march 31st 2020 these trials will likely provide much needed evidence to guide therapy with raas inhibitors in patients throughout the clinical spectrum of covid-19patients with severe covid-19 may also develop vasoplegic shock with or without concomitant sepsis30 in the initial wave of covid-19 in seattle patients with cardiovascular compromise seldom had superinfection suggesting that the cardiovascular instability was mostly due to the consequences of viral infection6 furthermore in this patient cohort echocardiography also rarely identified ventricular dysfunction although myocarditis is a possibility in this disease30 this latest data from the pandemic in the united states suggests that vasoplegic shock from the effects of the coronavirus is a likely clinical presentation in severe covid-196
a possible etiology for this low systemic vascular tone in this clinical setting may be the disordered function of the raas1

21 the first possibility is that patients on acei and arbs may be at greater risk for vasoplegia in the setting of an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response akin to what we typically observe in perioperative cardiothoracic and vascular practice4

5 a second possibility is that the severe alveolar endothelial damage from adult respiratory distress syndrome may disrupt the function of angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 interfering with the hydrolysis of angiotensin i to form angiotensin ii1 2 3 the resulting deficiency of angiotensin ii leads to loss of systemic vascular tone2

3 furthermore the resulting excess of angiotensin i also aggravates vasoplegia through the enhanced production of nitric oxide and bradykinin2

3 the possibility therefore exists that vasoplegic shock in severe covid-19 may be due to dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with consequent angiotensin ii deficiency suggesting that exogenous administration of this vasopressor may have a unique role in this clinical scenario2
the status quo with respect to acei and arbs in covid-19 can be confusing to clinicians in the front lines of patient care during the pandemic given the possibilities for both benefit and harm14

15 this priority for clinical guidance during the coronavirus virus has prompted recent statements from multiple professional societies including the canadian cardiovascular society the european society of hypertension the international society of hypertension the european society of cardiology and american college of cardiology13

14 in summary the expert consensus from all these professional societies is that patients with covid-19 should continue their regular home blood antihypertensive regimen even if it includes acei and arbs14 in patients with covid-19 who develop shock the vasodilator regimen with raas inhibitors can be discontinued14
although not specifically addressed in these multiple professional guidelines the roles of rescue therapy for vasoplegic shock can also be considered in refractory cases including angiotensin ii2

4

5 furthermore in treatment-resistant cases of copvid-19 the mechanisms for cardiogenic shock and the supportive roles of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be entertained early as these considerations can often lead to therapeutic breakthroughs29 30 31
the spectrum of severe covid-19 includes significant disruption of the raas with significant implications for organ dysfunction vascular tone as well as therapy with acei and arbs although clinical trials are in progress to close the current evidence gaps the current expert consensus has recommended that in most cases existing therapy with acei and arbs be continued in the setting of circulatory shock these agents may be discontinued and early consideration of therapies for medical and mechanical rescue may be lifesaving the management of patients through this pandemic must also consider

trial was purposefully run within the asia-pacific region and specifically sought to engage low- and middle-income countries at the start of 2020 1480 of a total of 1587 patients had been recruited from 74 centers in 12 countries a total of 447 patients were enrolled in mainland china and 617 were from other asian sites the corresponding numbers of patients with covid-19 were 78497 and ranged from 0 to 1766 respectively fig 14 there is concern that true patient numbers are higher because of under-reporting5the rapid onset and escalation of the coronavirus epidemic triggered health systems and governments to respond quickly with public health concerns overriding standard practices however each jurisdiction enacted different restrictions making it challenging for trial oversight first it has been difficult to systematically gather information regarding restrictions at each site and how they affect trial conduct second there are no clear guidelines for trial management committees on their ethical obligations under these circumstances nor is there any guidance for investigators or trial participants third despite public safety being paramount the impact on clinical trials across all fields of medicine is potentially enormous so that rational measures to prevent throwing the baby out with the bathwater are vitalclinical trials will be affected in multiple ways and there may well be a different impact and response for academic studies usually on shoestring budgets compared with large well-resourced industry-sponsored trials interestingly there has been little formal information regarding the latter recruitment may be reduced or halted perhaps for a prolonged period this will extend trial timelines and deplete already limited budgets as running costs persist even during inactivity depending on stage the viability of the trial may be threatened at that site in that country or even in its entirety logistic consequences include disruption of drug supply and increased loss to follow-up because of lockdown travel restrictions or patient preference to avoid hospitals statistical considerations include the impact of treatment disruptions on endpoints including potential alteration of event rate including death from all causes higher rates of missing data and delay in routine surveillance of endpoints which could falsely increase disease-free survival rates human resources are affected by staff illness and quarantine diversion of duties cancellation or delay of research ethics and governance processes restriction of monitoring visits and cancellation of investigator meetings biospecimen collection protocols may be affected for this particular outbreak throat swab and saliva collections are being discouraged transport of tissues across international borders could be subject to even further stringenciesthe impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the ascolt trial has been significant the 10 chinese sites are located in guangdong beijing shandong zhejiang and jiangsu none in hubei the province where wuhan is situated since january 23 all sites have suspended recruitment from guangzhou one of the cities with the most patients with the virus outside of hubei province gc reports all clinical trials at my center have been halted since february due to the virus outbreak a total of 53 patients have been successfully recruited into the ascolt study and 19 of them are still taking the study drug all patients hospital visits are also halted instead we are using phone-call follow-up and fax-back of investigation reports6 patients need to get a new package of the study drug in february we decided to deliver the package by post expressa new icf informed consent form has been approved and signed by all patientsin hong kong the study center pharmacy stopped dispensing oral research treatments and trial visits are postponed in taiwan there are no restrictions on visits but personal hygiene measures and temperature checks for staff and patients are enforced in singapore screening and recruitment for all clinical trials was halted by the national cancer centre singapore hospital administration on february 10 outpatients receiving treatment can continue scheduled visits however investigators are reporting a high rate of nonattendance nonurgent appointments are discouraged and it was recommended that they be deferred daily updates are issued from the regional health cluster singhealth and ministry of healthmany ascolt investigators in affected countries have reported on the emotional strain of covid-19 in their workplace including sick and overworked team members one investigator sent a poem about volunteers i send my youngest baby to the battlefield this is likely to affect trials because much of the work involved is in addition to usual dutiesadaptations to facilitate the ongoing running of the ascolt trial have been pragmatic based on ad hoc consultation initiated by sites with the chief ascolt trial manager practical changes such as a switch to phone or local practitioner follow-up and mailing of medication kits have so far not been submitted to a central process of protocol amendment there is concern about imposing additional burden on strained health systems a trial management committee meeting is planned to endorse and standardize advice as well as to consider the overall impact on the trialclinical trials are fundamental for medical progress but their vulnerability to external forces is highlighted by the recent coronavirus outbreak although management of the epidemic is the highest priority for affected hospitals the impact on clinical trials which themselves may lead to a major reduction in death rates from a vast spectrum of diseases raises ethical issues with regard to the special duty of care owed to trial participants the global clinical trial community has been caught without contingencies and should now start a formal process of emergency planning to endorse processes that can be applied to future unforeseen circumstances a rational carefully adapted policy encompassing operational responses to such crises would be of great utility beyond the crisis reevaluating the dated model of repeated in-person visits at 1 site for trial participation should be encouraged capitalizing on major advances in communication technology and big data finally a reluctance to pursue trials particularly academic research in any particular region of the world for fear of epidemics would be perhaps one of the most disastrous outcomes of allalthough effective prevention and control measures had been taken a total of 8708008 confirmed cases of covid-19 cases have been reported worldwide resulting in 461715 deaths until june 21 2020 the outbreak of covid-19 not only severely threatened the health of people around the world but also had great impact on the global economy on january 30th the world health organization who declared the covid-19 outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concerndrugs are regarded as an essential way for preventing and controlling epidemic diseases however drug discovery is a time-cosuming sophisticated and costly process which can be always divided into several important stages including preclinical research clinical trials and additional review process an average of 15 years are requied for an experimental drug to travel from the lab to the patients hughes et al 2011 therefore it is difficult to have an immediate effect on the prevention and control of covid-19 by developing de novo drugs against sars-cov-2 new use of old drugs that is searching for clinically approved drugs that have antiviral activities against sars-cov-2 may be a feasible strategy in the fight against covid-19 alimuddin et al 2016 sachs et al 2017 since pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity are the main considerations that determin the successfulness of novel drug development candidates screened from the existing or licensed drugs in the laboratory could possiblely be translated into clinical use in a faster pace ferreira and andricopulo 2019 han and gifford 2003 pan et al 2018since the outbreak of covid-19 many research institutions have been using the above-mentioned strategy to screen candidate drugs which could inhibit sars-cov-2 or excess immune responses with their continued efforts drug candidats that display some clinical effects have been included in diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus pneumonia dtpncp released by national health commission of china the current review summarized the clinical use mechanism and efficacy of the drugs which are recommended in dtpncp but also the novel therapeutic agents which are now undergoing clinical trials approved by nmpa to evaluate the treatment for covid-19 in china reviewing these accumulated experience may provide insight into the epidemic control all over the worldthe pathogenesis of covid-19 has been revealed that the spike protein of sars-cov-2 including two functional subunits s1 and s2 promoted the binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and the entry into host cells gralinski and menachery 2020 richardson et al 2020 walls et al 2020 the s1 subunit served as the pathway of binding to the host cell receptor and s2 subunit played a role in the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes the spike protein of sars-cov was incorporated without cleavage in contrast the s1s2 site of sars-cov-2 with the unique existence of furin cleavage site was entirely subjected to cleavage during biosynthesis which makes sars-cov-2 virus more aggressive in pathogenicity compared with sars-cov yuki et al 2020 autopsy of covid-19 victims in china has confirmed the exitance of coronavirus particles in the cytoplasm of tracheal and bronchial mucosa epithelia and alveolar type ii pneumocytes under electron microscopy the autopsy has also shown injuries in multiple organs and tissues with prominent and extensive pulmonary lesions caused by sars-cov-2 this was considered as a pathological basis for the lethal respiratory disfunction apparent lesions in lymphatic and hematopoietic organs were also observed bian and team 2020 the body injury may also be associated with the induction of excessive immune responses resulting in self-attack and multiple organ damage zumla et al 2020 in a peripheral blood sample from an early case both cd4 and cd8 t cells were hyper activated which was considered to be responsible for the severe immune injury in this patient xu et al 2020blopinavirritonavir aluviakaletra developed by alberta is a human immunodeficiency virus hiv protease inhibitor which can enhance the antiretroviral activity against the virus by inhibiting cytochrome p450 cvetkovic and goa 2003 lopinavirritonavir was approved for the treatment against hiv infection in the united states in 2000 and was available in china in 2008during the epidemic of sars it was found that patients with sars treated with the combination of lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin had lower risk of the acute respiratory distress syndrome ards or death compared with those treated with ribavirin alone chu et al 2004 in the dtpncp trial version 2 released on january 22 it was declared that there was no existing drug against covid-19 at present and lopinavirritonavir could be tried for no more than 14 days in a study including 47 patients with covid-19 treatment with the combination of lopinavirritonavir and pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs showed a notable therapeutic effect in lowering the body temperature and restoring normal physiological mechanisms with no evident toxic and side effects compared with treatment of adjuvant drugs alone ye et al 2020 however a randomized controlled open-label trial conducted by bin cao et al observed no benefit with lopinavirritiomnavir treatment cao et al 2020 and trials in the mild covid-19 cases also showed similar results cheng et al 2020 morever lopinavirritonavir was found to be related to the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission causing a prolonged length of stay fan et al 2020chloroquine phosphate is mainly used as an antimalarial and anti-inflammatory agent for treatment of malaria and rheumatic diseases bijker et al 2013 previous studies have also found that it has broad-spectrum antiviral effects delvecchio et al 2016 mizui et al 2010 chloroquine can strongly bind to the nuclear protein and decrease the twist of the double helix of dna forming a complex and preventing the replication of dna or the transcription of rna in addition chloroquine can cause ph changes of endosomes and it is also an effective autophagy inhibitor which interferes with viral infection and replication by affecting autophagy schultz and gilman 1997 besides the antiviral activity chloroquines also have the immunomodulatory ability which may enhance its antiviral abilities in vivo apart from chloroquine phosphate hydroxychloroquine is also an antimalarial drug used in clinical setting which has the similar structure and mechanism to those of chloroquine but is less toxic ben-zvi et al 2012it was found that chloroquine phosphate could effectively inhibit the infection of sars-cov-2 at the cellular level 50 effective concentration ec50  113 m semi-cytotoxic concentration cc50  100 m and selection index si  8850 in a joint study wang et al 2020a as of may 23rd there are 22 ongoing clinical trials using chloroquine for the treatment of covid-19 in china cortegiani et al 2020 a multi-center prospective observational study in china including 197 cases showed that the clearance rate of viral rna in the chloroquine group was significantly higher and faster than that in the non-chloroquine group after 14 days 959 and 796 but the rate of adverse reactions showed no significant difference in the two groups huang et al 2020 however a recent randomized trial in brazil to evaluate effect of high and low-dose chloroquine diphosphate as adjunctive therapy for patients with sars-cov-2 infection suggested that high-dose chloroquine diphosphate was not recommended for the treatment of critically ill patients because of potential safety hazards borba et al 2020azithromycin together with hydroxychloroquine effectively reduced the viral carriage at d6 post-inclusion and led to a much lower average carrying duration compared with controls the potential effect of hydroxychloroquine against covid-19 may be reinforced by azithoromycin gautret et al 2020 however in a recent observational study of hydroxychloroquine in clinic from march 7th to april 8th no association between hydroxychloroquine and changed risk of the composite end point of intubation or death was found indicating that covid-19 may be unsensitive to hydroxychloroquine geleris et al 2020 generally existing evidence is not enough to further clarify recommendations for hydroxychloroquine treatment in patients with covid-19 more randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to provide convincible informationabidol is a non-nucleoside antiviral drug developed by the pharmaceutical chemistry research center of the former soviet union which shows the antiviral activity against many viruses kadam and wilson 2017 pcheur et al 2007 the main indication of abidol is the disease caused by influenza a and b viruses abidol specifically inhibits the contact adhesion and fusion of the viral lipid envelope and the host cell membrane and blocks viral genes from penetrating into the nucleus inhibiting the synthesis of viral dna or rna by activating 2-oligoadenylate synthetase antiviral protein in vivo abidol was first approved in russia in 1993 and is now mainly used in russia and china but has not been approved by western countriesabidol showed an efficient inhibitory ability against sars-cov-2 infection in vitro with the ec50 at 411 355473 m wang et al 2020b it was predicted in structural and molecular dynamics studies that arbidol may target the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein and block the trimerization of spike glycoprotein which is a key for host cell adhesion and hijacking vankadari 2020 a retrospective cohort study found that arbidol and lopinavirritonavir treatment showed more favorable clinical response in treating covid-19 deng et al 2020 also another retrospective study including 50 cases indicated that arbidol monotherapy may be superior to lopinavirritonavir in which no viral load was detected in arbidol group but the viral load was found in 15 441 patients treated with lopinavirritonavir after 14 days zhu et al 2020ribavirin a purine nucleoside analog is a broad-spectrum nucleoside antiviral drug during the epidemic of sars and mers it has been widely adopted in clinical setting but its efficacy is still controversial chunxiao yang et al 2020 ribavirin is metabolized intracellularly into 5-phosphate derivatives that directly or indirectly inhibit viral replication and is rapidly excreted in the human body as a prototype or as a derived glycosylation product gilbert and knight 1986 it is mainly used for severe hospitalized patients with bronchiolitis and pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus rsv the patients with lassa fever or epidemic hemorrhagic fever with manifestations of the renal syndrome and those with chronic hepatitis c and viral upper respiratory tract infection zehua zhang et al 2020because of the direct antiviral activity of ribavirin against sars-cov-2 its usage has been considered as dosage guidelines for testing new therapeutic concepts khalili et al 2020 molecular docking results showed that the potential target of ribavirin was rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp of sars-cov-2 elfiky 2020 it was recommended that ribavirin should be used in combination with alpha-interferon or lopinavirritonavir 500 mg per adult 2 to 3 times per day and be given by intravenous infusion and the course of treatment should not exceed ten days zehua zhang et al 2020glucocorticoids are not only the most important hormones regulating stress response but also the most widely used and effective anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant agent in clinic allan et al 1984 glucocorticoids are fat-soluble hormones that pass through the cell membrane and bind to glucocorticoid receptor gr gr is a macromolecular complex of 90 kda which is composed of heat shock protein hsp90 and p59 protein hsp90 dissociates from the complex and the activated gcs-gr complex rapidly enters the nucleus binds to the glucocorticoid response components on the target gene promoter in the form of a dimer and thus to promotes or inhibits the transcription of the target gene and finally produces pharmacological effects or side effects by regulating the gene products wilckens and rijk 1997 in addition gcs-gr complex interacts with other transcription factors such as nf-b to inhibit the expression of inflammatory genes and directly influence the gene regulation and anti-inflammation rhen and cidlowski 2005 schcke et al 2002 in emergency or critical cases glucocorticoid is often the first choice for the treatment for primary or secondary pituitary adrenocortical dysfunction mainly combined with physiological dose of hydrocortisone or cortisone as a supplementary or replacement therapythe common clinical glucocorticoids are prednisone methylprednisone betamethasone beclomethasone propionate prednisone prednisolone hydrocortisone and dexamethasone etc glucocorticoids had been used to treat sars and mers resulting in lower mortality and shorter hospitalization stay and were not associated with significant secondary lower respiratory infection and other complications however more evidence is needed either for supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in patients with sars-cov-2 infection qin et al 2020 a phase ii and iii clinical trial of methylprednisolone for treatment of covid-19 were carried out in china nct04244591 but no results were reported yet in a study including 66 patients recovered after treatment a remarkable lasting of viral rna detection in oropharyngeal swabs and feces from covid-19 patients treated with corticosteroid was reported ling yun et al 2020 which might be the reason why who does not recommend glucocorticoids for covid-19 treatment unless absolutely requiredifn is a cytokine secreted by mammalian hosts during resistance to pathogens which can interfere with virus replication and enhance the antiviral ability of cells c e 2001 it is known that ifn can be divided into three types type i type ii and type iii chen et al 2020 type i ifn ifn- ifn- is also called viral ifn ifn- inhibits both rna and dna viruses but does not directly kill them c e 2001 ifn- can inhibit viral gene and protein synthesis by activating signaling pathways thus activates a variety of immune cells and improves the immunity while ifn- takes effect by inhibiting the adsorption of certain viruses enhancing phagocytosis of natural killer cells and mononuclear macrophages to viruses thus indirectly conducting the secretion of antiviral proteins in cells liu et al 2011 montoya et al 2002ifn- can effectively inhibit the replication of mers-cov and sars-cov in vitro or in animal models and it has been used in combination with other antiviral drugs such as ribavirin to treat patients with sars-cov and mers-cov omrani et al 2014 an open-label randomized phase ii trial concluded that triple antiviral therapy with ifn -1b lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin was safe and superior to lopinavirritonavir alone in shortening virus shedding and alleviating symptoms of covid-19 patients hung et al 2020 it was also stated that inhaled ifn- can be used as a trial treatment against covid-19 in the dtpncpthe analysis of the peripheral blood samples of severe covid-19 patients indicated that severe lung injury caused by sars-cov-2 was associated with the levated pro-inflammatory cytokine responses pathogenic t-cells are rapidly activated by viruses and produce cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf and interleukin 6 il-6 which are two key inflammatory factors the progressive increase of il-6 has been regarded as a clinical warning indicator of disease

action similar to that of favipiravir tchesnokov et al 2019 the structure of rdrp-remdesivir complex indicates that the partial double-stranded rna template is inserted into the central channel of rdrp where remdesivir is covalently incorporated into the primer strand at the first replicated base pair thus terminating the chain elongation yin et al 2020 once incorporated at position i the inhibitor causes rna synthesis arrest at position i3 gordon et al 2020 in addition the importance of the balance between incorporation and excision properties of nucleoside analogues between the rdrp and exonuclease also received increasing attention shannon et al 2020 in general remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral candidate drug with the potential against many viruses agostini et al 2018 de wit et al 2020on january 31st the clinical symptoms of a patient infected with sars-cov-2 in the united states were significantly improved after treatment with remdesivir and the oxygen saturation

nct04257656 was conducted in china the results showed that the use of remdesivir was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement yet patients receiving remdesivir had a significantly faster clinical improvement with symptom duration of 10 days or less and the adverse events were reported in 66 compared to 64 of the placebo group wang et al 2020c morever the results of a phase trial revealed by gilead suggested that remdesivir had a better effect in the 10-day group remdesivir was also found to have a synergy effect with emetine and remdesivir at 625 m in combination with emetine at 0195 m may achieve 649 inhibition in viral yield choy et al 2020 based on these clinical findings usfda has made remdesivir available under an emergency-use authorization for the treatment of adults and children with severe covid-19 disease hendaus 2020 though remdesivir was considered as a promising option for covid-19 its safety and effect in humans still requires more evidence from additionalclinical trials li et al 2020sivelestat sodium is the first drug to treat acute lung injury caused by systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs developed by ono company in japan it was licensed in japan in april 2002 the low molecular weight enables sivelestat sodium to reach the gap between neutrophils and tissues and its enzyme inhibitory activity is not affected by reactive oxygen species which can effectively inhibit neutrophil elastase in the local site of inflammation aikawa and kawasaki 2014 sivelestat sodium can improve respiratory function shortens the time of using respirator reduces the complication rate of stress injury and respiratory infection caused by respirator installation and improves acute lung injury caused by sirs and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis iwata et al 2010as early as mid-may 2003 nmpa approved the clinical study of sivelestat sodium for the treatment of acute lung injury caused by sars although the phase iii clinical trial of sivelestat sodium was completed in 2013 it has not been licensed in china aikawas research on the safety of sivelestat sodium in treating the acute lung injury showed no negative effect in the long-term treatment on march 12th sivelestat sodium was approved by nmpa cyhs2000102 for the acute lung injury with sirs and ards caused by covid-19abundant studies on acute lung injury caused by highly pathogenic viruses such as influenza a virus and coronavirus have found that overactivation of complement especially c5a may be the central event in that processwang et al 2015 therefore c5a is highly valued as a rational target for the treatment of highly pathogenic virus-mediated acute lung injurybdb-001 is a monoclonal antibody targeting human c5a developed in china it can control the further development of inflammation without inhibiting immune function barratt-due et al 2013 it is expected to prevent the exacerbation of pneumonia in coronavirus infection and further reduce the incidence of severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome bdb-001 injection has been approved by nmpa and is about to enter a phase 1-b clinical trial for the treatment of covid-19based on several preclinical studies mesenchymal stem cell msc which has the characteristics of low immunogenicity and secretion of soluble factors to regulate immune response plays an important role in attenuating underlying acute lung injury monsel et al 2016 some induced pluripotent stem cells may serve as suitable infection models for drug screening ex vivo zhou et al 2020 in addition based on the similar pathogenesis and symptoms of h7n9 and covid-19 msc transplantation may be a way to improve the symptoms of severe patients with covid-19 j chen et al 2020several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the safety and effciacy of msc therapy for covid-19 studies showed that ace2- mscs could be beneficial for the patients with covid-19 pneumonia leng et al 2020 zhao 2020 due to the fact that castem human embryonic stem cell-derived m cells significantly improved the survival rate in ards mice model castem has been approved by nmpa to evaluate the safety and efficacy for severe covid-19 associated withwithout ards golchin et al 2020 kaviyarasi renu et al 2020most of the promising drugs described above are small molecule drugs but biological products with specific targeting abilities and less side effects are gradually attracting interests the mechanisms underlying the therapies for covid-19 that have been approved for clinical use or are being evaluated in clinical trials include blocking viral replication regulation of immune function reducing inflammatory response and alleviating lung injurytable 1
 interfering with the normal replication of genetic material and blocking the formation of viral coat protein granules are two main strategies to block the viral replication reducing inflammatory response and alleviating injury can be achieved by inhibiting inflammatory factors or blocking the migration and other active responses of granulocytes while new use of old drugs is the most ideal strategy to identify effective drugs that can be translated to the clinical use immediately further clinical trials of old drugs to treat covid-19 are required since these drugs are not specifically developed based on the pathogenic mechanism of covid-19 in addition the strategy of new use of old drugs is not supposed to be a permanent solution for drug discovery to fight covid-19 rational drug design based on the pathomechanism of covid-19 and target protein structure of sars-cov-2 is suggested for discovering novel drugs against covid-19

coronaviruses are a form of positivestrand nonsegmented rna viruses distributed among birds mammals and humans that cause respiratory and neurological illnesses
1
 there are six different types that can cause disease among humans four of these hku1 229e nl63 and oc43 cause only the common cold in patients
2
 while two others cause severe acute respiratory syndrome sarscoronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov
3
 sarscov caused severe respiratory illness in china during its outbreak in 20022003
4
 while the merscov outbreak started in the middle east in 2012
5
 due to the broad genetic variation and diversity of coronaviruses and higher chances of animal to human spread they are likely to emerge periodically in future
6

during december 2019 an outbreak of pneumonialike symptoms occurred in patients that were linked to the seafood market in wuhan china
7
 investigation identified a new strain of coronavirus called sarscov2
8

the detection of this novel coronavirus is key to confirm the cases and proceed to treatment in an early method for detecting sarscov2 the samples from bronchoalveolarlavage fluids were collected centrifuged to remove debris and inoculated onto human epithelial cells of airway origin
9
 about 20 000 sequences from each sample were obtained and genome matches showed more than 85 identity with sarslike betacornavirus results were also obtained from realtime pcr and isolated viruses were named sarscov2
8
 to further characterize sarscov2 the denovo sequence was obtained by using nanopore sequencing and illumina methods the airway epithelial cell cultures were suitable for visualization and identification of the novel coronavirus
9

the nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin favipiravir galidesivir and remdesivir target rna polymerase and block the synthesis of viral rna
10
 favipiravir was effectively used against influenza and has the potential to inhibit viral rna synthesis and a new study also supports its activity against sarscov2
11
 different clinical trials are underway where patients are being recruited to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of favipiravir and interferon
12
 and a combination of favipiravir and baloxavir marboxil is being evaluated
13
 ribavirin is a guanine derivative antiviral drug approved for the treatment of hcv and rsv but it causes anemia at higher doses that limit its use and its efficacy against coronavirus is uncertain
14

remdesivir is an adenine derivative antiviral drug it has activity against a variety of viral strains such as sars and mers and a recent study also supports its activity against sarscov2
11
 a recent patient in us with sarscov2 has shown recovery with intravenous administration of remdesivir
15
 recently phaseiii clinical trials have been started in usa to evaluate the efficacy of iv remdesivir as 200 mg od or 100 mg od for 9 days
16
 a recent rct apparently reported no significant efficacy but we await the published findingssome protease inhibitors like lopinavirand ritonavir have shown activity against sars and mers coronaviruses
17
 
18
 clinical trials have been started to test the efficacy of lopinavir and ritonavir combination against sarscov2 these drugs are known to inhibit the chymotrypsinlike protease of mers and sars coronaviruses
19
 a study in vitro using vero e6 cells infected with sarscov2 assessed efficacy of different therapies by quantitative analysis using pcr qrtpcr remdesivir and chloroquine showed promising results remdesivir has previously shown efficacy against mers coronavirus and ebola virus and is currently under clinical trial for treatment of ebola the results showed that ec90 value of remdesivir against sarscov2 was 176 m
15

neuraminidase inhibitors are recognized antiviral agents for the treatment of influenza the treatment with oral oseltamivir has been given to suspected patients in china in past oseltamivir has shown efficacy against merscov
20

small molecular weight drugs such as chloroquine have shown inhibitory effects against sarscov2 ec50  114 m in vero e6 cells and is under evaluation in openlabel trials
15
 chloroquine cq is a recognized antimalarial drug but also has antiviral activity the antiviral activity of chloroquine was first noticed in the late 1960s
21
 chloroquine and its analog hydroxychloroquine both have inhibitory effects against various viruses including sars
22
 enterovirus
23
 and zika virus
24
 chloroquine inhibits the virus by increasing endosomal ph and so reducing viral cell fusion and also interferes with cellular receptor glycosylation
25
 the ec90 value of chloroquine against sarscov2 is 690 m that can be achieved with administration of 500 mg dose
26
 remdesivir and chloroquine have shown activity in in vitro studies and can easily be tested in patients with sarscov2
15

in another recent study gao et al found that chloroquine phosphate reduced the symptoms of pneumonia in sarscov2 patients and shortening the duration of disease
27
 the guidelines for the treatment of sarscov2 were revised six times since its issuance on 15 january 2020 the recent guidelines also include ifn remdesivir ribavirin ritonavir and chloroquine the mode of administration of ifn is through inhalation at a dose of 5 million units diluted with water for injection the dose of ritonavir is 100 mg bd for adults ribavirin may be given in combination with ifn or ritonavir at a dose of 500 mg bd or tds chloroquine phosphate should be administered at a dose of 500 mg bd arbidol can be given three times a day at 200 mg
28

hydroxychloroquine hcq is an approved diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug that also has immunomodulatory effects and prevents organ damage
29
 hcq alters endosomal ph and interrupts the biding between rnadna and tolllike receptors that leads to suppression of tlr signaling
30
 
31
 
32
 inside the cytoplasm hcq also interferes with the interaction between nucleic acid sensor cyclic gmp and cytosolic dna
33
 these two mechanisms lead to increase production of il1 tnf and type1 interferon such mechanism supports the idea that hcq suppress the cytokine release storm crs which is due to sarscov2 triggered overreaction of immune system
34
 in a recent study hcq was found to be more effective than chloroquine a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily and maintenance dose of 200 mg twice a day is recommended for sarscov2 infection
35

the mechanism involves in antiviral role of hcq and cq is inhibition of receptor binding and fusion of cell membrane these two are crucial steps that are required for cell entry of sarscov2 chloroquine interferes with the glycosylation of ace2 angiotensinconverting enzyme receptors receptors that are considered as cellular receptors for sarscov2 and block the fusion of sarscov2 with host cell thus the binding of virus is blocked and infection is prevented the hcq and cq after entry into the cell tend to concentrate in lysosomes and endosomes the sarscov2 use endosome as a tool for cellular entry hcq and cq increase the ph of endosomes and create a negative influence on the binding of sarsc0v2 with endosomes
25
 lysosomal protease helps in viral fusion with cell membrane increase lysosomal ph prevents the action of protease and fusion and replication of virus is blocked
36
  the mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is represented as figure 1cinanserin is an antagonist of serotonin receptors it can inhibit chymotrypsinlike 3clike protease and has shown promising results against sars coronavirus
37
 the 3cprotease was also investigated to be encoded in sarscov2
38

flavonoids such as chalcones flavones and isoflavones produce antioxidant effects but they also have antiviral effects
39
 a study has found that flavonoids can inhibit the entry of hepatitisc virus
40
 some flavonoids have activity against mers coronavirus presumably due to inhibition of 3clike protease
41

pirfenidone is under clinical trial for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis resulting from sarscov2 infection it also has an antiinflammatory effect and serves as an antioxidant the results obtained during sars 2003 were promising and now beneficial effects could be obtained in patients with severe pneumonia from sarscov2
42

nitric oxide no is a biological gas produced from arginine no after reaction with superoxide forms peroxynitrite which has cytotoxic bactericidal action
43
 nitric oxide is also known to regulate airway function and reduce inflammation of airways
44
 the beneficial effect of no in sars patients was observed in some studies
45
 no can also inhibit the synthesis of rna and viral protein
46
 a study has found that organic nitric oxide could inhibit the replication cycle of sarscov2
47

lphalipoic acid ala is used in hepatic disorders and polyneuropathies
48
 ala is an antioxidant that protects cells against oxidative stress by increasing the glutathione level
49
 it was reported that individual oxidative stress plays a role in coronavirus infection and g6llpd deficiency was a crucial factor in sarscov2 patients
50
 so ala could be an option to decrease the oxidative stress in patients with sarscov2 infectionmucroporinm1 is a peptide derived from scorpion venom with broad spectrum antiviral activity against various infections like influenza h5n1 and sarscov
51

the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of sarscov2 is also under consideration with varying hope regarding efficacy the pros of using plasma from recovered patients include easy availability and it can also be used as prophylactically in healthcare professionals who are at high risk of exposure to sarscov2 infection the cons include that not all recovered patients have enough antibodies lack of availability of validated sarscov2 assay for detection of neutralizing antibodies may cause hindrance in identification of suitable donor
52
 a large scale randomized clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of convalescent plasma
53

some studies support the role of angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors this is based on the hypothesis that ace2 serves as receptor for sarscov2
54
 
55
 so ace inhibitor could potentially compete for site binding and reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with sarscov2
56

the various ongoing clinical trials are summarized in table 1the fusion of coronavirus with a cell occurs after biding of s protein to a target receptor delivers viral nucleocapsid and initiates replication the s protein causes syncytial formation at the receptor site
85
 a neutralizing antibody that can target the s protein on the surface of sarscov2 could also be an option to produce passive immunity in patients
86
 recent research on the genome of sarscov2 mn9089473 allows scientists to express the s protein as immunogen on the surface and explore options such as yeast libraries for generating antibodies that neutralize the virus

the authors have no conflict of interest in this manuscriptthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 that causes coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 has spread to over 200 countries as of april 2020 1 the ongoing pandemic has resulted in increasing pressure on hospitals and healthcare systems in general as resources are diverted or reallocated cancer centers around the world are preparing and adapting their delivery of care to patients with cancer 2 travel restrictions a more vulnerable population of immunosuppressed patients and potential drug supply chain interruptions all further complicate the ability to administer even standard therapies there have been harrowing first-hand accounts 3 and numerous guidelines and experiences on the impact of general cancer care during the pandemic 4 5clinical trials in oncology represent a fundamental component of modern practice providing the crucial evidence to evaluate the efficacy of new therapies however with limited resources the sars-cov-2 pandemic is inevitably impacting on research activities and conduct commonly start-up activities for new trials may be deferred and recruitment to existing trials suspended 6 resources may then be focused on continuing care for patients already enrolled on trials especially if they are benefiting from treatment which in itself poses numerous additional challenges as a consequence many regulatory bodies have issued guidance on managing trials during the pandemic this includes the fda 7 the european medicines agency 8 the united kingdom medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency 9 as well as singapores health sciences authority 10 these guidelines detail potential difficulties in adhering to protocol-defined study requirements and appropriate contingency measures with a view to maintaining patient safety and trial integrity nevertheless each trial and patient should be considered on a case-by-case basis accounting for differences in individual circumstances with regards to the appropriateness of implementing these measures furthermore close and regular consultation between investigators sponsors and institutional review boards is critical to ensure patient safety herein we discuss several important aspects in adapting the conduct of clinical trials during the covid-19 pandemic and how it may potentially shape the future direction for trials in oncologytravel bans quarantines and stay at home notices have been implemented to varying degrees both domestically and internationally throughout many regions of the world naturally this introduces limitations on patient visits for scheduled study assessments and procedures clinical trials also tend to be conducted at large tertiary referral centers meaning patients often travel from long distances for trials conducting remote study visits with telemedicine or video calls 11 and using patients local facilities for laboratory investigations and imaging are alternative approaches for regular study assessments careful attention to the appropriate accreditation of local laboratories and differences in reference ranges is critical close communication with patients ensuring procedures are performed promptly and as completely as possible is similarly important results must be reviewed and acted upon where necessary subsequent transfer of source of documents must be done within established timelines comprehensive telemedicine consultations to review adverse events and concomitant medications for patient safety should be conductedwhere patients are unable to attend trial sites to receive investigational product ip supply delivery directly to patient can be considered pharmacovigilance remains paramount ensuring the security accountability traceability and compliance to ip storage requirements to maintain patient privacy and data confidentiality delivery of ip direct from trial site to patients homes may be necessary and not from drug distributors or central depots clearly only oral therapies may be suitable for direct delivery of ip and steps should be taken to ensure blinded therapies are not compromised other important considerations include complete traceability of ip throughout the supply chain appropriate storage requirements both en route and at patients homes and documentation of all communication and instructionlimitations for sponsors in attending sites for monitoring visits is another aspect which may require adjustment centralized monitoring or remote monitoring is an option which may be implemented in cases of remote monitoring using virtual technologies patient privacy and data confidentiality must be maintained data may be reverified during later on-site visits although protocol noncompliance during covid-19 may increase substantially reporting requirements remain and serious breaches must be actioned appropriatelyin singapore imported covid-19 cases were initially detected in late january 12 travel restrictions were implemented initially for visitors from china and later followed by visitors from all other countries 13 the national cancer centre singapore is a leading global cancer center with over 200 ongoing clinical trials including one of the largest early-phase trials units in asia as a regional hub many patients on trials come from around the region including south east asian countries such as malaysia indonesia the philippines and vietnam as well as from china many patients have been affected by travel restrictions unable to make visits and travel to singapore telemedicine consultations and patients local laboratories and facilities for safety and efficacy assessments have been used successfully particularly for delivery of ip there has been increased complexity in navigating local regulatory requirements of different countries however a majority has been able to continue on oral therapiesthe duke university hospital in durham nc similarly conducts a large number of early- and late-phase clinical trials the pandemic has resulted in widespread changes to workflows and resource allocation as with many large academic institutions in the united states provisions have been made for telemedicine as video and telephone encounters have been introduced and are now eligible for reimbursement by payers some of the clinical assessments necessary for clinical trial patient can be performed via telemedicine however most clinical trials assessments require face to face encounters some studies have been considered nonessential and are thus on hold until further notice but patients their caregivers and clinicians are still keen to pursue therapeutic clinical trials many of these patients need to travel from areas considered high risk or hot zones and the decision to accept referrals for clinical trials has become more complex than usualas the covid-19 pandemic evolves and varying levels of travel restrictions may need to be in place for the foreseeable future the need to adapt to changing circumstances may continue close communication between trial sites sponsors and regulatory bodies is crucialundoubtedly covid-19 will have negative consequences on the development of many novel therapeutics with significant delays in trial recruitment and completion more broadly the economic impact of the pandemic may hamper the clinical trial ecosystem as a whole including stakeholders such as contract research organizations cro however could this provide a roadmap for more efficient and streamlined conduct of clinical trials in the futurewith the increasing role for precision oncology and biomarker-enriched trials in rare molecular subsets and the rapid development of other novel individualized therapies such as cell therapies there is a definite need for greater flexibility in the conduct of clinical trials 14 moreover regulatory approval of novel molecularly targeted drugs based on early-phase clinical trial data is increasing patients often live far from specialized centers creating extra burden on patients and caregivers and impacting trial recruitment 15 furthermore the burgeoning costs associated with conducting large randomized trials shows no signs of slowing down 16 a move toward a more decentralized clinical trial model fig 1 or satellite sites fig 2 could improve the adaptability of trials indeed there have been ongoing efforts in this space 17decentralized clinical trials represent a concept that data can be collected at remote locations and the method of data collection may also be virtual 18 this is in contrast to traditional clinical trials where data must be collected at the designated research facility and via intermediaries such as cros importantly decentralized trials do not compromise on study design or statistical consideration it refers predominantly to the locality and method of data collection accordingly protocol-specified procedures compliant with regulatory requirements may still be conducted the fdas increasing focus on real-world evidence rwe to generate evidence and data outside the tools and methods of traditional trial settings is recognition of the unharnessed potential to capture multiple data sources 19 rwe is not restricted to retrospective collection of data from routine delivery of care but also includes pragmatic clinical trials which can be conducted in the real world additional benefits may be to improve the generalizability or external validity of the evidence obtained from clinical trials without significant sacrifices in internal validity the use of remote completion of study procedures and visits may improve patient recruitment retention and engagement finally other virtual digital health tools may also be incorporated including mobile applications wearable technologies and digital biomarkers to facilitate the decentralized model 20there are of course barriers and challenges to decentralized clinical trial models there is potentially greater reliance on data security and increased complexity in supply chain logistics 21 additional training insurance and indemnity considerations and management of adverse events and serious adverse events must be considered 22 oral therapies are more suited compared with parenteral therapies for trials in unselected populations of common tumor types in which patient recruitment is less difficult it may not prove cost-effective similarly early-phase studies with intense and specialized pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic sample collection requirements may not be well suited however hybrid models incorporating decentralized components may still improve efficiency for rare cancers or rare molecular subsets current trial models may not be practical in the long term ultimately key to decentralized clinical trials is maintaining the quality and integrity of data which can be collected remotely away from the primary study siteduring the sars-cov-2 pandemic controversy surrounding the drug development path for potential antivirals has taken center stage in the mainstream media with fundamental questions arising about appropriate checks and balances we have previously argued that drug development strategies and the availability of new agents for rare cancers are at risk of stalling owing to the ever-increasing complexity and costs of clinical trials and that finding solutions to these problems is imperative to the future of cancer care 23 a greater degree of risk sharing is needed than is currently accepted to enable the use of new methods with confidence and to keep pace with scientific advancement perhaps due to the sars-cov-2 pandemic the publics new focus on such issues may accelerate such reform the sars-cov-2 pandemic has necessitated adaptation in conducting oncology clinical trials which may need to continue for a while to come a potential silver lining to the sars-cov-2 pandemic could be demonstrating the feasibility of more efficient and cost-effective methods of conducting clinical trials without compromising ethical conduct safety and data integritydm ashley is an employeepaid consultant for istari oncology oblato and

interest were disclosed by the other authorbeginning in december 2019 a novel coronavirus disease covid-19 also referred to as sars-cov-2 has caused an international outbreak of acute respiratory illness the rapid spread of covid-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the world health organization on 11 march 2020 1 this pandemic has affected at least 177 countries with approximately 154000 fatalities 2 currently there are no specific therapeutic agents for this disease due to its broad clinical spectrumin the past herbal medicine has played an important role in controlling infectious diseases clinical evidence from a range of studies of herbal medicine in the treatment of sars coronavirus sars-cov has shown significant results and supported the idea that herbal medicine has a beneficial effect in the treatment and prevention of epidemic diseases 3 a cochrane systematic review reported that herbal medicine combined with western medicine may improve symptoms and quality of life in sars-cov patients 4 a recently conducted meta-analysis also concluded that herbal medicine could reduce the infection rate of h1n1 influenza 5inspired by previous experience herbal medicine is considered one of the alternative approaches in the treatment of covid-19 in china the national health commission has declared the use of herbal medicine combined with western medicine as a treatment for covid-19 and has issued many guidelines on herbal medicine-related therapy 6 to date there is much clinical evidence that reports favorable effects of the usage of herbal medicine in the treatment of covid-19 7 several systematic reviews that included evidence from case reports case series and observational studies have also been conducted to study the effectiveness of herbal medicine in the treatment of covid-19 8910 however in the hierarchy of systematic reviews reviews of randomized control trials rcts offer the highest level of evidence thus in this review we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events of herbal medicines in the treatment of covid-19 based only on currently available rctsthis review was conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelines 11 the protocol of this review was previously registered with the research registry unique identifying number researchregistry872a systematic literature search was then performed by two authors by searching the following electronic bibliographic databasesenglish databases pubmed embase allied and complementary medicine database amed and

were included placebo groups were also eligible for comparison groups comparator groups that involve different types of herbal medicine or herbal medicine of the same type with different dosages were excludedthe primary outcomes comprised the total effective rate the symptom score and symptom disappearance rate both effective rate and the symptom score were evaluated according to the guideline of clinical new drug research in chinese herbal medicine 12 the effective rate was defined as the number of patients whose total symptom score reduce greater than or equal to 30 percent after treatment the symptom score also referred as tcm syndrome score in this review was defined as the score of common tcm clinical symptoms which can be scored as 0 points no symptom 1 point mild 2 points moderate or 3 points severe additionally the core outcome set of clinical trials cos-covid was also assessed as primary outcomes in this review 13there were no restrictions on secondary outcomes any relevant clinical outcomes such as blood test results complete blood count duration of symptoms changes in chest ct scans quality of life using a validated instrument and adverse events were eligible for inclusion two review authors la and es independently searched the databases and assessed the eligibility of the studies after removing duplicates the full text versions of the potentially eligible studies were then obtained and screened based on the inclusion criteria any discrepancies in the suitability of a study for inclusion in this review were discussed with a third review author msl until a consensus was reachedsubsequently two independent review authors la and es extracted the data using a standard data extraction form the following information was extracted authors first name publication year country intervention model sample size patient age and sex duration and stage of the disease details of the interventions and controls regimens outcome measures study results and adverse events all disagreements between the two authors judgments were resolved with the third review author msl through discussion the authors of the included studies were contacted for unreported data or missing datatwo review authors la and es individually assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using the cochrane collaborations risk of bias assessment tool 14 the following six items were assessed the generation of a random sequence concealment of allocation blinding of participants and investigators incomplete outcome data selective outcome reporting and other possible biases the risk of bias of each item was categorized into low unclear or high risk the overall risk of bias of the included studies was also assessed any disagreements over the risk of bias in a particular study were resolved through the involvement of a third partyall data were analyzed using review manager revman version 53 software the nordic cochrane centre the cochrane collaboration copenhagen denmark the risk ratios rrs or odds ratios ors with 95 confidence intervals cis were calculated for dichotomous data eg symptom disappearance rate and effective rate while the mean differences mds with 95 cis were calculated for continuous data eg symptom scores as the variability between the included studies was taken into consideration the random-effects model was used to pool the data the heterogeneity levels of the eligible rcts were assessed using i2 statistics as there were only a few studies included in this review subgroup analysis was not performedthe database search identified 2027 studies as shown in figure 1 we screened the titles and abstracts of 1053 studies after removing duplicates and another 1042 articles were excluded because they were not rcts only 11 rcts were found and the full articles of studies were then retrieved based on our predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria four rcts were further excluded where one rct 15 included herbal medicine as a comparator intervention one rct studied on suspected cases of covid-19 16 and two rcts focused on the preventive effect 1718 a total of seven studies were hence included in this review 19202122232425 we did not find any further includable studies after reconducting all searches before the completion of this reviewthe characteristics of the included studies are presented in table 1 all rcts were conducted in mainland china four trials included patients in the mild or moderate stage of the disease and the other three trials included only patients in the mild moderate and severe stage of the disease in each trial respectively the sample size was 855 in total ranging from 42 to 295 with 472 55 male participants and 383 45 female participants mean age was 505 years ranging from 420 to 650 yearsall trials were parallel-design trials and applied combined therapy of herbal medicine with western medicine for covid-19 treatment herbal medicine intervention in the included trials were given orally which included chinese patent medicine lianhua qingke granules shufeng jiedu capsule jinhua qinggan granules toujie quwen granules and herbal decoction prescribed according to pattern identification as shown in supplementary table s1 the comparators of the trials only included western medicines types of western medicines included were as follows lopinavirritonavir arbidol hydrochloride tablets chloroquine phosphate tablets ambroxol hydrochloride tablets moxifloxacin tablets interferon-alfa injections and ribavirin injections no study compared monotherapy of herbal medicine to no treatment or monotherapy of western medicineoverall the risk of bias of the included studies was considered unclear five studies 1921232425 reported adequate random sequence generation but the other two studies 2022 did not describe the method of randomization except for two studies 2125 none of the studies provided information on allocation concealment the performance bias was unclear for four studies 20222324 as this information was not provided one study 21 was a single-blinded trial and the remaining two studies 1925 were open-label trials the risk of bias for incomplete outcome data was evaluated as low for all studies 19202122232425 on the grounds of having no dropouts in four studies 19202223 and of performing intention-to-treat analysis in three studies 212425 however the risk of selective reporting was unclear for all studies 19202122232425 as there was not enough information to reach judgment and there was no study protocol available for most studies one study 25 with study protocol was also assessed as unclear risk in reporting bias due to missing outcome data the risk of other biases was considered unclear for all studies 19202122232425 due to the small sample size short study duration and lack of information on sources of funding the summaries of the risk of bias assessment are illustrated in figure 21 total effective ratefour studies 20222324

events aesadverse events of the combined therapy of herbal medicine with western medicine were compared to those of western medicine in five studies 2021222324 two studies 2021 reported the occurrence of minor aes three studies 222324 reported no aes at all and two studies 1925 did not assess aes minor aes were equally distributed in one study 20 and more aes were observed in the combined therapy group in the other study 21 among these two studies one study 20 did not provide information on withdrawn cases and the other study 21 stated that there were eight cases of withdrawals due to aes the pooled effects of the five studies 2021222324 were not statistically significant n  756 risk difference 006 95 ci 004 to 015 p  024 figure 6 with high heterogeneity i2  95the systematic search revealed only seven rcts investigating the effectiveness of herbal medicine for covid-19 treatment in comparison to western medicine the meta-analysis showed significant effects of the combined therapy of herbal medicine with western medicine after intervention for the total effective rate the disappearance rate cough and sputum production tcm syndrome score cough fever dry and sore throat and fatigue and complete blood count white blood cell and lymphocyte counts lymphocyte percentage and level of procalcitonin and c-reactive proteinthe risk of bias of the included rcts was unclear in general resulting in a limitation in drawing a reliable conclusion on the effectiveness of herbal medicine in the treatment of covid-19 on the other hand no serious aes were reported minor aes were reported less often in the western medicine group than in the intervention group of the combined therapy of herbal medicine with western medicine nevertheless the aes stated in the included studies were not sufficient to provide a report on the adverse events of herbal medicine used to treat covid-19to conduct a more comprehensive systematic review in the future we searched for all ongoing rcts for possible inclusion in our review on the basis of our predefined criteria we found 32 ongoing rcts that were eligible for our future review we summarize the eligible studies on the herbal treatment of covid-19 which are still under clinical investigation in table 2in comparison to prior systematic reviews that included case reports case-control and cohort studies 8 reviewed only case reports and case series 10 and focused only on one type of herbal medicine 9 this review focused only on rcts investigating herbal medicine treatments in covid-19 patients thus we performed the first meta-analysis of rcts on herbal medicine interventions although the analysis could only be conducted on limited studiesfirst the small number of studies included in this review was our largest limitation due to the small number of included studies the studies that could be included in the meta-analysis are highly restricted the significance of the results may change with the inclusion of additional studies second the risk of bias assessment of the included studies was unclear many studies did not report on the generation of sequences concealment of allocation or blinding of participants and study investigators or provide alternative methods used to reduce potential performance bias as we included all the studies in our analysis the results of our analysis might have a certain degree of bias third clinical studies on covid-19 are still in their early stage overall as the outbreak is considered recent hence there are very few publications of rcts related to herbal medicine treatments and most publications are from mainland china this review may be considered less informative and the results of our review may be difficult to generalizethe summarized evidence in this review showed the potential of herbal medicine for treating covid-19 the combined therapy of herbal medicine with western medicine has shown significant results in increasing the effective rate and improving the symptoms disappearance rate tcm syndrome score and complete blood count compared to the effects of western medicine monotherapy the integration of both herbal and western medicine could be an alternative for reducing the duration of treatment and increasing the speed of recovery however we cannot provide a recommendation as the evidence of our review was obtained from limited studiesfurther rcts on herbal medicine for the treatment of covid-19 are still urgently needed this review provides existing evidence that might help to shape the design of future trials although doubleblinded trials may be difficult due to the nature of the disease study investigators should consider alternative strategies to minimize the risk of performance bias the trials could have also at least blinded the individuals who assessed the trial outcomes after incorporating these methodologic precautions study investigators should acknowledge the potential biases arising from the lack of blinding and address them appropriately in the limitations of their study in addition study investigators may also refer to developed core outcome sets such as cos-covid 13 for their outcome measures to avoid the waste of research resources regardless both study investigators and authors should ensure a strict methodology and proper reporting to reduce potential biases in trials evaluating the effectiveness of herbal medicine for the treatment of covid-19our results showed significant effects of the combined therapy of herbal medicine with western medicine on the effective rate and improvement of symptoms this reveals the potential role of herbal medicine in treating covid-19 more high-quality rcts are needed to further corroborate the effectiveness and adverse events of herbal medicine in the treatment of covid-19in wuhan china an outbreak of pneumonia of an unknown cause was reported in december 2019 in january 2020 a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-co v-2 was isolated from the patient samples 1 2 in february 2020 the infection was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 by the world health organization who since then covid-19 has rapidly spread to more than 200 countries which have experienced activity restriction economic stagnation and collapse of the healthcare system to varying degrees 3 the median incubation period in some patients is quite long 50 days confidence interval 44 to 56 days with the incubation period ranging from 2 to 14 days 4 5 while some patients show very mild symptoms and may even be asymptomatic the elderly and those with chronic diseases such as lung disease and diabetes mellitus often progress to a severe case of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and ultimately suffer multiple organ failure mof with a high-mortality rate 1 2 68 in addition very few existing anti-viral drugs have shown therapeutic effect for this virus these characteristics of covid-19 make it a challenging disease to control thus a multidirectional approach from prevention to treatment is warranted currently available drugs that can target the viral replication cycle have attracted attention for example the following three drugs have been considered for covid-19 camostat mesylate which inhibits protein-mediated fusion of the virus with cell membranes favipiravir which is an anti-viral drug targeting influenza viruses and remdesivir which is an anti-viral drug originally developed against ebola virus 9 thus drugs that not only target the replication cycle but also prevent and treat the cytokine storm observed in severe cases of covid-19 need to be discovered for the severe covid-19 cases with cytokine storms mesenchymal stem cells mscs and their exosomes are a potential treatment option 1012 in this review we discuss the therapeutic potential of mscs and their exosomes for severe covid-19 casesthe presentation of severe cases of covid-19 is currently under investigation it was reported that the median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 50 days to hospital admission was 70 days and to ards was 80 days 7 studies from china and the usa reported that 141 and 121 of patients with covid-19 were in severe condition at the time of admission in wuhan and new york respectively 13 14 lung images acquired by x-ray or computed tomography together with hematological and biochemical blood parameters such as elevation of neutrophil count d-dimer alanine aminotransferase total bilirubin lactate dehydrogenase ferritin and procalcitonin prolonged prothrombin time and decreases in lymphocyte counts and albumin have been reported in severe cases 2 15 16 during the process of aggravation virus-induced cytopathic effects and viral evasion of host immune responses are believed to dictate disease severity in a previous human coronavirus study it was reported that robust viral replication with delayed interferon ifn response causes aggressive infiltration of monocytesmacrophages and neutrophils and very high production of cytokines and chemokines 10 a study of subjects who died of middle east respiratory syndrome mers and sars suggests that an aberrant host immune response results in an inflammatory cytokine storm also called cytokine release syndrome crs macrophage activation syndrome mas or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shlh followed by ards and mof 10 17 a subject who died of severe covid-19 with cytokine storm showed tissue necrosis and interstitial macrophage and monocyte infiltration in the lungs heart and gastrointestinal mucosa in severe cases as discussed above severe lymphocytopenia with hyperactivated t cells and decreased numbers of regulatory t cells is commonly observed 1820 elevated cytokine and chemokine levels are being reported in covid-19 cases specifically the levels of ifn- interleukin il-1 2 4 6 8 10 and 17 induced protein 10 ip10 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor g-csf and tumor necrosis factor  tnf are significantly elevated in patients with severe covid-19 compared to non-severe cases 1 2 6 7 21 chen et al further reported that increased levels of the cytokines il-6 il-10 and tnf- lymphocytopenia of cd4 and cd8 t cells and decreased ifn- expression in cd4 t cells are associated with severe covid-19 16 these results suggest that a dysregulated immune response contributes to the aggravation of the disease of these cytokines and chemokines il-6 which is produced by pathogenic t cells and monocytes has attracted attention as a therapeutic target for severe cases of covid-19 xu et al reported that the therapeutic effect of tocilizumab a recombinant humanized anti-human il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody could improve patient outcomes without apparent adverse events including secondary infection 22 all of these results suggest that mscs which possess an immunomodulatory ability have the potential to be effective in decreasing or treating severe cases in addition to anti-viral drugsmscs were originally defined to fulfill the following three minimum criteria postulated by the international society for cellular therapy first mscs must be plastic-adherent when maintained under standard culture conditions second they must express cd105 cd73 and cd90 and lack the expression of cd45 cd34 cd14 or cd11b cd79a or cd19 and hla human leucocyte antigen-dr surface molecules third msc must differentiate into osteoblasts adipocytes and chondroblasts in vitro 23 these cells are relatively easy to expand maintain and cryopreserve while maintaining their viability mscs can be obtained not only from bone marrow but also from medical waste such as umbilical cord tissue adipose tissue amniotic tissue and dental pulp a recent study reported that mscs with different tissue origins have somewhat different characteristics 24 however overall mscs express low or modest levels of major histocompatibility complex mhc class i molecules and lack the expression of mhc class ii and co-stimulatory molecules such as cd40 cd80 and cd86 leading to their low immunogenicity this suggests that mscs can avoid immune responses in recipients thus autologous or allogeneic mscs have been used in clinical studies 2528 the main functions of mscs are determined by trophic factors including chemokines cytokines growth factors and exosomes watanabe et al reported in a mouse study that most mscs injected into the tail vein migrated to the lung with a small proportion migrating to the liver mscs exhibit anti-inflammatory anti-fibrotic and anti-oxidant effects and can promote angiogenesis 29 therefore they have been used in many fields to treat a variety of diseases such as neural heart liver intestinal and lung diseases among others according to clinicaltrialsgov more than 900 clinical trials involving mscs have been registered 27 in addition mscs have higher immunomodulatoryimmunosuppressive effects when the host inflammatory status is hyperactive 30 31 for example the allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cell-based agent temcell was approved for treating grade iii or iv acute graft-versus-host disease gvhd in japan 32 a variety of effects of msc therapy on immune cells including their ability to induce anti-inflammatory macrophages regulate t and b cells and regulatory dendritic cells and inactivate t cells have been reported thus mscs which can elicit multidirectional therapeutic effects can be theoretically appropriate for treating severe covid-19 cases 2931 33exosomes or small extracellular vesicles produced by mscs have recently attracted attention because they are thought to be important for msc activity exosomes are approximately 100-nm wide and are formed by the endosomal system of the cell they are enclosed by a lipid bilayer and are thus very stable and harbor molecules including proteins rnas lipids and metabolites in addition msc-derived exosomes possess hypoimmunogenic properties similar to mscs theoretically exosomes may also serve as an effective therapeutic option for various diseases exosomes are difficult to collect and enrich thus techniques to harvest them are currently being optimized in some studies exosomes have been shown not to be trapped in the lungs like mscs but instead migrate to the target organ thus they may be advantageous for therapeutic applications via aerosol inhalation 3439 fig 1a basic study using an influenza model and a clinical study on influenza a and covid-19 showed promising results with regard to the basic study on an influenza model loy et al reported the therapeutic efficacy of human umbilical cord tissue-derived mscs uc-mscs using a model of acute lung injury ali induced by the influenza a h5n1 virus they confirmed that uc-mscs were effective in restoring impaired alveolar fluid clearance and protein permeability of influenza a-infected alveolar epithelial cells they also confirmed that conditioned uc-msc medium and uc-msc exosomes have some therapeutic effects and only uc-mscs slightly improved the survival of influenza a-infected mice 40 in a clinical study on influenza using mscs chen et al enrolled 44 patients with h7n9-induced ards as a control group and 17 patients with h7n9-induced ards as the msc injection group they used allogeneic menstrual-blood-derived mscs from a healthy female donor age 2045 they reported that three patients were treated with three infusions of mscs at the early stage of h7n9 infection while the other six patients were treated with three infusions of mscs at the late stage of h7n9 infection and eight patients received four infusions of mscs at the late stage of h7n9 infection the injection dose of mscs was 1  106kg each time no msc-infusion-related acute toxicities or seriously adverse events were observed in any of these patients a multiple intravenous infusion of mscs was tolerated in these patients with moderate to severe h7n9-induced ards they also reported that msc transplantation significantly lowered the mortality of the subjects in the experimental group compared with that in the control group 176 died in the experimental group while 545 died in the control group 41 these results showed that mscs have therapeutic effects on ards and may have a similar effect on patients with covid-19 with regard to the clinical study on severe covid-19 cases leng et al reported that seven cases two common four severe and one critically severe case were treated with mscs they concluded that mscs significantly improved the functional outcome of all seven patients without any adverse effects the pulmonary function of these seven patients significantly improved 2 days after msc injection among them two subjects with common covid-19 and one subject with severe covid-19 recovered and were discharged 10 days after treatment 42 although the number of covid-19 patients who underwent msc treatment is very limited and there is a lack of studies elucidating the underlying mechanisms this study shows the potential application of msc therapy for severe covid-19 casesclinical trials using mscs and exosomes have already begun or are planned to describe recent trends in clinical trials using mscs we evaluated clinical studies reported on clinicaltrialsgov we searched the words covid mesenchymal or exosome and identified that 33 msc trials and one exosome trial have been registered as shown in additional file 1 table s1 of the 33 trials there were 10 303  from china 8 242 from the usa 4 121 from spain and 1 30 each from brazil uk jordan france denmark iran columbia germany turkey and canada thirteen trials 394 used uc-mscs 6 trials 182 used bone marrow-derived mscs five trials 151 used adipose tissue-derived mscs and two trials 61 used dental pulp-derived mscs twenty-six trials 788 used allogeneic mscs and one trials 30 used autologous mscs intravenous administration 15 injections was performed in all trials and the dose was approximately 1  106 cellskg almost all trials are phase i ii or iii studies one trial is phase iiiii a pilot study using msc-derived exosomes for treating severe covid-19 has been registered in china they plan to administer 20  108 nanovesicles five times by aerosol inhalation while basic studies using mscs and exosomes have not been sufficiently performed for covid-19 clinical studies using mscs and exosomes are in the planning stage or recently initiated additional file 1 table s1
to combat the covid-19 pandemic we must establish a multidirectional approach to reduce its prevalence for the prevention of aggravation and for the treatment of severe cases of covid-19 msc and exosome therapy may be a potential option however in parallel we need to perform further experiments to understand the underlying mechanism of action of sars-cov-2 in more detail and accordingly optimize msc therapy including parameters such as culture conditions and pre-conditioning to prepare for the prolonged covid-19 pandemic or other such pandemics we must explore novel approaches such as development of exosome therapy by using biologically active moleculesthere was no external funding involved in this researchthe authors have no conflicts of interest to declareethics approval was obtained for each of the trials as outlined in the original publicationsconsiderable economic losses may be incurred from neonatal diseases during calf rearing in 2006 8 of pre-weaned heifers and 2 of weaned heifers died primarily due to diarrhea and other gastrointestinal illnesses nahms 2010 similarly in pediatrics diarrhea is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 years in developing countries and is estimated to cause 3 million deaths annually bhutta et al 2000 hoque et al 2009 in 2004 based on numerous randomized clinical trials the world health organization recommended zinc supplementation of oral rehydration solutions to decrease the duration and severity of infant diarrhea bhutta et al 1999 faruque et al 1999 penny et al 1999 infants with diarrhea for more than 10 days had significantly lower serum zinc levels compared to healthy infants or infants with other non-gastrointestinal illnesses naveh et al 1982 suggesting gastrointestinal loss of zinc hoque et al 2009 zinc-supplemented ors also resulted in increased recovery rates reduced mortality and a reduction in use of antibiotics bhandari et al 2008 bhutta et al 2000 bhutta et al 1999 although the exact underlying mode of action of zinc is still not known hoque et al 2009 a mucosal-protective role enhanced cell-mediated immunity and modification of intra-luminal electrolyte secretion and absorption mechanisms have been proposed atia and buchman 2009 fischer walker et al 2009 hoque et al 2009 similar benefits of zinc-supplemented ors on diarrhea in calves could significantly impact the economics and sustainability of the production system by reducing antibiotic use for treatment of calf diarrhea zinc studies have demonstrated its beneficial effects in piglets and rats and on calf growth and fetal development graham et al 2010 graham et al 1984 owusu-asiedu et al 2003 however the therapeutic use of zinc in calves with diarrhea has not been studied a comparison of inorganic and organic formulations of zinc such as zinc oxide zo and zinc methionine met respectively is warranted because of differences in zinc bioavailability wedekind et al 1992 a greater effectiveness of an inorganic zinc formulation in treating calf diarrhea compared to an organic formulation may be evidence of zincs local intra-luminal mode of action given its poor absorption in the intestines absorption coefficient of zo  012 compared to 040 for zinc met cousins 1985 on the other hand if zinc met is found to be more effective than zo in treating diarrhea this may be evidence for a systemic mode of action given the greater bioavailability of zinc met compared to zo in addition because zinc is an antagonist of copper nrc 2001 a comprehensive assessment of trace minerals is necessary when administering zinc to calvesthe hypothesis of this block-randomized double-blind clinical trial is that neonatal holstein calves with diarrhea supplemented with either zinc met or zo will experience reduced days to recovery from diarrhea reduced mortality and reduced weight lost during the diarrhea episode compared to the placebo treated calves the objective of this clinical trial was to compare the effect of a daily dose of zo or zinc met equivalent to 80 mg of zinc or a placebo for a maximum of 14 days on fecal output and recovery in otherwise untreated 1 to 8 day-old holstein bull calves with neonatal diarrhea on a california calf ranch a secondary objective was to assess the effect of zinc met or zo on serum and liver zinc copper and iron concentrationsall procedures were approved by the university of california davis institutional animal care and use committee protocol number 16232 the clinical trial was conducted between june and september 2011 on a large california calf ranch in the san joaquin valley housing approximately 70000 holstein calves 40000 of which were of preweaning age calves enrolled included all male holsteins that developed diarrhea for the first time between 1 and 8 days of age calves were excluded from the study if they had a previous incident of diarrhea since birth or signs of disease other than diarrhea such as an umbilical abscess pneumonia or meningitis or if they were previously treated with antimicrobial drugs calves with diarrhea were identified by a veterinarian ag prior to enrollmentdue to lack of estimates in neonatal calves the sample size estimation was based on the difference between serum zinc levels of infants with and without diarrhea the increase in serum zinc levels post treatment in calves was assumed to be similar to that in infants naveh et al 1982 hence the sample size was calculated to detect a statistically significant difference in serum zinc concentrations in treated calves mean  sd 87  20 gdl and placebo calves 100  14 gdl with a power of 80 and level of significance of 5 a total of 22 calves per group were required allowing for a 15

 calves received a single daily oral dose of either 9969 mg of a zinc-free placebo electrolyte powder used to make ors group 1 38154 mg of zinc met equivalent to 80 mg of zinc group 2 or 9969 mg of zo equivalent to 80 mg of zinc group 3 dissolved in 2 l of a zinc-free ors solution the dose of 80 mg zinc per day was based on the ratio of human zinc nutrient requirement nhmrc 2005 to zinc supplementation of ors 167 bhandari et al 2008 bhutta et al 1999 patel et al 2009 this was verified to be less than the ratio in calves of recommended zinc intake nrc 2001 to toxic levels 1375 graham et al 1988 graham et al 1987bupon enrollment each calf was weighed kg salter brecknell ps-500 scale fairmont mn and received a complete physical examination as part of the physical examination the rectal temperature c fecal consistency and attitude were scored for each calf fecal output was scored by a single veterinarian ag after adapting fecal scores from the university of wisconsins calf health scoring chart httpwwwvetmedwiscedudmsfapmfapmtools8calfcalfhealthscoringchartpdf a fecal sample that was solid semi-formedloose or watery was assigned 1 2 or 3 respectively a decision was made to merge the original charts semi-formed and loose categories for consistency given the potential for difficulty distinguishing between both on the raised slatted wooden floors of calf hutches a similar simple scoring system for calf attitude was followed a calf with an attitude score of 1 was standing bright alert responsive and had a good suckle reflex a score 2 calf stood only after stimulation and had a moderate suckle reflex and a score 3 calf was recumbent did not stand with stimulation and had a weak or absent suckle reflex after enrollment fecal consistency and attitude for all trial calves were recorded every other day fecal and venous blood samples were collected at enrollment every other day thereafter and at exit from trial in addition a liver biopsy swanson et al

  008 power  723data collected from the current trial showed that a daily zinc dose of 80 mg did not result in zinc toxicosis or copper or iron deficiency the current trial results did not provide evidence for a beneficial effect of either zinc met or zo as a treatment for diarrhea in neonatal holstein calves this is in contrast to studies on infants that reported a significant reduction in diarrhea-associated mortality after oral zinc supplementation bhandari et al 2008 bhutta et al 2000 the difference in findings between the pediatric trials and our calf trial may be explained by the differences in pathogens or disease severity since pediatric research was conducted on diseased infants with more severe clinical signs and a greater risk of mortality compared to calves in our trial other explanations for the lack of significant differences among the treatment groups may be due to a sub-therapeutic zinc dose trial dose provided 80 mg of available zincday or a small sample size indeed estimates of power analyses from the current data show evidence of low sample sizeat exit calves treated with zinc met had significantly higher fecal and serum zinc concentrations compared to the placebo treated group however there were no significant differences in liver zinc concentrations at exit among the three treatment groups stratified analysis by duration of treatment 15 610 or 1114 days showed that calves on treatment for up to 10 days and supplemented with zinc met had significantly higher fecal zinc concentrations compared to the placebo treated calves but there were no differences in liver or serum zinc concentrations among the three groups data not shown total zinc was measured in feces mgkg dw and thus we are not able to differentiate between the different forms of zinc it is known that fecal excretion of zinc increases as the intake of zinc increases in humans so it is possible that zinc met was absorbed metabolized to other forms of zinc and then excreted via the intestine and bile cousins 1985 spencer et al 1985 this trend did not continue for calves treated for more than 10 days calves in the trial for more than 10 days and supplemented with zinc met had significantly higher serum and liver zinc concentrations than the placebo treated calves these findings are consistent with the increased bioavailability of zinc met compared to zo absorption coefficient of zinc met  040 compared to 012 for zo reported by cousins 1985it is known that the bovine fetus is completely dependent on the placenta during gestation for supply of essential trace elements hidiroglou and knipfel 1981 in addition liver zinc mean sem concentrations vary from 1110 193 mgkg dw during 120170 days of gestation to 716 385 mgkg dw during 221270 days of gestation abdelrahman and kincaid 1993 the zinc concentration of bovine colostrum and milk is 15 gml and 35 gml respectively in the current study all calves were fed formulated milk replacer containing 24 mgkg zinc dw the equivalent of 029 g zincml as fed abdelrahman and kincaid 1993 the national research council nrc daily zinc recommendation for calves is 40 mgkg of total diet there is a significant effect of age on liver zinc concentrations in calves in that the liver zinc concentrations decrease with time after birth puschner et al 2004a the low levels found in colostrum and milk replacer may reflect adequate tissue reserves of zinc in the bovine neonate abdelrahman and kincaid 1993 nrc 2001 thus if calves are born with adequate zinc stores in the liver and do not require much in the diet our trial dose of 80 mg of zincday was likely too low to have an effect at exit trial calves treated with zinc met had significantly higher fecal p
  001 and serum zinc p
  002 concentrations compared to the placebo group despite zinc met being more bioavailable it was excreted in the feces this further indicates that calves have adequate zinc body stores and our trial dose may have been too low to have an effectthe current trials zinc dose of 80 mgday in holstein calves aged 122 days did not result in zinc toxicosis it is known that clinical signs and death from zinc toxicosis can occur in pre-ruminant calves fed 700 g zincg mgkg diet for 30 days graham et al 1987a in previous studies where 338 day old male holstein calves were fed milk replacers containing 40 200 500 700 or 1000 mgkg of zinc weight gains dm intakes and feed efficiencies were reduced at the 700 and 1000 mgkg level jenkins and hidiroglou 1991 the calves in the current trial were being fed a formulated milk replacer made on the calf ranch that contained 24 mgkg zinc the addition of an additional 80 mg of zinc resulted in a total zinc level well below the toxic dose of 700 gg of zinc assuming they were fed 1 gallon or 379 kg of milk per day approximately total zinc intake level was 379 kg  24 mg  80 mg  891 mg previous research indicated that calves require anywhere from 9 to 14 mgkg of zinc in their total diet to maintain adequate plasma levels but that up to 40 mgkg of dietary zinc may be required according to the nrc herrick 1974 nrc 2001 thus the therapeutic dose is not known for this age of holstein calves and this information suggests that there may be a wide range among tolerance therapeutic and toxic levelsan important finding of the current study was that calves treated with either zinc met or zo did not experience clinical or laboratory evidence of zinc toxicity the mean sem liver zinc wet weight concentrations of the placebo zinc met and zo treated calves at exit were 1453 956 1791 1144 and 1376 723 mgkg respectively which are below reported mean liver zinc wet weight concentrations of 3457 161 mgkg in neonatal holstein calves with clinical signs of zinc toxicosis graham et al 1988 it has been reported in calves up to one year of age without clinical signs of zinc deficiency or toxicosis that acceptable liver zinc concentrations range from 49 to 117 mgkg wet weight puschner et al 2004a based on these data calves in our trial did not have liver zinc concentrations suggestive of zinc deficiency 2428 mgkg wet weight or toxicosis but it is possible that there is a wide range of liver zinc concentrations during the first three weeks of life from birth to weaning and from weaning to breeding agewhen supplementing zinc in the diet of calves interaction with other metals especially copper and iron must be considered graham et al 1988 there were 70 calves that had measurable liver copper concentrations at exit from the trial the mean sem liver copper wet weight concentrations for the placebo zinc met and zo treated calves were 1756 1056 1435 604 and 1101 620 mgkg respectively it has been reported that newborn calves without clinical signs of copper deficiency or toxicosis can be expected to have liver copper concentrations ranging from 62 to 125 mgkg wet weight or 190 to 380 mgkg dw puschner et al 2004b calves in the placebo zinc met and zo treatment groups had mean liver copper dw values higher than this range at exit indicating that the zinc supplementation did not cause a deficiency in liver copper concentrationsin the current trial calves treated with zinc met had a mean daily gain of 4024 g compared to a daily loss in the other two treatment groups the observations recorded from this trial do not prove that calves treated with zinc met tend to gain rather than lose weight but the direction of point estimates for weight change between groups is worth further investigation the sample size at the current study permitted a power of 199 to detect significant daily weight gain in the zinc met group compared to the placebo group as discussed earlier sample size determination for this study was based on a study in infants that detected a statistically significant difference between children with gastro-intestinal illness and healthy infants and infants with diseases other than diarrhea naveh et al 1982 this approach may be inappropriate for detecting a significant difference in neonatal holstein calves given our study findings the sample size needed to detect a statistically significant difference in mean daily weight change between the placebo group 6688 gday sd 29616 and the zinc met group 4024 gday sd 37453 given a power of 90 is 213 calves per group such a number can be easily attained on most dairy or calf ranches in californiaalthough the data collected did not prove a positive association between zo and clinical cure calves supplemented with zo had a higher hazard of a clinical cure compared to the placebo in addition the hazard for clinical cure in calves that tested positive for cryptosporidium spp or coronavirus at enrollment when treated with zo were greater than the respective hazards in calves treated with a placebo with respect to microbiological cure calves that tested positive for cryptosporidium spp at enrollment and treated with zinc met had 16 times higher odds of microbiological cure being pathogen test negative at exit than calves in the placebo group given the magnitude of the association or  16 and it is respective power estimate of 723 further studies are required to investigate the effect of zinc met on microbiological prevention and cure from cryptosporidiosis in dairy calves the lethal dose ld 50 for such zinc formulation for different age groups would need to be estimated through formal toxicity studies to guide the dairy industry in the use of an optimal dose for zinc therapeutic treatment in calf diarrhea to avoid accidental intoxicationthe current study results are limited by the finding of only clinically important differences between treatment groups which were not statistically significant furthermore the study was conducted on a large calf ranch in california which may differ in preweaned calf management on dairies important differences may include less variability in preweaned calf diets and more closely followed standard protocols for calf health monitoring and treatments despite such limitations results of the current double blind clinical trial show that there may be a positive impact of zinc on calf health management including decrease in use of antimicrobial drugsthis is the first randomized clinical trial testing the effect of a daily oral zinc supplementation in neonatal holstein calves with diarrhea data collected from the current trial did not provide evidence for a beneficial effect of daily oral 80 mg of zinc as either zinc met or zo treatment on days to recovery fecal consistency or microbiological and clinical cures in holstein calves with diarrhea a total daily dose of 80 mg of available zinc did not result in a zinc toxicity or mineral deficiency although statistically not significant the current trial identified clinically important differences in weight change during the course of diarrhea in calves and other potentially interesting contrasts between effect of organic versus inorganic zinc formulations on clinical and microbial cures in neonatal holstein calves which differed by pathogen

the city of wuhan china became the center of an outbreak of an unknown cause of pneumonia in december 2019 and raised intense global attention chinese scientists isolated a novel coronavirus from infected patients in wuhan by january 7 2020 this strain of coronavirus became formally known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 and also referred to as 2019-ncov the infection caused by this virus is known as coronavirus infectious disease-2019 covid-19 1 cases of covid-19 are no longer restricted to wuhan with the growing number of cases and expanding geographic distribution raising serious questions about the outbreaks future trajectory 2 3 the world health organization who called the outbreak of covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern pheic on january 30 2020 4 covid-19 cases had been recorded around the world including western pacific european southeast asia eastern mediterranean americas and african regions more than 220 countries registered cases of covid-19 with 1773084 confirmed cases and 111652 deaths worldwide according to the who report on april 13 2020 5as a result of the serious global health threat international health authorities efforts have concentrated on rapid detection and isolation of patients with covid-19 as well as the search for treatments capable of mitigating the diseases most serious consequences in the absence of a known effective treatment and because of the public health emergency the world is endangered by the risk of a sars-cov-2 pandemic according to the who 6 centers for disease control and prevention cdc 7 and the us food and drug administration fda 8 there is currently no proven effective drug or vaccine for the treatment or prevention of sars-cov-2 infection now the world is desperately searching for ways to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus and find effective therapies drug repositioning drug repurposing is the investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic purposes it is a line of scientific research aimed at developing safe and effective treatments for covid-19 9 therefore different clinical trials have been conducted to identify possible treatment options for covid-19 several existing antiviral drugs previously developed or used as treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers human immunodeficiency virus hiv and malaria are being investigated as treatments for covid-19 and some have moved into clinical trials conducted around the globe 10 according to the cdc two licensed drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and one investigational agent remdesivir are currently in use in the usa 11 however remdesivir is not approved by the fda for a covid-19 indication 12 on the other hand the china international exchange and promotive association for medical and health care cpam has released covid-19 guidelines and recommended the use of lopinavirritonavir tablets 400 mg100 mg orally twice daily or chloroquine 500 mg orally two times daily in critically ill older patients hydroxychloroquine orally 400 mg once daily is also recommended when chloroquine is unavailable 13the use of other drugs such as hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin 14 15 ribavirin 16 17 interferon 18 19 oseltamivir 20 favipiravir 21 sofosbuvir 22 ivermectin 23 ozone therapy 24 and tocilizumab 25 has not been recommended as first-line therapies however use of such drugs may be considered if treatment with first-line drugs chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and lopinavirritonavir is ineffective 13 these products have shown some effectiveness in laboratory and animal experiments but it is not possible to make an evidence-based recommendation on their use in covid-19 treatment unless a large human trial is conducted the name solidarity trial was given to such an effort by the who 26currently limited data from randomized clinical trials rcts are available to inform clinical guidance on the use dosing or duration of the aforementioned drugs for prophylaxis or treatment of sars-cov-2 infection 8 14 moreover the recommended anti covid-19 medications are likely to have adverse effects such as the risk of macular retinopathy 27 and cardiomyopathy due to chloroquine 28 and cardiotoxicity prolonged qt syndrome due to extended use of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin in hepatic renal and immunocompromised patients 11 29 additionally hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin has been reported to reduce the detection of sars-cov-2 rna in upper respiratory tract specimens compared to a non-randomized control group but did not assess clinical benefit 15 and in a recent randomized controlled open-clinical trial in china lopinavirritonavir did not show promise for the treatment of hospitalized patients with covid-19 and pneumonia 30therefore for the better safety of patients with covid-19 further clinical trials and large randomized controlled studies are needed to validate the effective role safety profile and adverse effects of all the test drugs 26 31 however any approvals for the use of a new drug of course require further clinical testing followed by the approval of widespread use by the relevant regulatory body for medical treatment in each country to accomplish this there is an urgent need for global collaboration access conditions for public funds and upfront agreements and affordability arrangements with those involved in the development of new medical technologies products for the prevention and treatment of covid-19 should be global public goods such a measure requires action at the global levelcovid-19 coronavirus disease-2019 is a public health emergency of international concern patients contracting the severe form of the disease constitute approximately 15 of the cases 1 as of this time there is no known specific effective proven pharmacological treatment in-vitro studies have suggested that chloroquine an immunomodulant drug traditionally used to treat malaria is effective in reducing viral replication in other infections including the sars-associated coronavirus cov and mers-cov 2 3 4chloroquine has been used worldwide for more than 70 years and it is part of the world health organization who model list of essential medicines it is also cheap and has an established clinical safety profile 3 however the efficacy and safety of chloroquine for treatment of sars-cov-2 the new virus causing covid-19 pneumonia remains unclearwe performed a systematic review of the pubmed and embase databases from inception to 1-march-2020 to find articles providing information on the efficacy and safety of chloroquine and chloroquine-related formulations in patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia and articles describing related in-vitro studies as much of the data on covid-19 are coming from asia no language restrictions were imposed see detailed search strategy in supplement 1 the search was expanded using a snowballing method applied to the references of retrieved papers we also searched the chinese clinical trial registry clinicatrialgov and the international clinical trials registry platform who ictrp to identify ongoing trials two authors ac mi independently screened the databases and the trial registries and extracted relevant information mi gi discrepancies and doubts about relevance of the sources were solved by consensus with two more authors ag se we did not register the systematic review protocol because we anticipated the very limited available evidence on the topic and due to the urgency of the matterthe initial search identified 234 sources 156 from pubmed 73 embase and 5 from other sources following screening of titles and abstracts and removing duplicates we evaluated eight articles in full text among these we found six relevant articles one narrative letter one research letter one editorial one expert consensus paper in chinese one national guideline document in dutch and one in italian 35 6 7 8 9 twenty-three trials were found in the trial registries table 1
the research letter written by a group of chinese researchers studied the effect of chloroquine in vitro using vero e6 cells infected by sars-cov-2 at a multiplicity of infection moi of 005 the study demonstrated that chloroquine was highly effective in reducing viral replication with an effective concentration ec90 of 690 m that can be easily achievable with standard dosing due to its favourable penetration in tissues including in the lung 6 the authors described that chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomial ph and by interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptor of sars-cov the authors also speculated on the possibility that the known immunomodulant effect of the drug may enhance the antiviral effect in vivo 6a narrative letter by chinese authors reported that a news briefing from the state council of china had indicated that chloroquine phosphate had demonstrated marked efficacy and acceptable safety in treating covid-19 associated pneumonia in multicentre clinical trials conducted in china 5 the authors also stated that these findings came from more than 100 patients included in the trials 5 we sought for evidence of such data in the trial registries we reviewed and found nonethe editorial written by french researchers underlined the in-vitro efficacy of chloroquine in other viral infections especially sars whose disappearance resulted in limited further research they also discussed the potentially favourable risk-benefit balance the high safety and the low expenditure of such treatment in the context of the current covid-19 outbreak 3 since cases were reported in 85 countries so far 5th march 2020 the low cost of chloroquine is a major benefit for both the highly stressed healthcare systems of involved high-income countries and the underfunded heathcare systems of middle- and low-income counties 10the expert consensus was published on 20th february by a multicentre collaboration group of the department of science and technology of guangdong province and health commission of guangdong province paper and related specifically to the use of chloroquine phosphate 7 no information was provided on the method used to achieve consensus 7 based on in vitro evidence and still unpublished clinical experience the panel recommended chloroquine phosphate tablet at a dose of 500 mg twice per day for 10 days for patients diagnosed as mild moderate and severe cases of sars-cov-2 pneumonia provided that there were no contraindications to the drug the panel recommended using several precautions including blood testing to rule out the development of anemia thrombocytopenia or leukopenia as well as serum electrolyte disturbances andor hepatic and renal function dysfunction also recommended were routine electrocardiography to rule out the development of qt interval prolongation or bradycardia and patient interviews to seek the appearance of visual andor mental disturbancedeterioration the panel recommended avoiding concurrent administration of other drugs known to prolong the qt interval ie chinolones macrolides ondansetron as well as various antiarrhythmic antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs 7the dutch center of disease control cdc in a public document on its website suggested to treat severe infections requiring admission to the hospital and oxygen therapy or admitted to the icu with chloroquine 8 however the document also stated that treating patients only with optimal supportive care is still a reasonable option due to lack of supportive evidence the suggested regimen in adults consists of 600 mg of chloroquine base 6 tablets a-cq 100 mg followed by 300 mg after 12 h on day 1 then 300 mg  2die per os on days 25 days this document also underlined 1 the needs for stopping the treatment at day 5 to reduce the risk of side effects considering the long half-life of the drug 30 h 2 the need to differentiate between regimens based on chloroquine phosphate and chloroquine base since 500 mg of the first correspond to 300 mg of the second 8another guideline document by the italian society of infectious and tropical disease lombardy section recommend the use of chlorochine 500 mg  2die or hydroxychloroquine 200 mg die for 10 days although the treatment may vary from 5 to 20 days according to clinical severity the suggested target population ranged from patients with mild respiratory symptoms and comorbidities to patients with severe respiratory failure 9our search also identified ongoing 23 trials all in china table 1 the trials varied in study design severity of the disease in the target population and in dosing and duration of the treatment indeed the trial registrations varied also in quality of the reported information that so many such studies are being conducted in parallel suggests that that the scientific community is making a huge effort to clarify this question but this effort is probably insufficiently coordinated in support of this observation the chinese authorities have recently issued a directive to regulate and coordinate clinical trials studying potential pharmacological treatments for covid-19 11 the results of these trials will be the first available on humans since studies published to date on the characteristics and management of patients with covid-19 did not report data about chloroquine use 112 13 14 15 of note the who published a generic protocol for randomized clinical trials to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of drugs in hospitalized patients with covid-19 ie a master template for researching drugs in this setting 16the vital ethical issue is whether administration of chloroquine in the setting of covid-19 is experimental and therefore requires ethical trial approval or off-label ie ethically justifiable as the best available treatment additional information on chloroquine will soon be released in the context of the evolving outbreak timely release of this information can be of importance due to the growing number of infected patients and the absence of licensed specific drugs meanwhile the recommendations for clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus 2019-ncov infection is suspected published by the who confirm that there is currently no evidence from rcts to inform on specific drug treatment of covid-19 and that unlicensed treatments should be administered only in the context of ethically-approved clinical trials or the monitored emergency use of unregistered interventions framework meuri under strict monitoring 17 the who therefore seems to view chloroquine as experimental the authors tend to agree with this viewpoint but even off-label use of chloroquine may be accompanied by several concerns the first is patient safety such use should be accompanied by close monitoring an epidemic is hardly the ideal setting to do this the ethical approach to off-label drug use also differs between countries raising questions regarding equity finally chloroquine remains a pivotal drug in the treatment of malaria in many places in the world off label drug use can create major drug shortages 18there is sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence regarding the effectiveness of chloroquine for treatment of covid-19 as well as evidence of safety from long-time use in clinical practice for other indications 3 to justify clinical research on the topic the current circumstances justify prioritization of ethical review of study proposals above other less pressing research topics ie fast track institutional ethical review although the use of chloroquine may be supported by expert opinion clinical use of this drug in patients with covid-19 should adhere to the meuri framework or after ethical approval as a trial as stated by the who data from high-quality coordinated clinical trials coming from different locations worldwide are urgently neededac conceived the

disease caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 including over 15 million cases and over 90 000 attributable deaths in the united states 1 supportive care remains the mainstay of covid-19 therapy and the infectious diseases society of america guidelines for covid-19 treatment recommend use of antiviral and immunomodulatory medications suspected to have activity against covid-19 only in the context of a clinical trial 2 unfortunately children are not being given the opportunity to participate in most us-based covid-19 clinical therapeutic trials as of 6 may 2020 options to participate in antiviral clinical trials targeting sars-cov-2 aside from convalescent plasma trials are limited to adolescents ages 12 or older nct04292730 nct04292899 nct04335552 with the exception of a hydroxychloroquine treatment study at our institution nct04369742 open to children of all ages we advocate that pediatric patients should be given equal opportunities to enroll in covid-19 therapeutic clinical trials and outline our rationale for inclusion of children in our hydroxychloroquine treatment trialchildren are not simply small adults they have inherent biological differences that evolve with age and can manifest as alterations in immunity disease pathophysiology drug metabolism therapeutic effects and drug-associated toxicities compared to adults infection with sars-cov-2 clearly demonstrates significant differences in clinical presentation and severity related to age 3 given these differences in covid-19 manifestations therapeutic data abstracted from adult treatment trials may not be reflective of the risks and benefits of therapeutic agents in children although most children infected with covid-19 do not develop immediate severe illness covid-19 infection leading to hospitalization intensive care admission and death have been reported among children in the united states 4 as a basic principle of justice children significantly affected by covid-19 should be given equal opportunities to receive potentially active therapeutic agents against covid-19 in the safest manner possible via structured clinical trialswell-designed therapeutic clinical trials incorporate routine structured safety monitoring that maximizes the likelihood of detecting toxicities associated with therapeutic agents of unproven benefit beyond that offered in an off-label clinical context close monitoring for adverse events integrating opportunities to monitor drug levels into the trial design if pediatric pharmacokineticspharmacodynamics of the investigational agent have not been established and routine incorporation of criteria for halting the therapeutic agent in clinical trials make this the safest approach for use of an investigational or off-label therapeutic agent in children particularly when the degree of direct benefit that the agent provides to the child in uncertain for newly identified diseases such as the covid-19 pandemic that immediately pose a direct threat to a large number of children worldwide delays in initiation of pediatric clinical trials while awaiting adult data pose a potentially preventable safety issue for children and conflicts with the bioethical principle of beneficence not only do children and the medical community lose out on opportunities to gain the highest level of clinical evidence for efficacy in a vulnerable population but due to the lack of availability of pediatric trials many children hospitalized for covid-19 are receiving off-label use of therapeutic agents with unproven benefit against covid-19 off-label prescribing is common practice among children hospitalized in the united states 5 however this approach presents safety risks by lacking the structured safety monitoring provided by clinical trials does not further advance knowledge to provide benefit to future children with the same condition and fails to encourage long-term follow-up to detect potential harmsin addition to offering enhanced safety monitoring enrollment of children in clinical trials ensures that parents and older children are fully informed of the potential risks and benefits associated with use of the therapeutic agent a conversation often omitted when medications are prescribed off-label this preserves the autonomy of the parentsguardians and older children capable of providing assent to make informed decisions on behalf of their child and themselves in a setting in which risks and potential benefits need to be closely weighed because therapeutic efficacy is not yet proven as covid-19 was only recognized in the last few months adequately powered data using the gold standard of biomedical evidence for therapeutic efficacy randomized double-blind placebo control trials is lacking for all leading covid-19 treatment candidates current evidence suggesting agents have a potential therapeutic benefit against covid-19 mainly relies on case series in vitro studies and in vivo animal studies against sars-cov-2 or related coronaviruses the extent of evidence for potential benefit of each of these agents needs to be taken into account when considering either off-label use or clinical trial use for pediatric patients to ensure the potential direct benefit to the child outweighs the commensurate risks associated with the potential therapeutic agent only agents with scientific evidence supporting potential direct benefit to the childs condition with low potential toxicities should be considered for pediatric use until additional efficacy data are available in adultsas the therapeutic benefit of these agents in humans is unclear enrollment of children in randomized double-blind placebo control trials remains ethical if a therapeutic agent is proven to be efficacious for covid-19 therapy in adults it may no longer be ethical to enroll acutely infected pediatric patients in randomized double-blind placebo control trials as it would deprive children in a placebo arm from receiving a known efficacious therapy therefore including children in covid-19 therapeutic trials immediately during the pandemic period may provide the only ethical window of opportunity for obtaining the gold-standard level of efficacy data for covid-19 therapeutics in children moreover depriving children worldwide the opportunity to have therapeutic recommendations based on the same high-quality level data as adults would be an injustice to this vulnerable population pediatric covid-19 therapeutics trials will require multicenter collaboration to achieve appropriately powered data and existing clinical trial networks should be mobilized to facilitate this approachthis approach of using only therapeutic agents with the maximum likelihood of providing direct benefit to pediatric trial participants enhanced safety monitoring beyond that used in routine clinical care for off-label medication use and obtaining both written assent from capable children and informed consent from parentsguardians is consistent with the special protections afforded to children involved in research studies by the us department of health and human services under 45 cfr part 46 we advocate that covid-19 therapeutic clinical trials should open enrollment to pediatric patients during these early months of the covid-19 pandemic according to the bioethical principles of autonomy beneficence and justice inclusion of children in these clinical trials is feasible under current regulations provides direct benefit to pediatric trial participants from a safety perspective compared to off-label prescribing and provides systematic collection of the highest quality of evidence for covid-19 therapeutics in a vulnerable population where sars-cov-2 infection behaves differently from adults even if sufficient power cannot be obtained for children stratified age-based analysis of pediatric cohorts embedded in large-scale clinical trials may at least provide preliminary data on whether a therapeutic response difference exists between children and adults to assist with the design of future therapeutic trials and a first look at whether adult data may be generalizable to the pediatric population excluding children from covid-19 therapeutic trials based on age alone risks causing undue harm and perpetuates medical inequalities among a vulnerable population who deserve equal opportunities to receive investigational therapeutic agents in a safe structured systematic mannerin december 2019 wuhan city the capital of hubei province in china became the centre of a virulent disease of pneumonia of unknown cause 1 by jan 7 2020 chinese scientists had isolated a completely unique coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 previously referred to as 2019-ncov from these patients with virus-infected pneumonia 2 the outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020 by who 3 who later designated this sars-cov-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 in february 2020 by march 11 2020 around 114 countries were affected globally by coronavirus disease then who declared covid-19 as a deadly disease 3 although the outbreak is probably going to possess started from a zoonotic transmission event related to an oversized seafood market huanan seafood market wuhan that also traded in live wild animals it soon became clear that efficient person-to-person transmission was also occurring 4 from phylogenetics analyses undertaken with available full genome sequences bats and possibly pangolins appear to be the reservoir of covid-19 virus but the intermediate hosts has not yet been identified 56as of 6 april 2020 over 1280000 cases of covid-19 are reported in over 200 countries and territories leading to approximately 70500 deaths over 270000 people have recovered globally 6 the primary case of the 201920 coronavirus pandemic in india was reported on 30 january 2020 originating from china as of 6 april 2020 the ministry of health and family welfare have confirmed a complete of 4067 cases 292 recoveries including 1 migration and 109 deaths within the country experts suggest the amount of infections may be much higher as indias testing rates are among the bottom within the world the infection rate of covid-19 in india is reported to be 17 significantly less than within the worst affected countries 7as show in fig 1
 the clinical spectrum of sars-cov-2 infection appears to be vague encompassing asymptomatic infection mild upper respiratory tract illness and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death 1at present clinical management includes infection prevention and control measures and supportive care including supplementary oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support when indicated who and cdc also recommend safety measures like avoiding direct contact with the patients stricken by acute respiratory infections frequent washing of hands and people with respiratory infections to hide their nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing currently there are many international furthermore as country-specific government management guidelines for covid-19 getting published and revised subsequently clinical management of severe acute infection sari when covid-19 disease is suspected by who on march 13 2020international pulmonologists consensus on covid-19 contributed by pulmonologists across the world and handbook of covid-19 prevention and treatment by national health commission of china were published on march 18 2020 nice national institute for health and care excellence uk published its first 3 rapid guidelines on the care of individuals with suspected and confirmed covid-19 and in patients without covid-19 on march 21 2020 guidelines on clinical management of covid  19 by ministry of health  family welfare india on march 30 2020 an array of medication approved for other indications furthermore as several investigational drugs are being studied in several hundred clinical trials that are underway across the worldthere arent any us-fda ema or the other regulatory approved drugs specifically for the treatment of patients with covid-19 however on march 22 2020 the indian council of medical research icmr recommended the employment of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis for asymptomatic health care workers and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases of covid-19 8 further on march 28 2020 the fda granted emergency use authorization eua to be used of chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulphate for treatment of covid-19 9 who has identified a listing of promising candidates for covid-19 treatment which include remdesivir an investigational agent lopinavir-ritonavir approved to be used in hiv with or without interferon investigational immunotherapies like monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and convalescent sera in its january 27 statement who failed to support the antimalarial chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine ribavirin used for hepatitis or corticosteroidssteroids for covid-19 clinical studies 10 who later launched solidarity trial on march 20 2020 involving 45 countries and counting which tests four therapy groups remdesivir lopinavir-ritonavir with or without interferon and hydroxychloroquine the rationale for selecting these drugs was stated as there was some evidence of effectiveness against the sars-cov 2 virus which caused covid-19 either in vitro andor animal studies 11as shown in in the figure the envelope is like hiv virus consisting of spike glycoprotein s e protein and membrane protein m which are essential for entry of virus in the cell this is a rna virus and thus rna genome is present in the core
fig 2
is representing the structure of novel corona virus which is like other rna viruses containing various glycoproteins on the envelope and the rna genome in the core as shown in fig 3
 the viral cycle is like other viruses consisting of attachment integration uncoating use of cell machinery for replication assembly and finally release of virions steps in coronavirus replication are potential targets for antiviral drugs and vaccines 2 the spike glycoprotein s of coronavirus is a good candidate for vaccines because neutralizing antibodies are directed against glycoprotein s blockade of the specific virus receptor on the surface of the host cell by monoclonal antibodies or other ligands can prevent virus entry receptor-induced conformational changes in the s protein can be blocked by peptides that inhibit membrane fusion and virus entry the polyprotein of the replicase protein is cleaved into functional units by virus-encoded proteinases protease inhibitors may block replication the polymerase functions in a unique membrane-bound complex in the cytoplasm and the assembly and functions of this complex are potential drug targets viral mrnas made by discontinuous transcription are shown in the cytoplasm with the protein that each encodes indicated at the right the common 70 base long leader sequence on the 5 end of each mrna is shown in red budding and exocytosis are processes essential to virus replication that may be targets for development of antiviral drugsapart from the pathophysiology of virus itself it is now believed that the primary cause of mortality in susceptible patients is either due to pro-inflammatory cytokine storm or due to secondary bacterial infection secondary bacterial infections can be treated by using various antibiotics research is currently focussed for innovation of new therapies to treat this potentially fatal cytokine storm besides most microbes including covid-19 are known to bind to toll like receptor tlr which in turn induces a highly proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 il-1 il-1 is the mediator of fever and fibrosis this can lead to further deterioration in susceptible covid positive patients thus drugs supressing il-1 or il-1 receptor can be taken into consideration for treatment of covid -19 3a study has found out that women are much less susceptible to being affected by covid 19 compared to men initially the reason was hypothesised to be only environmental stating that as smoking is more prevalent in men and hence their respiratory system is compromised leading to greater risk of covid infection however new research suggests that there are some innate differences between both sexes leading to the difference in the susceptibility the presence of an extra x chromosome in females lead to lower viral load levels and less inflammation than in men while cd4  t cells are higher with better immune response besides women produce higher titre of antibodies which tends to remain in circulation for longer periods the levels of activation of the immune cells are higher in women than in men and it is correlated with the trigger of tlr7 and the production of interferon ifn tlr7 is higher in women than in men and its biallelic expression leads to higher immune responses and increases the resistance to viral infections tlr7 is expressed in innate immune cells which recognizes single strand rna virus by promoting the production of antibodies against the virus and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 and il-1 family members moreover in women the production of inflammatory il-6 after viral infection is lower than in males and is often correlated with a better longevity in addition on the x chromosome there are loci that code for the genes involved in the regulation of immune cells such as foxp3 and transcription factor for t regulatory cells treg involved in virus pathogenesis the x chromosome influences the immune system by acting on many other proteins including tlr8 cd40 l and cxcr3 which can be over-expressed in women and influence the response to viral infections and vaccinations however greater production of pro-inflammatory cytokines enhances risk of cytokine storm thus drugs acting against pro-inflammatory cytokines can be theoretically more effective in women compared to men and in future there may be gender wise differential therapy for treatment of covid 19 4
a chloroquine

mechanism of action primarily inhibits the entry transport and the post-entry stages of sars-cov-2 it increases endosomal ph and interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptor of sars-cov and thereby it has the potential to block viral infection it also inhibits cathepsins that leads to the formation of the autophagosome which cleaves sars-cov-2 spike protein furthermore chloroquine through the inhibition of map-kinase interferes with sars-cov-2 molecular crosstalk besides altering the virion assembly budding and interfering with the proteolytic processing of the m protein
in- vitro chinese researchers who studied the effect of chloroquine in vitro using vero e6 cell line infected by sars-cov-2 found chloroquine to be highly effective in reducing viral replication that can be easily achievable with standard dosing due to its favourable penetration in tissues including the lung 5
animal model antiviral activity of chloroquine against human coronavirus oc43 infection in new born c57bl6 mice was highly effective 6
key clinical trial a chinese study involving more than 100 patients of covid-19 found chloroquine superior to the control group in reducing symptom duration exacerbation of pneumonia including radiological improvement and promoting virus-negative seroconversion without any severe side effects 7

b hydroxychloroquine hcq

mechanism of action same as that of chloroquine since same structure except for an additional hydroxy moiety in one terminal in hcq
safety profile addition of hydroxyl molecule makes hcq less permeable to blood-retinal barrier and allows faster clearance from retinal pigment cell thereby suggesting a lesser risk of retinal toxicity with hcq as compared to chloroquine furthermore the narrow therapeutic and safety index margin with chloroquine makes hcq a safer option than chloroquine long-term clinical safety profile of hcq is better than that of chloroquine since it allows higher daily dose of hcq with less drug-drug interactions 5
in- vitro hydroxychloroquine ec50  072 m was found to be more potent than chloroquine ec50  547 m in vitro against sars-cov-2 8
animal model whether hcq works in-vivo is not yet proven for covid-19 9
key clinical trial in an open-label study of 36 patients with covid-19 use of hcq 200 mg three times per day for 10 days was associated with a higher rate of undetectable sars-cov-2 rna on nasopharyngeal specimens at day 6 compared with no specific treatment 70 versus 125 percent 10

c remdesivir rdv

mechanism of action it inhibits viral replication through premature termination of rna transcription
in- vitro it has shown to inhibit sars-cov-2 replication in vero-e6 cells with ec50 at 2315um
animal model it has demonstrated to improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral loads in mice infected with mers-cov 11
key clinical trial a single case report by holshue et al described clinical improvement after rdv used to treat the first us case of covid-19 there are several randomized control trials are currently being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rdv in patients with covid-19 two phase iii trials initiated in china in february 2020 aimed to evaluate rdv in hospitalized adult patients with mildmoderate nct04252664 or severe nct04257656 covid-19 rdv 200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg once daily for 9 days vs placebo preliminary results of these trials are expected to be announced at the end of april 2020 12

d lopinavir-ritonavir

mechanism of action the polyprotein of the replicase protein is cleaved into functional units by virus-encoded proteinases which is inhibited by these protease inhibitor combinations thus inhibiting proteolysis
in- vitro the lopinavirritonavir combination was first considered a potentially useful treatment after in-vitro studies showed it had antiviral activity against sars coronavirus 13
animal model the lopinavirritonavir-treated and interferon-1b-treated animals had better outcome than the untreated animals with improved clinical mean clinical scores 509-950 and weight loss than the untreated animals radiological minimal pulmonary infiltrates and pathological mild broncho interstitial pneumonia findings and lower mean viral loads in necropsied lung 059-106 log10 copiesglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh p  050 and extrapulmonary 011-129 log10 copiesgapdh p  050 in kidney tissues 14
key clinical trial
chan and colleagues compared outcomes in people who received lopinavirritonavir as initial treatment and as rescue therapy with matched controls all patients were given ribavirin and steroids according to a standardised protocol the addition of lopinavirritonavir as initial treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the overall death rate and intubation rate compared with matched controls p  005 15
note camostat mesylate is another drug of same class protease inhibitors having same mechanism of action has shown evidence of effectively blocking sars-cov-2 in lung cells in-vitro 5
e convalescent plasmathe us-fda has accepted emergency investigational new drug applications for use of convalescent plasma for patients with severe or life-threatening covid-19 16a case series described administration of plasma from donors who had completely recovered from covid-19 to five patients with severe covid-19 on mechanical ventilation and persistently high viral titres despite investigational antiviral treatment the patients had decreased nasopharyngeal viral load decreased disease severity score and improved oxygenation by 12 days after transfusion but these findings do not establish a causal effect finding appropriate donors and establishing testing to confirm neutralizing activity of plasma may be logistical challenges 1718

f drugs acting against pro-inflammatory factors
a
interleukin 1

interleukin 1 il-1 consists of two molecules namely il-1a and il-1b associated with innate immunity il-1b is associated with most of the biological pleiotropic properties and hence it is directly referred as il-1 il-1 is proinflammatory cytokine and it binds to il-1 receptor to modulate its action association with il-1 receptor leads to recruitment of other pro-inflammatory cytokines anakinra is one of the anti-interleukin 1 antagonist which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and currently being repurposed for the treatment of covid-19 19mechanism of action inhibits actions of il-1 leading to inhibition of cytokine storm which is common reason for fatality in covid-19current evidence no current in-vitro and in vivo evidence specifically for covid 19 currently there is no published clinical trial however as per the data on clinicaltrialsgov there are 8 trials using anakinra against covid-19 either in recruitment or pre-recruitment stage 20 one of the major phase 3 trials using this drug is ongoing in italy and is initiated by the manufacturer swedish orphan biovitrum to evaluate efficacy and safety of anakinra or emapalumab with standard of care in reducing hyperinflammation and respiratory distress in patients with covid-19a
interleukin 6

il-6 is one of the key pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 activates its downstream janus kinase jak signal by binding the transmembrane cis-signalling or soluble form trans-signalling of the il-6 receptor il-6r and interacting with membrane-bound gp130 excessive il-6 signalling leads to a myriad of biological effects that contribute to organ damage such as maturing nave t cells into effector t cells inducing vascular endothelial growth factor vegf expression in epithelial cells increasing vessel permeability and reduces myocardial contractility 21mechanism of action tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-il6r antibody it binds both soluble and membranebound il6r to inhibit il6mediated cis-signalling and trans-signallingcurrent evidence case studyseries describing use of tocilizumab in patients with covid-19 have been reported from various areas of the world in preliminary data from a non-peer reviewed single-arm chinese trial involving 21 patients with severe or critical covid-19 infection showed rapid fever reduction and a reduced need for supplemental oxygen within few days after receiving tocilizumab initially given as a single 400-mg dose by iv infusion this dose was repeated within 12 hours in 3 patients because of continued fever in china randomized multicentre controlled clinical trial evaluating efficacy  safety in 188 patients with covid-19 is under way results are not yet available in usglobal scenario randomized placebo-controlled trial is in phase 3 nct04320615 is in collaboration with the us health and human services biomedical advanced research and development authority barda the study will evaluate safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in combination with standard of care compared with placebo in this study there is expectation of enrolment of about 330 patients globally including in the us beginning in april 2020 22

g anti-inflammatory cytokines as drugs
a
interleukin 37 il-37

though it is a member of il-1 family and is structurally like il-1 it has anti-inflammatory activity il-37 has several mechanisms for immunosuppression but it ultimately leads to suppression of il-1 it inhibits histocompatibility complex mhc molecules and thus inflammation by suppressing il-1 il-6 tnf  ccl2 23 currently there is no evidence regarding safety and efficacy of il-37b
interleukin 38 il-38

like il-37 this is one of the most recently discovered anti-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the family of il-1 it binds to the receptor of interleukin 1 receptor type 6 and leads to suppression of inflammation in-vitro cultures of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs are inhibited by il-38 in the production of several cytokines including il-1 il-17 and il-22 il-38 gene knock out mice are more susceptible to inflammatory conditions currently there are no clinical trials using either il 38 or its analogues however il-38 can also be a potential new therapy 24as this is still an evolving topic only the key medications mentioned in who and cdc guidelines as of 9th april 2020 have been incorporated in this review besides we have added potential immunosuppressive therapies in the review as cytokine storm is one of the most common reasons for mortality in susceptible individuals however there are many more drugs currently under investigation including drugs like ivermectin vitamin c baloxavir colchicine and tacrolimus the efficacy and safety of these drugs is still unknown and will be clearer in the coming monthsthe pandemic of the coronavirus disease covid-19 has quickly spread to affect almost all countries and territories around the world the agent causing the infection was rapidly detected to be a beta coronavirus first named the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov the international committee of taxonomy of viruses changed the name to severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 sars-cov-2 denoting the coronavirus as causing severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 1the reported covid-19 case fatality ranges from 1 to 7 according to reports of the world health organization who these values must be interpreted with caution in countries that have implemented massive screening for the whole population like south korea the overall case fatality may be less than 1 as a large number of mild or asymptomatic cases have been counted in the denominator of their equation due to the huge unprecedented scale of the pandemic the actual numbers of deaths are considerable 2respiratory failure was obviously a major cause of death in previous viral pandemics including spanish flu in 1918 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 and this is also the case in the new covid-19 3 besides conventional treatment antiviral therapy both classic and novel repurposed medications may shorten the course of the disease and improve its outcome however there is currently no supporting evidence for these therapies apart from small studies or case series severe cases of covid-19 may need assisted ventilation through various modalities 4 a high number of severe cases especially elderly may progress to acute severe lung injury andor multiple organ failure due to a deranged immune response or a cytokine storm the treatment of which may involve immunomodulators this review covers the key medications suggested as potential agents under investigation in registered clinical trials for the treatment of covid-19 broadly they are either repurposed antiviral other anti-infective or immunomodulatory agents in addition to drugs that act on host cell receptors the ventilatory and hemodynamic support of critically-ill covid-19 patients has been reviewed elsewhere 56the significant advances and continuous progress of computational analysis have greatly served the study of epidemiological aspects covid-19 through data collection compilation and dissemination in parallel advances in molecular technology and the availability of the virus genome database have allowed for the identification of the virus and its mutations an important approach to drug discovery is the screening of chemical libraries including a large number of available molecules or databases of transcriptional signatures in various cell lines ongoing studies are conducted to validate such molecules as potential therapies 7 on the other hand several products have appeared in the market with strong claims of effectiveness against sars-cov-2 infection some constitute a risk on patients health eg chlorine dioxide products known as a miracle mineral solution that was warned against by the fda httpswwwfdagovnews-eventspress-announcementscoronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-warns-seller-marketing-dangerous-chlorine-dioxide-products-claimthe broad strategies for covid-19 treatment include the targeting of key enzymes of sars-cov-2 thus interfering with the viral cycle inside the host cell by using repurposed antiviral drugs previously tested for other coronaviruses like sars-cov and mers-cov as well as other rna virus infections eg hiv and hcv other anti-infective agents have also been proposed in addition targets on the host cell surface may represent potential covid-19 therapy-inhibiting virus entries the second strategy is immunomodulation by using non-specific immunoglobulins and interferons or specific agents eg tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies immunomodulation is particularly needed early in the disease to boost antiviral immunity as well as in severe cases where an uncontrolled immune response may lead to acute lung injury and other organ damagethis review covers key medications proposed for covid-19 that have been registered in various clinical trials httpsclinicaltrialsgov including the chinese clinical trial database httpwwwchictrorgcnindexaspxcoronaviruses belong to nidovirales order viruses depending on a nested group of mrnas for their replication nido-  nest they contain the biggest known viral rna genomes 2732 kb in length these viruses are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses figure 1 shows the key virus proteins under electron microscopy the virus has a characteristic crown-like shape due to the presence of the spike s protein 89 the s protein is extensively glycosylated forming a homotrimer it mediates virus entry through binding to specific receptors eg angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and fusion with the cell membrane of the host figure 1 the s protein harbors the major antigen that stimulates the formation of neutralizing antibodies in addition to targets of cytotoxic lymphocytes the membrane m protein has a major role in viral assembly 10 the nucleocapsid n protein is responsible for the regulation of viral rna synthesisit interacts with m protein during the budding of the virus it forms part of the nucleocapsid in association with the rna sars-cov-2 has sequence homology with the influenza virus through hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein he the he binds to neuraminic acid on the host cell surface leading to the adsorption of the virus on the cell surface such homology may denote an early recombination between the two viruses finally the function of the envelope eprotein is not fully elucidated proteins m n and e are essential for the virus assembly and release 11the incubation period is thought to be 14 days after exposure 12 in more than 80 of patients the symptoms are mild however in 14 of cases especially in the elderly the symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxia may develop with more than 50 lung involvement on computed tomography ct scan in around 5 of cases in a late phase of the disease respiratory failure due to acute lung injury shock andor multiple organ dysfunction due to the cytokine storm may develop 13 severe cases of covid-19 that require intensive care unit icu admission have been shown to have increased plasma levels of key inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-2 il-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf- among many others thus indicating a cytokine storm that correlates with disease severity 13 uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation is a major cause of death in sars-cov-2 infection more than 80 of patients with covid-19 have lymphopenia 13 suggesting the possible pulmonary recruitment of lymphocytes another explanation of lymphopenia is immune-related cell apoptosis or pyroptosisremdesivir is an adenosine analog that leads to the premature or delayed termination of the viral rna chains the drug was first developed for the treatment of ebola infection 1516 it was found to be a promising antiviral drug against a broad range of viruses rna viruses including coronaviruses eg sarsmers-cov5 the drug acts in the post-entry phase mainly by inhibiting the key enzyme rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp 17 when incorporated into a specific position in the rna chain remdesivir causes the inhibition of rna synthesis at five nucleotides down to the site of the drug incorporation thus delaying chain-termination 18 studies in non-human primates have shown the prophylactic and therapeutic value of the drug in the mers-cov infection 19 another recent in-vitro study reported a half-maximal effective concentration ec50 that suggested the drug is likely to have a plausible working concentration in non-human primates the investigators concluded that among several drugs tested only remdesivir and chloroquine could inhibit the virus infection in human cells sensitive to sars-cov-2 20recently on 1 may 2020 the us food and drug administration issued an emergency use authorization of remdesivir for covid-19 patients adverse effects of remdesivir include nausea vomiting and liver transaminase elevations as the used vehicle is cyclodextrin there is a risk of the potential toxic accumulation of this substance in patients with renal impairment remdesivir may be used for pregnant women and children only as compassionate drug use remdesivir is under investigation as one of the four arms in the solidarity clinical trial and its outcome in covid-19 has been so far described only in case series 2122 several clinical trials are currently investigating the drug see table 1the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was developed as protease inhibitors for the treatment of hiv-1 infection the protease enzyme is an aspartic protease that cleaves proteins from precursor viral polypeptide strands this applies to structural and functional proteins the proteases play an important role in the viral lifecycle and if inhibited immature non-infectious virions will be generated 23 lopinavir undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver by microsomal enzymes cytochrome 3a4 cyp3a4 and cyp3a5 ritonavir inhibits the cyp3a4 enzyme and results in increased concentrations of lopinavir when the two drugs are co-administered 24 lopinavirritonavir combination is mostly eliminated by the fecal route whereas the urinary excretion accounts for less than 2 of the eliminated drug lopinavir has a low transference across the human placenta fetal exposure is increased with ritonavir based on information collected by the antiretroviral pregnancy registry the risk of teratogenic effects is not increased in patients receiving lopinavir adverse pregnancy outcomes may be linked to the use the antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy including preterm delivery stillbirth low birth weight and small for gestational age infants 25the combination of lopinavirritonavir was effective against mers-cov in previous studies in experimental animals 23 given that success the combination was recently tried in the treatment of sars-cov-2 in contrast in a study that included 199 adult patients admitted to the hospital with severe covid-19 lopinavirritonavir treatment did not show any benefits compared with the conventional care regarding the time to clinical improvement viral load or mortality 26 however the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was included in two arms of the solidarity trial with and without the addition of interferon- it was also included in another smaller study 150 participants were recruited in comparison to hydroxychloroquine and a control no intervention group for 710 days nct04307693 see table 1 interestingly a computational study suggested lopinavir as well as oseltamivir as a potential therapy for covid-19 27another combination of protease inhibitors was previously reported to be bioequivalent to the lopinavirritonavir combination in healthy volunteers with the advantage of avoiding the adverse effects of ritonavir 28 cobicistat is an analog of ritonavir and a potent cyp3a inhibitor it has no antiviral activity like ritonavir it inhibits cyp2d6 and p-glycoprotein cobicistat also inhibits drug transporters eg organic anion transport protein oatp1b1 which is the main transporter for statins 29 clinical trials were registered to compare the combination of darunavir and cobicistat for conventional treatment in patients with covid-19 nct04252274 and chictr2000029541as a guanine analog favipiravir inhibits the key viral enzyme rna-dependent rna polymerase 30 favipiravir has been approved for the treatment of influenza viruses type a and b in a few asian countries the use of favipiravir in mild cases of covid-19 was reported by a single study to be associated with a better viral clearance and more frequent radiological improvement compared with lopinavirritonavir combined therapy the analysis was an open-label and non-randomized surprisingly the manuscript was temporarily removed however favipiravir has been included in several trials in combination with other antiviral drugs including lopinavirritonavir see table 1 the drug is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor the enzyme is crucial for the de novo synthesis of guanosine the drug is mainly used for the treatment of viral hepatitis c it has not shown a significant effect as a monotherapy in the treatment of sars-cov or mers-cov 3132 however combined with lopinavirritonavir and a corticosteroid it reduced the 21-day mortality rate due to acute respiratory distress syndrome ards in patients with sars-cov 33 ribavirin was also used in combination with lopinavirritonavir and an interferon- 1a or 1b in the treatment of mers-cov and showed no significant effect 3435 however viremia was resolved within two days after starting the combination therapy in severe cases 36 interestingly ribavirin inhibited sars-cov-2 replication at low concentrations in caco-2 cells in micromolar amounts used as a model for the new viral infection of human cells in a study proposed by klann et al this study is under review the results of this study are concordant with previous reports of ribavirin effectiveness against other coronaviruses including hcov-43 cov-nl63 and mers-cov-16 but not sars-cov-126 ribavirin is under investigation in covid-19 in combination with interferon- nct04254874 chictr2000029308the broad-spectrum antiviral agent umifenovir or arbidol hydrochloride was developed 25 years ago at the russian research chemical and pharmaceutical institute umifenovir is approved for the prophylaxis and treatment of human influenza type a and type b infections as well as post-influenza complications only in a few countries including russia and china 37 overall umifenovir has a broad variety of antiviral activity against hepatitis b virus respiratory syncytial virus adenovirus parainfluenza virus avian coronavirus coxsackie b3 virus hantavirus and arthropod-borne flaviviruses including zika virus west nile virus and tick-borne encephalitis thus indicating broad-spectrum antiviral activities 38 a current trial on mild cases of covid-19 is investigating the drug as either a single treatment or in combination with pegylated interferon- atomization for two weeks nct04254874oseltamivir is a competitive viral neuraminidase enzyme inhibitor the enzyme inhibition interferes with the release of progeny influenza virus from the infected host cells thus new viral cycles are inhibited after the replication of the virus progeny virions bind to the infected cell via sialic acid moieties on cell surface glycoproteins neuraminidase removes the sialic acid and allows for the release of progeny virions thus neuraminidase inhibitors interfere with the final process of new virion release 39oseltamivir is active against a variety of respiratory viruses including influenza a and influenza b oseltamivir can decrease the severity and duration of the illness if started within 36 h of the onset of symptoms the influenza neuraminidase enzyme is highly conserved being common to type a h1n1 type a h2n2 type a h3n2 type a h5n1 and type b influenza viruses 40 interestingly oseltamivir is also active against the strain that caused the 1918 pandemic 41oseltamivir phosphate is available as both a liquid suspension and in a solid formula capsule or powder it is a pro-drug that undergoes rapid metabolism to its active form oseltamivir carboxylate 42 the drug is eliminated primarily by renal excretion and dose reduction is recommended for patients with renal impairmentthe most common adverse effects include mild nausea and vomiting in around 15 of patients however post-marketing surveillance has reported rare but serious adverse neuropsychiatric effects up to convulsions and encephalitis severe skin reactions stevens-johnson syndrome and death 43 most oseltamivir-related neuropsychiatric events have been reported in children in japan where oseltamivir is frequently prescribed 44a computational study has suggested oseltamivir as a potential therapy for covid-19 as it binds to the sars-cov-2 protease 27 a clinical trial was registered to evaluate oseltamivir alone in combination with ritonavir or with asc09f in treatment of covid-19 asc09f is an investigational antiviral interferes with the virus life cycle and will be investigated in combination with oseltamivir and other antiviral agents in at least two trials nct04261270 and chictr2000029603 intravenous immunoglobulins ivig offer potentially effective therapy in severe cases of covid-19 through their role in immunomodulation early in the course of covid-19 infection pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released in response to the rapid rate of virus replication leading to apoptosis 45 similar to a previous study on sars-cov infection it can be speculated that viroporin 3a may activate nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-likenod-like receptor protein 3 nlrp3 and inflammasome thus inducing cell pyroptosis in sars-cov-2 infection 46 tranilast is an antagonist of nlrp3 that inhibits the inflammasome pathway tranilast is a tryptophan analog used to treat allergic conditions including bronchial asthma atypical dermatitis and allergic conjunctivitis 47 interestingly the drug is registered for a chinese clinical trial in the treatment of covid-19 chictr2000030002the primary inflammatory responses are usually mild and can be overcome by most patients it is the secondary inflammatory response that is frequently florid and fatal though antiviral neutralizing antibodies enhance the clearance of the virus as evidenced by the decrease in viral load anti-spike protein-neutralizing antibodies anti-s-igg in sars-cov infection have been found to cause severe lung injury by altering inflammatory responses in previous animal studies 48 similarly the vaccine for sars-cov has been found to induce pulmonary injury in multiple animal models 4950 in covid-19 patients the fast development of the anti-s-neutralizing antibody was associated with a higher mortality 51 the anti-s-igg may alter the functional polarization of alveolar macrophages and enhance the accumulation of the proinflammatory monocytemacrophage and the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 and il-8 in the lungs the process starts with the binding of the virus-anti-s-igg complex to the fragment crystallizable region receptor receptors fcr of monocytesmacrophages thus blocking fcr decreases the production of inflammatory cytokines figure 2 48 a previously described phenomenonthe antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection ademay be a plausible explanation the process of ade enhances the cellular uptake of infectious virus-antibody complexes after their interaction with fcr or other receptors leading to the exacerbation of target cell infection 52fcr can be blocked by ivig thus suppressing and pacifying the exuberant immune response several clinical trials have been registered to investigate the use of intravenous immunoglobulins nct04261426 and nct04264858 or the convalescent plasma of recovered patients nct04342195 to treat severe cases of covid-19 the role of ivig in severe infections and sepsis is still controversial and warrants further well-designed clinical trials while a previous randomized trial showed no benefit of ivig on sepsis-related mortality 235354 meta-analyses have shown a reduction in mortality in particular with the use of iga- or igm-enriched ivig 455556ifn-i is one of the first cytokines released in the context of viral infection the ifnar receptors recognize it on the plasma membrane in most cells upon interaction with its receptors interferons induce signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 stat1 phosphorylation stat1 then translocates to the nucleus to activate interferon-stimulated genes isg the isgs interfere with viral replication and spread by several mechanisms such as the modulation of cell metabolism or cytokine release finally activating the adaptive immunity pattern recognition receptors prrs are a subgroup of the isg prrs increase the cellular response to pathogens the isgs also include proteins that decrease membrane fluidity thus suppressing the membrane fusion and the egress of the virus isgs also comprise antiviral proteins that specifically inhibit steps of the viral cycle 57previously interferon treatment showed inconclusive activity against sars-cov and mers-cov ifn1 up-regulates cd73 in the pulmonary endothelium leading to adenosine secretion adenosine is an anti-inflammatory molecule that supports the endothelial barrier thus interferon treatment reduces vascular leakage in ards 58 unfortunately such an anti-inflammatory effect is insufficient to support survival in patients with ards 59 thus there is lack of support of use of interferon beta in covid-19 one assumption of covid-19-associated severe lung injury is that the virus infection provokes an exaggerated ifn-i-mediated response against the virus leading to exuberant tissue damage interferonopathy accordingly ifn-i should be judiciously used by expert specialists ifn-1 may be administered to patients in the early phase of the disease 60 however it is plausible that an anti-interferon agent may be of help in late phases 61according to the guidelines implemented in china for covid-19 infection ifn is to be administered by inhalation five million u twice a day combined with the antiviral ribavirin 62 clinical trials have been recently registered to assess a combination of lopinavirritonavir and ifn2b chictr2000029387 or a combination of lopinavirritonavir with ribavirin and subcutaneously-administered ifn1b nct04276688 for the treatment of covid-19 see table 1 in addition to its immune-boosting effect thymosin 1 was recently suggested to facilitate the infiltration of immune cells to improve the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitors 63 as an immune-boosting agent the drug is registered for several clinical trials in combination with antiviral agents for the treatment of covid-19 nct04252274 and chictr2000029541baricitinib is a small orally active molecule that inhibits janus kinase 1 and2 the janus kinase family including jak1 jak2 jak3 and tyrosine kinase 2 tyk2 has important roles in some signaling pathways through its triggering of the cytokine-induced phosphorylation of stat that is later transported to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription 6465baricitinib is reported to be effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in several clinical trials 65 with excellent results in terms of clinical response and a good safety profile 66 the literature has reported that the drug blocks the phosphorylation of stats induced by different cytokines in the blood and it causes a transient alteration in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts 66676869receptor-mediated endocytosis is the most common pathway for virus entry to the cells ace2 a cell surface protein expressed by cells in the kidney blood vessels heart and most importantly lung at2 alveolar epithelial cells is the receptor used by sars-cov-2 to infect lung cells 70 ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 is a pivotal regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis thus the disruption of aak1 would interfere with the virus passage into the cells and further prevent the intracellular assembly of virus particles 71 a benevolent artificial intelligence ais knowledge graph and customizations bespoke to sars-cov-2 were used together to identify drugs that may halt the viral infection process baricitinib was expected to have a high binding affinity to aak1 and cyclin g-associated kinase another regulator of endocytosis 72 accordingly baricitinib is suggested to be trialed on patients with sars-cov-2 acute respiratory disease in order to reduce the viral entry and the associated inflammation nct04321993a great chance for potential combination therapy with baracitinib is present due to its favorable pharmacokinetic properties such as low plasma protein binding affinity minimal interaction with cyp enzymes and drug transporters 73 currently in the covid-19 outbreak baricitinib is being combined with different antivirals such as lopinavir ritonavir and remdesivir since this combination would decrease viral infectivity viral replication and the exaggerated host inflammatory responseon the other hand using baricitinib is associated with an increased risk of developing severe infections due to opportunistic pathogens especially if it is taken concomitantly with immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids 74 tuberculosis was identified in patients receiving baricitinib and patients should be tested prior to and during therapy for latent tuberculosis infection in addition thrombosis including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism has been documented more than placebo in patients treated with baricitinib 74ruxolitinib is an orally available and potent jak1 and jak2 inhibitor it was the first drug for myelofibrosis to be approved by the fda in november 2011 75 the pharmacokinetic analysis of ruxolitinib predicted that the unbound plasma concentration required to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis greatly exceeds the currently tolerated therapeutic dose 73 therefore viral infectivity at therapeutic doses is unlikely to decrease but the drug may reduce the inflammatory response of the host by inhibiting jak ruxolitinib is currently being studied to combine it with covid-19 mesenchymal stem cell infusion nct04252118camrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed cell death 1 pd-1 receptors pd-1 receptors are expressed on the surface of t cells and act as negative regulators of t cell function camrelizumab has been reported to block pd-1s binding to its ligand pd-l1 thus inhibiting the immune escape of tumor cells 76 recently in china the drug has received conditional approval for the treatment of relapsed or refractory hodgkins lymphoma camrelizumab is also being investigated as a possible therapy for other malignancies 76after antigen exposure the expression of pd-1 on t-cells is induced rapidly following the engagement between the t-cell receptor tcr and the loaded major histocompatibility complex mhc molecule in the draining lymph nodes 77 the presence of various pro-inflammatory mediators such as il-2 il-6 il-7 and il-15 in the affected tissue contribute further to pd-1s up-regulation of t-cells 78 the interaction between pd-1 and pd-1l provides signals that tolerize t-cells to their antigenic targets neutralizing their effector functions 78 furthermore in sepsis patients pd-1 and pd-l1 are known to be the primary mediators in t cell depletion 79 animal models have shown that blocking pd-1 or pd-l1 prevents t cell death regulates cytokine production and reduces both organ dysfunction and death in sepsis 80 researchers are therefore attempting to perform clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of pd-1 inhibitors in 2019 novel coronavirus infection in patients with serious lymphocytopenia-associated pneumoniaon the other hand the use of camrelizumab is associated with a good safety profile the high incidence of all adverse drug reactions is related to reactive capillary hemangiomas which are generally unthreatening and self-limited 81 currently camrelizumab is being investigated for its effectiveness in covid-19 nct04268537eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal igg antibody that binds to the c5 complement protein preventing cleavage into c5a and c5b blocking the formation of c5b prevents terminal complex c5b-9 or membrane attack complex mac from subsequent formation in the united states eculizumab is approved for treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome 8283the literature has identified the complement system as an essential host mediator for both sars-cov- and mers-cov-induced disease and has suggested that complement activation controls the systemic pro-inflammatory response against the viral infection 8485 accordingly eculizumab is expected to stop immune-mediated death in patients infected with sars-cov-2 currently the drug is under clinical trials for its effectiveness in patients with confirmed covid-19 infection who are in icu due to ards nct04288713 meplazumab is a humanized anti-cd147 antibody a recent study showed that sars-cov-2 can invade human host cells via a novel route of the cd147-spike protein sp 86 the sp was found to bind to cd147 a receptor on the host cells thus mediating the invasion of the virus the study also showed that meplazumab could competitively inhibit the binding of sp and cd147 and it could prevent viruses from invading host cells this has provided a potential target for developing antiviral cures or protocolsrecently the drug was evaluated for its effectiveness and safety as an add-on treatment in patients with covid-19 pneumonia meplazumab was found to speed up the recovery of patients with pneumonia associated with covid-19 infection with a favorable safety profile 87 the findings of this study support the carrying out of a large-scale investigation of meplazumab as a possible treatment for covid-19 pneumoniatocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor il-6r il-6 is a cytokine that plays a major role in immune response and is associated with the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases 88 il-6 is produced by different cells including t-cells and b-cells lymphocytes monocytes and fibroblasts il-6 is involved in various physiological processes such as t-cell activation the induction of immunoglobulin secretion the initiation of hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis and the stimulation of hematopoietic cells precursor proliferation and differentiation the drug is already approved for the treatment of serious or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome crs the fda has approved a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase iii clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of combining tocilizumab to the standard of care in hospitalized patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia 89the seventh edition of the chinese clinical guidance for covid-19 pneumonia diagnosis and treatment published by china national health commission on 4 march 2020 included tocilizumab as an option for patients with severe covid-19 extensive lung lesions and elevated il-6 levels 90 this followed reports of positive outcomes from the use of tocilizumab to control dangerous lung inflammation in 21 patients with severe covid-19 in china 91however health canada notified healthcare providers that severe cases of drug-induced liver injuries had been reported in patients treated with tocilizumab including cases of acute liver failure that required a transplant 92 patients should be closely monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with tocilizumab including the potential development of tuberculosis in patients who have tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection before starting therapy many patients who acquired these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids and as such the drug should be only used according to the specialist instructions 93sarilumab is another human monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor it binds to soluble and membrane-bound il-6 receptors and inhibits il-6-mediated signaling via these receptors there is a growing body of evidence confirming the benefit of targeting the il-6 pathway in patients with covid-19 most notably in a recent single-arm study in china with tocilizumab in critically ill covid-19 patients 94 currently the clinical efficacy of sarilumab against sars-cov-2 is being evaluated in various clinical trials table 1similar to tocilizumab sarilumab-treated patients are at an elevated risk of developing severe opportunistic infections that may result in hospitalization or death 95bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that has been used in anti-tumor therapy for 16 years it binds to and neutralizes vascular endothelial growth factor vegf preventing its interaction with endothelial receptors flt-1 and kdr the suppression of vascular permeability in patients with severecritical covid-19 is expected to reduce pulmonary edema the autopsies of patients who died from covid-19 have shown the significant exudation of the pulmonary mucus more evident than infection with sars 96 pulmonary ct scanning and pathological observation have recognized inflammatory exudation as a distinctive characteristic of covid-19 97 evidence has suggested that bevacizumab is a promising treatment for critically ill covid-19 patients currently the drug is being evaluated for its efficacy and safety in severe or critical patients with covid-19 in a multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial 98bevacizumab has been reported by the american heart association to be an agent that may either cause reversible direct myocardial toxicity or exacerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction moreover bevacizumab has been reported to cause andor worsen hypertension 98 thus blood pressure monitoring during bevacizumab treatment and regularly after discontinuation is recommendedfingolimod is a sphingosine analog that modulates the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor and thus alters the migration of lymphocytes resulting in lymph node sequestration 99 as an immunomodulatory agent it may confine the over-exuberant inflammatory response and slow down the progress of lung injuryfingolimod is mainly contra-indicated in patients with myocardial infarction within six months unstable angina stroke heart failure and heart block prolonged qt interval above 500 ms is another important contra-indication given the high incidence of myocarditis as a complication of severe covid-19 patients with diabetes may get macular edema upon fingolimod treatment 100 a clinical trial has been registered to use fingolimod at a dose of 05 mg daily for three consecutive days in the treatment of severe covid-19 infection nct04280588both chloroquine cq and hydroxychloroquine hcq are antimalarial drugs that are also prescribed in treating autoimmune diseases 101 according to the literature both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine possess antiviral activity against several viruses cq through the inhibition of specific viral replication steps restricts hiv 102 influenza virus 103 dengue virus denv 104 west nile virus wnv infection japanese encephalitis virus jev and zika virus infection 105 those specific viral replication steps depend on the phthe investigation of the anti-sars-cov-2 activity of cq and hcq is also encouraged by several factors first both cq and hcq have been used for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria and rheumatic diseases for more than 50 years second both drugs are very cheap eg when compared with immunotherapy finally cq inhibits the synthesis of a myriad of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf- il-1 and il-6 106 which may have deleterious effects on covid-19 prognosiscq and hcq as weak bases exert their antiviral mechanism by affecting the acid vesicles which leads to the disruption of enzymes required for the post-translational modifications of proteins both drugs concentrate in the acidic cell organelles thus inhibiting virus replication by preventing endosomelysosome trafficking another potential mechanism is the intervention with the viral protein maturation during virion maturation 107 cq has been shown to alkalinize the endosomal ph thus preventing fusion between the virus and the cell and interfering with the glycosylation of the ace2 receptor and its binding to the sars-cov-2 spike protein 108 to date clinical studies investigating hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine have been limited and their role in covid-19 treatment is still to be elucidated recent reports have found that cq can also inhibit the growth of sars-cov-2 20108 chinese experts recommend that all cases of covid-19 who have no contraindications to cq should receive the drug in a dose of 500 milligrams twice daily for ten days 109 in the united states the fda endorsed an emergency use authorization to permit cq and hcq treatment for hospitalized patients for covid-19 109 there is a risk of potential toxicity with those medications including qtc prolongation cardiomyopathy and retinal toxicity given that and because of the previously described cases of myocarditis in covid-19 cq and hcq should be cautiously prescribed under close clinical supervision by specialists patients with myocarditis are expected to be more susceptible to cardiac adverse effects in addition drugdrug interactions should be considered before use and the patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects during use the american college of cardiology has recommended qtc monitoring parameters in that setting 110 in a study on 36 patients with covid-19 patients on hcq 200 mg three times per day for 10 days showed a higher rate of undetectable sars-cov-2 rna on nasopharyngeal specimens at day six compared to patients who received no specific treatment 70 versus 125 respectively 111 in this study the use of azithromycin in combination with hcq was apparently associated with a more rapid decline in viral rna however the control groups for the study were a concern and the biologic basis for using azithromycin in this setting is unclear another small observational study in patients with more severe illness did not suggest rapid viral rna clearance with the combination 112ivermectin is derived from avermectins produced by the microorganism streptomyces avermitilis which was discovered by mura 113 ivermectin which is a highly safe compound was later marketed to cover agricultural and aquaculture as well as the veterinary areas in 1981 ivermectin in the oral tablet dosage form is used to treat infections of parasites including the intestinal tract skin and eyes parasitic infectionsivermectin has numerous medical uses in which antiviral activity is considered one of the experimental targets ivermectin in sub-nanomolar range ec50 inhibits the replication of the yellow fever virus 113 ivermectin is also able to inhibit other flavivirus replication including dengue tick-borne encephalitis and japanese encephalitis viruses one of the mechanisms involved in this inhibition is the targeting of the activity of the non-structural enzyme 3 helicase 113 moreover ivermectin inhibits dengue viruses and interrupts virus replication 114 ivermectin has also been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of importin  which mediates the nuclear transport of several rna viruses thus ivermectin blocks the nuclear trafficking of rna viral proteins ivermectin has been shown to have potent antiviral activity against hiv-1 and dengue viruses both types of viruses depend on the importin protein system ivermectin may also disrupt the hiv-1 integrase in hiv-1 in addition to the ns-5 non-structural protein 5 polymerase in dengue viruses 115116 to investigate the effect of ivermectin on sars-cov-2 verohslam cells with sars-cov-2 that were isolated australiavic012020 were treated with ivermectin 117 ivermectin administration resulted in a successful viral loss by 48 h with no further reduction in viral rna at 72 h the authors hypothesized that ivermectin exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting the nuclear import of viral proteins that is mediated by importin1the same mechanism discussed before for other rna virusesmacrolides are a unique class of antibiotics that include erythromycin clarithromycin and azithromycin they have not only antimicrobial activity but also immunomodulatory reactions including anti-inflammatory effects lately the anti-viral effects of macrolides have been investigatederythromycin is the first macrolide proved to have efficacy in the treatment of rhinovirus and influenza virus 118 on the other hand clarithromycin and azithromycin have shown higher effectivity towards rhinovirus respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus 118119 in addition zika and ebola viruses have been shown to be inhibited by azithromycin 120121 during the early phase of influenza virus infection azithromycin has been found to block influenza virus endocytosis into host cells 119regarding macrolide treatment for covid-19 gautret et al hypothesized that hydroxychloroquine in addition to azithromycin might be an effective treatment for covid-19 the mechanism of azithromycin against sars-cov-2 is unclear however it may be similar to the mechanistic pathways of macrolides against the influenza virus 111several pathways for the suspected antiviral effects found with azithromycin have been suggested firstly as mentioned regarding cq and hcq azithromycin is a weak base that could inhibit endocytosis thus limiting viral entry and replication 122 secondly azithromycin directly affects the activity of bronchial epithelial cells and decreases mucus production thus improving lung function 123 thirdly there is evidence suggesting that azithromycin increases the production of ifn via the stimulation of ifn genes leading to a reduction of viral replication 124 lastly and recently azithromycin was shown to directly intervene with the sars-cov-2 host cell entry by inhibiting the interaction between sars-cov-2 spike protein and the host cell receptor ace2 125similar to sars-cov sars-cov-2 binds first with its s glycoprotein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace-2 a homologs enzyme to ace expresses on the membrane of lung epithelial cells which is followed by virus-cell fusion and viral entry see figure 1 125126127128 ace-2 is a zinc carboxypeptidase whose catalytic active site is exposed at the extracellular surface 126129 angiotensin ii angii is generated from angiotensin i angi after being cleaved by ace angii binds to angiotensin type 1 receptor at1r and functionally results in blood pressure elevation ace2 terminates the angii effect by degrading it into angiotensin-17 which binds to mas receptors on blood vessels thus resulting in a vasodilator effect 12 furthermore ace2 degrades angi into angiotensin-19 which is later converted into angiotensin-17 via ace 130 notably ace2 acts as a negative regulator in the reninaldosteroneangiotensin system and opposes the deleterious cardiovascular effects induced by that system 126129 angii plays an important role in regulating ace2 in the absence of abnormally elevated levels of ang ii complex formation between angiotensin receptor at1r and ace2 on the cell membrane is predominant 129 when angii levels increase the at1race2 complex is disrupted and triggers ace2 cellular internalization with subsequent lysosomal degradation via an at1r-dependent pathway 129131angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor acei and angiotensin ii receptor blocker arb are two related categories of antihypertensive treatment that are extensively used to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases acei and arb increase the expression of ace2 on the lung epithelial cell surface 126129 therefore it has been suggested that treatment with acei or arb could have a higher expression of cell membrane-bound ace2 exposing essential binding sites to sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein however the reduction of angii synthesis by acei or the inhibition of angiis physiological effect via arb is thought to leave at1r in interaction with ace2 129 this interaction could block the affinity of sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein to ace2 and hence reduce sars-cov-2 viral entry 129 furthermore dijkman et al suggested that viral replication directly diminishes cellular ace2 levels 130 this may explain the lung protection role for acei and arb via increasing the ace2 levels and opposing the sars-cov-2 infection consequenceslosartan is an at1r blocker that is widely applied in the management of hypertension and to slow down the nephropathy progression in patients with diabetes mellitus it is a safe drug with infrequent adverse drug events 132 interestingly around 50 of hospitalized sars-cov patients have developed hypotension during their hospital stay 133 no published clinical data are yet available on hypotension rates among hospitalized nct04312009 or non-hospitalized nct04311177 sars-cov-2 patients it is thus too early to estimate how safe at1r blockers in targeting covid-19 without developing exacerbated hypotensionanother approach for treatment of covid-19 is to use a soluble form of ace2 a recombinant human ace2 rhace2 apn01 and gsk2586881 is safe in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 134135 treatment with rhace2 rapidly abolishes the elevated levels angiotensin-ii with a trend to decrease the plasma concentration of il-6 a small clinical trial of rhace2 in patients with severe sars-cov-2 infection was recently initiated nct04287686logically low cellular membrane ace2 expression may reduce the chance of cells to be entered by sars-cov-2 but at the same time it leads to the activation of at1r with subsequent lung tissue injury however the higher the expression of ace2 on the lung cell surface the higher the chance of viral entry and the lower chance lung injury due to minimal at1r activation this is the main reason why aceiarb or rhace2 may be useful in covd-19 treatment these opposing effects of ace2 and hence aceiarb or rhace2 treatment in sars-cov-2 infection need more investigationin-vitro studies have shown that endosomal cysteine proteases namely cathepsin b ctsb and l ctsl can activate the glycoproteins of filoviruses sars-cov other coronaviruses nipah virus niv and hendra virus hev through a mechanism that facilitates virus entry into certain cell lines 136 in addition other molecules that can lead to the activation of coronaviruses include tmprss2 and other serine proteases present extracellularly or present at the cell surface 137 tmprss2 activity is crucial for viral spread and pathogenesis in an infected host 16138 and camostat mesylate is a serine protease inhibitor that inhibits sars-cov activation by tmprss 139 camostat mesylate also inhibits the replication of both influenza and parainfluenza viruses in experimentally infected mice camostat was also found to prevent the development of pneumonia and viral myocarditis 140 moreover camostat mesylate has been found to help to slow down or inhibit chronic pancreatitis in animal models and has been used for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis patients in japan 141 therefore camostat mesylate could also be of benefit in patients infected with sars-cov-2 table 1 the drugs presented in this review are possible pharmacological modalities to covid 19 but most of them are proposed based on their possible pharmacological mechanism to target virus entry replication and associated complications the management of covid 19 is rapidly evolving as all available therapies are currently being investigated in clinical trials and information will continue to emerge regarding pharmacological therapy for sars-cov-2 while awaiting the further development of clinical guidelines the rational use of therapies should be ensured by local protocols based on the clinical expertisecoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 spread to most countries in the world within five months of initial reports in china as of 22 april 2020 more than 25 million infections and 178 thousand deaths had been reported1
several drugs including remdesivir favipiravir ribavirin lopinavir-ritonavir used in combination and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have been highlighted on the basis of promising in vitro results and therapeutic experiences from two other coronavirus diseasessevere acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome2 however none of these promising results has yet been translated into clinical benefits in patients with covid-19 with a failed trial of lopinavir-ritonavir being the most recently reported3
chloroquine and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine best known as antimalarial drugs are prominent on the list of potential covid-19 treatments owing to potent antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 in the in vitro studies and news reports of promising results from some ongoing trials4

6 despite their unclear benefits chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are both recommended for off label use in the treatment of covid-19 by the chinese national guideline7 and the us food and drug administration recently authorised them for emergency use8 us president donald trump also recently recommended use of hydroxychloroquine such a presidential endorsement stimulated an rapid increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine which obscured the negative aspects of this drug deaths due to chloroquine overdoses have been reported in nigeria among people self-treating for apparent covid-199 retinopathy and gastrointestinal and cardiac side effects are well documented with the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of malarial and rheumatic diseases10 hydroxychloroquine is preferred in clinical applications owing to its lower toxicity particularly retinal toxicity10 and three times the potency against sars-cov-2 infection compared with chloroquine in a recent in vitro study5 no convincing evidence from well designed clinical trials exists to support the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with good efficacy and safety for the treatment of covid-19 rapidly conducting such trials with high quality is challenging in the face of a dangerous coronavirus outbreak in which healthcare workers have an overwhelming amount of work and the highest risk of developing covid-1911
having encountered many challenges we conducted a multicentre open label randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in adult patients with covid-19the principal investigators qx gs gn and jq designed and initiated the study after approval of the protocol by the institutional review board in ruijin hospital on 6 february 2020 the protocol and approval documents are available in the online supplement all patients gave written informed consent the principal investigators invited hospitals with the capability to provide the current standard of care for covid-19 to participate in the study minimum requirements for the standard of care included the provision of intravenous fluids supplemental oxygen regular laboratory testing sars-cov-2 testing haemodynamic monitoring and intensive care as well as the ability to deliver concomitant medications the trial was conducted urgently during the outbreak of covid-19 in compliance with the declaration of helsinki good clinical practice guidelines and local regulatory requirements shanghai pharmaceuticals holding donated the investigated drug hydroxychloroquine but was not involved in the study design accrual analyses of data or preparation of the manuscript a contract research organisation rg pharmastudies was hired to assist in the study design data collection and cleaning and statistical analyses data were recorded by clinical research coordinators followed by queries from clinical research associates the study statistician then entered confirmed data into the openclinica database for statistical analyses performed by and reviewed by the senior statistician in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines data collection forms and statistical analysis plans are available in the online supplementan independent data and safety monitoring committee idmc periodically reviewed the progress and oversight of the study the interim analysis took place on 14 march and the results were presented to the idmc the rapid decline in eligible new cases of covid-19 in china at that time precluded recruitment of our targeted number of patients after a two round extensive review of the efficacy and safety data generated from the interim analysis the idmc endorsed an early termination of the trial members of the committee all agreed that the data from the trial are important for clinicians the public and the government to avoid inappropriate use of hydroxychloroquine in the clinical management of covid-19 particularly in areas with overwhelming patient numbers the report of the trial could be an important resource to facilitate better design of future trials the results of this clinical trial are reported in accordance with consort consolidated standards of reporting trials guidelinesthis study was a multicentre randomised parallel open label trial of hydroxychloroquine in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 patients were enrolled by the site investigators in 16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres in three provinces in china hubei henan and anhui no placebo was used and drugs were not masked we applied stratified random sampling to stratify all eligible patients according to disease severity mildmoderate or severe followed by random assignment in a 11 ratio in each stratum to ensure a balanced distribution of disease severity between treatment hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care and control standard of care only groups ll designed the randomisation rules together with the principal investigators and an independent statistician who was not involved in data analysis implemented them equal numbers of cards with each group assignment number randomly generated by computer were placed in sequentially numbered envelopes that were opened as the patients were enrolled all patients were managed with standard of care aligned with the indications from the updated national clinical practice guidelines for covid-19 in china patients in the treatment group were given hydroxychloroquine within 24 hours after randomisation with a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days total treatment duration was two weeks for patients with mild to moderate disease and three weeks for those with severe disease the dose of hydroxychloroquine was adjusted when adverse events were related to hydroxychloroquine as judged by investigators details of dose adjustment are provided in the study protocol available in the online supplement patients investigators and statisticians were not masked to treatment assignment laboratory technicians who did virological chemical and other routine measurements were unaware of treatment informationinclusion criteria were age 18 years or older ongoing sars-cov-2 infection confirmed in upper or lower respiratory tract specimens with real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr willingness to participate and consent not to be enrolled in other clinical trials during the study period pneumonia on computed tomography of the chest was not mandatory for inclusionexclusion criteria were age below 18 years severe conditions including malignancies heart liver or kidney disease or poorly controlled metabolic diseases unsuitability for oral administration

haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in the original protocol patients with severe covid-19 were excluded considering that the anti-inflammatory property of hydroxychloroquine might favour disease regression we decided to include patients with severe covid-19 change approved by the ethics committee on 17 february 2020the definition of disease severity of covid-19 was based on the fifth version of the chinese guideline for the management of covid-1912 mild disease includes patients with mild symptoms but no manifestation of pneumonia on imaging moderate disease includes patients with fever

treatment and post-treatment follow-up at scheduled visits on days 4 7 10 14 21 and 28 the local centre for disease control and prevention or authorised health institutions or hospitals at each site measured sars-cov-2 by using assays approved by the national medical products administration measurements were performed according to the recommendations of the national institute for viral disease control and prevention china httpivdcchinacdccnkyjz202001t20200121211337html methods for extraction and amplification of total rna through rt-pcr were similar to those described elsewhere13 rather than quantitative data cycle threshold value reported from the rt-pcr assay we collected only qualitative data reported from our trial sites on the basis of a national recommendation we defined a cycle threshold value less than 37 as a positive test result and a cycle threshold value of 40 or more as a negative test cycle threshold values between 37 and 40 confirmed by retesting were reported as unclassifiedin addition to sars-cov-2 testing patients were assessed on each scheduled visit for vital signs c reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate tumour necrosis factor  interleukin 6 complete blood cell count with differential blood chemistry coagulation panel pulse oximetry and respiratory symptoms records of administration of hydroxychloroquine and adverse events were reviewed daily to ensure fidelity to the protocol and more importantly patient safety computed tomography of the chest was assessed on screening and at the last visit of the treatment period day 14 for patients with mild to moderate disease and day 21 for severe disease computed tomography examinations of the chest could be exempted by the investigators if the participants could provide qualified examination results within three days before the start of the study more details on data collection are provided in the protocol available in the supplementthe primary outcomes for this trial were whether patients had negative conversion of sars-cov-2 by 28 days and whether patients with severe covid-19 had clinical improvement by 28 days however as the trial was stopped early and only two patients with severe disease were enrolled results on clinical improvement are not presented we defined negative conversion of sars-cov-2 as two consecutive reports of a negative result for sars-cov-2 at least 24 hours apart without a subsequent report of a positive result by the end of the study we considered the date of the first negative report as the date of negative conversion in the original protocol the primary endpoint was prespecified as the negative conversion rate by day 10 approved by the ethics committee on 6 february 2020 however with the increasing knowledge of covid-19 from our clinical practice we realised that the duration of sars-cov-2 in respiratory samples of many patients was longer than 10 days recently highlighted by a detailed virological study14 we therefore modified our primary outcome to test whether patients had a negative conversion of sars-cov-2 by 28 days approved by the ethics committee on 17 february 2020 probability of negative conversion at day 4 7 10 14 or 21 was specified as a secondary outcome in the protocol but this does not appear on the trial registration list the listed secondary outcome in the trial registration was adverse events coded using the latest version of medical dictionary for regulatory activities coding dictionary recorded in standard medical terminology and graded according to the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for adverse eventsother prespecified secondary outcomes not listed in the trial registration but included in the protocol were the probabilities of alleviation of clinical symptoms improvement of c reactive protein erythrocyte sedimentation rate tumour necrosis factor  interleukin 6 and absolute blood lymphocyte count improvement of lung lesions on chest radiology all cause death and disease progression in patients with mild to moderate disease the time frame for these secondary outcomes was from randomisation to 28 days prespecified secondary outcomes for patients with severe disease are not listed here but are included in the protocol owing to the early termination of our study we could not justify the results from these analyses with an underpowered sample size and therefore decided not to emphasise them in this paper to avoid misinterpretation the only one presented here is the alleviation of clinical symptoms within 28 days which is an important outcome of interest prespecified in our protocol the definition of the alleviation of clinical symptoms was resolving from fever to an axillary temperature of 366c or below normalisation of spo2 94 on room air and disappearance of respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion cough sore throat sputum production and shortness of breathin the original protocol the target number of enrolments was set to 200 without type i error control in the updated protocol approved by the ethics committee on 10 february 2020 we considered type i and type ii error control and recalculated the sample size the sample size was calculated on the basis of the alternative hypothesis of a 30 increase in the rate of conversion to negative for sars-cov-2 as defined by virus nucleic acid negativity with the assumption that time to conversion follows an exponential distribution if the median time to conversion with hydroxychloroquine can be reduced from 10 days to seven days a total of 248 events would provide a power of 80 to detect a hazard ratio of 07 standard of care v hydroxychloroquine with a log rank test additionally we assumed a 75 day accrual period and a seven day follow-up after enrolment of the last patient so about 360 patients 180 per group would be randomised in the study an interim analysis was planned when around 150 patients were treated for at least seven days we applied the obrien-fleming cumulative  spending function by lan-demets algorithm to control for family-wise type i error005we estimated the overall probability of negative conversion by analysing time to negative conversion of sars-cov-2 using the kaplan-meier method in the intention to treat population and compared groups with a log rank test we considered patients who did not reach the negative conversion of sars-cov-2 see definition in outcome section by the cut-off date of the analysis 14 march 2020 to be right censored at the last visit date all these patients remained in hospital and may have reached negative conversion after our last visit date but the specific timing of the event is unknown we applied similar approaches to the analysis of alleviation of symptoms we used the rate difference between groups to show the treatment effect size and estimated 95 confidence intervals by an approximate normal distribution and the standard error by the bootstrap method n1000 we used a cox model to estimate the hazard ratio hazard ratios greater than one indicate that the rate of negative conversion of virus or alleviation of symptoms was higher in the hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care group than in the standard of care only group safety analyses were based on the patients actual exposure to treatment we used sas version 94 for data analysesno patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment design or implementation of the study no patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results there are no plans to disseminate the results of the research to study participants or the relevant patient communityof 191 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 from 11 to 29 february 2020 41 did not meet the eligibility criteria the remaining 150 patients were randomised 75 patients were assigned to standard of care and 75 patients to standard of

6 participants in our trial had mainly mild to moderate disease with a median 16 day delay between symptom onset and hydroxychloroquine treatment so the negative results of our trial are applicable only to patients with persistently mild to moderate covid-19 covid-19 has overwhelmed hospital systems during the pandemic and many of these patients may be treated in the community and may finally be admitted to hospital because of a need for oxygen or owing to rapid deterioration of the disease data from our trial do not provide evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in this population particularly considering the increased adverse events discussed below our trial could not assess the antiviral efficacy of hydroxychloroquine at an earlier stage such as within 48 hours of onset of the illness the golden window for antiviral treatment in influenza15 however conducting such a trial is challenging in patients admitted to hospital and will be easier in outpatient or community settings the fact that antiviral treatment was not restricted in our trial should also be considered when interpreting our results seeing the antiviral effects of hydroxychloroquine when compared with a pure control arm would be more conclusive in the early dangerous outbreak of covid-19 in china however setting a restriction on drugs that could be potentially useful was not ethical nevertheless the use of antiviral drugs before and after randomisation was balanced between the hydroxychloroquine and standard of care groups and thus might have little effect on our primary endpoint moreover use of a higher dose of hydroxychloroquine than was used in our trial is not likely to have additional antiviral effects because the dosage of hydroxychloroquine that we chose achieves the 50 effective concentration ec50 of hydroxychloroquine against sars-cov-25 although we did not monitor the concentration of hydroxychloroquine in our study another important message from our trial is that the kaplan-meier curve crossed over with time suggesting a potential for a non-constant hazard ratio of negative conversion conferred by exposure to hydroxychloroquine therefore the hazard ratios presented in our trial should be interpreted as weighted results over time rather than as a definitive constant we will investigate this in the future further trials might also need to combat this problem when using the cox regression method taken together future studies could take advantage of our results to design trials in a more selective population at the earliest stage possible 48 hours from illness onset and using more sensitive endpoints such as viral load sheddinghydroxychloroquine in our trial was given at a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily for a total treatment duration of two weeks or three weeks for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease respectively serious adverse events occurred in two patients and both were reported in hydroxychloroquine recipients the overall frequency of adverse events was significantly higher in hydroxychloroquine recipients than in non-recipients gastrointestinal events particularly diarrhoea were most commonly reported as they were in another study using a high dose of hydroxychloroquine16 transient blurred vision was reported in one patient whose symptoms recovered two days after discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine early development of retinal damage with a daily dose of 800 to 1200 mg was detected using sensitive retinal screening tests17 therefore the retinal damage could be underestimated in our trial events of cardiac arrhythmia such as prolonged qt interval18 were not observed in our trial possibly because of the relatively mild to moderate disease of patients investigated or the short term period of follow-up however with increasing interest in the combined use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin worldwide physicians should be cautious about the increased risk of prolongation of the qt interval and fatal ventricular arrhythmia with azithromycin and other antimicrobial agents19
20 drug-drug interaction should be taken into consideration when assessing safety and efficacy endpoints in future trials of hydroxychloroquine10 the effects of hydroxychloroquine in causing increased concentrations of digitoxin and metoprolol would be particularly relevant in patients with severe covid-19 and would therefore require close monitoring21
this study provides the first and timely evidence about the benefit-risk profile of hydroxychloroquine derived from a multicentre randomised controlled trial which was started during the most challenging time of the covid-19 outbreak in china in such a situation our study has several limitations firstly the open label as opposed to double blind design introduces the possibility of biased investigator determined assessments and unbalanced dosage adjustment urgent production of placebos mimicking hydroxychloroquine and the management of a multicentre placebo controlled trial remain challenging during the pandemic secondly the use of sequential envelopes is inferior to the interactive web response management system for randomisation thirdly the setting of our trial among patients admitted to hospital precluded us from enrolling patients at the early stage of disease in addition we cannot provide evidence on the effect of hydroxychloroquine on disease progression or regression because 148150 99 patients in our trial had mild to moderate diseasefourthly the results of our main prespecified outcomes are not entirely conclusive being based on an underpowered sample size due to the lack of enough eligible patients to enrol the recruitment of eligible patients was unexpectedly difficult with many clinical trials launched in the same period in response to the urgent call by the national health authorities for the exploration of effective treatment against covid-19 the rapid decline in eligible new cases owing to the successful containment of covid-19 in the middle of march 2020 in china precluded further recruitment to reach our targeted sample size the premature termination of our trial also led to increased censoring of data on our primary outcome we therefore reanalysed the probability of negative conversion in the two groups by using follow-up data to 27 april 2020 supplementary table b and the results were consistent with our reported resultsfifthly ensuring fidelity to the protocol by site investigators under highly challenging circumstances in the covid-19 treatment centres was difficult hiring a contract research organisation as we did in our trial can greatly support the conduct and oversight of trials sixthly population quarantine of wuhan and neighbouring cities nationwide travel restrictions and isolation of cases and contacts were also barriers to collecting and transferring data and paper files several prespecified secondary endpoints including the changes on computed tomography of the chest were therefore not finished by the cut-off date for analysis finally the specimens collected in our trial for virus rna determination were mostly from the upper respiratory tract rather than bronchoalveolar lavage fluid which could introduce false negative results22 however the prespecified definition for negative conversion of virus was two consecutive negative results at least 24 hours apart which can reduce false negativitythe results of our trial did not show additional benefits of virus elimination from adding hydroxychloroquine to the current standard of care in patients with mainly persistent mild to moderate covid-19 adverse events particularly gastrointestinal events were more frequently reported in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine who were given a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days for a total treatment duration of two weeks in patients with mild to moderate disease and three weeks in those with severe disease overall these data do not support the addition of hydroxychloroquine to the current standard of care in patients with persistent mild to moderate covid-19 for eliminating the virus our trial may provide initial evidence for the benefit-risk profile of hydroxychloroquine and serve as a resource to support further researchcoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 was declared as pandemic by the world health organization on march 11th 2020 mainly due to the speed and scale of the transmission of the disease 1 before that it started as an epidemic in mainland china with the focus being firstly reported in the city of wuhan hubei province in february 26th 234 the etiologic agent of covid-19 was isolated and identified as a novel coronavirus initially designated as 2019-ncov 5 later the virus genome was sequenced 6 and because it was genetically related to the coronavirus outbreak responsible for the sars outbreak of 2003 the virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 by the international committee for taxonomy of viruses 78the origin and source of the sars-cov-2 remains unknown although the initial cases have been associated with the huanan south china seafood market where snakes birds and other animals such as bats were sold considering that many of the early patients worked in or visited the market in contrast to the exported cases it was suggested either a human to human transmission or a more widespread animal source 9 a suspected bat origin was suggested after 96 genome sequence identity was demonstrated between sars-cov-2 and another coronavirus named bat-cov-ratg13 isolated from bat species which colonized a province nearly 2000 km away from wuhan 610 pangolins were also suggested as natural host of coronaviruses 1112 however evidence of human to human transmission became strongly supported on january 22nd 2020 after a visit conducted by a who delegation to the city of wuhan 13 since the first outbreak recognized in february 2020 the disease spread rapidly around the world according to the european centre for disease prevention and control as of 17th of june 2020 8142129 cases of covid-19 and 443488 deaths have been reported worldwide since 31st december 2019 american continent was among the ones with highest number of cases 3987543 with united states and brazil the leading countries 2137731 and 923189 respectivelyseveral sars-cov-2 samples have been isolated from different people and genomic sequences have been available aiming to better understand the virus and to provide information for the development of diagnostic tools and a potential vaccine to date more than 42000 sars-cov-2 rna genomes have been uploaded in the global initiative on sharing all influenza data known as gisaid 14sars-cov-2 belongs to the beta subgrouping of the coronaviridae family and are enveloped virus containing a positive-sense single- stranded rna with 29891 bases of size 1516 the genome encodes for 29 proteins involved in the infection replication and virion assembly process like other coronaviruses they are characterized by the presence of crown-like spikes on their surface 17 the spike s protein from sars-cov-2 contains a receptor binding domain rbd that binds the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 and thereby promotes membrane fusion and uptake of the virus into human cells by endocytosis 1819 the rbd present in the spike protein is the most variable region of the coronavirus genome 620 structural and biochemical studies have suggested that rbd from sars-cov-2 binds with high affinity to ace2 compared to other sars-cov viruses 212223 however the human ace2 protein variability may also be a factor for the high binding affinity 21sars-cov-2 can be transmitted human to human by respiratory droplets close contact with diseased patients and possibly by fecal-oral and aerosol contact 242526 it was recently shown that airborne transmission is highly virulent and represents the dominant route to spread the disease 27 this finding was obtained based on the analysis of the trend and mitigation measures in three different cities considered epicenters of covid-19 wuhan china italy and new york city in the period from january 23 to may 9 2020 importantly this result reveals that among the adopted mitigation measures such as social distancing and wearing of masks the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the trends of the pandemic and spread of the disease majority of sars-cov-2 infected individuals 80 are asymptomatic or present mild symptoms most likely due to a good immune response able to control the advance of the disease 2829 there is evidence that these asymptomatic people can infect others with sars-cov-2 3031 in the other hand symptomatic individuals may evolve to more severe symptoms and eventual death the best way to prevent transmission and illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus therefore some recommendations include wash hands often avoid close contact cover mouth and nose with a mask cover coughs and sneezes and clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily 32 in this regard wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission 27 fig 1
upon cell contact the virus can enter the cells in two ways either via endosomes or plasma membrane fusion in both ways spike proteins s1 e s2 from sars-cov-2 mediate attachment to the cell membrane by binding to the ace2 as the entry receptor 33 on the other hand virions are taken up into endosomes spike proteins are activated by cathepsin l or alternatively by transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 in close proximity to ace2 receptor which initiates fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane the latter mechanism is less likely to trigger an antiviral immune response and is more efficient for viral replication 34once inside the cell viral rna is released and polyproteins are translated coronavirus genomic rna encodes nonstructural proteins ns that play a critical role in viral rna synthesis and structural proteins which are important for new virion assembly first ns proteins 1a and 1ab are translated and cleaved by the papain-like protease pipro and 3c-like protease 3clpro to form functional ns proteins such as helicase or rna-dependent rna polymerase complex rdrp structural proteins s1 s2 envelope e membrane m are translated by ribosomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum er and presented on its surface as a preparation of virion assembly the nucleocapsids n remain in the cytoplasm and are assembled together with the genomic rna the virion precursor is then transported from the er through the golgi apparatus to the cell surface via vesicles finally virions are released from the infected cell through exocytosis and a new replication cycle begins 1535 fig 2
symptoms and signs associated with viral pneumonia such as fever cough sore throat headache fatigue myalgia and dyspnea are frequently shown by patients during the onset of covid-19 363738394041 additionally loss of taste or smell and gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea vomiting or diarrhea has also been reported by infected patients 424344 nevertheless disease severity seems to be strongly associated with underlying host conditions including age sex and overall health the latter seems to play a critical role in susceptibility and contribute to the risk of infection when severe and non severe patients are compared conditions such as hypertension diabetes cardiovascular and kidney diseases increase the risk of infection two to three-fold 45the macrocyclic lactone antibiotic azithromycin has been shown to have in vitro activity against zika and ebola viruses 100101 azithromycin has also shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity 102103 additionally it has shown to induce interferon type i ifn- ifn- and type iii ifn- in cells from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and decrease rhinovirus-16 viral load in bronchial epithelial cells 104 most of the cytokines induced by azithromycin is related to viral infection response and in turn induce resistance to viral replication in target cells 105106 the in vitro concentration ec50 50 effective concentration for azithromycin against sars-cov-2 was determined as 212 m following 72 hours incubation period post infection 107 several studies in covid-19 patients have been showing limitations considering that they focused mainly on viral load as end point and detailed clinical outcomes are generally lacking nevertheless collectively they present preliminary evidence that inclusion of azithromycin in various treatment regimens can influence the course of viral infection and potentially influence clinical outcomes 108109 yet there are still controversies regarding efficacy of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 while a french study have shown 100  reduction of viral load in six patients treated with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in contrast with 571 of patients treated with only hydroxychloroquine another study showed no efficacy at all in a case series with eleven patients treated with the same combination 109110 thus confirmation and validation are still needed before a conclusion on the efficacy of azithromycin can be reached the contradictory results reported so far is one of the reasons suggesting that additional randomized controlled trials is essential to confirm these preliminary data and help to understand the benefits and the role of azithromycin in treatment combinations used to treat covid-19 infection clinical trials are currently ongoing to fill up these gapschloroquine is a drug that has been used worldwide as anti-malarial as well as for the treatment of immune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus 111112 the first indication of a potential effect of chloroquine on sars-cov-2 infection came from a report during china outbreak in this study results from more than 100 patients demonstrated that chloroquine inhibited the exacerbation of pneumonia improved lung imaging findings promoted a virus negative conversion and shortening of the disease course 113 before the covid-19 outbreak previous studies with chloroquine had shown its ability to inhibit in vitro the viral replication of another coronavirus sars-cov responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome 114115hydroxychloroquine is a less toxic derivative of chloroquine that has shown lower half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 compared to chloroquine in inhibiting sars-cov-2 in vitro 116 additional studies confirmed this finding 117118119120 a small study open-label non-randomized clinical trial with 36 confirmed covid-19 patients was conducted in france the end point was the presence or absence of virus after six days from the inclusion in the protocol the results showed a significant association between hydroxychloroquine treatment and viral load reductiondisappearance and this effect was reinforced by azithromycin 109 important to note that in this study clinical severity of the patients ranged from asymptomatic to pneumonia ie none of them was critically ill also the results of this study was questioned by the international society of antimicrobial chemotherapy isac which declared that due to the lack of clear explanation of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety it did not meet the expected standard of that organization nonetheless an analysis of the data reported in gautret work using a pharmacokinetic model claim to confirm that co-treatment of covid-19 with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin increases the probability of negative-pcr in patients the analysis also showed that clinical status affects the treatment outcome since the analysis was based on limited published data the results need to be interpreted with caution 121basically three mechanisms have been proposed for the antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquinechloroquine first the drugs interfere with the terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor ace2 thus preventing virus-receptor binding secondly the drugs increase the ph of acidic cellular organelles hampering endocytosis at intermediate stages with negative effects on virion transport and potentially altering post-translational modification of newly synthesized viral proteins and third the drugs may disturb the process of virion assembly and viral protein synthesis 119122despite the lack of strong and reliable evidence of efficacy due to the pressure that covid-19 has imposed worldwide many health authorities have implemented official guidelines on the use hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of patients with covid-19 123124125 regarding the side effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine both have been in clinical use for several years thus their safety profile is well established 126 gastrointestinal upset has been reported with hydroxychloroquine and retinal toxicity has been described with long term use of both drugs 127128129 retinal toxicity may also be related to over-dosage 130 additionally cardiomyopathy and heart arrhythmia have been reported 131132 to address the effect of chloroquine hydroxychloroquine in combination or not with azithromycin on the qt interval a measure of delayed ventricular repolarization a prospective observational study was performed in hospitalized patients with sars-cov-2 the primary outcome evaluated in this study was qt prolongation resulting in torsade de pointes tdp and cardiac death the results showed that for the two hundred one patients treated for covid-19 with chloroquinehydroxychloroquine baseline qt intervals did not differ between patients treated with chloroquinehydroxychloroquine and patients treated with these drugs and azithromycin however during treatment the maximum qt was significantly longer in the combination group compared to the monotherapy group and seven patients required discontinuation of the medications but no arrhythmogenic deaths were reported the authors concluded that although clinicians seldomly needed to discontinue therapy further studies are needed before final recommendations can be made 133 a multinational registry evaluation of the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without a macrolide for the treatment of covid-19 using data from 671 hospitals in six continents was recently published 134 in this study was included patients hospitalized between dec 20 2019 and april 14 2020 with a positive laboratory finding for sars-cov-2 patients were included in one of four treatments chloroquine alone chloroquine with a macrolide hydroxychloroquine alone or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group from a total of 96032 patients analyzed 14888 patients were in the treatment groups 1868 received chloroquine 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide 3016 received hydroxychloroquine and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide and 81144 patients were in the control group the study concluded that after controlling for multiple confounding factors age sex race or ethnicity body-mass index underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors diabetes underlying lung disease smoking immunosuppressed condition and baseline disease severity it was not possible to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used alone or with a macrolide on in-hospital outcomes for covid-19 each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of covid-19 134 of note this study was performed with hospitalized patients most of them with associated comorbidities regrettably this study was recently withdrawn under suspect of flawed data and ethical concerns about the methodology used in the analysis before this announcement clinical trials designed to address the safety and efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin were suspended temporarily by the world health organization authorities based on the published results however they stepped back and authorized the continuation of the ongoing clinical trials therefore a great debate persists whether individuals with confirmed covid-19 with mild symptoms or asymptomatic could benefit from treatment with these drugsivermectin is best known as an antiparasitic agent sold with the commercial name stromectol but it has also demonstrated antiviral activities toward human immunodeficiency virus hiv and dengue virus 135 ivermectin targets the host nuclear transport importin 1 heterodimer which the virus relies for the replication and assembly of new virions 136 this drug was shown to inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro replication for up to 48 h at a concentration of 5 m the 50 inhibition concentration ic50 was determined as 2 m which was much higher than the maximum plasma concentration 137 a study was performed aiming to predict total bound and unbound and unbound plasma concentration-time profiles after the administration of fda approved dose 200 mgkg 60 mgkg and 120 mgkg the results of this study showed that plasma concentrations did not reach the ic50 even at doses higher than the approved furthermore the authors concluded that after oral administration with the approved dose it is unlikely that ivermectin reaches the ic50 in the lungs and therefore the likelihood of a successful clinical trial would be low despite these results combination therapy with other agents may be beneficial and it has been suggested 138 moreover studies with animal models have shown up to 3-fold higher levels in pulmonary tissue than in plasma one week after oral dosing demonstrating the need for further research to better evaluate the effectivity of ivermectin for the treatment of respiratory viruses such as sars-cov-2 139lopinavir is an aspartate protease inhibitor that has demonstrated high specificity against human immunodeficiency virus hiv type 1 lopinavir was developed by the pharmaceutical company abbot and is sold by the brand name kaletra this drug is generally administered in combination with ritonavir due to its poor oral bioavailability rapid biotransformation and to increase its half-life through the inhibition of cytochrome p450 140 in the hiv-1 infection context the lopinavir hydroxy ethylene bond mimics the normal peptide cleaved by the virus hiv-1 protease 141 during the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic in 2003 lopinavir was tested in vitro and showed inhibitory activity against sars-cov 140142143 a multicenter retrospective study matched cohort study was performed by chan et al 144 to investigate possible benefits and adverse effects of the addition of lopinavirritonavir to a standard treatment protocol for the treatment of sars they showed that as an initial treatment the protocol used was associated with a significant reduction in the overall death rate and intubation rate when compared with a matched cohort who received standard treatment another study reported in 2004 suggested that the addition of lopinavirritonavir compared to a control group who received the antiviral ribavirin reduced the risk of adverse clinical outcomes and viral load among patients with sars 140 one study reported a case of a single patient in the initial phase of sars-cov-2 outbreak in korea who was identified as an index patient that caused secondary and tertiary transmission the administration of lopinavirritonavir to this patient significantly decreased the viral load and no or little coronavirus titers were observed during follow-up 145nevertheless in another study reporting a randomized controlled open-label trial involving 199 hospitalized adult patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection the use of lopinavirritonavir showed no benefit beyond standard care this study had the time to clinical improvement as the primary end point 146nitazoxanide belongs to the class of drugs known as thiazolides it has a broad spectrum antiparasitic and it has also shown to have broad spectrum antiviral activity nitazoxanide has been previously shown to exhibit in vitro activity against mers-cov and other coronaviruses 147 haffizulla et al showed that when nitazoxanide was given in a regimen of 600 mg twice daily for 5 days it reduced the duration of symptoms in patients with acute uncomplicated influenza with minor adverse effects 148 several recommendations have been made suggesting the potential use of nitazoxanide to treat sars-cov-2 infection but they have been often ignored 149 a recent review evaluated nine nitazoxanide research clinical trials to assess the safety cost and potential use of this drug for covid-19 150 the authors concluded that this drug demonstrate good safety profile at approved doses although further evidence is required regarding hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects as well as teratogenicity if efficacy of nitazoxanide is clinically proven against covid-19 it may represent an affordable and safe treatment to date the 15th of june 2020 twelve nitazoxanide clinical trials undergoing worldwide have been registered on the clinicaltrialgov website five of them recruiting volunteers table 2
remdesivir is a phosphoramidate nucleoside analogue prodrug and a broad-spectrum antiviral agent commercialized by the pharmaceutical company gilead 151 it has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against coronaviruses causing mers and sars which are structurally similar do sars-cov-2 152 remdesivir demonstrated to potent block sars-cov-2 infection at low concentrations with a half-maximal effective concentration ec50 of 077 m 120 a report on a single case patient described clinical improvement after use of remdesivir intravenously to treat the first united states case of covid-19 153 another study reported a compassionate use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94 or less or who were receiving oxygen support 154 the authors observed clinical improvement in 36 of 53 patients 68 treated with remdesivir consisting of a loading dose of 200 mg intravenously on day 1 plus 100 mg daily for the following 9 days however the authors suggested that efficacy will require ongoing randomized placebo controlled trialsnotwithstanding these results a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study with 237 patients enrolled showed that use of remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits patients receiving redemsivir had a numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement compared to placebo although theses results were not statistically significant 155 this study had to be terminated early due to the adverse events observed in the patientsfavipiravir commercially sold as avigan is a pyrazinecarboxamide derivative and guanine analogue that has shown to selectively inhibit the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp of rna viruses interfering with the assembly of viable virus 156157 this drug has shown activity against many rna viruses such as influenza a virus alphavirus filovirus arena and norovirus as well as ebola virus 158 a study designed to evaluate the potential antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 included favipiravir in a panel of drugs tested favipiravir showed efficacy in vitro in infected vero e6 cells demonstrating a half-maximal effective concentration ec50 of 6188 m and half cytotoxic concentration over 400 m 120 in contrast choy et al showed that concentrations lower than 100 m has no effect against sars-cov-2 in vitro 159 on the other hand it has been shown that covid-19 patients treated with favipiravir show superior recovery rate 7143 than patients treated with umifenovir 5586 160 an open label nonrandomized controlled study examined the effects of favipiravir and lopinavirritonavir in 80 patients with confirmed covid-19 the study comprised two arms with one containing 35 patients treated with favipiravir day 1 1600 mg twice daily days 214 600 mg twice daily plus 5 ku twice daily ifn- and the other containing 45 patients treated with lopinavirritonavir days 114 400 mg100 mg twice daily plus 5 ku twice daily ifn- as a control group favipiravir treatment was associated with faster viral clearance significantly higher improvement rate in chest imaging and fewer adverse effects compared to the lopinavirritonavir arm 161 non-randomized and randomized controlled clinical trials aiming to investigate efficacy and safety of favipiravir alone or in combination with tocilizumab or chloroquine phosphate are currently ongoingumifenovir is an indole carboxylic acid derivative used for treating prophylaxis and infections associated with h1n1a and b arbovirus 162 also known as arbidol umifenovir acts by blocking the virus-cell membrane fusion and virus-endosome fusion through incorporation into cell membranes and interference with the phospholipids network organization 163 this drug showed in vitro activity against sars-cov-1 virus and was speculated to have activity against sars-cov-2 164 combination of umifenovir and lopinavirritonavir showed increased negative conversion rate of sars-cov-2 and improved chest ct scans results in a retrospective cohort study 165 however it was shown that patients treated with umifenovir demonstrated inferior outcome in clinical recovery rate and less improvement in symptoms like fever and cough when compared to favipiravir 160 in contrast another study evaluated the antiviral effects and safety of lopinavirritonavir and arbidol in fifty patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 they were divided into two groups lopinavirritonavir group consisting of 34 cases and arbidol group consisting of 16 cases the first group received 400 mg100 mg of lopinavirritonavir twice a day for a week while the second group was given 02 g arbidol three times a day rt-pcr assay was used to detect sars-cov-2 virus during antiviral therapy patients in the arbidol group had a shorter duration of positive rna test compared to those in the lopinavirritonavir group suggesting that arbidol monotherapy may be superior to lopinavirritonavir in treating covid-19 166 clinical trials aiming to investigate efficacy and safety of umifenovir alone or in combination are currently ongoingmethylprednisolone is one of the classical immunosuppressive drugs used to stop or delay the progress of pneumonia and have been proved to effective for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards patients with covid-19 pneumonia and severe cases develop rapidly to acute respiratory failure 39 therefore it is not a surprise that methylprednisolone became a drug of choice to use in severe cases in a retrospective cohort study with 201 patients with covid-19 who developed ard administration of 12 mgkgdaily iv for 57days apparently reduced the risk of death although 42 of patients who received this drug died compared to 618 who did not received the drug 167 early low-dose and short application of methylprednisolone was associated to improvement in clinical symptoms and a shortened disease course in another study with 46 patients with severe covid-19 168 a limited study with only 15 patients and no control group corroborated the benefits of low dose corticosteroids treatment in a subset of critically ill covid-19 pneumonia patients 169 another steroid that has been used in the treatment of acute respiratory syndromes before is the fluorinated steroid dexamethasone a synthetic member of the class of glucocorticoids at the closing of this review on june 17th the results of a randomized clinical trial established to examine the potential benefit of treatment with dexamethasone in covid-19 patients were announced by the university of oxford this study was part of the proposal called recovery randomized evaluation of covid-19 therapy and consisted of 2104 patients randomized to receive 6 mg once per day of dexamethasone either orally or by intravenous injection for ten days and 4321 patients randomized to receive standard care as mentioned before patients with severe covid-19 infection requires ventilation and oxygen support and unfortunately they are among the patients with high mortality rate dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third among ventilated patients and by one fifth among those receiving oxygen this benefit was not observed in patients who did not require respiratory support the announced yet unpublished study is encouraging and give support to the hypothesis that corticosteroids can be useful in the treatment of severe covid-19 patients reducing mortality 170some studies have been reporting that severe covid-19 patients present coagulopathy complications 39171172 disseminated intravascular coagulation is frequently observed in most of deaths caused by sars-cov-2 39 this observation led to the active application of anticoagulants such as heparin for patients with severe covid-19 in china notwithstanding the lack of efficacy validation 173 nevertheless tang et al 174 performed a retrospective study where they compared the 28-day mortality between a group of severe covid-19 patients who received heparin and a group who did not receive this anticoagulant no statistically difference in 28-day mortality was observed between groups 303 vs 297 p  0910 however in a group of patients presenting sepsis-induced coagulopathy with score greater than 4 those who received heparin showed a lower 28-day mortality than those who did not receive heparin 400 vs 642 p  0029 on the other hand negri et al 175 reported in a not yet peer-reviewed study a series of 27 consecutive covid-19 patients admitted at a hospital in so paulo-brazil and treated with heparin in therapeutic doses used in clinical severity the treatment with heparin improved the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen pao2fio2 and the mean time of discharge of 81 of theses patients were 114 days 175 cardiac arrhytmias are often the immediate cause of death in severe patients 176 therefore it has been suggested that the use of heparin in covid-19 severe patients would be useful not only due to its anticoagulant activity but also its antiarrhythmic property 177178179beyond the virus itself another factor considered to be important as primary cause of mortality of patients infected with sars-cov-2 is the pro-inflammatory response which can promote a cytokine storm and secondary bacterial infection therefore drugs acting as anti-inflammatory are thought to help decrease the severity of covid-19 patients interleukins 1 il-1 and il-1 are cytokines associated with innate immunity and damaging inflammation 180 il-1 was shown to reach peak levels at the time of disease onset in a study of ards assessing serial bronchoalveolar lavage fluids for cytokine content 181 anakinra sold by the brand name kineret is a recombinant il-1 receptor antagonist used to treat autoinflammatory disorders 182 a retrospective cohort study conducted in italy with patients with covid-19 moderate-to-severe ards and hyperinflammation demonstrated that high-dose intravenous anakinra was safe and associated with clinical improvement in 72 of the patients 183 despite the recognized limitations of this study the results are promising and a randomized phase two clinical trial nct04324021 is ongoing meanwhile a cohort prospective study was performed in france with participants who were admitted to groupe hospitalier paris saint-joseph with severe covid-19-related bilateral pneumonia on chest x-ray or lung ct scan from march 24 to april 6 2020 the anakinra group consisted of 52 consecutive patients that received subcutaneous anakinra 100 mg twice a day for 72 h then 100 mg daily for 7 days as well as the standard treatments at the institution at the time the control group consisted of 44 patients that received standard treatments and supportive care intensive care unit icu admission or death occurred in 13 25 patients in the anakinra group compared to 32 73 patients in the control group 184 these results suggest the need of more clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of anakinra to treat patients with severe covid-19 infectionbaricitinib is a janus kinase jak inhibitor licensed primarily for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and with good efficacy and safety records 185 interestingly this anti-inflammatory drug has been considered an option for treatment of covid-19 and its antiviral effect is believed to be related to its affinity for ap2 associated protein aak1 reducing sars-cov-2 endocytosis 186 cantini et al 187 reported a pilot study to evaluate the safety and clinical impact in covid-19 baricitinib was given to 12 patients with moderate covid-19 at a dose of 4 mgdayorally no adverse events were recorded after two weeks and clinical and respiratory parameters significantly improved at two weeks with no patients required admission to icu 187 caveats in this study is that no proper control group was includedinterleukin 6 il-6 tumor necrosis factor tnf and interferon gama ifn- are other targetable cytokines that play important role in the pathogenesis of lung seen in covid-19 excessive il-6 signaling induces several biological pathways including janus kinase jnk which contribute to organ damage 188 tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-il-6 antibody that binds both soluble and membrane bound il-6 receptor 189 a chinese study aiming to assess the efficacy of tocilizumab in 21 patients with covid-19 showed preliminary results demonstrating that this drug improved clinical outcome immediately in severe and critical patients and was an effective treatment to reduce mortality all 21 patients in the study were discharged on average 151d after giving tocilizumab 190interferons ifns are the first line of immune defense against viral infections its antiviral activity occurs by blocking viral replication and eliminating the virus-infected cells 191 several cellular proteins located in different compartments contain pattern recognition receptors prrs such as toll like receptors tlrs rig-i like receptors rlrs and cyclic amp-gmp synthase cgasstimulator of ifn genes sting that act as sensors for specific viral components 192193194 upon virus infection transcription factors such as interferon regulatory factors irfs and nuclear factor-b nf-b are activated by signaling pathways triggered by ligand-prrs interaction these transcription factors act cooperatively to induce the synthesis of type i interferons such as ifn- which in turn can induce the expression of several genes involved in blocking viral infection via janus kinase jaksignal transducer of transcription stat signaling pathway 195 interferon-1b treatment have shown to improve outcome of mers-cov infection in a nonhuman primate model of common marmoset 196 ifn- and ifn- have been tested in vitro against sars-cov-2 and shown potent antiviral activity infected vero cells treated with ifn- or ifn- at a concentration of 50 international units iu per milliliter reduced viral titers by 34 log or over 4 log respectively demonstrating the potential therapeutic use of these biologicals in covid-1 infections 197 addition of ifn-1 in the treatment of covid-19 patients receiving the antivirals lopinavirritonavir was shown to be better than the treatment with the two antivirals alone as demonstrated by a open label randomized phase ii clinical trial where patients in the triple combination treatment group had a significantly shorter median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab 7 days compared to the lopinavirritonavir control group 12 days 198as mentioned before angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 was identied as a functional receptor in sars-cov infection 199 structural and functional analysis of sars-cov-2 binding receptor showed that the spike glycoprotein of this virus also binds to ace2 receptor 200201202 it has been observed that patients with comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes are frequently under medication with angiotensin-converting enzyme ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers arb which could result in overexpression of ace2 and potentially increase availability of target molecules for sars-cov-2 entry 45203204205 ace inhibitors and arbs are used to treat patients with high blood pressure heart and kidney problems and other conditions it is believed that disbalance in ace2 as caused by ace inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug nsaid such as ibuprofen an activator of ace2 receptors expression may predispose to severe disease 206 on the other hand there are some reports showing no association between these drugs and severe covid-19 207 however the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is very complex and it has been suggested that this complexity needs to be taken into consideration when treating covid-19 pneumonia patients with comorbidities due to the opposing physiological actions of ace and ace2 receptors 208 ace cleaves angiotensin i to generate angiotensin ii the peptide which binds to and activates angiotensin receptor 1 at1r to constrict blood vessels thereby elevating blood pressure in contrast ace2 inactivates angiotensin ii while generating angiotensin 17 a heptapeptide having a potent vasodilator function via activation of its mas receptor 209 in this context it has been proposed that at1r blockers such as losartan and olmesartan could reduce the aggressiveness and mortality from sarscov2 virus infections the rationale appointed for this proposal is that when sars-cov-2 binds to ace2 receptor it causes a downregulation of ace2 activity which in turn results in excessive production of angiotensin-ii by the related enzyme ace while less ace2 is capable of converting it to the vasodilator heptapeptide angiotensin 17 which contributes to lung injury due to increased pulmonary vascular permeability 210 furthermore observational studies on the use of ace inhibitors and arbs during the covid-19 pandemic and in other acute respiratory syndromes do not support the hypothesis that these drugs increase the risk of infection with sars-cov-2 or have a negative impact on the clinical outcomes of covid-19 patients some demonstrate the opposite of the initially raised concerns 211212 although in preclinical animal model treatment with losartan has been shown to upregulate ace2 mrna expression and activity human studies showed no significant difference in ace2 plasma levels in patients treated with arbs or ace inhibitors although local tissue ace2 levels have not been measured 213214215216 ace inhibitors and arbs could mitigate the deleterious effects at1r pathway activation which in turn decreases inflammation and lung injury 217 however the real impact of ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers on severe acute respiratory illness due to sars cov-2 is not well established and contradictory results have been published in the literature so far only controlled randomized trials will be able to definitively answer the question of whether ace inhibitors or arbs pose a harm to patients with covid-19 or if they could even be beneficial despite controversies it has been suggested the use of ace inhibitors and arbs should be continued in patients that are in stable condition who are at risk for infection are being evaluated for infection or have covid-19 218convalescent plasma is a type of therapy where plasma is collected from individuals following resolution of infection and development of antibodies transfusion of convalescent plasma may prevent infection or decrease clinical severity in individuals with recent exposure to the virus 219 this type of therapy has been in use for over a century 220 human plasma from recovered covid-19 patients is being considered a safe and potentially effective alternative for treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis 221222 a study with 173 sars-cov-2 infected patients detected the presence of antibodies in serial plasma samples and demonstrated seroconversion rates for antibody ab igm and igg of 931 827 and 647 respectively the presence of antibodies was 40 among patients within 1-week since onset and rapidly increased to 1000 ab 943 igm and 798 igg since day-15 after onset demonstrating a strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of covid-19 patients 223 there are still few data on the use of convalescent plasma therapy in covid-19 however reports from china has shown preliminary clinical benefits regarding improvement of symptoms like fever cough chest pain and no serious side effect 224225 again the need of randomized clinical trials is urgent to determine the true clinical effect of this treatment or whether the patients might have recovered without this therapy according to the clinicaltrialsgov database there are currently 102 studies evaluating this therapy for covid-19vitamin c ascorbic acid is an essential vitamin known for its antioxidant properties important to boost the immune system 226 some studies have shown that various high-dose intravenous vitamin c infusions eg 200 mgkg body weightday divided into 4 doses shortened the intensive care unit icu stay by 78 227 and was accompanied by a signicant reduction in the mortality rate in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock 228 moreover vitamin c has also demonstrated antiviral activity which was recently reviewed 229 coronaviruses increase oxidative stress that promotes cellular malfunction and ultimately results in organ failure 230 it is believed that high intravenous dose of vitamin c could be particularly effective by inhibiting the production of cytokines storm due to covid-19 and many physicians in china have identied promising results using this approach against covid-19 231232 it was reported that high-dose intravenous vitamin c was successfully used in the treatment of 50 moderate to severe covid-19 patients in china the doses used varied between 10 g and 20 g per day given over a period of 810 h the oxygenation index was improving in real time and all the patients eventually cured and were discharged 231recently a new clinical trial to test high-dose vitamin c in patients with covid-19 identifier nct04264533 has begun in wuhan china in this trial the investigators will treat 140 patients with a placebo control or intravenous vitamin c at a dose of 24 gday for 7 days they will assess requirements for mechanical ventilation and vasopressor drugs organ failure scores icu length of stay and 28-day mortality 232it is known that vitamin d can stimulate innate immunity and modulate acquired immunity 233 however although there are several contradictory results reported in the literature regarding the effect of vitamin d on acute respiratory infections considering that pneumonia sepsis respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress are frequently found in sars-cov-2 infected patients it has been suggested that this vitamin could be beneficial in patients with covid-19 a meta-analysis study has shown evidence that vitamin d supplementation could protected against acute respiratory infections 234 this benefit was observed in individuals who received frequent eg daily doses of vitamin d but not in those who received bolus doses and this effect was more evident in individuals with vitamin d deficiency a study performed with 449 individuals recruited from a uk biobank with confirmed covid-19 aimed to establish whether 25-hydroxyvitamin d 25ohd concentration was associated with covid-19 risk 235 this study showed no potential link between vitamin d concentrations and covid-19 infection nor relation between this vitamin and the ethnic differences in covid-19 infection despite this result there are several clinical trials undergoing to better evaluate the role of vitamin d in covid-19 infection table2it has been shown that zinc inhibits coronavirus and retrovirus rna polymerase activity and zinc ionophores exhibit the potential to block virus replication in vitro 236 moreover zinc has also shown to play a role as anti-inflammatory agent in pneumonia in animal models thus limiting tissue damage and systemic effects 237238 furthermore previous work performed before the covid-19 pandemic demonstrated that chloroquine is a zinc ionophore increasing zn2 flux into the cell 239 therefore zinc has been considered as supportive treatment in the therapy of covid-19 infection recently it was reported a series of four patient cases one 63 years old man and three women with 57 41 and 26 years old with clinical symptoms andor laboratory confirmed covid-19 that used high dose zinc salt oral lozenges to alleviate the symptoms of the disease the treatment resulted in significant improvement in objective and symptomatic disease measures such as fever and pao2 after one day of this high dose therapy 240 currently there is no standard dosage for zinc supplementation established in the treatment of covid-19 however several clinical trials are underway to evaluate the effects of supplementation with zinc alone or in combination with other supplements or drugs such as vitamin c chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on covid-19 table 2hydroxychloroquineazithromycin combination therapy has shown promising results in covid-19 treatment although no clear mechanism of action has been established nevertheless it was shown by molecular dynamics that both drugs act in synergy to prevent contact between the virus and the plasma membrane cells 241 azithromycin display similarity with the sugar moiety of ganglioside gm1 a lipid that act as important host attachment cofactor this antibiotic interacts with the ganglioside-binding domain of sars-cov-2 spike protein and thereby prevents virus attachment to the host cell receptor on the other hand hydroxychloroquine saturates sites in the vicinity of the primary coronavirus receptor ace2 241the results from an open label randomized phase ii clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of triple combination of interferon beta-1b lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin for treating patients with covid-19 were recently published the study comprised 127 patients from which 86 were randomly assigned to the combination group 14-day combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days and 41patients were assigned to the control group 14 days of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h the primary endpoint was the time to providing a nasopharyngeal swab negative for sars-cov-2 rt-pcr the combination group had a significantly shorter median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab 7 days than the control group 12 days p  00010 the authors concluded that early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavirritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate covid-19 198 several treatment combinations protocols with the drugs mentioned earlier are being tested on ongoing clinical trials clinicaltrialsgov 2020 a summary of the status of these clinical trials accessed in june 13th on the clinicaltrialsgov databank is shown in table 2a vaccine named chadox1 ncov-19 was the first vaccine to enter phase i clinical trial aiming to assess whether health people can be protected from covid-19 this investigational vaccine developed at the university of oxford jenner institute protected six rhesus macaques from pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 242 it started to recruit volunteers in oxford on april 23rd 2020 around 1100 people is expected to take part in the trial with half receiving the vaccine and the other half control group the vaccine is based on an adenovirus vaccine vector and the sars-cov-2 spike protein and has been produced in oxford 243another candidate vaccine for covid-19 named mrna-1273 was developed by the pharmaceutical company moderna and phase 1 data was announced on may 18th 2020 mrna-1273 is an mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the spike s protein the vaccine has shown to generate an immune response similar to the response seen in people infected by the virus and recovered despite the limited data in phase i trial eight patients who received low and middle doses of 25 and 100 g of the vaccine respectively developed neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 one of the people who received 100 g developed redness at the injection site which is considered criteria for grade 3 adverse event three volunteers subjected to the highest dose tested of 250 g presented these adverse events after receiving the second of two doses 244zhu et al 237 reported on may 22nd the results of a clinical trial nct04313127 where they tested the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 vectored covid-19 vaccine healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years were sequentially enrolled and allocated to one of three dose groups 5  10 1  10 and 15  10 viral particles to receive an intramuscular injection of vaccine 108 participants 51 male 49 female mean age 363 years were recruited and received the low dose n  36 middle dose n  36 or high dose n  36 of the vaccine elisa antibodies and neutralizing antibodies increased significantly at day 14 and peaked 28 days post-vaccination specific t-cell response peaked at day 14 post-vaccination the authors concluded that this vaccine was tolerable immunogenic and warrants further investigation 245 notwithstanding preliminary these results are encouraging and shed hope for an effective treatment in the near future besides these vaccines there are more than 140 clinical trials registered in the clinicaltrialsgov databankdespite great efforts worldwide to try to find an effective drug against sars-cov-2 yet there is not a consensus about a definite therapy for covid-19 the use of repurposed medications has shown to be a good alternative with promising results while an effective vaccine is still not available in this review we incorporated only key drugs and treatments that have been tested and demonstrated potential for use against sars-cov-2 virus as of june 13th 2020 however the results obtained so far with the use of repurposed drugs must be faced with caution unfortunately the pressure imposed by the increasingly death toll and the great attention of the media and politics on the pandemic have stimulated the publication of some small or incomplete studies in humans with questionable empirical clinical data many of them without desirable scientific rigor this fact has been the subject of broad debate as a result misinformation and confusion have occurred hindering important actions to combat covid-19 advance and leading to a needless discredit in science in fact some published research papers from recognized medical journals have been withdrawn recently after several concerns raised with respect to the veracity of the data and analyses conducted by the authors revealing the use of dubious methods of analysis and ethical problems 246 this fact had a direct impact on ongoing clinical trials causing temporary suspension and compromising the long-awaited results on the other hand as stated by zhang et al 27 sound science should be effectively communicated to policy makers and should constitute the prime foundation in decision-making amid this pandemic furthermore only well designed and rigorous randomized controlled trial can provide reliable and generalized data for safety and effective use of drugs to treat infected patients 247 despite the great challenge posed by the covid-19 pandemic and the surfaced ethical issues the ongoing efforts to fight the virus and the excellence and hardworking of many research groups across the world offer hope that in a near future we can win this battlethis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectors7980there is no conflict of interest
