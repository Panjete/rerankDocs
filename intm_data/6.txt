following the development of sporadic cases of an unknown pneumonia accompanied by respiratory failure in wuhan hubei province china in early december 2019
1
 a new coronavirus was identified in respiratory samples obtained from patients with pneumonia and was named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019ncov the world health organization who officially announced that the coronavirus would be identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2
2
 the disease is also referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 covid19
3
 the global mortality rate of covid19 was reported to range from 15 to 36
4

currently the diagnosis of covid19 has been confirmed using nextgeneration sequencing or realtime reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcr to directly detect sarscov2 in specimens obtained from the upper and lower respiratory tracts of affected patients

 however this process takes a relatively long time at least 6 hours to produce the final results regarding covid19 infection via detection of the virus itself recently new serologic laboratory diagnostic tests such as enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa and immunochromatography have been developed to identify the presence of covid19 antibodies in blood or tissue samples following sarscov2 infection however the effectiveness and diagnostic value of these serologic tests including immunochromatography have not been sufficiently validatedearly and rapid diagnosis of covid19 infection is necessary to prevent the spread of infection and to reduce the associated morbidity and mortality rates therefore this study evaluated the diagnostic performance of an immunochromatographybased immunoglobulin g iggimmunoglobulin m igm rapid test using serum to detect sarscov2 infection and compared its results to those of rtpcr using nasopharyngeal aspirates and sputumin total 149 subjects who ranged in age from 26 to 89 years were consecutively enrolled in this study between 20 march and 8 april 2020 in daegu republic of korea participants in this study were divided into two groups those with positive rtpcr n  70 findings for sarscov2 and those with negative rtpcr n  79 results for sarscov2 the positive rtpcr group comprised patients being treated in the quarantine ward of our hospital after confirming infection with covid19 repeat rtpcr tests were performed every other day to determine whether the covid19 infection had resolved at the time of their participation in the study all patients in the positive group were confirmed to be positive for sarscov2 the negative rtpcr group contained subjects with a negative result obtained on rtpcr in screening for covid19these subjects evaluated acute respiratory symptoms and signs fever myalgia and other clinical abnormalities such as chest pain and diarrhea in addition past medical history including hypertension diabetes mellitus heart disease chronic renal diseases chronic liver disease and pulmonary disease were also assessed the design of this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of daegu catholic university medical center mdcr20002lnasopharyngeal swabs and sputum were obtained from each patient for rtpcr which was performed using the cfx96 realtime pcr detection system biorad laboratories hercules ca with a powerchektm 2019ncov realtime pcr kit kogenebiotech co ltd seoul korea according to the manufacturers instructions the primers and probes were designed to target the e and rdrp genes of the sarscov2 viral sequencewe used serum from blood samples obtained from the study population for immunochromatography the serum samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4c in serum separating tubes until immunochromatography analysis in accordance with the manufacturers instructions a 10 l blood serum sample was dropped into the sample hole of the experimental device using a disposable dropper and 60 l of diluent was added via the same sample hole after 10 to 15 minutes the results were confirmed any results that were obtained 20 minutes after addition of diluent were not read or recordedthe immunochromatography tool used to detect covid19 igg and igm antibodies for sarscov2 infection was the pcl covid19 iggigm rapid gold pcl inc seoul

the analysis of immmunochromatography for covid19 there were no subjects in the rtpcr positive group and two subjects 25 in the rtpcr negative group who only produced the igm antibody table 2 in addition 19 patients 271 with active covid19 infections and one subject 13 without covid19 infection had only igg antibody positivity without the presence of igm antibodyboth igm and igg antibodies were noted in 46 subjects 657 in the rtpcr positive group and in none of the rtpcr negative group in addition 929 n  65 of the subjects with sarscov2 infection and 38 n  3 of those without sarscov2 infection showed either igm or igg positivity as determined by immunochromatography neither igm nor igg antibodies for sarscov2 were found in five subjects 71 in the rtpcr positive group or in 76

unknown causes developed in december 2019 in china

 in the early period of the covid19 outbreak its diagnosis was made based on clinical laboratory and radiographic findings before the introduction of a diagnostic technique that could directly identify this coronavirus

 the who announced that chinese authorities had identified a novel type of coronavirus on 7 january 2020
9
 presently rtpcr a nucleic acid amplification test naat has been routinely used to detect covid19 infection in many countries around the world

 in this study we assessed the diagnostic value of a new immunochromatography assay to detect igm and igg antibodies for sarscov2 infectioncoronaviruses are singlestranded rna viruses with a spike glycoprotein that plays a role in the binding of their receptors and the subsequent entrance of the virus into host cells and consist of four genera alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus
10
 
11
 the genome structure of coronaviruses includes four structural proteins spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins
2
 
10
 sarscov2 which has been identified as the cause of covid19 is a type of betacoronavirus along with sarscov and merscov
11
 in clinical practice diagnosis of covid19 infection is made via viral rna detection using naats including rtpcr in earlier studies sarscov2 virus detection was mainly performed using rtpcr that targeted the n s or e rdrp gene region of the viral sequence and the open reading frame 1 ab fragment of coronavirus
1
 
6
 
12
 
13
 the present study also used an rtpcr assay that targeted the e gene and rdrp gene for detection for sarscov2 however it was necessary to thoroughly evaluate the diagnostic value of these rtpcr methods especially their sensitivity and specificity using different viral gene sequences corman et al
12
 demonstrated that the e gene and rdrp gene assay were sensitive based on sars coronavirus virions and in vitrotranscribed rna identical to the sarscov2 target gene in addition they also confirmed no nonspecific reactions with other nucleic acids and demonstrated that there was no crossreactivity with other respiratory viruses or bacterial pathogens including some other human coronaviruses merscov influenza respiratory syncytial virus legionella and mycoplasma
12
 this finding suggests that rtpcr method that targets at least two sarscov2 genes is a reliable test for screening for or confirming covid19 infectionhowever there are some limitations or weaknesses in the areas of confirmation of covid19 diagnosis by rtpcr testing alone such as the inability to distinguish virus viability and production of indeterminate or falsenegative results due to low numbers of target cells in specimens although rtpcr remains a powerful technique for microbial diagnostics
14
 laboratory assays such as elisa and immunochromatography that use serum or blood sampled from suspected or established patients with covid19 infection have been proposed to overcome or supplement these limitations one study using inhouse antisarsrcov igg and igm elisa to target the n gene showed that the igm antibody level increased rapidly in the early stages of covid19 infection and then decreased in the later stages
13
 furthermore the igg antibody was insignificantly expressed in the early stages of infection but increased rapidly in the later stages interestingly titers of both igm and igg antibodies in covid19 patients were significantly higher than those assessed in healthy subjects infections have been reported to be reactivated in patients and confirmed by rtpcr testing
15
 therefore serial quantitative results using elisa may help not only confirm the diagnosis but also predict the clinical course of a patientimmunochromatography is another diagnostic alternative that has been proposed to detect covid19 infection this technique was developed in the late 1960s to detect antigens in the blood and has recently been used as a rapid diagnostic method for various viral infections such as norovirus and influenza
16
 
17
 the benefits or advantages of immunochromatography include its ability to be performed at bedside without special laboratory equipment its ease of performance its simple interpretation and its rapid time to produce results which may compare favorably to other diagnostic tools such as rtpcr and elisa methods however the sensitivity and specificity of immunochromatography are greatly dependent on duration of infection and the antigens produced by manufacturers of the tests immunochromatography for rapid detection of noroviruses showed a relatively low sensitivity from 542 to 789 and a higher specificity from 93 to 100
18

until now there have been no available data on the sensitivity and specificity of immunochromatography for identifying sarscov2 infection in the present study detection of igm or igg antibodies showed good sensitivity 929 and specificity 963 indicating a recent symptomatic infection or subclinical infection however the sensitivity decreased to 657 when requiring both igm and igg antibodies as indicated by other studies
18
 we unexpectedly observed two subjects 25 with only igm antibodies and one subject 13 with igg antibodies alone in people without prior evidence of covid19 infection these three subjects who were positive for either igm or igg but not both on immunochromatography had been tested repeatedly using rtpcr every other day and were confirmed negative rtpcr all of the bacterial and respiratory viral infection tests performed at the same time were also negative the diagnostic kit used in this study is known to have no crossreactivity with influenza respiratory syncytial virus hemoglobulin cholesterol or heparin sodium we also identified five subjects who did not produce any detectable antibody for sarscov2 but had been diagnosed with covid19 which means that they had experienced falsenegative results first falsenegative results may result from weak or no antibody formation against sarscov2 infection this may be insufficient time for the virus to amplify to high enough levels to be detected depending on the individual to overcome the limitation of falsenegative results in immunochromatography it is necessary to verify other methods such as the elisa test second the inherent limitations of the immunochromatography assay technique must also be considered this method showed a variable range of falsenegative results in diverse viral diseases such as norovirus and human influenza virus
18
 
19
 the possibility of obtaining a falsenegative result with the igmigg rapid gold test kit for sarscov2 used in this study was lower than that reported by other earlier studies third target gene selection can also affect the sensitivity of immunochromatography and produce a falsenegative result the diagnostic kit used in this study targets the s and n genes of the viral sequence corrman et al
12
 demonstrated a lower sensitivity of the n gene compared with the e and rdrp genes therefore the falsenegative results observed in the present study were presumed to be related to the low sensitivity of the n genethis study found that one subject with igg and two subjects with igm for sarscov2 in immunochromatography assay were positive among rtpcr negative subjects although rtpcr test was repeated two to three times using samples of the upper and lower respiratory tracts of these patients they were all confirmed negative they also showed negative results for various respiratory pathogens such as influenza ab parainfluenza respiratory syncytial virus chlamydophila pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae and other human coronaviruses including coronavirus 229e coronavirus hku1 coronavirus oc43 and coronavirus nl63 the immunochromatography test used in this study was confirmed to have no crossreactivity to most of these pathogens however there is no data about crossvalidation of coronavirus in the immunochromatography test kit used in this study although there was no evidence of infection with other human coronaviruses the possibility of false positives by crossreactivity with other coronaviruses cannot be ruled outthere are some limitations to this study first it was not possible to observe changes in antibodies from the time of patient diagnosis to the time of participation in the study because this study was conducted in a crosssectional manner second the quantitative titer for each antibody expressed in the test kit could not be confirmed and is therefore a methodological limitation of immunochromatography third it may be difficult to fully represent the diagnostic values especially the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic kit due to the small size of the study populationin conclusion immunochromatography demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity for sarscov2 infection in the presence of either igm or igg antibodies in addition this igmigg rapid immunochromatography technique produced a good diagnostic ppv and npv therefore the immunochromatographybased igmigg rapid test for sarscov2 may be more practical for rapid and largescale screening of coronavirus infections in the current outbreak of covid19 within the larger community and provides information to help predict patients clinical progress by identifying the presence of igm andor igg antibody formation against this viral infectionthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestssince december 2019 a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in wuhan hubei china with clinical presentations greatly resembling viral pneumonia
1
 subsequently pathogenic gene sequencing confirmed that the infected pathogen was a novel coronavirus named 2019 novel coronavirus sarscov2
2
 similar to previous outbreaks of coronavirus infection in humans 2003 sarscov
3
 
4
 and 2012 merscov
5
 sarscov2 infection caused the novel coronavirus disease covid19 its outbreak developed into an epidemic that quickly spread all over china and to more than 20 other countries
6
 it has been listed as a public health emergency of international concern
7
 the outbreak of this disease has caused the chinese government to take drastic measures to contain the outbreak including the quarantine of millions of residents in wuhan and other affected cities countrywide interventions include delaying the resumption of workplaces and encouraging citizens to stay and work from home and so onhowever these efforts are limited by one hard problem how to differentiate the covid19 cases from the healthy for confirmed covid19 cases reported common clinical symptoms include fever cough myalgia or fatigue
8
 yet these symptoms are not unique features of covid19 because these symptoms are similar to that of other virusinfected diseases such as influenza
9
 currently virus nucleic acid realtime polymerase chain reaction rtpcr ct imaging and some hematology parameters are the primary tools for clinical diagnosis of the infection
10
 many laboratory test kits have been developed and used in testing patient specimens for covid19 by chinese cdc us cdc and other private companies the virus nucleic acid rtpcr test has become the current standard diagnostic method for the diagnosis of covid19 yet these rtpcr test kits suffer from many limitations 1 these tests have long turnaround times and are complicated in operation they generally take on average over 2 to 3 hours to generate results 2 the pcr tests require certified laboratories expensive equipment and trained technicians to operate 3 there are some numbers of false negatives for rtpcr of covid19
11
 these limitations make rtpcr unsuitable for use in the field for rapid and simple diagnosis and screening of patients it limits the outbreak containment effort therefore there is an urgent need for a rapid simple to use sensitive and accurate test to quickly identify infected patients of sarscov2 to prevent virus transmission and to assure timely treatment of patientstesting of specific antibodies of sarscov2 in patient blood is a good choice for rapid simple highly sensitive diagnosis of covid19 it is widely accepted that immunoglobulin m igm provides the first line of defense during viral infections before the generation of adaptive highaffinity igg responses that are important for long term immunity and immunological memory
12
 it was reported that after sars infection igm antibody could be detected in patient blood after 3 to 6 days and igg could be detected after 8 days
13
 
14
 since covid19 belongs to the same large family of viruses as those that cause the mers and sars outbreak we assume its antibody generation process is similar and detection of the igg and igm antibody against sarscov2 will be an indication of infection furthermore detection of igm antibodies tends to indicate recent exposure to sarscov2 whereas the detection of covid19 igg antibodies indicates virus exposure some time ago thus we believe that the detection of both igm and igg could provide information on the virus infection time course the rapid detection of both igm and igg antibodies will add value to the diagnosis and treatment of covid19 diseasebased on these we developed a pointofcare lateral flow immunoassay lfia test product which can detect igm and igg simultaneously in human blood within 15 minutes we tested the product in eight hospitals and chinese cdc agencies to validate its clinical efficacy the results demonstrated this rapid antibody test has high sensitivity and specificity it can be used in hospitals clinics and testing laboratories the test can also be effectively deployed in businesses schools airports seaports and train stations etc giving it the potential to become a compelling force in the fight against this global threatantihuman igg and igm lf201001 lf201002 were purchased from nanjing lefushidai inc covid19 recombinant antigen mk201027 was developed and purified at medomics the recombinant antigen mk201027 is receptor binding domain of sarscov2 spike protein which is transient transfected in cell culture and purified by protein a affinity chromatography and sizeexclusion chromatography the design of the antigen was based on the published sarscov2 sequence several different designs of antigen were tested and optimized eventually mk201027 was picked into the testing product bovine serum albumin bsa and goat antihuman igg and igm antibodies rabbit igg and goat antirabbit igg antibodies were obtained from sigmaaldrich fortynanometer gold nanoparticle aunp colloids nc membrane and plastic pad were obtained from shanghai kinbio inc the glass fiber conjugate pad was obtained from whatman the phosphatebuffered saline pbs was purchased from sigmaaldrich inactivated covid19positive and negative serum samples of patients were supplied by hunan cdc chinato prepare the aunp conjugate sarscov2 recombinant protein dissolved in pbs 1 mgml was added to the mixture of 1 ml aunp colloid 40 nm in diameter od  1 and 01 ml of borate buffer 01 m ph 85 after incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature 01 ml of 10 mgml bsa in pbs was added to the solution to block the aunp surface after incubation for 15 minutes at room temperature the mixture was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm and 4c for 20 minutes the supernatant was discarded and 1 ml of 1 mgml bsa in pbs was added to the aunp conjugate to be resuspended the centrifugation and suspension processes were repeated twice and the final suspension solution was pbs the aunprabbit igg conjugates were prepared and purified by the same procedurethe main body of the test strip consists of five parts including plastic backing sample pad conjugate pad absorbent pad and nc membrane every component of the strip should be given a pretreatment described as follows the nc membrane was attached to a plastic backing layer for cutting and handling the antihumanigm antihumanigg and antirabbitigg were immobilized at test m g and control line c linerespectively conjugate pad was sprayed with mixture of aunpcovid19 recombinant antigen conjugate and aunprabbitigg sample pad was pretreated with bsa 3 wv and tween20 05 wv before usethe patients were recruited who conform to the diagnostic criteria of a suspected case of covid19 according to the guidelines of diagnosis and treatment of covid19

 including typical epidemiological history and clinical characteristics these samples were collected from various hospitals and cdc testing laboratories total eight at six different provinces of china the tests were conducted at the sites by clinical staff who followed the test procedure described in the product inserts the respiratory tract specimen including pharyngeal swab and sputum was used to confirm covid19 cases and the blood including serum and plasma was used to test the igm and igg antibodybefore testing the pouched device was opened immediately before use when refrigerated blood samples were used for the test they were warmed to room temperature 15c30c during testing 20 l whole blood sample or 10 l of serumplasma samples was pipetted into the sample port followed by adding two to three drops 70100 l of dilution buffer 10 mm pbs buffer to drive capillary action along the strip the entire test took about 15 minutes to finisha total of three detection lines are on the stip the control c line appears when the sample has flowed through the cartridge the presence of antisarscov2 igm and antisarscov2 igg will be indicated by a redpink test line in the m and g region if only the control line c showed red the sample is negative either m or g line or both lines turning into red indicates the presence of antisarscov2igm or antisarscov2igg or both antibodies in the specimen if the control line does not appear red the test is invalid and the test should be repeated with another cartridgethe rapid sarscov2 iggigm combined antibody test kits were tested at eight hospitals and chinese cdc laboratories in different provinces with a total of 397 clinical positive and 128 clinical negative patient blood samples the test data was collected and analyzed the specificity and sensitivity of the rapid test kits were calculated according to the following formulas

the sarscov2 rapid iggigm combined antibody test kit is designed and manufactured by jiangsu medomics medical technologies located in nanjing china it is a lateral flow qualitative immunoassay for the rapid determination of the presence or absence of both antisarscov2igm and antisarscov2igg in human specimens whole blood serum and plasma the test kit comes with a test cartridge sample dilution buffer and a package insert the testing cartridge has three detection bands including a distal control band that appears when the sample has flowed to the end of the testing strip the presence of sarscov2 igg and igm antibodies are indicated by a redpurple line in the specific region indicated on the device the sarscov2 rapid iggigm combined antibody test strip as shown in figure 1 has two mouse antihuman monoclonal antibodies antiigg and antiigm stripped on two separated test lines a surface antigen from sarscov2 which can specifically bind to sarscov2 antibodies including both igm and igg is conjugated to colloidal gold nanoparticles and sprayed on conjugation pads the aunprabbit igg conjugates were also sprayed on conjugation pads for binding to antirabbit igg antibody which is immobilized on the control line figure 1awhen testing 10 to 15 l specimen is added into the sample port followed by the addition of sample dilution buffer the mechanism of the assay is based on the hydration and transport of reagents as they interact with the specimen across the strip via chromatographic lateral flow figure 1a as the specimen flows through the device antisarscov2 igg and igm antibodies if present in the specimen are bound by the sarscov2 antigen labeled gold colorimetric reagent fixed on the conjugate pad as the conjugated sample continues to travel up the strip the anti sarscov2 igm antibodies are bound on the migm line and the anticovid19 igg antibodies are bound to the g igg line if the specimen does not contain sarscov2 antibodies no labeled complexes bind at the test zone and no lines could be observed the remaining colloidal gold travels up the nitrocellulose to the control line zone which captures the excess conjugate demonstrating that the fluid has migrated adequately through the device a reddishpurple line will appear at the control line zone during the performance of all valid tests whether the sample is positive or negative for sarscov2 infection during the test excess reagent including aunprabbit igg conjugates migrate passes the control line zone where the annprabbit igg conjugates bind to antirabbit igg to form a red line on the control line figure 1b is the illustration of different testing results reading for negative igm positive igg positive and igmigg both positive situationsas one example to show real testing results figure 2 shows a testing result photo for six different test cartridges from six patients which represent several different types of results in cartridge 13 the photo reading represents detection of both igm and igg in cartridge 14 igm only in low concentration in cartridge 15 no igm and igg in cartridge 16 igg only in low concentration in cartridge 17 igg only in high concentration and in cartridge 18 igm only in high concentration in patient bloods respectivelyto test the detection sensitivity and specificity of sarscov2 iggigm combined antibody test blood samples were collected from covid19 patients from multiple hospitals and chinese cdc laboratories the tests were done separately at each site a total of 525 cases were tested 397 positive clinically confirmed including pcr test sarscov2infected patients and 128 nonsarscov2infected patients 128 negative the testing results of vein blood without viral inactivation are summarized in table 1 of the 397 blood samples from sarscov2infected patients 352 tested positive resulting in a sensitivity of 8866 a total of 12 blood samples from the 128 nonsarscov2 infection patients tested positive generating a specificity of 9063 it was also found that 6448 256 of 397 of positive patients had both igm and igg antibodies table 1for the test it is very important to know the data of infection time point from clinical samples which will be helpful to compare the data of single or doublepositive in table 1 due to limited time we do not have complete detailed information for how long each patient was infected or for how long each patient had symptoms when the blood sample was collected at all the clinical sites we only had such data from one of the clinical sitewuhan red cross hospital as a reference by analyzing one subset data of 58 patients in wuhan it was found that 9483 of the positive patients had both igm and iggpositive test lines and 172 345 had only igm or only iggpositive lines respectively table 2 the test time was from day 8 to day 33 after infection symptoms appeared further studies and information collection are needed for thisthe above results have verified the sensitivity and specificity of kit detection in uninactivated vein blood however it is more convenient to collect fingerstick blood outside hospitals and clinics to achieve a simpler operating process we tested the performance of sarscov2 iggigm combined antibody kit with peripheral blood patient fingerstick blood and vein blood and plasma from the same patient were tested as shown in table 3 seven covid19 patients and three healthy volunteers were recruited we took the blood samples from fingerstick serum of venous blood and plasma of venous blood and tested them with the kits within the 7 patients 3 patients have igm only positive and 4 patients have both igm and igg positive all healthy volunteers tested negative the results showed that all of the positive and negative test results matched with 100 consistency among the corresponding blood samples this result demonstrates that the sarscov2 iggigm combined antibody test kit can be used as a pointofcare test poct it can be performed near the bedside with fingerstick bloodhere we successfully developed a rapid iggigm combined antibody test kit for covid19 diagnosis the sensitivity and specificity of the kit were verified via the lab and clinical practice this test kit provides a product to meet the urgent need for immunoassay tests in chinese hospitals for the diagnosis of covid19to make the kit suitable for different stages of the disease we developed an iggigm combined antibody test for covid19 infection figure 1 it was also been confirmed that the detection sensibility was higher in iggigm combined antibody test than in individual igg or igm antibody test table 1 therefore we more recommend the development of iggigm combined antibody test kits than the separate igg or igm antibody test kits if there is a reliable technical system available it is a better test for screening covid19 patientsthis newly developed test kit the iggigm combined antibody test kit has a sensitivity of 8866 and specificity of 9063 however there were still false positive and falsenegative results table 1 the reasons for the falsenegative maybe first due to the low antibody concentrations when igm and igg levels are below the detection limit not determined yet of this rapid test the test results will be negative second the difference in individual immune response antibody production could be one reason for the falsenegative results in covid19 patients the last but not least igm antibody will decrease and disappear after 2 weeks in some cases it is hard to know exactly when the patient was infected or how long the patient was infected thus when the patient was tested the igm level might well be below its peak and not detectable by this test therefore we encourage more research and development of the covid19 iggigm combined antibody test kit to improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for patients since covid19 recombinant antigen was used in the test our test is specific for covid19 infection the clinical testing data in this paper at different clinical sites from east south west and middle of china confirmed the specificity of the test kit however because of the emergency of the outbreak of covid19 we could not carry out normal research activities and perform enough tests to verify if there is interference from other igm and igg induced by different virus infections such as typical flu viruses this study need to be done laterthis new rapid sarscov2 iggigm combined antibody test kit has several advantages compared to rtpcr it saves time and it does not require equipment it is simple to perform and only requires minimal training it can be performed at the bedside in any clinic or laboratory at airports or at railway stations
16
 it will be more convenient to use fingerstick blood or heel blood instead of vein blood for outofclinic screening our initial test results using fingertip blood were as good as that of vein blood table 3 which suggests that the sarscov2 iggigm combined antibody test kits can be developed as agents for rapid field detection another potential application of this test is screening asymptomatic sarscov2 carriers it was reported that asymptomatic carriers could spread sarscov2 virus
17
 
18
 this finding made the current covid19 outbreak control more difficult because there is no method available to screen asymptomatic carriers this rapid igmigg combined antibody test kit makes largescale screening of asymptomatic carriers possible at least some if not all of the carriers are likely to have antisarscov2 antibodies as demonstrated by asymptomatic zika virus carriers
19
 because this test can detect igm and igg simultaneously it could be used for both early diagnosis igm and for monitoring during treatment sarscov2 infection starts at the lungs not in the upper respiratory tract

 therefore sampling during the early infection stage using throat swab or sputum may not detect the virus this is one possible explanation for high false negatives in the nucleic acid pcr test however this sampling effect should not have any effect on igm and igg detection with this rapid testbased on our knowledge and information there are several other chinese ivd companies developing or have developed similar products ranging from igm only and igmigg combined tests we do not know the details about their technical performance since there is no publication on them we believe the good test products will be used in clinical sites and the information will emerge we will carry out comparison studies latercertainly this test cannot confirm virus presence only provide evidence of recent infection but it provides important immunological evidence for physicians to make the correct diagnosis along with other tests and to start treatment of patients in addition possible crossreactivity with other coronaviruses and flu viruses were not studied and the change level of antibody was not compared in the different stages of sarscov2 infection we believe the combination of nucleic acid rtpcr and the igmigg antibody test can provide more accurate sarscov2 infection diagnosiswe developed a rapid sarscov2 iggigm combined antibody test using lateral flow immune assay techniques it takes less than 15 minutes to generate results and determine whether there is a recent sarscov2 infection it is easy to use and no additional equipment is required results from this study demonstrated that this test is sensitive and specific this rapid test has great potential benefits for the fast screening of sarscov2 infections and it has already generated tremendous interest and increased clinical uses after a short time testing in chinese hospitalsthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsacute respiratory disease ard accounts for a large proportion of all acute morbidities as well as mortalities worldwide among which acute viral respiratory tract infection is the leading cause appropriate 80
1
 the major viral pathogens include influenza virus respiratory syncytial virus rsv coronavirus adenovirus and rhinovirus in children below the age of five the combined global mortality of only influenza and rsv reaches 300 000 deaths each year
2
 other respiratory viruses such as adenovirus and rhinovirus are associated with lower mortality but significant morbidity causing a huge economic burden
3
 the highly pathogenic emerging and reemerging coronaviruses that may cause epidemics or pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov have posed great threat to global public health most recently a novel coronavirus 2019ncov httpswwwwhoint has caused the pneumonia in 41 confirmed cases of patients including 7 in serious condition 1 dead and 2 recovered httpswwwshinecnnewsnation2001119576 the full genomic sequence of this coronavirus was released on january 10 2020 httpvirologicalorgtinitial-genome-release-of-novel-coronavirus319fromgroupmessageisappinstalled0 which is more than 82 identical to those of sarscov and bat sarslike coronavirus slcov
4

accurate and fast diagnosis of the causative viral pathogens is important to select the appropriate treatment save peoples lives stop the epidemics and reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics all viruses mentioned above can cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections as well as overlapping clinical presentations making it difficult for physicians to distinguish the causative agents without a solid laboratory analysis conventional diagnostic methods such as viral culture and directindirect immunofluorescence assay ifa are timeconsuming and labor intensive with limited sensitivity rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viruses can help in epidemiologic monitoring along with taking effective prevention steps and implementing appropriate antiviral therapies over the past decades an evolution in viral diagnostic testing has been seen all the way from conventional approaches to rapid antigen detection more recently highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests naat and pointofcare tests poct have been developed
2

in this review we describe various approaches currently available or under development for diagnosis of common respiratory virus infections in humans it is anticipated that these data will assist clinical laboratories to rapidly and accurately diagnose respiratory viruses thus providing physicians with essential information for timely and appropriate treatment of patients the commonly used diagnostic approaches for influenza virus rsv coronavirus adenovirus and rhinovirus are summarized in table 1 and described in detail in the following reviewviral culture is the gold standard for diagnosing influenza viral infections this approach includes inoculation of the corresponding cell lines such as madin darby canine kidney mdck a549 and rhesus monkey kidney llc mk2 with clinical samples propagation for seven to 10 days to monitor the development of cytopathic effect cpe and final confirmation of influenza virus infection by hemadsorption using erythrocytes specific antibody staining or immunofluorescence microscopy
5
 ifa has been used since the 1960s it directly stains respiratory epithelial cells derived from nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs with fluorescently labeled influenza virusspecific antibodies
5
 currently several fdaapproved enzymelinked immunosorbent elisabased tests are available for diagnosis of influenza virus infections however elisabased tests often show lower sensitivity compared with nucleic acidbased methods a novel immunoassay based on europium nanoparticles has been developed to rapidly detect 29 strains of influenza a and 10 strains of influenza b viruses with high sensitivity and specificity
6

the abovedescribed conventional diagnostic methods generally have lower sensitivity and specificity relative to molecular methods with the development of laboratory approaches for virus diagnosis isolation of viral pathogens from secretion samples has become much easier than beforethe rapid influenza diagnostic test ridt offers a faster approach for detecting both influenza a and b viruses however it has limited ability to further identify the subtypes of influenza viruses in addition its test performance ie sensitivity and specificity varies widely for example in november 2009 290 suspected influenza patients were analyzed using direct antigen ez flu ab kit the sensitivity and specificity of ridt were 405 and 945 respectively
45
 naat assays based on polymerase chain reaction pcr detect virusspecific genetic materials rather than viral antigens or antibodies therefore optimal extraction of viral genetic materials is required one of the advantages of naat over ridt is that naat is able to identify different subtypes of influenza viruses trombettas group found that naat shows much higher sensitivity for both influenza a and influenza b viruses despite its relative lower specificity
7
 a variety of naat assays such as reverse transcriptasepcr loopmediated isothermal amplificationbased assay lamp dnamicroarraybased and sequencingbased tests are appearing for diagnosis of influenza viral infections in humans
5
 using the lamp approach poons group demonstrated 100 sensitivity for detection of seasonal influenza a h1n1 and h3n2 viruses from clinical specimens with analytical sensitivity of 10 copies per reaction
8
 compared with the rtpcrbased assay a realtime reverse transcription lampbased assay rtlamp showed a sensitivity of 978 and a specificity of 100 for detecting 2009 h1n1 pandemic virus
9
 lampbased assays have also been used to detect the highly pathogenic h5n1 and h7n9 avian influenza viruses having comparable or higher sensitivities than rtpcrbased approaches
10
 
11
 
12
 however the high cost of naat the complexity of the equipment required and the need for trained professionals make naat assays less practical in areas with limited resourcesin addition to the above approaches the dnamicroarraybased approach has been developed to detect influenza viruses offering a novel tool for accurate and rapid diagnosis of influenza epidemics or pandemics this assay uses multiple oligonucleotides specially designed to target conserved sequences encoding ha na and m proteins of influenza a and b viruses
5
 for instance zhaos research group has developed a gold nanoparticlebased genomic microarray assay which is able to differentiate h5n1 viruses from the major seasonal influenza a viruses h1n1 h3n2 this can be explained by oligonucleotides which are designed on the basis of consensus sequence of the ha and na genes of the h5n1 virus and m gene of h1n1 h3n2 and h5n1 viruses
13
 the same group has expanded the platform and designed specific oligonucleotides for ha na and m genes of the 2009 pandemic h1n1 virus enabling the detection of the 2009 pandemic h1n1 virus and distinguish it from other influenza a viruses
46

particularly a combinational diagnostic platform is reported using nanomicroarray for screening and multiplex nextgeneration sequencing ngs assays for confirmation to simultaneously identify and characterize influenza a and b viruses in a single sample
47
 recently a highthroughput whole genome sequencing wgs method with the minion portable sequencer was developed to test influenza a and b viruses as subsequently validated by the illumina miseq platform the overall accuracy precision as well as recall rates were 9995 9788 and 8941 respectively from 1d reads and 9997 9986 and 9328 respectively from 1d2 reads
14

elisa and immunofluorescence assays are traditional assays to identify rsv however a modified elisa method has been developed targeting rsv f protein and it can detect rsv within 25 minutes at low cost
15
 the immunofluorescence assay can rapidly detect rsv antigens using a fluorescencetagged primary or secondary antibody for example the direct fluorescent antibody assay dfa which requires a certain number of cells in the specimen with a sensitivity and specificity of 94 and 968 respectively is widely used for detection of rsv in clinical laboratories because of its simplicity and rapidity for this reason this assay has particular use in resourcelimited countries since it can potentially eliminate prolonged hospitalization and unnecessary use of antibiotics
16

semiconductor quantum dots can be used for biological and biomedical applications because of their unique sizedependent optical and electronic features the assay detects rsv f protein using thioglycolate tgacoated cadmium telluride cdte particles which are bioconjugated with rsv antif protein mab
17
 it overcomes some of dfas disadvantage such as relatively low sensitivity because of the background staining and the rapid fading of the dye also this assay is more sensitive than rtpct by probing f and g proteins with qds confocal microscopy could detect the progression of rsv infection in the hep2 cell line and this method was found to be more sensitive compared to rtpcr
18

lateral flow immunoassay lfia is another rapid rsv detection method based on an immunochromatographic technique using the samples of nasal washes or aspirates many lfia kits are now available in the market such as bd directigen ez rsv binax now rsv rsv respistrip remel xpect and quicklab rsv test
19
 
20
 
21
 the sensitivity and specificity of the abovementioned kits are normally higher than 90 and 95 but they differ by manufacturerthe pcr method is based on the nested rtpcr technique involving the outer and inner primers designed from the f gene of rsva or b this method has been developed in both circle time and operability in adult infections
22
 therefore it can be used to detect samples with low viral titers and sensitively perform identification using antigenbased detection approachesthe following novel pcr detection methods have been established by modification of the conventional pcr approach for example realtime quantitative pcr rtqpcr is a rapid specific and sensitive taqman pcr method for detection subgrouping and quantitation of pathogens this assay increases the sensitivity of conventional pcr it needs two sets of primerprobe pairs which come from the nucleotide sequence of nucleocapsid n gene or fusion f gene targeting rsva and rsvb respectively
23
 
24
 a quantitative taqman pcr assay was once used to detect 175 nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from children with respiratory symptoms in hong kong and it detected 36 rsvpositive samples including 10 as rsva and 26 as rsvb in contrast a cell culturebased assay only identified 21 and an immunofluorescence assay identified 32 rsvpositive specimens all of which were among those identified by the taqman pcr assay suggesting the greater accuracy and sensitivity of the taqman pcr assay
24
 in addition locked nucleic acid lnabased onetube nested realtime otnrtpcr is an assay with very high sensitivity and low incidence of crosscontamination for detection of rsv
25
 a total of 143 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples that tested rsvnegative by qrtpcr were confirmed as rsvpositive by sequencing the otnrtpcr products
25
 indicating that otnrtpcr is more sensitive than rtqpcr for detection of rsv in clinical samples moreover the rapid reversetranscription recombinaseaided amplification rtraa assay was developed as a molecularbased diagnostic method to detect subgroup rsv a and b genomes in clinical specimens this method mainly utilizes an enzyme mixture including singlestrand dna binding protein ssb recombinase uvsx and dna polymerase to detect rna amplicons of rsv
26
 it is performed at 39c in less than 30 minutes with high specificity furthermore reverse transcription strand invasionbased amplification rtsiba is reverse transcription isothermal nucleic acid amplification for rapid detection of rsv with good sensitivity since it can detect as few as 10 copies of rsv rna within 20 minutes
27
 rtsiba does not need highly purified rna for detection of rsv which can reduce the complexity of specimen preparation and shorten the total detection cycle in clinical specimenscoronaviruses belong to the family of coronaviridae bats have been recognized as natural reservoir and vectors of a variety of coronaviruses and the viruses have crossed species barriers to infect humans and many other different kinds of animals including avians rodents and chiropters
50
 
51
 coronavirus may cause respiratory and neurological diseases
52
 so far six human coronaviruses hcovs have been identified including hcov229e hcovhku1 hcovoc43 hcovnl63 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sarscov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov
53
 merscov is a human coronavirus first reported in june 2012 that can cause human respiratory diseases
52
 it has been classified as a lineage c coronavirus and its structure comprises a 30 kb positivesense singlestranded rna genome which is closely related to the lineage c coronaviruses of tylonycteris bat cov hku4 and pipistrellus bat cov hku5
54
 by genomic analysis of lineage c coronaviruses human merscov has shown high similarities to merscov derived from camels with 995 nucleotide identities suggesting that the human and camel isolates belong to the same coronavirus species
4
 as of september 30 2019 2468 laboratoryconfirmed cases of merscov infections including 851 deaths in 27 countries have been reported to who httpswwwwhointemergenciesmers-coven because no commercial vaccines or therapeutic treatments are currently available for mers rapid and accurate diagnosis of merscov is important for the prevention of its transmission and outbreakscurrent diagnostic tests for coronavirus include rtpcr realtime reverse transcription pcr rrtpcr reverse transcription loopmediated isothermal amplification rtlamp as well as realtime rtlamp
51
 
55
 
56
 
57
 
58

a duplex rtpcr method has been developed based on primers and probes targeting the conserved spike s2 gene of sarscov and merscov by using puc57sarsps2 as a template for sarscov and pgemmerss2 as a template for merscov respectively adequate detection limits of 50 to 100 copiesml were achieved
28
 the singleplex rtiipcr assays are designed to detect merscov envelope gene upe and open reading frame 1a orf1a genes separately compared to the reference singleplex rtqpcr assay the sensitivities of the singleplex merscov orf1a and upe rtiipcr assays are 9903 and 100 respectively
29

six commercially available merscov rna detection kits based on rrtpcr are available including accupower bioneer korea anyplex seegene korea diaplexq solgent korea lightmix roche molecular diagnostics switzerland ultrafast kits nanobiosys korea and powerchek kogene biotech korea the powerchek mers realtime pcr anyplex ii merscov upe realtime detection and diaplexq mers virus detection kits consist of two steps a single gene targets the upstream region of the upe region for screening and multiple genes target both upe and orf1a regions for final confirmation
30
 the accupower merscov real time rtpcr lightmix molecular dx merscov upeorf1a and ultrafast labchip merscov realtime pcr kits use two single genetargeting reagents to detect the upe and orf1a genes simultaneously
30
 no crossreactivity has been reported with other respiratory viruses based on the validation tests including 28 specificity panels and 9 clinical specimens the sensitivity and specificity of all these rrtpcr kits for detecting upe and orf1a reach 100 95 confidence interval ci 060100 and 100 95 ci 079100 respectively based on results from the high inhibition panel accupower and powerchek have lowest sensitivity to the presence of pcr inhibition
29
 therefore the overall sensitivity and specificity of the above six rrtpcr kits are sufficient for diagnosing merscov infectionin the rtlamp assay two primer sets were constructed with one set targeting the n gene and one set targeting the orf1a gene both sets have shown high efficiency in amplifying target sequences derived from different merscov strains with no crossreactivity observed with other respiratory viruses
31
 huangs research group has established a nucleic acid visualization technique that combines the rtlamp technique and a vertical flow visualization strip rtlampvf to detect the n gene of merscov
52
 the rtlampvf assay can detect 2  101 copiesl of synthesized rna transcript and 1  101 copiesl of merscov rna without crossreactivity to multiple sarsrelatedcovs including hku1 hku4 oc43 and 229e thus exhibiting high specificityrtlamp and rtlampvf mentioned above are assays for rapid and accurate detection of merscov infection bonhan kooas team designed an archshaped multipletarget sensor capable of rapid pathogen identification using direct amplification in clinical samples the method can detect a variety of viruses including merscov with high sensitivity and specificity and is able to distinguish merscov from hcov in clinical samples within 20 minutes
32
 the taqman probebased onestep rrtpcr assays provide rapid and sensitive internal diagnostic detection of merscov by detecting the upe and open reading frame orf 1b this method is reliable specific and reproducible in addition different from the traditional twostep sample detection method the onestep method combines two steps into one step thus increasing the sensitivity of the measurement for example 10 and 50 copies of rna template per reaction for upe and orf1b respectively
33
 the mabbased rapid np detection method for merscov was used for preliminary rapid screening of merscov infection due to its high specificity but moderate sensitivity the detection limit of this assay is about 1037 to 1042 tcid50ml of merscov and the sensitivity is about 25 to 100fold lower than that of antigen capture elisa
34

the isolation of adenovirus after growth in cell culture and its immunological detection are generally thought to be the gold standard
36
 samples such as throat swabs and stool specimen collected from patients are treated overnight with antibiotics centrifuged and supernatant inoculated with susceptible cells hep2 graham 293 or a549 cpe is observed after cell incubation at 37c and then the hadv is isolated the serotype of hadv can be determined by detecting the antigenic determinant of penton proteins by the hemagglutination inhibition hi test hadv can also be typed by detecting the antigenic determinant of hexon proteins by neutralizing test nt however these methods are timeconsuming require experienced technicians to analyze the results and the results are still uncertain different types of hadv infection can cause different diseases and different symptoms thus detection of antigens and antibodies can make the diagnosis of hadv more rapid and sensitive indirect elisa can detect the iga igm and igg antibodies of hadv in human serum or plasma immunofluores if latex agglutination test lat and enzyme immunoassay eia are also common diagnostic methods accepted by most clinical laboratories because of their simple and rapid characteristicsemerging molecularbased detection methods have gradually replaced traditional detection technology in many laboratories and clinical practices providing reliable new methods for the diagnosis of hadv
60

specific antigenic determinants on the hexon surface of hadv can be identified by neutralizing antibodies the antigenic determinants of hexon proteins have two loops l1 and l2 which are divided into seven hypervariable regions hvr among which hvr 1 to 7 has become the newest method of choice for adenovirus typing madisch developed a twostep diagnostic method that can classify 51 serotypes by amplification and sequencing of the amplification elements on l1 and l2
37
 shimada studied a more conservative hexon gene on hvr which can type 44 serotypes but it is limited to the hadv serotypes that can lead to corneal conjunctivitis
38
 realtime pcr is a sensitive and quantitative technique to diagnose hadv infections a realtime pcr with consensus primer and probe for a conserved region of the hexon gene has been designed to detect 51 prototypes the sensitivity of the assay is 15 copies per run and the linear range of quantitation was 15  101 to 15  108 copiesrun
39
 the realstar adenovirus pcr kit 10 is a realtime pcrbased diagnostic test for in vitro detection and quantification of hadvspecific dna its sensitivity is 109 copiesl 95 062308 copiesl and it has no crossreactivity against 35 human viral pathogens compared with the realstar adenovirus pcr kit the inhouse qpcr assay is more sensitive and reliable for the detection and quantification of hadvspecific dna the performance characteristics of this inhouse qpcr have been evaluated against the realstar adenovirus pcr kit using 122 clinical specimens and 18 proficiency samples
35
 in this study the inhouse hadv qpcr assay detected six hadv species a to f except species g using the realstar adenovirus pcr kit as the reference the sensitivity and specificity are 981 and 100 respectively for the inhouse qpcr assay and the correlation of the two assays is quite good r2  0984 furthermore the inhouse qpcr assay has a linear range up to 9 log10 copiesm and the cv values suggested quite low intrainterassay variationsrhinoviruses rvs are rna viruses belonging to the family picornaviridae genus enterovirus which has been classified into 3 species a to c with over 160 serotypes
64
 
65
 
66
 
67
 rvs are small singlestranded rna viruses with an icosahedral symmetrical capsid
68
 rvs are the most frequent cause of respiratory tract infections in both children and adults rva and rvc are common rv species causing lower airway illness wheezing and acute asthma and they can lead to more severe symptoms than rvb in children
67
 
69

culture isolation of virus combined with acid stabilization test is a classic method for rv diagnosis however this assay is timeconsuming and laborious limiting its value for clinical treatment human rv antibodies can be detected by immunological methods such as the complement fixation test cft hi test if and elisa however owing to the lack of suitable crossreactive antigens to cover a large number of rv serotypes the application of these methods is greatly limited in contrast the onestep realtime pcr assay detects rvs by using a sequence detection system this assay improves workflow reduces preparation time and eliminates crosscontamination that might be introduced during cdna transfer from the reverse transcription reaction into the pcr reaction step
40
 seminested rtpcr assay is based on an extremely sensitive pcr to detect airborne rvs which has a limit of detection lod of approximately 08 median tissue culture infectious dose tcid50

42
 with the rapid development of wgs technology more and more laboratories may perform wgs on human rv isolates clinically with the discovery of hrvc the data volume of wholegenome hrv sequencing has been increased and improved significantly this will help researchers and clinicians to understand the evolutionary and recombination of rv
43
 which may improve diagnosisalthough single respiratory viruses can be detected in patients with symptoms other respiratory viruses may also exist simultaneously children especially those under 5 years of age present with a higher frequency of coinfections
70
 
71
 
72
 multiplex assays that contain more than one viral gene target in a single tube have the advantage of rapid detection of several potential viral pathogens simultaneously multiplex realtime pcr has allowed simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses in a short time compared with the singleplex approach the multiplex diagnostic approach has higher sample throughput 96 samples per run shorter turnaround time 5 hours and a smaller amount of sample requirement
73

the luminex nxtag respiratory pathogen panel nxtagrpp is a new highthroughput multiplex realtime pcr system which was upgraded from the xtag respiratory viral panel fastv2 rvpv2 assay

respiratory viruses are a major cause of symptomatic respiratory tract infection in all age groups worldwide timely and accurate diagnosis of these viruses enables appropriate treatment of infections traditional and modern molecular diagnostic approaches with their advantages disadvantages and principles are summarized for several common respiratory viruses such as influenza virus human rsv coronavirus hadv and rhinovirus as discussed in this review however these respiratory viruses are prone to antigenic drift caused by point mutations in viral genes and new strains with pandemic potential may result from gene reassortment all of these continue to pose new challenges to rapid and accurate detection of respiratory virus infection in humans therefore the identification of mutations within viral genomes is quite essential however efforts to pinpoint genetic mutations in human respiratory viruses have relied on highthroughput sequencing of single genes or gene families using sanger sequencing although this approach has been fruitful the cost and throughput of sanger sequencing generally prohibits systematic sequencing of the 22 000 genes that make up the exome the recent development of ngs technologies changed this paradigm by providing the capability to rapidly sequence exomes transcriptomes and genomes at relatively low cost the application of ngs in diagnosis and identification of respiratory pathogens especially for patients with severe pneumonia or those with unknown origin infections becomes more and more popular ngs exhibited the ability to detect coinfections in severe pneumonia patients and performed well in diagnosing severe pneumonia compared to conventional methods as an infrequently circulating genotype genomic characterization of the whole genome of a viral strain will promote further studies on its epidemiology and pathogenicity and aid the diagnosis of a new emerging respiratory virus wgs enables better identification of transmission events and outbreaks which is not always possible with subgenomic sequencesthe authors declare that there are no conflict of interestsnz lw xd rl ms ch ys and lh drafted the manuscript fy ld and sj revised and edited the manuscript all authors read and made final approve of the manuscriptinfectious diseases are still a major threat in the world today

6 data sharing ensures that other nations use available facts and minimize wastage of time and resources another lesson learnt from this pandemic is that nations should also end secrecy in public health decision-making especially amidst suspected disease outbreaks and promote global cooperation
5 globally governments should be ready to share outbreak information on acquisition transmission and treatment as well as make efforts to fight the spreading of fake news related to outbreaks nations with networks of high-containment biological laboratories must guarantee safety of all agents in their custody to prevent their potential deployment as bioweaponsthis review briefly describes the currently available testing approaches as well as selected two easy to use point-of-care test assays including the xpert

14 non-propagative diagnostic laboratory work such as viral genome sequencing and nucleic acid amplification tests must be conducted at containment facilities and procedures equivalent to biosafety level 2 bsl-2 while propagative work that involves coronavirus culture isolation animal inoculation or neutralization assays must be done at a high-biocontainment laboratory with inward directional airflow minimum bsl-3
14 viral cultures are not recommended for routine diagnosis and must be carried in a minimum of bsl-3 facility or bsl-4
14 however sars-cov-2 virus isolation in cell cultures is critical to obtain isolates for characterization and to support the development of vaccines therapeutic agents
15 and new or better diagnostic testssars-cov-2 is isolated and propagated in primary monkey cells and cell lines such as the kidney vero-e6 llc-mk2 human hepatoma cell line huh7 human airway epithelial cells and vero-e6tmprss2 transmembrane serine protease 2
16 not all countries or jurisdictions have the facilities to perform virological culture tests for covid-19 this is due to several reasons such as the required level of technical expertise required for the tests and biosafety requirements therefore in such cases these regions eg american samoa have had to ship clinical samples from suspected individuals to either the us cdc laboratory in atlanta georgia
17 or who reference testing laboratories in france united kingdom china japan singapore australia thailand india usa south africa senegal russian federation germany and the netherlands
18 this increases the tat for the diagnosis even when they are shipped as expedited consignments in addition to virological culture serological tests are currently under development and these could enable diagnosis of covid-19 especially in patients for whom acute and convalescent paired samples are available these are drawn approximately 2 weeks apart to monitor any significant changes in antibody titers of the patients however development of these types of tests is currently challenging due to a lack of knowledge about the antibody response elicited from the sars-cov-2 infection in humans including the question concerning the antigenic differences between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov
19 in addition these serological tests may face a challenge of cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses
18 however the fda has offered emergency use authorization of the first antibody-based test for covid-19 that detects antibodies in the ones blood rather than for the virus in the nose or throat samples this test is only done at certified laboratories and even though it takes 15 to 20 minutes to get a result after sample collection it is not a bedside test
20 point-of-care testing means that results are delivered to patients in the patient care setting such as hospitals urgent care centers and medical emergency rooms instead of samples being sent to a testing laboratory real-time pcr also known as quantitative pcr is commonly used in molecular point-of-care testing it can amplify more than one genomic target and in the case of covid-19 and these can be
orf1ab of coronaviruses occupy about two thirds of their genomes it encodes the replicase polyprotein and is translated from orf1a and orf1b
e-gene envelope protein and
n-gene the nucleocapsid protein
21 and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp that is an essential viral enzyme which replicates positive-strand rna viral genome for more specificity some molecular diagnostic assays amplify more than one molecular target in the virus to minimize chances of all three targets mutating and hence being missed by the diagnostic test
21 during the development of disease testing assays us manufacturers can apply for emergency clinical use authorization from fda and in the european union manufacturers can obtain conformit europene which literally means european conformity marking them for
in vitro diagnostic useon march 21 2020 the us fda granted emergency use authorization to a rapid point-of-care diagnostic test designed to detect covid-19 infection

30 in addition the above two covid-19 molecular diagnostic tests are designed for near patient testing in a variety of healthcare environments using a range of sample types such as throat nasal nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and this facilitates effective patient managementas the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 rises rapidly throughout the world more and more nations continue to require reliable testing a rapid inexpensive and easy-to-use point-of-care diagnostic device integrated with a smartphone could reduce transportation needs lower the risk of spreading infection alleviate the strain on the healthcare system and mitigate the cost of testing for both individuals and governments
31 unfortunately scaling up production of available covid-19 diagnostics as well as personal protective equipment remain an ongoing challenge in the fight against this disease a list of other diagnostics under development and testing are listed here
32 the who prequalification team activated the emergency use listing eul for candidates in vitro diagnostics to detect sars-cov-2 there is currently a total of 30 different diagnostic tests at the time of this publication
33 since sars-cov-2 diagnostics development and approval are rapidly changing this information is updated weekly at the
who portal as governments around the world are being encouraged by who to rapidly test a very large percentage of their populations to fight coronavirus
34 these tests will be critical in meeting this demandfollowing the emergence of sars-cov-2 genomic analyses continue to play a key role in the public health response by informing the design of appropriate molecular diagnostics and corroborating epidemiological efforts to trace contacts
35 in order to better understand the spread of this pandemic and design better interventions whole genome sequencing of the virus from a range of clinical presentations of the disease in different parts of the world must occur 
figure 1 it has been suggested from rapid data sharing using publicly available sequence data platforms that this pandemic was a point-source outbreak
35
36 therefore researchers need more data from the whole genomes of sars-cov-2 including viral transcriptome
37 all these have the potential to reveal further insights into the biology of this emergent pathogen
35 nanopore minion sequencing technology has been used to sequence sars-cov-2 genomes
38
39 many of these genomes have been successfully uploaded to global initiative on sharing all influenza data -
gisaid by the who reference laboratories globally and
nextstrain other public repositories that have a number of these sequences are genbank and the sequence read archive of the us national center for biotechnologycurrently with more than 26 million infected individuals in 185 sovereign states and 183000 deaths globally
40 at the time of writing the covid-19 pandemic may see deployment of covid-19 rapid non-invasive point-of-care tests at civil airports and national borders to screen individuals and avoid imported cases of the infection this would be similar to mitigation of aircraft hijackings and in-flight sabotage using mandatory civil aviation security procedures including strict security screening for passengers and baggage at all commercial airports
41 currently screening for covid-19 is performed by checking for high fever in individuals coming through airports and border controls using thermal screening guns a nanosensor diagnostic platform is in development to test for this virus which will replace thermal screening guns and be more specific this technology which will be in the form of a hand-held device promises to give results specific for this virus within one minute by detecting the nucleocapsid protein specific for this virus using nanosensor and aptamer technology
21to minimise the current covid-19 pandemic related pressure on health systems globally especially arising from ramping up testing capacity quickly readily accessible cheap easy to use and interpret point-of-care diagnostic tests with high sensitivity must be developed produced and distributed widelyno data is associated with this articlethe identification by us public health officials of presumptive covid-19 cases believed to be due to community transmission of this infection brings into sharp focus the importance of the laboratory diagnosis of infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 15 the current recommendations for laboratory diagnosis of covid-19 from the cdc are that clinicians coordinate this testing with local public health authorities andor the cdc the preferred testing method is the real-time reverse transcription-pcr rt-pcr test 68 similar to that developed for the diagnosis of sars-cov 9 10 viral cultures are not recommended this commentary addresses current issues for the laboratory diagnosis of covid-19 that must be understood by clinicians clinical microbiology laboratories and public health authoritiesi initial respiratory tract specimen collection for diagnosis and screening of patients with covid-19 pneumonia within 5 to 6 days of the onset of symptoms patients with covid-19 have demonstrated high viral loads in their upper and lower respiratory tracts 1114 a nasopharyngeal np swab andor an oropharyngeal op swab are often recommended for screening or diagnosis of early infection 9 12 15 a single np swab has become the preferred swab as it is tolerated better by the patient and is safer to the operator np swabs have an inherent quality control in that they usually reach the correct area to be tested in the nasal cavity wang et al have just reported that op swabs n  398 were used much more frequently than nasal swabs n  8 in china during the covid-19 outbreak however the sars-cov-2 rna was detected in only 32 of op swabs which was significantly lower than the level in nasal swabs 63 16 while collectiontesting of both nasal and op swabs either as independent specimens or together within a single aliquot of viral transport medium might be an attractive option under normal circumstances institutions must also consider the potential stress that this pandemic places on nationalinternational supply chains in this light another excellent reason to limit testing with np swabs is to prolong supplies of flocked swabs andor transport media however as we understand more about respiratory and oral contact routes of transmission we may learn that patients with pharyngitis as a dominant initial presenting symptom can be adequately sampled via the op routein order to properly obtain an np swab specimen the swab must be inserted deeply into the nasal cavity patients will likely flinch but that means the swab has hit the target swabs should be kept in place for 10 s while being twirled three times swabs should have flocked nontoxic synthetic fibers such as polyester as well as synthetic nylon handles 17 collecting an npop swab specimen may carry a theoretical risk of transmitting sars-cov-2 particularly if airborne transmission is demonstrated as the investigation of the covid-19 outbreak continues 18 if personal protective equipment ppe cannot be utilized due to scarcity of such ppe other means of collecting upper respiratory tract specimens will be needed 18 one alternative option for collecting an upper respiratory tract specimen to evaluate patients with suspected covid-19 pneumonia is a self-collected saliva specimen 1922 should the supply of swabs become scarce other nonflocked swabs and transport media have been cleared equivalently by the food and drug administration fda under an emergency use authorization eua but head-to-head comparisons are lacking currentlyafter collection swabs should be placed in viral universal transport medium for rapid transportation to the clinical microbiology laboratory ideally under refrigerated conditions 17 it should be noted however that in some cases salivanpsops may miss early infection and that in later infection the main site of replication may have shifted to the low respiratory tract repeated testing or obtaining lower respiratory tract specimens may be required moreover other respiratory viral pathogens such as influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses must be ruled out in many ways covid-19 highlights the key difference between analytic and clinical sensitivities that is the ability of an assay to detect a pathogen when it is present in a clinical specimen versus the ability of a test to identify a patients overall infected status the latter of course reflects various other factors that include the specimen site and method of collection in conjunction with the burden of organism as a function of anatomic location disease severity and time symptomatic and variability of these factors from individual to individual repeated testing may be particularly important if a patient has a clinical picture of viral pneumonia a potential exposure history andor radiographic findings chest computed tomography ct or magnetic resonance imaging mri scan consistent with covid-19 pneumonia equally challenging are how the results of a single undetected result should impact decisions regarding patient quarantine and social distancing in particular when the patients themselves are health care providers including clinical laboratory staff serology as discussed in the postanalytical section may assist in such situationsii late detection and monitoring of patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia ideally sputum sampling or bronchoalveolar lavage should be used for collecting lower respiratory tract specimens as they have yielded the highest viral loads for the diagnosis of covid-19 18 23 a recent study revealed that samples bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid yielded the highest sars-cov-2 rna rate although this study did not compareevaluate results from np swabs 16 patients who present with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome may require emergent intubation as well as respiratory isolation in a negative-pressure room if possible a lower respiratory tract sputum specimen should be collected during the intubation procedure alternatively sputum andor bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens can be collected after intubation 9 11however some patients with covid-19 pneumonia have demonstrated high viral rna loads of sars-cov-2 in fecal material 24 25 as well as delayed shedding from the respiratory tract 4 18 late in their clinical course enteric involvement previously has been seen in patients with severe novel coronavirus infections 9 2632 in four such studies sars coronavirus was isolated from stool cultures 26 28 31 in another study sars coronavirus was demonstrated inside enterocytes by electron microscopy 30 thus aside from direct respiratory sampling the preferred method for detecting sars-cov-2 in advanced covid-19 cases may be a rectal swab and real-time rt-pcr 9 2628 3032iii safety measures for specimen processing for pcr processing and testing processing of respiratory specimens should be done in a class ii biological safety cabinet 6 9 10 although some laboratories would argue that biosafety level three bsl-3 work procedures should be used and that the safety cabinet should be in a negative-pressure room within the laboratory such as that used for mycobacterial cultures for nucleic acid extraction before real-time rt-pcr is performed the specimen should be transferred to lysis buffer under this bsl-2 cabinet the lysis buffer should contain a guanidinium-based inactivating agent as well as a nondenaturing detergent indeed the buffers included in common commercial extraction platforms such as the biomrieux easymag or qiagen ez1 do contain guanidiumdetergents and are able to inactivate any viable coronavirus 3335 similarly universal transport medium that includes guanidinium salt is available from merlin biomedical xiamen china httpwwwchinamerlincomenindexphppproductsshowid166sidcid68lanmu2 because this test is a reverse transcription method the salivaswabs used to collect the clinical specimens should be quickly added to lysis buffer to disinfect the specimen as well as to stop degradation of the coronavirus rna 6 9 10 the clinical specimensswabs should not be heated to 56c for 30 min as evidence suggests that this process may also degrade the coronavirus rna even as it inactivates viable coronavirus 9 36moreover self-enclosed systems integrating nucleic acid extraction amplification and detection such as id now abbott san diego ca 37 38 cobas liat roche molecular systems pleasanton ca and genexpert cepheid sunnyvale ca 39 when available and meeting local regulatory requirements for sars-cov-2 testing will be very useful once the clinical specimen in viral transport medium is transferred into a cartridge in a class ii biosafety cabinet the cartridge is sealed many of these random-access sealed devices are suitable for point-of-care testing for local hospitals and clinics without biosafety cabinets in this situation the specimen collector in appropriate protective gear splash guardgoggles mask gloves and disposable laboratory coat could directly transfer the specimen into detection cartridges at bedside or in a location without a class ii biosafety cabinet and the closed cartridge could be safely placed on an instrument for testing however spills of transport solution during transfer to these cartridge-based tests should be avoided and if they occur decontamination should be performed as appropriatei assay selection immunoassays have been developed for rapid detection of sars-cov-2 antigens or antibodies these rapid point-of-care immunoassays are generally lateral flow assays but high-throughput immunoanalyzer versions are also in development for population-level screening such lateral flow assays have been developed for detecting antigens such as the sars-cov-2 virus or for detecting antibodies igm and igg against covid-19rapid antigen lateral flow assays would theoretically provide the advantage of a fast time to result and low-cost detection of sars-cov-2 but are likely to suffer from poor sensitivity early in infection based on the experience with this method for influenza flu viruses 4044 monoclonal antibodies specifically against sars-cov-2 have been under development and several rapid antigen assays are being developed 45 there is concern that given the variability of viral loads in covid-19 patients antigen detection may miss cases due to low infectious burden or sampling variabilityserology measures the host response to infection and is an indirect measure of infection that is best utilized retrospectively serological methods are rapidly being developed and have proven to be useful in confirming past covid-19 25 serology previously has had an important role in the epidemiology of sars 46 and other coronavirus outbreaks 47 rapid lateral flow assays for both igm and igg antibodies undoubtably will play an important role in the covid-19 outbreak and should allow the burden of infection the role of asymptomatic infections the basic reproduction number and the overall mortality to be determined however igm responses are notoriously nonspecific and given the weeks required to develop specific igg responses serology detection is not likely to play a role in active case management except to diagnoseconfirm late covid-19 cases or to determine the immunity of health care workers as the outbreak progresses cell culture is not recommended for diagnostic purposesii assay selection for molecular detection of sars-cov-2 random-amplification deep-sequencing methods played a major role in the initial identification of sars-cov-2 4852 deep sequencing molecular methods such as next-generation sequencing and metagenomic next-generation sequencing will continue to be needed to determine future mutations of sars-cov-2 but are currently impractical for diagnosing covid-19 most of the molecular diagnostics being developed for the diagnosis of covid-19 involve real-time rt-pcr assays including those from the us centers for disease control and prevention 53 charit institute of virology in berlin germany 7 54 and hong kong university 21 55 other molecular methods are being developed and evaluated worldwide and include loop-mediated isothermal amplification multiplex isothermal amplification followed by microarray detection and crispr clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-based assays 56iii target selection for real-time rt-pcr assays a real-time rt-pcr method is recommended for molecular testing 6 810 a major advantage of real-time rt-pcr assays is that amplification and analysis are done simultaneously in a closed system to minimize false-positive results associated with amplification product contamination there are a number of coronaviruses that cause respiratory and intestinal infections in humans 8 57 among these coronaviruses are a group of sars-like bat coronaviruses including both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 that comprise a unique clade under the subgenus sarbecovirus 57 58 coronaviruses have a number of molecular targets within their positive-sense single-stranded rna genome that can be used for pcr assays 6 7 57 58 these include genes encoding structural proteins including envelope glycoproteins spike s envelope e transmembrane m helicase hel and nucleocapsid n 5759 in addition to the genes that encode structural proteins there are species-specific accessory genes that are required for viral replication these include rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp hemagglutinin-esterase he and open reading frame 1a orf1a and orf1b 7 5355 57 58 in the united states the cdc recommends two nucleocapsid protein targets n1 and n2 53 while who recommends first-line screening with an e gene assay followed by a confirmatory assay using the rdrp gene 7 chan et al have just developed and compared the performance of three novel real-time rt-pcr assays targeting the rdrphel s and n genes of sars-cov-2 among them the covid-19-rdrphel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro and higher sensitivity and specificity 59 however it is likely that well-optimized targets will arise from a number of viral genomic locations since assay performance is usually dictated by the reagent design not the target itself since the viral genes are present in equal copy numbersto avoid potential cross-reaction with other endemic coronaviruses as well as potential genetic drift of sars-cov-2 at least two molecular targets should be included in the assay various investigators in different countries have used a number of these molecular targets for real-time rt-pcr assays in the united states the cdc has selected two loci in the nucleocapsid gene as the two-target assay appears to be performing well 53 one study utilized two sequence regions open reading frame 1b and a nucleocapsid protein that are highly conserved among sarbecoviruses for initial real-time rt-pcr testing 6 another study in hong kong china used two targets for its rt-pcr assay the first used the nucleocapsid for screening followed by confirmation by the open reading frame 1b 55 in germany two molecular targets envelope and rna-dependent rna polymerase have been selected 7 in china at the time of manuscript preparation several molecular devices had received urgent approval 8 to date there has been no indication that any one of the sequence regions used offers a unique advantage for clinical diagnostic testing however the ideal design would include at least one conserved region and one specific region to mitigate against the effects of genetic drift especially as the virus evolves within new populationsin the united states regulatory issues have complicated the development and implementation of laboratory-developed molecular tests for the diagnosis of covid-19 on 29 february 2020 the fda issued new guidance for laboratories to be able to develop and implement covid-19 molecular diagnostic tests prior to obtaining eua laboratories are required to submit an eau to the fda within 15 business days after validation moreover the validation must include the specimen types eg nasopharyngeal oropharyngeal or saliva that are to be used clinically although these new regulatory burdens did not prohibit the development of molecular laboratory testing for the diagnosis of covid-19 they did create a lot of extra work at the time of writing the us fda had granted quite a few euas httpswwwfdagovmedical-devicesemergency-situations-medical-devicesemergency-use-authorizationscoronavirus2019 accessed 28 march 2020i interpretation of molecular results in the united states initially if both of two targets in the cdc assay nucleocapsid proteins n1 and n2 test positive a case is considered to be laboratory confirmed 53 a cycle threshold ct value of less than 40 is defined as a positive test while a ct value of 40 or more is defined as a negative test a ct value of 40 for only one of the two nucleocapsid protein n1 and n2 is defined as indeterminant and requires confirmation by retesting 53 currently in china for the assays with three targets positives for two or more targets are considered positive 60 although some correlations have been revealed viral loads determined by real-time rt-pcr assays should not be used yet to indicate covid-19 severity or to monitor therapeutic response 1113 61 62 however low ct values indicating high viral loads may be used as an indication of transmissibility 18 63ii test of cure and test of infectivity monitoring patients with resolution of covid-19 pneumonia may also be important in terms of when they should be released from isolation and discharged if discharged patients are still shedding viable coronavirus they are likely to infect other people 27 therefore self-quarantine for up to 1 month has been recommended in some cases np and op swabs may not be sufficient for either test of cure or test of infectivity 64 but this needs further investigation one approach to test of cure has been to demonstrate two consecutive negative real-time rt-pcr tests from rectal swabs this suggestion is based on the fact that sars-cov-1 was cultured from stool during the 2002-2003 sars outbreak 26 28 31 and sars-cov-2 has been cultured from stool during the covid-19 outbreak 16 thus a rectal swab that is positive by real-time pcr testing suggests that this patient may be shedding viable sars-cov-2 in their stools thereby remaining infectious 16 2428 3032 however a very recent study on 20 serial covid-19 patients indicated that infectious virus was not isolated from stool samples in spite of high virus rna concentrations 14 the correlation of rt-pcr positivity in stool with recovery of live virus from the same samples remains to be fully investigatediii serology of covid-19 members of the coronavirus family have four structural proteins the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins two of these proteins appear to be important antigenic sites for the development of serological assays to detect covid-19 serological methods have focused on detecting serum antibodies against s proteins from the coronavirus spike 47 the coronavirus envelope spike is responsible for receptor binding and fusion and determines host tropism and transmission capability 57 58 s proteins are determined by the s gene and are functionally divided into two subunits s1 and s2 the s1 domain is responsible for receptor binding while the s2 domain is responsible for fusion sars-cov and sars-cov-2 bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 which is found on human respiratory cells renal cells and gastrointestinal cells 57 65 66 the other protein that appears to be an important antigenic site for the development of serological assays to detect covid-19 is the n protein which is a structural component of the helical nucleocapsid the n protein plays an important role in viral pathogenesis replication and rna packaging antibodies to the n protein are frequently detected in covid-19 patients 67 68 suggesting that the n protein may be one of the immunodominant antigens in the early diagnosis of covid-19 69as mentioned above rapid lateral flow assays for antibodies igm and igg produced during covid-19 have been developed 70 seroconversion occurred after 7 days of symptomatic infection in 50 of patients 14 days in all but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load 14 serological methods when available will play an important role in the epidemiology of covid-19 and in determining the immune status of asymptomatic patients but are unlikely to play any role in screening or for the diagnosis of early infections 14 67 68 however serology may be useful for confirming the diagnosis of covid-19 25the ongoing unprecedented outbreak of covid-19 globally has emphasized the importance of the laboratory diagnosis of human coronavirus infections in order to limit the spread as well as to appropriately treat those patients who have a serious infection this commentary has addressed current issues regarding such testing for sars-cov-2 for example an np rather than op swab is recommended for early diagnosis or screening because it provides higher diagnostic yields is better tolerated by the patient and is safer for the operator an np swab can be combined with an op swab to increase sensitivity but requires twice the number of swabs should the np swabs become scarce self-collected saliva or nasal washes could be used as an alternative specimen type for epidemiological screening and for the worried well who are asymptomatic persons with no exposure history who wish to be tested just to be sure they are not infected np swabs would then be reserved for hospitalized patients those who test negative may need deep sputum or bal fluid samples collected the importance of repeated testing or the use of bronchoscopy in patients with severe illness should the first screening test be negative must be understood the role of rectal swabs in testing patients with late infection or as a test of infectivitycure is currently not well studied but needs urgent attention equally unappreciated is the need for broad screeningtesting with molecular testing andor serological testing in order to determine the true mortality rate as well as other epidemiological markers finally the importance of rapid development of integrated random-access point-of-care molecular devices for the accurate diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infections cannot be overemphasized these short-turnaround-time stat tests will be very important for real-time patient management and infection control decisions especially when other less infectious forms of pneumonia are present and respiratory isolate resources are scarce these assays are safe simple and fast and can be used in local clinics and hospitals that already have the needed instruments and that are responsible for identifying and treating such patientssince its first appearance in 2012 the middle east respiratory syndrome mers has affected more than 25 countries in four continents with more than 1300 cases and a high fatality rate of more than 30 1 a novel lineage c betacoronavirus mers coronavirus mers-cov has been confirmed to be the etiological agent23 human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 hdpp4 was found to be the cellular receptor for mers-cov4 subsequent detection of mers-cov and its antibodies in dromedaries in various countries in the middle east and north africa have implied that these animals are probably the reservoir for mers-cov57 other lineage c betacoronaviruses in bats eg tylonycteris bat cov hku4 ty-batcov-hku4 pipistrellus bat cov hku5 pi-batcov-hku5 and hedgehogs were found to be closely related to mers-cov89so far detection of mers-cov and discoveries of its closely related covs are most efficiently achieved through rt-pcr although rt-pcr is highly sensitive its turn-around-time is about 4 h and the test requires expensive equipment stringent laboratory set-up and personal attention to prevent laboratory pcr product cross contamination which may lead to false-positive results recently we have developed a monoclonal antibody-based rapid nucleocapsid protein detection assay for on-site diagnosis of mers-cov which can be finished in 30 min10 this rapid test is highly specific for mers-cov for human and dromedary samples as samples containing other human covs hcov-oc43 hcov-229e hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 or dromedary cov uae-hku23 all showed negative results however these human and dromedary covs are all non-lineage c betacoronaviruses it is not known if the nucleocapsid protein of lineage c betacoronaviruses other than mers-cov may cross-react with that of mers-cov we hypothesize that such cross-reactivity may occur and the rapid test can pick up lineage c betacoronaviruses closely related to mers-cov and hence would be useful for the discovery of mers-cov ancestors to test this hypothesis we examined the usefulness of this rapid test to detect four alphacoronaviruses and four lineage b c and d betacoronaviruses that we previously discovered in alimentary samples of bats81116 the differential positive rate of detecting lineage c betacoronaviruses that showed different relatedness to mers-cov was also discusseda total of 131 alimentary samples from bats that were tested rna-positive for four alphacoronaviruses rhinolophus bat

best-fit substitution model was selected using mega 60the rapid mers-cov nucleocapsid protein detection assay was tested positive in 24 889 of the 27 ty-batcov-hku4 rna-positive alimentary samples of tylonycteris pachypus and 4 190 of the 21 pi-batcov-hku5 rna-positive alimentary samples of pipistrellus abramus fig 1a and table 1 there was significantly more ty-batcov-hku4 rna-positive alimentary samples than pi-batcov-hku5 rna-positive alimentary samples that were tested positive by the rapid mers-cov nucleocapsid protein detection assay p  0001 by chi-square test the rapid mers-cov nucleocapsid protein detection assay was tested negative in all 51 alimentary samples rna-positive for alphacoronaviruses and 32 alimentary samples rna-positive for lineage b and lineage d betacoronaviruses table 1the purified recombinant nucleocapsid protein of a ty-batcov-hku4 strain sm2a of which the sample showed positive result was tested positive fig 1b and three ty-batcov-hku4 rna-negative alimentary samples of tylonycteris pachypus and three pi-batcov-hku5 rna-negative alimentary samples of pipistrellus abramus were tested negative fig 1a by the rapid test confirming that the positive results were due to the nucleocapsid protein of the cov but not other ingredients or chemicals in the alimentary samples of the bats for the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of ty-batcov-hku4 strain sm2a the detection limit was 06 g of proteinthe median range viral loads of the 27 ty-batcov-hku4 and 21 pi-batcov-hku5 positive alimentary samples were 408  108 891  106631

that were tested positive and negative by the rapid mers-cov nucleocapsid protein detection assay mannwitney u testin the phylogenetic tree constructed using the amino acid sequences of the nucleocapsid protein of mers-cov ty-batcov-hku4 and pi-batcov-hku5 it was observed that the nucleocapsid protein of mers-cov is more closely related to that of ty-batcov-hku4 than pi-batcov-hku5 fig 2the rapid mers-cov nucleocapsid protein detection assay is able to rapidly detect lineage c betacoronaviruses in bats and other potential animal reservoir two years ago we developed a monoclonal antibodies-based mers-cov nucleocapsid protein capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using two mers-cov nucleocapsid protein specific monoclonal antibodies20 the two monoclonal antibodies reacted with the nucleocapsid protein of mers-cov but not those of hcov-229e and hcov-oc4320 subsequently using the format of a lateral flow immunoassay we further developed a rapid mers-cov nucleocapsid protein detection assay10 both the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and rapid assay showed high specificity for mers-cov in human and dromedary samples as all the respiratory and alimentary samples that contained alphacoronaviruses and lineage a and b betacoronaviruses of human and dromedary origins with comparable viral load ranges to those samples that contained ty-batcov-hku4 and pi-batcov-hku5 data not shown were tested negative by both assays1020 in this study we demonstrated and exploited the relative non-specificity of the rapid assay to detect ty-batcov-hku4 and pi-batcov-hku5 lineage c bat betacoronaviruses closely related to mers-covthe rapid mers-cov nucleocapsid protein detection assay detected significantly more ty-batcov-hku4 than pi-batcov-hku5 previous studies have shown that the receptor binding domain of the spike protein in ty-batcov-hku4 but not pi-batcov-hku5 is able to bind hdpp42122 moreover pseudotyped virus embedding the spike protein of ty-batcov-hku4 but not pi-batcov-hku5 can use hdpp4 as a receptor for infecting cells2122 furthermore phylogenetic analysis showed that the s protein of mers-cov is more closely related to that of ty-batcov-hku4 than pi-batcov-hku5 fig 2 and the receptor binding domain of pi-batcov-hku5 has deletions compared to those of mers-cov and ty-batcov-hku421 as for the target nucleocapsid protein which the monoclonal antibodies of the rapid assay in the present study captured phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequence comparison also showed that the nucleocapsid protein of mers-cov is more closely related to that of ty-batcov-hku4 than pi-batcov-hku5 fig 2 this may explain why the rapid test is able to pick up almost 90 of ty-batcov-hku4 but only about 20 of pi-batcov-hku5 indicating that antigenically the epitopes on the nucleocapsid protein of ty-batcov-hku4 more readily cross-react with the corresponding ones on the nucleocapsid protein of mers-cov than pi-batcov-hku5 this is also in line with the results of multiple alignments for the amino acid sequences of the mers-cov ty-batcov-hku4 and pi-batcov-hku5 nucleocapsid proteins by comparing the variable sites of the three viruses it was found that 44 residues were identical between mers-cov and ty-batcov-hku4 but not pi-batcov-hku5 while only 22 residues were identical between mers-cov and pi-batcov-hku5 but not ty-batcov-hku4 fig 3 based on the results we speculate that whether a specific ty-batcov-hku4 or pi-batcov-hku5 strain can be picked up by the rapid test depends more on the sequence of the epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibodies than the viral load of the sample as high viral load samples eg sm6a could be tested negative while low viral load samples eg wlp31a could be tested positive table 2this rapid mers-cov nucleocapsid protein detection assay will facilitate rapid on-site mass screening of bat samples for ancestors of mers-cov that are closely related to mers-cov so far detection of mers-cov ancestors was performed by collection of animal samples mostly from the middle east and north africa transporting them to laboratories in developed countries and viral rna detection by quantitative real-time rt-pcr or metagenomics technologies2324 such viral studies were seldom performed in the field or laboratories in the middle east where resources and expertize could be limited moreover it is expensive and labor-intensive to perform these nucleic detection assays for screening thousands of bat samples from diverse species which may be needed to pick up just a dozen of positive samples in surveillance studies compared to quantitative real-time rt-pcr and metagenomics the cost of the present rapid assay is much lower it also does not require expertize on molecular technology and the expensive set-up for molecular studies which may not be present in most clinical laboratories in the middle east where specimen transport in hot climate is often a problem in the middle east and north africa this user-friendly rapid test is suitable for testing a large number of bat samples at the study field if a particular sample is positive the investigator can easily collect more samples from the particular bat species for further studies on the other hand if a certain sample is negative the bat can be released back to the wild such strategies would be extremely useful for tracking the transmission patterns of mers-cov and its close ancestors in different bat species across different countries it is notable that although the rapid test is able to pick up 889 of ty-batcov-hku4 a lineage c betacoronavirus which can bind and utilize hdpp4 it can only detect 19 of pi-batcov-hku5 a lineage c betacoronavirus which cannot bind and utilize hdpp4 this limitation renders this rapid test mainly suitable for on-site mass screening for ancestors of mers-cov that are more closely related to mers-cov application of this rapid antigen assay for large number of samples at the field coupled with confirmation by rt-pcr in more equipped laboratories may speed up and allow more cost-effective surveillance studies for animal ancestors of mers-covsince the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 emerged at the end of 2019 in wuhan china it has rapidly progressed to a pandemic status and has caused tremendous repercussions on human health and life1

2 as a newly emerged virus is normally assigned to a species based on its phylogeny and taxonomy3

4 the causative pathogen of covid-19 was officially named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-22 sars-cov-2 has been found to be closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov which was identified in 2003 both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 may have originated from bats and have evolved to be capable of human-to-human transmission through accumulation of genetic mutations5 while facing an emerging infectious disease rapid identification of the causative microorganism and analysis of its genome composition helps in the development of diagnostic tests therapeutic drugs and vaccines required to contain the spread of the disease and to mitigate the impact of the disease it is especially true for a viral disease with high transmissibility pathogenicity and virulence as observed in the current covid-19 pandemicviral culture a gold standard for diagnosis of viral infections is a time-consuming method and can only be performed in a high biosafety level laboratory specifically designed for handling biohazardous pathogens real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr assay used for amplification and detection of specific viral nucleic acid sequences within few hours has been an important and irreplaceable diagnostic tool in recent years however rrt-pcr assay remains labor-intensive and expertise-dependent and is only available in hospitals with a qualified microbiology laboratory6

7 the surge capacity of rrt-pcr assay has been limited by the mass influx of patients with covid-19 due to the large-scale community outbreak of the disease in addition the site of specimen collection technique and timing of the disease course significantly affect the sensitivity and specificity of the rrt-pcr assay in the diagnosis of covid-19 thus a simple easy-to-use and accurate diagnostic tool is needed to supplement the diagnosis of covid-19 to improve patient outcome resource allocation and infection control interventionsserological tests based on point-of-care poc lateral flow immunoassays lfias have been developed to detect anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies simultaneously or separately for the diagnosis of covid-198 9 10 compared to rrt-pcr serological tests have the advantage of decreased technical requirement short turnaround time affordability lower sampling and specimen preparation risk and higher detection sensitivity and specificity serological testing is therefore an important diagnostic tool and can be used as an adjuvant to rrt-pcr for mass screening clinical diagnosis and epidemiological study of covid-19many rapid serological tests targeting anti-sars-cov-2 immunoglobulin a iga immunoglobulin m igm or immunoglobulin g igg antibodies have been applied for clinical use in many countries8

9 however the usefulness of these poc rapid serological tests based on lateral flow immunoassays lfias has not been elaborately studied therefore the primary goal of this study was to evaluate and compare the usefulness of four poc antibody rapid tests in the diagnosis of covid-19 infection based on different time courses of the disease further we hypothesized that there might exist a difference in dynamic antibody response between patients with covid-19 at different levels of severity therefore the second goal of this study was to test our hypothesis by comparing the difference in time from symptom onset to seroconversion between patients with covid-19 with and without pneumoniain taiwan samples from patients who meet the reporting criteria of covid-19 have to be submitted to virology laboratories validated and contracted by the centers for diseases control and prevention of taiwan taiwan cdc for sars-cov-2 rrt-pcr testing11 the samples include oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs oral gargling and sputum three sets of primers and probes targeting sars-cov-2 envelope e nucleocapsid n and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp genes are used in addition to sars-cov-2 rt-pcr testing all respiratory samples are simultaneously evaluated for the presence of influenza ab viruses using rt-pcr if the results are negative for both sars-cov-2 and influenza ab viruses an additional sars-cov-2 rrt-pcr test for another respiratory sample from the suspected covid patient is performed12 13 14 all rrt-pcr confirmed patients with covid-19 have to be reported to the national health command center nhcc and are mandatorily hospitalized in a negative-pressure isolation room to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 in the community as of may 2 2020 taiwan has maintained a record of limited community transmission of covid-19 and has 432 confirmed cases15
our hospital national taiwan university ntuh a 2500-bed teaching hospital in northern taiwan admitted a total of 16 rrt-pcr-positive and nhcc-confirmed patients with covid-19 between january 23 2020 and april 25 2020 this retrospective and observational study was undertaken at ntuh where all the 16 rrt-pcr confirmed patients with covid-19 were enrolled this study was approved by the institutional review board of the hospital ntuh202003004rind and the requirement for informed consent from each patient was waivedwe used the residual blood samples collected from attending physicians providing regular medical care all blood samples were collected on the date of venipuncture if multiple blood samples were collected from a patient with covid-19 on the same day only one sample was used for antibody rapid testing the serum samples collected from the study patients were stored at -20c before use frozen samples were stored until further analysis with only a single freeze-thaw cyclein addition 58 control serum samples collected from 58 hospitalized patients median duration from symptom onset 13 days range 1-59 days with respiratory tract infection or fever but two negative results of sars-cov-2 rrt-pcr test were evaluated to validate the performance of the assay none of these cases were confirmed to be positive for covid-19 by rrt-pcr during or after hospitalizationpatient data including sex age date of symptom onset date of hospitalization requirement of intensive care unit admission icu and date of icu admission were retrieved from electronic medical records we also recorded the results of sars-cov-2 rrt-pcr test performed using respiratory tract specimens collected on the same day as blood samples all the 16 confirmed covid-19 patients had at least 2 chest roentgenographic survey during hospitalization all of the chest roentgenograms were reviewed presence of pneumonia in chest roentgenogram of all confirmed patients with covid-19 was judged by two investigators independently wu jl and tseng wp if there was discrepancy in the interpretation of initial chest roentgenogram a third investigators chen sy opinion was sought to reach final consensus for the 58 covid-19-negative cases opd follow-up records and laboratory study results for infection etiology were further collectedfour qualitative rapid tests for anti-sars-cov-2 antibody were evaluated in this study 1 alltest 2019-ncov iggigm rapid test hangzhou alltest biotech co ltd china 2 dynamiker 2019-ncov iggigm rapid test dynamiker biotechnology tianjin co ltd china 3 ask covid-19 iggigm rapid test tonyar biotech inc taiwan and 4 wondfo sars-cov-2 antibody test guangzhou wondfo biotech co ltd china product information of the four rapid tests used for detection of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies is summarized in table 18

seroconversion was defined as the earliest date on which a positive anti-sars-cov-2 antibody response was detected in a serum sample using a specific poc rapid test time to seroconversion detection was defined as the duration from the date of symptom onset to the date of seroconversion diagnostic sensitivity of a poc rapid test was defined as the percentage of serum samples from confirmed patients with covid-19 found to be positive for antibodies against sars-cov-2 diagnostic specificity of a poc rapid test was defined as the percentage of serum samples from control patients found to be negative for antibodies against sars-cov-2we calculated means and standard deviations sds for age variables and percentages for categorical variables the cumulative probabilities of detection of seroconversion for a specific rapid test were obtained using kaplanmeier method the difference in the cumulative probability of detection of seroconversion between the four antibody rapid tests was evaluated using the log rank test further the difference in cumulative probability of detection of seroconversion between patients with covid-19 with and without pneumonia was investigated using the log rank test data were analyzed using spss for windows ibm spss statistics v26 all p values are two-sided and p005 was considered statistically significantall the 16 confirmed patients with covid-19 had at least two range 2-14 median 5 positive rrt-pcr results performed using either throat or lower respiratory specimens the mean age was 456 years standard deviation sd 155 years and was higher for male patients than for female patients mean  sd 540  114 vs 349  138 p  009 nine 563 of the 16 patients with covid-19 were men one patient had human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection and one patient had colon cancer all these patients developed clinical symptoms including lower respiratory tract symptoms 12 patients 750 upper airway symptoms 10 patients 625 body temperature 38c 8 patients 500 headache or myalgia 5 patients 313 and gastrointestinal symptoms 3 patients 188 ten 625 patients had increased pulmonary infiltrate or hazy patch pneumonia on their chest radiograph three patients required intensive care and one of them received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation supportserial plasma samples from one patient with covid-19 were simultaneously tested for anti-nucleocapsid antibody using wb method on days 1-5 7 9-11 14-18 and 21 after symptom onset21 the anti-nucleocapsid antibody was persistently detected from day 10 onwards by wb method the serum samples obtained after 8 14 30 33 35 days of symptom onset from the same patient were evaluated using the four poc rapid tests the antibody response was found to be negative in sample obtained on day 8 but positive in samples obtained on day 14 and beyond using all the four rapid tests which was consistent with the results obtained by wb method21

22 in this study the overall diagnostic sensitivity ranged from 697 to 758 and specificity was consistently 100 for the four poc antibody rapid tests the performance was lower than observed in previous two studies however the time point of serum sample collection is crucial for the evaluation of the diagnostic performance of these poc rapid tests targeting host immune responsive antibodies studies have shown an increase in serum antibody levels against nucleocapsid protein np or surface spike protein receptor binding domain rbd in samples from patients with covid-19 obtained after 10-17 days of symptom onset and analyzed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa or magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay mclia22 23 24 25 26 in the current study the diagnostic sensitivity was high and increased to more than 87 between 15-21 days after symptom onset and reached to 100 after 3 weeks of symptom onset for all four poc antibody rapid tests our study has provided further supportive evidence with a detail chronological analysis and has validated this observation to poc antibody rapid tests based on lfia combining the results of our and previous studies diagnosis of covid-19 infection with serological responsive antibodies is most valuable after 2 weeks of symptom onset furthermore a poc rapid test detecting igm separately from igg antibodies against sars-cov-2 did not add an early and overall diagnostic value compared a poc rapid test detecting total or mixed igg and igm antibodies a similar result was also observed in studies by to et al and long et al which showed an earlier onset and higher overall seroconversion rate of anti-np igg than anti-np igm antibody among patients with covid-1923

26
it was observed that anti-sars-cov-2-np or anti-sars-cov-2-rbd igg levels correlated with virus neutralization titer the viral load also seemed to be related inversely to serum antibody response23

24 therefore presence of virus-specific antibodies is expected to be associated with rapid virus eradication and clinical improvement however prolonged viral shedding with a median duration of up to 14 days after seroconversion was observed in the current study we also found that the 10 patients with covid-19 and pneumonia exhibit earlier seroconversion than the six patients with covid-19 who did not develop pneumonia among the 10 patients with covid-19 and pneumonia three patients had evidence of clinical deterioration despite of the presence of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies in earlier studies by zhao et al and long et al it was found that a higher titer of ab was independently associated with clinical severity of covid-19 infection25

26 previous studies on sars which emerged in 2003 have also showed anti-spike igg antibody stimulated pulmonary pro-inflammatory response and injury in one animal model27 and a correlation between a high level upsurge of igg antibodies in response to sars-cov with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome in another clinical study28 as both sars and covid-19 are caused by novel coronaviruses which have similar genetic components and clinical manifestations it is plausible that both diseases possess the same pathogenic effect based on these observations we propose that the presence of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies does not necessarily indicate the rapid eradication of sars-cov-2 furthermore early anti-sars-cov-2 antibody response might be a surrogate serological indicator for patients with covid-19 with risk of subsequent pulmonary injury therefore the implications of a positive test for a patient in terms of being a correlate of protective immunity remain not clearly established at this timethis study has several limitations first this was a single-center study thus generalization of our findings requires further confirmation second inadequate case number might have failed to demonstrate the statistical difference in the diagnostic performance between different poc antibody rapid tests third nine serum samples collected before march 1 seven from the first and two from the second enrolled patient with covid-19 were stored at -20c for more than 9 days before testing them for antibody response20 two of the nine samples were negative for antibody response in all four poc rapid tests the two samples had been obtained after days 2 and 7 of symptom onset we could not exclude the possibility of false negative results for these two serum samples due to prolonged storage fourth laboratory tests for other concomitant respiratory tract viral pathogens especially other coronaviruses were inadequate in this retrospective study therefore we could not exclude the possibility of co-infection in our patients with covid-19 cross reactivity with non-sars-cov-2 coronaviruses by the four poc rapid antibody tests was not well investigated table 1
 fifth pneumonia diagnosis of the covid-19 patients was primarily based on chest roentgenogram in this study because plain chest roentgenogram is less sensitive than computed tomography scan in detecting parenchymal change of viral pneumonia we could not exclude the possibility of misclassification of a covid-19 pneumonia patient with subclinical pulmonary infiltration to non-pneumonia patient finally as a non-protocolized retrospective study serum samples tested in different post-symptom stages were not consistent therefore this study is subject to information bias in both clinical and laboratory data because of above limitations findings in the current study need to be further confirmed in a prospectively recruited adequately powered diagnostic accuracy studyin conclusion serological testing may be a useful diagnostic tool in addition to rrt-pcr for the diagnosis of patients with covid-19 in this study the detection sensitivity of poc rapid tests corresponded with the antibody dynamics and reached 100 after 3 weeks of symptom onset covid-19 patients complicated with pneumonia exhibited earlier seroconversion than those without pneumonia however the presence of anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies neither indicated the rapid eradication of the virus nor provided immune protection from disease deterioration our study findings provide supportive evidence for the appropriate application and interpretation of poc antibody tests in the diagnosis and management of patients with covid-19the authors declare no conflict of interestrespiratory tract infections are a leading cause of hospital admission morbidity and mortality 14 at presentation etiological agents of the respiratory tract infection cannot be identified solely based on clinical signs and symptoms therefore and awaiting microbiological confirmation empirical antibiotic and antiviral treatment is initiated based on severity score and the influenza season 5 since only a minority of the infections is being caused by bacteria this empiric antibiotic treatment approach is redundant and can lead to an increase in antibiotic resistance moreover empiric isolation precautions are installed to protect other patients and healthcare workers from a possible viral infection altogether there is a need for rapid identification or exclusion of a viral respiratory tract infection to reduce inappropriate unnecessary hospital hygienic interventions and focus shorten antibacterialantiviral treatmentcurrently the diagnosis of respiratory infections is usually based on a combination of molecular amplification methods and bacterial culture in our laboratory laboratory-developed real-time polymerase chain reaction pcr multiplex assays ldt are used that show excellent sensitivity and specificity however this approach is limited by the number of targets per multiplex reaction and the need for batch-wise testing the assays are performed once daily with a time to result of approximately 20

showed a concordance of  97 compared to ldt 7 hypothetically eplex rp panel testing represents a considerable reduction in time to diagnosis as compared to ldt which could have significant clinical benefits in this paper a pilot study is reported that analyzed the implications of using the eplex rp panel for the detection of respiratory infections compared to ldt regarding time to result isolation precautions and antibacterialantiviral therapythe primary endpoint of this study was the time to result of the eplex rp panel compared to ldtthe eplex rp panel was offered as a pilot to elevate the pressure on droplet isolation rooms thus isolation was discontinued based on the eplex rp panel results due to the pilot nature of this study antibacterial and antiviral treatment were not adjusted based on the eplex rp panel results therefore only the theoretical time reduction in treatment was calculated using the time to results of the eplex rp panel and ldt secondary outcome measures were the reduction of isolation days based on the eplex rp panel ahead of ldt results the theoretical reduction in hours in oseltamivir and atypical pneumonias treatment calculated with the time to results of ldt and the eplex rp panel and possible additional diagnosis found with the eplex rp panelldt viral testing and testing for mycoplasma pneumoniae chlamydia pneumoniae and chlamydia psittaci was performed the same day on all samples that arrived at the laboratory before 815 am samples arriving at the laboratory before 330 pm were tested for legionella pneumophila and bordetella parapertussis the following day these assays were performed daily from monday till friday and on request on weekend days the viral respiratory panel of ldt consists of adenovirus bocavirus coronavirus 229e coronavirus hku1 coronavirus nl63 coronavirus oc43 influenza a influenza b human metapneumovirus parainfluenza 14 differentiation with differently labeled probes respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus in addition testing for bacterial pathogens could be requested legionella species legionella pneumophila mycoplasma pneumoniae chlamydia pneumoniae chlamydia psittaci bordetella pertussis and bordetella parapertussisall sputa samples were 15 diluted in phosphate-buffered saline pbs and homogenized by bead-beating prior to extraction then 200 l of each respiratory sample was used to extract 100 l total nucleic acids using the total nucleic acid extraction kit on the magna pure lc system roche diagnostics nucleic acid amplification and detection by real-time pcr was performed on a bio-rad cfx96 thermocycler using primers probes and conditions as described previously 810 for the detection of mycoplasma pneumoniae chlamydia pneumoniae and chlamydia psittaci the b-cap assay biolegio nijmegen the netherlands developed for the bd-max system was used by testing 200 l of each respiratory sample according to the manufacturers instructions 11 ldt results were reported in the electronic patient record the time to result for the ldt was calculated as the time from receipt of the sample in the laboratory to the time results were available in the electronic patient recordspecimens for diagnosis using the ce-ivd cleared rp panel were accepted on weekdays between 815 am and 300 pm and tested during the day as soon as possible the eplex rp panel was not offered during the weekend while treatment was not adjusted based on the results the rp panel as used in the study was able to detect adenovirus bocavirus coronavirus 229e coronavirus hku1 coronavirus nl63 coronavirus oc43 influenza a h1 influenza a 2009 h1n1 influenza a h3 influenza b metapneumovirus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus parainfluenza 14 respiratory syncytial virus a and b rhinovirusenterovirus bordetella pertussis legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae as with ldt sputa samples were diluted in an 15 dilution using pbs according to the manufacturers instructions 200 l of the respiratory sample was pipetted in a buffer tube and after vortexing transferred to the eplex cartridge and subsequently to the eplex tower if the test gave an invalid result the run was repeated results were reported by telephone to the requesting physician since the results were not reported in the electronic patient record the time to result was calculated as the time from receipt of the sample to the time results were reported by telephonethe time to result was compared with the wilcoxon signed-rank test using ibm spss statistics version 23 software for windows a p-value  005 was considered statistically significantbetween january and march 2017 64 patients were included with symptoms of acute respiratory infection whose characteristics are summarized in table 1 a total of 68 samples were tested comprising 40 throat swabs 13 sputum samples 11 nasal lavages and four nasopharyngeal swabs thirty-four tested positive for a respiratory pathogen in one or both assays six samples failed in the eplex rp panel of which two gave a valid result upon retesting the other four were not retested two because of insufficient remaining sample volume the failed samples if not retested were excluded from further analysis leaving 64 samples of 61 patients for further analysis none of the samples failed in the ldt
of the 64 samples 31 tested positive for a total of 37 pathogens with ldt or the eplex rp panel table 2 using ldt 30 tested positive and 34 negative whereas this was 29 and 35 using the eplex rp panel as shown in table 3 a discordant result was found in five samples

in three patients different sample types were tested table 4 from the first a sputum and a throat swab were collected of which only the first tested ldt positive for influenza a the second tested rhinovirus positive in a nasal lavage with ldt only and negative in sputum of the third patient a sputum and a throat swab were tested of which only the sputum tested coronavirus 229e positive
for 62 of the 64 samples both the time of acceptance and the time of result was recorded the calculated time to result was significantly shorter approximately 24 h for the eplex rp panel than for ldt p  0001 table 5 a time to result of over 35 h was seen with ldt in 15 samples of which 13 had arrived on friday and were tested on monday in the two remaining samples there was a delay in requesting and authorization of the test subsequently in the eplex rp panel four samples had a time to result of more than 18 h two of these samples were already at the laboratory for several hours before the eplex rp panel testing was requested while the testing of two samples was requested after 300 pm and therefore performed the next day one due to failure of the initial sample
of the 61 patients included in the analysis 60 were admitted to the hospital at the time respiratory testing was requested fifty-one of these hospitalized patients were isolated while awaiting test results whereas nine patients were not admitted in isolation in these cases isolation was not installed mainly because of low clinical suspicion of a pathogen requiring isolation one of these nine patients needed isolation since the eplex rp panel tested positive for influenza a 3 days ahead of ldtthe tests showed that 19 out of 51 patients admitted in isolation had a respiratory pathogen requiring isolation of the remaining 32 patients one died before test results became available and for one patient the duration of isolation was unknown leaving 30 patients for further analysis in 14 of these isolation was discontinued based on the eplex rp panel results ahead of the ldt results this resulted in a total reduction of 21 isolation days with a median reduction of 2 days range 14 days per patient in eight of the remaining patients isolation was discontinued when the ldt results became available in the other eight patients of which three were children isolation was not withdrawn at the moment ldt results were reporteda total of 50 out of the 61 patients received antiviral or antibacterial treatment during hospitalization oseltamivir treatment was initiated in 19 patients awaiting test results of which five tested positive for influenza a in the 14 influenza eplex rp panel negative patients oseltamivir could have been stopped approximately one day earlier median of 2259 h range 5337203 based on the eplex rp results compared to ldt table 6 of the total of 11 patients who tested influenza positive the remaining six did not receive oseltamivir at the time of diagnosis in one patient oseltamivir treatment was started as soon as the eplex rp panel showed influenza a one day prior to the ldt results and one patient started when ldt was positive four patients did not receive any antiviral treatment of which two were already dismissed at the time of definite ldt diagnosis
awaiting test results 19 patients received antibiotic treatment for bacteria causing atypical pneumonias in none of these patients either the eplex rp panel or ldt eight were tested was positive for bordetella pertussis legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae in theory in these 19 patients a median duration of 2335 h range 0437528 antibiotic treatment for atypical pneumonia could have been saved if treatment was stopped when the eplex rp panel tested negativeof the 61 patients two tested positive by the eplex rp panel for a bacterial agent one bordetella pertussis and one mycoplasma pneumoniae in both patients testing for these pathogens was not requested by the clinician and as a consequence not included in the routine diagnostic ldt workflow the positive eplex rp panel results were confirmed by ldt with quantification cycle cq values of 256 and 346 for b pertussis and m pneumoniae respectively ldt for atypical bacterial pathogens mycoplasma pneumoniae chlamydia pneumoniae chlamydia psittaci was requested in only 16 patients legionella ldt was requested in only ten patientsas hypothesized diagnosis with the eplex rp assay significantly reduced the time to result median 2334 h as compared to batch-wise ldt consequently a total of 21 isolation days were saved and three days of influenza a exposure prevented unnecessary oseltamivir treatment could have been shortened at least 20 h in 14 patients and antibiotic treatment for atypical pneumonias by a median of 2335 h in 19 patients proper therapeutic and isolation measurements could be installed in two patients for bacterial pathogens based on eplex rp panel detection that were not considered by the treating physicians and therefore not analyzed by routine ldtto our knowledge this study is the first to report the use of the eplex rp panel in a clinical setting it demonstrated a significant time reduction reflecting previous clinical studies implementing rapid molecular testing 1215 and significantly reduced the number of isolation days furthermore confirmation of a single viral cause of infection in a cohort of patients enabled cohort nursing which increased the number of isolation rooms available to patients awaiting identification of their respiratory pathogen efficient use of isolation rooms is essential during the influenza season when the demand for these rooms is highthe rapid eplex rp panel results could have resulted in a reduction of oseltamivir usage which is in line with previous studies 14 results regarding reduction in antibiotic treatment for atypical pneumonias should be interpreted with care while they are according to the dutch guidelines only indicated for legionella pneumophila in high-risk populations and can also been stopped based on negative urine antigen testing the lack of routine testing for atypical respiratory bacterial pathogens mostly legionella pneumophila and the finding of additional respiratory pathogens initially not considered by the clinicians underline the importance of syndromic respiratory testingour study has a number of limitations first the clinical impact of our pilot study was hampered by its design since the eplex rp assay was readily offered to reduce the quest for isolation rooms during the coinciding influenza and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics early in 2017 its test results were not yet shown in the hospital information system but reported by phone creating a bias moreover the eplex rp panel result was reported as a provisional result awaiting routine ldt confirmation the delay in showing the test results in the electronic patient record might have withheld clinicians to discontinue isolation and therefore created an underestimation of the true clinical potential furthermore the findings of this study cannot be extrapolated readily since this was a single-center study during just a part of one winter season the benefits of rapid diagnostics might be more pronounced when assessing complete respiratory seasonsso far the eplex rp panel has been ce-ivd cleared for nasopharyngeal swabs only however especially samples from the lower respiratory tract such as sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage can be important to include in the ce-ivd clearance since our study shows that these samples might have a higher diagnostic yield however in both our previous and current study several different sample types were tested with good results 7 nevertheless the eplex rp panel had a failure rate of nearly 10 in two cases due to internal control failure while none of the ldt failed overall the eplex rp panel results showed excellent concordance with our ldt only three ldt positives all with cq values  30 could not be detected using the eplex rp panel this is in line with our previous findings reported by nijhuis et al 7 the eplex rp panel is based on syndromic testing and has a standard panel containing the most common respiratory pathogens that are requested by the physician however the eplex rp panel is not complete especially when caring for immunocompromised patients in that case additional ldt testing for legionella species cytomegalovirus herpesvirus toxoplasmosis and fungal pathogens would still be necessary compared to ldt eplex rp panel testing is more expensive regarding reagents and consumables but cheaper with respect to hands-on time in addition rapid diagnostics will result in a cost reduction in the clinical departments as demonstrated previously 16in conclusion diagnosis of respiratory infections with the eplex rp assay resulted in a significant reduction in the time to result compared to ldt which causes a reduction in isolation days and theoretically improved treatment regimens because of these advantages we assume that this rapid diagnostic molecular assay will be of added value for ongoing improvement in patient carein december 2019 an outbreak of an unexplained pneumonia originated from the city of wuhan hubei province china huang et al 2020 guan et al 2020 after the initial outbreak a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 was quickly identified as the etiological agent and the associated disease defined as covid-19 named as an acronym from co-rona vi-rus d-isease where 19 stands for the year the virus was firstly detected the exponential growth of affected individuals led the world health organization who declaring a global pandemic on the march 11 2020 huang et al 2020 with 3002303 confirmed cases and 208131 deaths worldwide as of the april 27 2020 with many more anticipated the utilization of direct molecular diagnostic testing based on sequencing of sars-cov-2 has been critical in identifying infected individuals however as lock down measures have begun to bite there has been a race to develop and approve tests with a different purpose to assess not current viral infection but rather immunity to severe sars-cov-2 to facilitate a return to work however antibody testing may also be relevant in our critical evaluation of the disease including i understanding the kinetics of the immune response to infection ii understanding the immune response relative to disease severity and timeline iii understanding whether cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses leads to cross-protection iv clarifying whether infection protects from future infection and how long will immunity last and v what are the correlates of protection that can guide public health measures in addition to these critical questions immediate clinical applications would include i diagnosis and triage of patients who seek medical attention in the later phases of the disease ii contact tracing iii stratifying workforces and patients if immunity shown to be lasting and iv sero-epidemiological studies to understand the extent of covid-19 spreadan understanding of the application and diagnostic performance of the different testing approaches for sars-cov-2 is essential in the fight against this pandemic in our own field these tests are believed by many to be one of the milestones for the recommencement of clinical activity the recent eshre wwweshreeuhomecovid19wg position statement highlighted the current lack of understanding in the field of in-vitro diagnostic assays and in particular serological testing and the asrm wwwasrmorgnews-and-publicationscovid-19 have called for healthcare providers to be aware of the limitations of these tests the purpose of this review was to provide an overview of current diagnostic approaches for sars-cov-2 and in particular highlight the issues with serological testing with the objective of providing a clear guide to clinicians on the assays currently availablecoronaviruses cov belong to the subfamily coronavirinae in the family of coronaviridae of the order nidovirales in this subfamily four genera are included alphacoronavirus betacoronavirus gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus the genome of the virus is a singlestranded positivesense rna ssrna 30 kb with 5cap structure and 3polya tail the genome and subgenomes of a typical coronavirus may present six open reading frames orfs or even more the first orfs orf1ab encompass approximately 66 of the whole genome and encode 16 nonstructural proteins nsp116 which are mainly involved in replication of covs other orfs encompassing onethird of the genome near the 3 terminus encode the main structural proteins spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins chen et al 2020athe different coronaviruses exhibit 54 identity of the whole rna with 58 identity on the nonstructural proteinscoding region and 43 identity on the structural proteincoding region sequence analysis shows that the new coronavirus incorporates the typical genome structure of cov and belongs to the cluster of betac-cov that includes bat sarslike slzc45 batsl zxc21 sarscov and merscov based on the phylogenetic tree of covs 2019ncov is more closely related to batslcov zc45 and batslcov zxc21 and more distantly related to sarscov chen et al 2020afour principal structural proteins are essential for virion assembly and its associated infective capacity homotrimers of s proteins make up the spikes on the viral surface and they are responsible for attachment to receptors on the host cells the m protein has three transmembrane domains and it shapes the virions promotes membrane curvature and covers the nucleocapsid the e protein participates in virus assembly and release and is involved in viral pathogenesis the n protein presents two domains both of which can bind virus rna genome via different mechanisms the n protein binds to nsp3 protein to help tether the genome to replicationtranscription complex and package the encapsidated genome into virions n protein is also an antagonist of interferon and viral encoded repressor of rna interference which may be beneficial for the viral replicationthe database held by the foundation for innovative new diagnostics which is the who collaborating centre for laboratory strengthening and diagnostic technology evaluation on the 22 may 2019 contained 560 sars-cov-2 laboratory tests for the diagnosis of covid-19 this comprises 273 molecular assays and 287 immunoassays excluding those intended for research use only 152 of these are molecular assays and 211 immunoassays are ce-ivd marked there are principally two types of tests available for covid19 viral tests and antibody tests the viral tests are direct tests as they are designed to detect the virus and therefore reflect current infection in contrast the antibody tests are indirect tests as they do not detect the virus but rather ascertain established seroconversion to previous infection or early seroconversion to ongoing infectionthe recommended test for sars-cov-2 infection diagnosis is by detecting the viral rna with nucleic acid amplification tests naat such as rt-pcr wwwecdceuropaeu in areas with widespread community transmission of sars-cov-2 and when laboratory resources are limited detection by rt-pcr of a single discriminatory target is considered sufficient there are however still specific technical considerations for laboratory testing including specimen collection variable collection methods which samples to collect upper or lower respiratory tract biospecimens or other samples time of collection in relation to course of disease and the availability of different laboratory test methods and kits not all of which may be standardized or approved by authorities such as the food and drug administration then there are the infrastructure considerations are the approved laboratory facilities and trained manpower available can the methodology be rapidly scaled up and how are test results interpreted and false negatives excludedthese issues have been faced by the whole scientific community with a collective response to develop guidance the currently used protocol was developed and optimized for the detection of the novel coronavirus at the charit university hospital in collaboration with several other laboratories in germany the netherlands china france uk and belgium corman et al 2020 additionally the existing protocol was further optimized by the center for disease control cdc in the united states through the comprehensive comparison and validation of alternative available kits for nucleic acid extraction and the use of alternative probe and primer sets for efficient sars-cov-2 detection in clinical samples wwwcdcgovcoronavirus with similar approaches undertaken by other national authorities as they continue to scale up provision for laboratories not using ce marked assays wwwenglandnhsukcoronavirus the importance and variability of specimen collection was initially highlighted on comparison of the positive rates of pharyngeal nasal blood sputum feces urine brochoalveolar lavage fluid and fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy of patients with confirmed covid-19 zou et al 2019 at present the cdc recommend collecting and testing an upper respiratory specimen with a nasopharyngeal specimen the preferred choice for swab-based sars-cov-2 testing when collection of a nasopharyngeal swab is not possible the following are acceptable alternatives an oropharyngeal specimen a nasal mid-turbinate using a flocked tapered swab an anterior nares nasal swab specimen using a flocked or spun polyester swab or a nasopharyngeal washaspirate or nasal aspirate specimen for those having invasive procedures lower respiratory tract specimens are also recommended if available although detected in other specimens like blood and stools these were generally less reliable than from respiratory specimensat present it is recommended that specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a decision has been made to pursue sars-cov-2 testing regardless of the time of symptom onset the viral load in throat swabs is greatest at the time of viral onset and decrease monotonically thereafter zou et al 2019 to et al 2020 analysis of these temporal dynamics suggests that viral shedding may begin 2 to 3 days before the appearance of the first symptoms facilitating pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission he et al 2020 covs have a number of molecular targets within their positive-sense single-stranded rna genome that can be used for rt-pcr assays the who have provided primers for the genes which encode the structural proteins of the viral envelope e and the nucleocapsid n and for the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp which is a key part of the viruss replication machinery that makes copies of its rna genome corman et al 2020 however there has been no demonstration that any one of these three e n or rdrp sequences may offer an advantage for clinical diagnostic testing with different targets being preferred by different authorities for example the public health england assay employs two probes against rdrp with one being a pan sarbeco-probe which will detect 2019-ncov sars-cov and batsars-related covs while the second probe is specific to 2019-ncov continued refinement of these naat assays is ongoing to facilitate their upscaling while maintaining laboratory safety a low-cost and high-sensitivity won et al 2020great efforts have been carried out in order to develop tests for rapid detection of sars-cov-2 antigens antigen detection tests are designed to directly detect viral particles in biological samples like nasopharyngeal secretions several rapid antigen tests have been proposed diao et al 2020 however the principal concern is the false negative rate due to either a low or variable viral load and the variability in sampling with the latter having the potential to further compound cases with low viral titres thereby increasing the false negative rate tang et al 2020
diao and colleagues 2020 have reported the preliminary results from the utilization of a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of sars-cov-2 in both nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine from 239 participants with comparison to natt testing where the intersection of the amplification curve and diagnostic threshold line ct value was set at either 30 or 40 diao et al 2020 with a higher viral load in the sample the prespecified ct value may be lower as fewer replication cycles are required to achieve a detectable signal however with a low viral load a greater number of replication cycles higher ct value will be required for a detectable signal to be attained for this assay with a prevalence of 87 although the positive predictive value was 100 the negative predictive value was 32 for a ct 40 increasing to 97 for patients with a higher viral load as demonstrated by a ct30 this would suggest that at present this assay would only be useful in excluding those with high viral loads whether alternative approaches as previously suggested for influenza viruses in children including the utilization of colloidal gold-labeled iggs as the detection reagent li et al 2020 to increase the sensitivity of rapid antigen tests for respiratory viruses is feasible is still under consideration with monoclonal antibodies specifically against sars-cov-2 under development further validation of these technique and similar approaches in larger populations including asymptomatic cases is warranted consideration of approaches to try to concentrate antigen and amplify the detection phase are however likely to be needed for these methods to have any clinical utility loeffelholz et al 2020at present april 25 2020 the non-governmental organization find httpswwwfinddxorg have listed four ce-marked rapid sars-cov-2 antigen detection tests which are primarily lateral flow immunochromatographic assays based on the presence of a colloid gold conjugate pad and a membrane strip pre-coated with antibodies specific to sars-cov-2 antigens on a test line if sars-cov-2 antigens are present in the specimen withdrawn from a nasopharyngeal swab a visible band appears on the test line as antibody-antigen-antibody gold conjugate complex forms the evaluation of these diagnostic tests has however been limited and their ce-mark means that they manufacturers state that they conform with the relevant eu legislation but they may still not be available to purchase according to ivd directive 9879ec to affix the ce-mark to covid-19 diagnostic devices to be used by health professionals the manufacturer has to specify device performance characteristics and self-declare conformity with the safety and performance requirements listed in the directive in contrast self-tests intended to be used by patients themselves must also be assessed by a third party body a notified body which for these tests has yet to happenalthough direct antigen tests are being registered by several health authorities the sensitivity of these tests is lower than rt-pcr with previous antigen detecting elsias developed for sarscov having limits of detection of 50pgml che et al 2004 di et al 2005 furthermore clarification of their specificity for sars-cov-2 is awaited given the potential for cross-reaction with other human coronaviruses despite these limitations the chief advantages of antigen tests including their rapidity 10-30 mins compared to hours for naat testing ease of interpretation and the limited technical skill and infrastructure required as compared to the naat based testing continue to make them worth pursuing however experience with influenza antigen testing invites caution as these tests may have low sensitivity and specificity moreover as noted the false negatives rate will be critical tang et al 2020 their greatest utility if they come to fruition may be in symptomatic patients when the viral load will be at its greatest to enable accurate triageappropriate thresholds for sensitivity and specificity of an antibody test depend on its purpose and must be considered prior to implementation for diagnosis in symptomatic patients high sensitivity is required generally  90 in this context a slight reduction in specificity may be acceptable as some false positives may be tolerated provided other potential diagnoses are considered and acceptance that over-diagnosis may result in unnecessary interventions which for sars-cov-2 may include quarantining however if antibody tests were deployed as an individual-level approach to inform release from social isolation and return to normal activities then high specificity is essential as false-positive results return non-immune individuals to risk of exposure it is with these purposes in mind that the uk medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency set a minimum 98 specificity threshold for lateral flow immunoassays lfias this is particularly challenging particularly given the scale of validation study required for a suitable candidate lfia as to demonstrate a high specificity if the true underlying value was 98 1000 negative controls would be required to estimate the specificity of an assay to -1 with approximately 90 poweras part of the evaluation of test performance the influence of population prevalence also needs to be considered acknowledging that at present this is rapidly changing brenner and gefeller 1997 this can be considered as the proportion of all positive tests that are wrong as well as the number of incorrect positive tests per 1000 people tested for example a point of care test with 70 sensitivity and 98 specificity the proportion of positive tests that are wrong is 35 at 5 population seroprevalence 19 false-positives1000 tested 13 at 20 seroprevalence 16 false-positives1000 and 3 at 50 seroprevalence 10 false-positives1000according to available data seropositivity prevalence is still low the prevalence of antibodies to sars-cov-2 among a high risk category such as healthcare personnel is 59 in utah masden et al 2020  54 in lyon france solodky et al 2020 173 in trieste comar et al 2020 525 in padua tosato et al 2020 15 in bari italy paradiso et al 2020 16 in germany korth et al 2020 and 26 in barcelona spain tuaillon et al 2020 in the general population it has been reported as being 013 in rio grand do sul brasil silveira et al 2020 15 in santa clara california benavid et al 2020 179  in idaho bryan et al 2020 and 71 in atlanta usa zou et al 2020 12 in edinburgh scotland thompson et al 2020 3 in paris france grzelak et al 2020 17 in denmark erikstrup et al 2020 and 33 in kobe japan doi et al 2020 96 in whuan china wu et al 2020 and 21 in guilan iran shakiba et al 2020 large scale seroprevalence studies are ongoing but understanding the background rates are essential for accurate interpretation of diagnostic teststhe potential risk of a test providing false reassurance and release from being sheltered for non-immune individuals can therefore widely based on the underlying seroprevalence and this still assumes antibody-positivity as a correlate of protective immunity which may be incorrectunderstanding viral and host interactions during acute and convalescent phases are critical to be able to understand both the timing of initial seroconversion after exposure to sars-cov-2 and the subsequent duration of antibodies however at present the studies regarding seroconversion are being developed in parallel to the assays limiting some conclusions the data does suggest that seroconversion after exposure to sars-cov-2 is very similar to other acute viral infections with igg concentration beginning to rise as igm levels reach a plateau figure 1
 however observations that igm and iga growth is relatively slow related to other respiratory viruses have been suggested to contribute to the heterogeneous pathogenicity of sars-cov-2 in covid-19 patients zhao et al 2019the most comprehensive study to date of seroconversion assessed 173 patients affected by covid-19 utilizing an assay developed to detect antibodies against the receptor binding domain rbd of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 zhao et al 2019 the median seroconversion time of total ab igm and igg antibodies was 11 12 and 14 days respectively zhao et al 2019 the respective seroconversion rates for total ab igm and igg were 931 827 and 647 zhao et al 2019 with the cumulative seroconversion curve suggesting that the rate for total ab and igm reached 100 30 days after the onset these studies have also highlighted the temporal nature of testing as despite all patients being subsequently confirmed as covid-19 positive in the early phase of illness within 7-day since onset the natt test only exhibited 667 sensitivity with the antibody assays even lower with a positive rate of 383 zhao et al 2020 however the sensitivity of ab overtook that of rna test since day 8 after symptom onset and reached over 90 across day 12 after onset among samples from patients in later phase day 15-39 since onset the sensitivities of total ab igm and igg were 1000 943 and 798 respectively in contrast rna was only detectable in 455 of samples of day 15-39 in a separate small series of nine cases seroconversion was occurred after 7 days in 50 of patients 14 days in all but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load wolfel et al 2020 analysis of 285 patients would further support igg seroconversion within 19 days after symptom onset long et al 2020 collectively this data suggests that there is a role for both tests depending on where the patient is on their infection journey with the combined use of natt and ab tests markedly improving the sensitivity of a pathogenic-diagnosis for covid-19 patients in different phaseswith respect to antibody titres and disease severity critically ill hospitalized patients have been reported to exhibit significantly higher ab title values than non-critical cases in some studies zhao et al 2019 long et al 2020 but not all studies in previous epidemics sars-cov and the mers-cov antibody titres were positively associated with disease severity okba et al 2019 choe et al 2017 in a limited case series n57 confirmed sars-cov-2 cases six patients with detectable viral rna in the blood were at increased risk of severe disease progression as compared to those with low titres but unfortunately the authors did not measure antibody titres chen et al 2020b clarification of whether even in previously healthy individuals a high viral titre and  or high antibody titer can predict disease severity and likely progression is awaitedour extensive search identified 25 peer-reviewed articles and 26 pre-print studies reporting on the sensitivity and specificity of immunoassays for covid-19 with a sample size ranging from 16 to 6001 subjects table 1 most studies were conducted in china with only a few coming from western countries the overall sensitivity ranged from 0 to 100 and the specificity from 78 to 100 with performance highly time sensitive reflecting the dynamics of seroconversion in general most assays performed better shortly after initial symptom resolution accepting the very limited time frames evaluated for all studies to date in an evaluation of nine commercially available sars-cov-2 immunoassays the sensitivities varied the duration of disease early phase 7 to 13 days after the onset of disease symptoms sensitivities ranged from 40 to 86 middle phase 14 to 20 days after the onset of disease symptoms sensitivities ranged from 67 to 100 and late phase 21 days after the onset of disease symptoms sensitivities ranged from 78 to 89 lassauniere et al 2020the range of assays being released is extensive with apparently very limited validation gonzalez and colleagues reviewed four web databases for sars-cov-2 immunoassay for and by the april 4 2020 there was already 226 immunoassays from 20 different countries the technical data sheet was available online in only 22 of tests and despite 23 claiming regulatory certification only four had pubmed listed papers gonzalez et al 2020 despite wide claims on sensitivity and specificity practically at present it is almost impossible to conclude which antibody test would be the one to use a pragmatic choice would be to use an automated immunoassay that is scaleable from a well-known established manufacturer with a complete and clear technical data sheet which has received regulatory certification issued by the health authority and been validated independentlyin accordance with this the most recent novel assays utilize fully automated chemiluminescence immunoassays clias implemented on high throughput laboratory instrumentation these systems include the maglumi 2000 plus 2019-ncov igm and igg assays snibe shenzhen china which has been independently validated in accordance with the clinical and laboratory standards instituteep15-a3 guideline padoan et al 2020 and the ce-marked euroimmun anti-sars-cov-2 iga and igg assays with others including beckman coulter for their access platform and roche diagnostics for their elecsys platform under development the euroimmun assay however in independent validation exhibited some cross reactivity in both elisas with serum samples from the two seasonal coronavirus patients hcov-oc43 that had previously cross-reacted with the mers-cov s1 igg elisa okba et al 2019 on comparison of their respective performances on 131 known cases there was only concordance for the igg assays of 88 kappa statistics 047 95 ci 026068 despite being different immunoglobulin classes an analogous analysis between maglumi 2019-ncov igm positivenegative vs euroimmun anti-sars-cov-2 iga positivenegative results yielded an overall concordance of 90 kappa statistics 039 95 ci 014065 the igg assays also exhibited different concordance during the early phases of symptom onset with concordance improved 10-21 days after symptom onset further studies with longer timelines and known cases with a range of symptoms will help confirm alignment of these assays inevitably we anticipate an enormous number of studies comparing the available assays with the advantages and disadvantages of the respective assays discussed at lengthpoint of care poc immunoassays have also been developed for the rapid detection of sars-cov-2 antibodies igg and igm the primary advantage of these tests like an at home pregnancy test is to obtain a diagnosis without sending samples to centralized laboratories thereby enabling communities without the necessary laboratory infrastructure to detect sars-cov-2 exposed subjects use only finger prick testing rather than formal blood draws thereby reducing training requirements and enable clinicians to have a validated test at the bedside as these devices are cheap to manufacture store and distribute provided that a positive antibody test was confirmed to be an accurate surrogate for immunity to infection they would also be able inform decision making this would be particularly the case as secure confirmation of antibody status would reduce anxiety provide confidence to allow individuals to relax social distancing measures and guide policy-makers in the staged release of population lock-down potentially in tandem with digital approaches to contact tracingthe rapid point-of-care immunoassays are generally lateral flow immunoassays lfia li et al 2020 in lateral flow assays a membrane strip is coated with two lines gold nanoparticle-antibody conjugates are in one line and bind antibodies in the other the blood sample from the patient is put on the membrane and the proteins draw through the membrane strip by capillarity as it passes the first line the antigen binds to the gold nanoparticle-antibody conjugate and the complex flows together across the membrane generally the rapid assays have a low diagnostic performance when compared to elisa assays and this is explained not only by the well-known technical differences between the two methodologies but also because of possible low antibody concentrations that may further contribute to the false negatives observed with the rapid testsat present 11 peer-reviewed articles and 8 pre-print studies have reported on the diagnostic performance of the rapid assays these are summarised in table 1 in the published studies sensitivity and specificity ranged from 9 to 886 and from 889 to 917 respectively table 1 while in the pre-print articles sensitivity and specificity ranged from 30 to 988 and from 89 to 100 respectively of note the sensitivity of these tests performed in non-chinese countries were substantially lower than those reported for studies conducted in china extensive evaluation of manufacturers claims on the performance of these tests and optimal timing will be required before they are suitable for widespread routine clinical use for example the performance of vivadiag covid-19 igmigg rapid test was evaluated in 30 cases 7 days corman et al 2020 tang et al 2020 after confirmed natt testing and despite this 5 167 were negative for both igg and igm cassaniti et al 2020 furthermore in evaluation of 50 acute patients presenting in the emergency room the sensitivity of the vivadiag covid19 igmigg rapid test was 184 specificity was 917 while npv was 262 and ppv was 875 cassaniti et al 2020 the same vivadiag test was evaluated in 525 health care workers in italy with only six testing positive none were positive by natt testing or symptomatic and only three had a confirmed positive result on the maglumi chemiluminescence igg assay paradiso et al 2020b evaluation of six poc tests in a mix of 110 cases of covid-19 other coronavirus other viruses and negative controls revealed sensitivities ranging from 80 to 93 and negative predictive values of 74 to 92 lassauniere et al 2020 in keeping with other studies the diagnostic performance of these tests reflected the duration of the illness with the worst performance observed in the first two weeks after symptom onset lassauniere et al 2020 lastly formal evaluation of nine commercially available lfias in a case control mix of 182 samples revealed sensitives of 55 to 70 national covid testing scientific advisory panel 2020for all studies to date sample size has been limited with further testing across a large diverse population from a range of geographical locations and ethnic groups required with inclusion of children and individuals with autoimmune disease and immunosuppression with extensive evaluation it is likely that technical performance may deteriorate at present evaluation of the current lfia devices suggest that although they may provide some information for population-level surveys their performance is inadequate for most individual patient applicationsthe interpretation of a test for sars-cov-2 will depend on a combination of the accuracy of the test and the estimated risk of covid19 prior to performing the test watson et al bmj 2020 a positive direct antigen test and specifically the nucleic acid amplification tests are strongly suggestive of current infection due to its high specificity but moderate sensitivity and the patient can be reassured that you are confident that they have covid19 and should managed in accordance with local policies regarding positive cases in contrast negative tests need to be interpreted with caution and a single negative sars-cov-2 test in a patient with strongly suggestive symptoms should not be relied upon to exclude covid19 in this situation it would still be safer for the patient to be treated as a positive and local policies regarding retesting and isolation be followed for the serological tests the clinical implication of seroconversion with respect to future immunity continue to be elucidated but similar principles for evaluating the test result in the clinical context and history of previous infection or exposure is critical particularly as a false positive could lead to false reassurance and inappropriate behaviour that may enhance community disease transmissionat present natt based methodologies remain the cornerstone of in-vitro diagnostic assays for sars-cov-2 there is an urgent need for development of serological assays with high sensitivity for screening and adequate specificity to avoid unnecessary interventions and confirmation that seropositivity equates to immunity at present none of the point of care diagnostics for sars-cov-2 appear suitable for wide-scale deployment and large prospective studies are urgently needed to clarify their utility evaluation of the performance of the potentially scaleable high-throughput immunoassays is ongoing however extensive validation across different populations will be required before they can be routinely used to inform critical decision making for clinicians the public health community and policy-makers

 although covid-19 is generally thought to be milder compared to sars and mers-cov the full extent of the impact from covid-19 remains pending however this outbreak represents an opportunity for multiple governmental and health sector stakeholders to partner and develop rapid diagnostic tests for infectious agents of global health concern 5pcr produces numerous copies amplification of a gene or series of genetic sequences by using a primer sequence and dna polymerase enzymes to exponentially increase the amount of dna required pcr is widely used to amplify minute quantities of dna to enable adequate requisite amounts for laboratory analysis of diagnosis owing to its simplicity high sensitivity and high sequence specificity pcr-based method are a routine and reliable method for detecting coronavirus infection in patients 3 11 12 in principle such assays are employed following conversion of coronavirus rna into complementary dna by reverse transcription following which pcr is performed and resultant amplification of dna subject to specific detection or analytical methods such as electrophoresis or sequencing 3 13 14rt-pcr is significantly more sensitive than conventional methods 15 16 and is routinely employed as the predominant method to detection most coronaviruses 17 18 including covid-19 19 a concern however particularly in the current demanding times is that such analysis requires various specialist and expensive items of equipment alongside highly trained analysts furthermore current pcr-based methods of analysis require realistically speaking particularly when dealing with increasing volumes of potential infected upwards of 4-8 hours to process these requirements with the addition of financial pressures dictating that samples to be tested be sent potentially hundreds of miles away where requisite facilities and resources are present to perform such diagnostic analysis may result in further inflation of the required time and finances to perform such diagnostic testsloop mediated isothermal amplification lamp is a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method lamp exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity due to an exponential amplification feature that utilises 6 different target sequences simultaneously identified by separate distinct primers in the same reaction 20 lamp assays are significantly rapid and do not require expensive reagents or instruments which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection 3current improved lamp assays employ a total of six primers recognising eight distinct sites of the target sequence a strand-displacing dna polymerase is employed to initiate synthesis while two primers form loop structures to facilitate and accelerate subsequent rounds of amplification specifically lamp employs two inner primers fip and bip which in turn consist of two parts each and two outer primers f3 and b3 which can recognize a total of six distinct regions within the target dna two loop primers are employed forward loop primer lf and backward loop primer lb to accelerate amplification and detection efficiency 21 22 23first fip anneals to the template and extension occurs using a polymerase with displacement activity such as bst polymerase which will displace the product obtained from fip by the extension reaction associated with the f3 primer subsequently an extension reaction occurs using bip on the product of fip and not on the template dna due to displacement by dna synthesis associated with the b3 primer these reactions result in a product with a dumbbell-like structure which is essential for lamp to establish isothermal amplification as the loop structures are always single stranded and can be annealed by fip or bip this loop structure formation eliminates the denaturing step which is otherwise essential in pcr for obtaining single-stranded dna and also establishes a cyclic reaction between the dumbbell-like structure and its complementary product leading to elongated products with various copies of the target sequence produced for reviews and detailed schematics refer to 22 23numerous studies have now shown the successful application of lamp assays in various forms to detect coronavirus rna in patients samples 24 25 26 27 demonstrating that 1-10 copies of viral rna template per reaction was sufficient for successful detection which were 100-fold more sensitive than conventional rt-pcr methods 26 27 28 29 30 31 of course however as with any emerging technology there are some disadvantages associated with lamp assays such methodology prevents inclusion of an internal pcr inhibition control necessitating duplication of reactions while testing another disadvantage is the perceived complexity of the methodology requiring a complex primer design system which can constrain target site selection and resolution or specificity furthermore as the final product is a large fragment downstream applications such as cloning are limitedhowever despite such drawbacks lamp is an ultrasensitive nucleic acid amplification method that can detect minute quantities of dna or rna templates within roughly an hour far outstripping normally utilised rt-pcr methods particularly with the current demands for rapid and sensitive testing as the growing number of suspected covid-19 cases exceeds the capacity of many hospitals many patients remain untested impeding efforts to the control the disease a rapid point-ofcare diagnostic for the covid-19 is urgently needed which we propose to be the lamp method of detection table 1
considering the success obtained by zhang et al 34 using relatively less-sensitive lamp the enhanced sensitivity of the penn-ramp strategy employed by el-tholoth et al 32 attributable to a modified two-step lamp protocol could prove significantly successful as a diagnostic penn-ramp involves a preliminary reaction with outer lamp primers to amplify all targets through recombinase polymerase amplification rpa in which all targets are amplified concurrently after this a second highly specific lamp reaction is initiated specifically the first stage uses outer lamp primers f3 and b3 while the second stage further combines the other 4 ramp primers this nested principle significantly enhanced lamp sensitivity by 10-100-fold compared to normal lamp particularly when operating with purified and crude samples 35 indeed the penn-ramp methodology when applied on mock trials by el-tholoth et al 32 provided a success rate of 100 at 7-10 copies of viral rna per reaction compared to a 100 success rate at 700 viral rna copies required for pcr methods 32 35 to this degree we hypothesise that the modified lamp assay proposed by el-tholoth et al 32 perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of covid-19 figure 3
 using the primer sequence strategies utilised table 2
we hypothesise that this assay is will be a rapid cost-effective and simple method that could be applied within the field at short-notice and utilised by users with even limited training all the equipment that would be required would be a hot-block or heater capable of differential heating reagent-wise the costs would be similar to that of real time rt-pcr but the real advantage of this would be the rapidity of this assay yielding results within an hour of testing compared to 4-8 hours taken with rt-pcr methods the aim is not necessarily a quantitative measure of infection but rather a simple positivenegative assay for rapid detectionconfirmation we consider that this strategy should be applied rapidly and confirmed for viability with clinical samples before being rolled out for mass-diagnostic testing in these current times
36a week after alerting the who of a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology in wuhan the chinese authorities announced on 7 january 2020 that a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of these pneumonia according to phylogenetic analysis this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 previously named 2019-ncov belongs to the b lineage of betacoronavirus genus and the sarbecovirus subgenus and has more than 85 nucleotide sequence identity with a bat sars-like cov genome published previously 12 initially described in china the coronavirus disease covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 rapidly gained ground and evidence of human-to-human transmission rose on january 30 who declared covid-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and the disease has now spread worldwide highly sensitive and specific tests are crucial to identify and manage covid-19 patients and implement control measures to limit the outbreak real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-qpcr in respiratory samples is the current recommended laboratory method to diagnose sars-cov-2 acute infection 34 however performing rt-qpcr requires special equipment

qualitative detection of sars-cov-2 antigen in nasopharyngeal secretions this test based on a membrane technology with colloidal gold nanoparticules uses monoclonal antibodies to detect highly conserved sars-cov and sars-cov-2 nucleoprotein antigen another monoclonal antibody is conjugate to colloidal gold nanoparticules these antibodies are immobilized onto the nitrocellulose membrane the test was performed according to manufacturers instruction by mixing 100 l of nasopharyngeal secretions with 4 drops approximately 100 l of ly-s dilution buffer in a tube and the strip was added when the nasopharyngeal secretions come into contact with the strip passive diffusion allows the solubilized conjugate to migrate with the sample and react with the anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies immobilized

5

6 these systems have pioneered the ability to involve individual volunteers in public health through a participatory process influenza and acute respiratory illness-related symptoms are collected from community members who voluntarily report their health status on a weekly basis via web and mobile apps data from these systems have demonstrated the potential to better understand acute respiratory illness in the population by detecting trends early and at the point of contact piecing together real-time patterns of disease spread identifying important subpopulations monitoring the course of an epidemic or pandemic and helping to target prevention and control efforts however none of these internet-based systems employ molecular diagnostics to rapidly confirm the viral cause of illness which is important because the clinical presentation of influenza is similar to illness caused by other respiratory pathogens7new detection technologies are rapidly emerging for home-based and point of care diagnosis they harness real-time polymerase chain reaction as well as newer techniques for high sensitivity and specificity molecular detection8

9 in all of these technologies there are common threads needing investigation with respect to the types of specimens both in regards to feasibility of viral detection as well as the willingness and capability of individuals to generate the sample on their own specimens for molecular detection of acute respiratory infections generally consist of nasopharyngeal wash and aspirate as the gold standard however there are safety concerns for lay volunteers to collect this type of specimen at home10 nasal swabs have been successfully used by volunteers to collect viable samples for influenza culture at home at first for individuals whom were classified by nurses to have colds and flu 11

27 further nasal self sampling has been used as part of population-based surveillance of respiratory virus infections and compared to contemporaneous clinical surveillance specimens and general practitioner sampling in some european cohorts 26

28 to date none of these systems have considered other specimen types or reported how individuals symptoms were linked to detected infectionwhile nasal swabs are easy to use the non-invasive nature of oral specimen collection makes it an easier and more convenient and thus preferable alternative to nasal swabs15

16 oral specimens have been widely used to obtain genetic material for direct-to-consumer medical tests14 as well although the literature is sparse oral specimens have been shown to be reliable in the detection of certain respiratory pathogens saliva were found to be accurate and reliable in the detection of h1n1 and comparable to the nasopharyngeal swab18 oral specimens have also been found to be effective in the detection of sars measles and beta-hemolytic streptococcus in pediatric patients12

13

15

16

17 others have found oral specimens to be inferior to nasal swabs in the detection of respiratory viruses but still suitable in settings where obtaining a nasal swab would be impractical21 beyond specimen type community participation in analysis and specimen collection for flu surveillance is also unexplored academic and commercial entities have demonstrated19

20

21 that home sample collection is feasible from the community and at scale for genomic microbiome and std testing23

24 however the utility and format of what information should be communicated back to individuals in order to be useful to impact public health behaviors is a related and open questionin sum while there have been some efforts to use nasal swabs for self-collection of specimens and surveillance of acute respiratory infection at scale the work reported here adds to these existing efforts by considering important questions of utility of different specimen types linking of individual participatory symptom reports to specimen types and how the resulting surveillance information can be used at an individual level to address these needs we developed the goviral platform this platform is designed to acquire community generated diagnostic samples and couple them with other contemporaneous information such as participatory syndromic reports thus goviral enables us to test 1 the types of samples that individuals are able to and willing to generate in their own homes in a timely fashion when they have an acute respiratory infection along with and appropriate processing methods 2 how user-generated diagnostic information corresponds to self-reported symptoms and 3 reception and use of the information by the public herein we report results from an initial deployment during the 2013-2014 influenza season
participant recruitment and sign up
a cohort of lay volunteers was recruited in massachusetts recruitment was open throughout the study period november 1 2013 to april 30 2014 we used a convenience sample in order to rapidly recruit participants and evaluate the platform during this first season thus anticipating participants to be skewed towards those who have access to internet permitting investigation via a more representative sampling during subsequent years enrollment was driven largely by announcements on local radio stations and word of mouth paid online advertisements and social media were also used as means of recruiting volunteers to the study the study size was limited by our ability to recruit and engage participants in order to register volunteers signed an electronic consent form and reported their email address name and mailing address gender and age volunteers were immediately sent a kit see section below to keep at home users were instructed that if they became sick with symptoms of a cold or flu they should perform the specimen collection and rapid test within 48 hours of experiencing symptoms participants who returned a kit were sent a replacement allowing them to report a second illness second illness was included if the specimen was provided at least 2 weeks after the initial specimen goviral participants were also registered for flu near you and reported symptoms through weekly surveys as has been previously described6 if a participant reported any symptoms on their weekly survey they immediately were sent an email reminder to follow the instructions in the kit and submit specimens instructions for submission of the kit were made available on a report page on the report page an individual confirms the symptoms that they have can view video instructions supplementary information for each of the sample types and rapid test and they record the date illness began the numbering on their sample tubes and test results from the rapid test all participants who signed up with a massachusetts mailing address were sent a kit and their symptom reports were included in the study

specimen collection
participants were instructed to collect a nasal sample by inserting the flocked nasal swab approximately 25 cm into one nostril and rotating the swab was then placed in transport media for testing 2 ml of saliva in transport media was collected a second nasal swab mixed with reagent was collected and then the reagent was used as per instructions for the rapid test 27 from the written goviral kit instructions participants were directed to the goviral website to submit symptom information kit number and photo of rapid test results customized youtube instructional videos httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgwrmbvfjrsg httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjaq-of8-cya httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvs1oe4dldiw8 showed participants how to collect the oral and nasal specimens and package them for mailing samples were sent by overnight mail to the laboratory for detection
specimen preparation and analysis
specimens received were excluded both the pair of nasal and saliva specimens if they were received and had leaked due to poor packaging or appeared to not have any saliva added we tested samples on both the genmark respiratory viral panel and biofire filmarray respiratory panel both offer a multiplex panel for respiratory pathogens they however differ in the dnarna extraction methods used in the measured sensitivity and specificity for nasopharyngeal specimens and workflow parameters such as hands-on time time to result and relative ease of use previous studies have compared these molecular multiplex platforms including laboratory developed molecular methods pcr25 while all of these studies were using nasopharyngeal np swab specimens because of the different nucleic extraction methods in each platform and potential differences in viral load and location in saliva versus nasal specimens their performance on these sample types is still indeterminate

specimens were processed following the procedure found in the filmarray respiratory panel instruction booklet the filmarray rp contains its own extraction procedure and internal controls within each pouch in the filmarray dnarna is extracted from the sample through physical agitation and chemical disruption of the cells with beads possible results include detected not detected equivocal influenza a only and invalid
survey
in order to gauge if diagnostic test results or flu risk actually influence individuals to change behaviors participants were sent a survey at the completion of the study period one of two versions of the survey was sent depending on whether the participant had sent in diagnostic samples participants were asked about their preventative behaviors and the difficulty of the specimen collection protocols all questions and responses in table s1
outcomes and statistical methods
analyses were performed using r version 2151 r development core team vienna austria key outcomes of interest were self-reported symptoms participants could report any of fever cough sore throat shortness of breath chills fatigue nausea diarrhea body aches and headache and diagnostic results for each of the nasal and saliva specimens via both the genmark and biofire systems for each set of specimens sent in timing of specimen collection compared to symptom onset was noted in order to understand the potential of self-collection univariate comparisons between symptoms and diagnostic results were performed but sample size was too low to warrant further analyses
participant demographics and participation
between november 1 2013 and april 30 2014 295 participants enrolled in the study and received a kit during the study period we also sent a second kit to participants who already completed one kit allowing for second illnesses to be captured among the cohort of enrolled study participants 167 individuals reported any symptoms during the study time frame and from those individuals 71 pairs of diagnostic samples were returned 1 returned nasal sample had no accompanying saliva sample and sent for nucleic acid analysis participants submitted kits an average of 329 95 ci 239 418 days after symptom onset figure 2 people ages 20 to 77 signed up and received kits figure 3 and 70 of signups were women kits were returned by individuals ranging in age from 20 to 70





pathogens detected biofire filmarray genmark and rapid tests
out of the 71 pairs of samples tested 35 sets of samples tested positive in at least one specimen on both systems 31 were negative on both and there were 5 cases in which both the saliva and nasal specimens tested on one system did not detect a virus detected in at least one specimen using the other system influenza a was detected in one nasal specimen by genmark and not on the filmarray coronavirus was detected in one saliva sample detected by genmark and not on the filmarray coronavirus detected in one nasal sample by filmarray and not on the genmark coronavirus detected in one saliva sample by filmarray and not the genmark rsv was detected in both a nasal and saliva samples from one person on the filmarray and not on the genmark the distribution of samples and viruses detected in at least one specimen saliva or nasal on both systems are illustrated in figures 4a and b in 10 cases there was a difference between results for the nasal and saliva specimen pairs on at least one of the systems but the same pathogen was also detected in the other system table s2

rapid immunoassays performed by the users were not useful in identifying the specimens that were positive with influenza rsv or adenovirus none of the rapid tests returned alongside any of the 71 returned pairs of specimens demonstrated positive results for any pathogens even ones that were determined positive by the pcr-based methods
relationship between symptoms and diagnostic results
of people who reported the cdc centers for disease control and preventions influenza-like illness ili symptom profile fever and cough or sore throat two out of twelve of tested positive for influenza five out of twelve did not test positive for anything on the panel and five out of twelve tested positive for other viruses coronavirus hmpv and rsv the full summary of symptom profiles by pathogen is provided in table s3
participant survey results
results of the survey are reported in table s1 overall it was found that i most participants who sent in a kit did not seek any interventions from healthcare professionals for their illness 867 ii it was harder for people to produce the nasal sample than the saliva sample and iii beyond finding out their own diagnosis most individuals reported that they would find it also useful to know what others in their area have had near them 833 for those who sent in kits 937 for those who did notour study seeks to specifically study user preferences and specimen types towards building a scalable method connecting self-reported symptoms to infection type for understanding community prevalence of respiratory infections multiple initial findings are offered diagnostic samples can be generated by the public demonstrated by the high user participation rate half of the people who reported any symptoms at all completed the kit and sent in specimens and initial validation of oral specimens as compared with nasal specimens can be used for the identification of upper respiratory pathogens along with reports of greater comfort and preference for oral specimens while we anticipate the participation rate is biased upwards based on the types of people who may have agreed to participate in the study it indicates that while sick at home people are willing and able to complete the specimen collection influenza a rsv coronavirus 3 subtypes hmpv and hrv were detected from saliva and nasal samples with high concordance between the nasal and saliva samples measured on two different detection methods pairing symptom profiles with the detected viruses showed that most people who self-report the common ili profile did not have influenza through our survey we found that most individuals who became ill and returned a sample did not seek healthcare such as going to a clinic or the hospital overall saliva collection was reported to be easier than the nasal swab specimen collection rapid immunoassays did not show value for community use compared to the pcr detection of community-acquired specimens beyond the expected lower sensitivity and specificity of the rapid tests the specifications for these tests have been determined using nasopharyngeal swabs on children thus the performance on specimens from adults and using nasal swabs can be attributed to this difference the different assays genmark and biofire filmarray demonstrated similar performance with some false negatives on both saliva and nasal specimens from each system as compared to the other we also found that individuals would find it useful to know what pathogens were detected in other people in the community regarding finding out their own diagnosis most common reasons cited for desiring this information included concern for exposure to others especially by those who also mentioned they work in healthcare the results presented here suggest methods for achieving these preferences and with further studies involving more and diverse groups the power of these conclusions will increasethere are many aspects of the study which can be improved and future research should address one limitation of this study was the small and non-representative sample of volunteers based on the internet or mobile requirement for participation as well as a self-selective nature of interest participants of this study are similar demographically to those in other participatory systems6 geographically recruitment was purposefully limited but will be expanded in the future to target under-represented groups although the number of samples received was consistent with the expected number of individuals who would be sick with some type of respiratory infection this indicates that in order to increase the number of samples a greater number of participants are required finally while rapid tests were included in the kits and obtaining rapid results is an incentive for individuals to participate the performance was not specific nor sensitive enough to warrant further use different rapid diagnostic tests may be experimented with in forthcoming kits as while the majority of individuals report they would like to receive the results of their own tests within two days which is feasible with this model a more real-time test is optimal for decision makingthis study represents an advance with respect to the field of participatory public health surveillance systems to-date reports in the literature of online participatory studies have been limited to self-reported syndromic information only some studies have combined self-reported influenza symptoms with serology to understand attack rates in the population however linkage to symptoms has been limited in self-sampling studies and although other studies have demonstrated that individuals can obtain a nasal swab specimen from themselves we report here that individuals prefer saliva and initial results indicate that it can potentially provide a feasible medium for acute upper respiratory infection detection finally via the results of our survey it is indicated that participatory information crowdsourced can be used to generate context-specific rapid information for disease surveillance that has the potential to impact public health behaviorsgoing forward further study of data from the goviral surveillance method offers potential benefits such as understanding household transmission characteristics enabling evaluation of the relationship between reported symptom profiles and viral etiology as well as spatio-temporal distribution of upper respiratory infection duration of symptoms and its relation to viral etiology and impact of these efforts on an individuals public health and healthcare seeking behavior beyond a cohort approach here community specimen collection can be used during seasonal outbreak or pandemic investigations future work will increase the number and representatively of study participant demographics as well as employ next-generation detection technologies to improve sensitivity and speed of generating the diagnostic resultsall authors have confirmed that they have no financial personal or professional competing interests to report

during the end of december 2019 some patients having symptoms of flu like illness were admitted in wuhan china the infecting organism remained unknown as preliminary etiological agents suspected like influenza other respiratory viruses chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae were not found in the laboratory investigations so to identify the pathogen responsible metagenomic rna sequencing of this patients sample was done the complete viral genome data suggested this is a new rna virus related to the family coronaviridae which was later on designated as 2019-ncov or novel cov-19 this analysis revealed that this virus has more than 89 genomic similarity with a sars-like bat coronaviruses which belongs to sarbecovirus subgenus and betacoronavirusgenus on 11 february 2020 international virus classification commission renamed this novel cov-19 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 on the basis of its genetic composition and similarity with other coronaviruses and the disease caused by the virus was renamed as covid-19 18coronaviruses are a group of large sized 100160 nm spherical positively sense non-segmented single-stranded rna with genome sized 2632 kb the largest among known rna viruses and known to infect both animals and humans 2 44 45 47 coronavirus has been classified into four genera -alpha -beta -gamma and -delta out of which only two generaalpha which contains cov-nl63  cov-229e and -beta contains cov-oc43 cov-hku1 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and sars-cov found to be infectious for human 27 44 the genome of covid-19 virus constitutes 29903 nucleotides which upon fresh reannotation and mapping of the rna-sequences obtained presented the 123613 reads assembly and was very similar to sl-covzc45an already known bat strain and sars-cov 17 18 42 46 this group of viruses can easily undergo mutation and recombination to adapt any environment and thus survive by altering wide host range 40 causing constant and long-term health threats therefore it is necessary to understand its virology to prevent its rapid spreading and safety of mankindcoronavirus are among top ten deadliest viruses known for human beings with a high fatality rate of up to 36 by mers-cov during 2012 and 10 by sars-cov in 20022003 40 42 46 the current sars-cov-2 has already infected around 13 million persons and killing 72774 persons from over 211 countries and all it happened within 100 days of emergence of this new virus who as on 8 april 2020 international air travel facility and asymptomatic carriers state of the patients has been mainly responsible for rapid and exponential increase of the incidences of covid-19 infections over the globe to slow down or curtain the covid-19 spread in very first step many countries including india have followed the complete lockdown of their countriesthe second step to slow down the spread of disease is to identify the infected persons as early as possible for early prevention and cure but patient infected with this virus shows no symptoms or only mild symptoms of infection matching or confusing with common coldflu the potential of a pathogen is estimated by its reproduction number r0 which is the average secondary cases can be infected by an individual r0 of sars-cov-2 has been told much higher ie  25 than that earlier human coronaviruses sars  2 and mers  1 hence potential of covid-19 have more potential to causing pandemic which has been turned true within short time span 10 28 49 even in some reported studies the r0 for sars-cov2 was estimated to be around 4 thus indicating even bigger pandemic situation than the present status 7 30 asymptomatic carriers can increase the disease transmission to an uncontrollable manner if they will not be identified and quarantine in early stage in such situation mass screening for the disease becomes necessary and hence the fast testing devices are strongly advised to prevent the spread of the virustherefore rapid on-the-spot and accurate screening of potential virus carriers along with critical observation of patients without any indicative symptoms is very much essential for controlling the spread of covid-19 thus the present review paper summarized the various detection methods available for the detection of covid-19 their advantages disadvantages and urgent need for a rapid poc detection method on the spot biosensor their feasibly and importance in presence ever increasing countdown of covid- 19 infected patientscoronavirus detection approaches are generally based on the travel history of the person from the affected areas as well as the analysis of their clinical symptoms along with some auxiliary examinations clinical symptoms like pneumonia due to covid-19 are highly atypical and quite similar to diseases due to other respiratory viral pneumonia a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of covid-19 is still unavailable although some diagnosis methods are available presently fig 1 for virus detection each having different degree of specificity and based on single or multiple target molecule from the sars-cov2 these methods use the pathological changes in the patients organ by imaging like ct or viral nucleic acid like rt pcr using one or more gene or next generation sequencing whole genome immunological molecules produced by the patient or by the virus in the patients body- antigenantibody reaction based tests like elisa and utilizing each of these diagnosis approach has its their own advantages and shortcoming in present scenario table 1 out of these some methods were already established and considered as gold standard methods which could be replicated for this novel virus also while others are being developed and evaluated for the diagnosis of this virus on other hands there are other methods technologiesdevices also which has been developed but pending for regulatory approval and are intended for the use in covid-19 methods are described herenucleic acid based technologies are utilizes the genetic material such as dnarna and are based on the principle of their highly specific base paring with homologous strands genetic materials-based detection and diagnostics are comparatively faster than traditional culture-based methods and very useful for high-throughput testing and also provide clinical useful information like drug resistance virulence factors or strain sub-types within some hours but are relatively expensive these technologies such as polymerase chain reaction pcr dna microarrays and high throughput automated sequencing methods have tremendous role in the routine clinical diagnosis and discovering novel strains of bacteria and viruses and other pathogens here the current state of the art in the nucleic acid-based technologies for diagnostics of covid-19 and their future advancements along with pro and cons of using these technologies are being describedthe next-generation sequencing ngs is also called as high-throughput sequencing hts by this method we can determine the genomic sequence even more than 1 million base pairs in a single experiment by this technique we can diagnose the inheritable diseases cancer and infectious diseases earlier also the same technology was used for in uk for tracking an outbreak due to the methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa 8 22 with high precision and traceability even in a single patient while other routine surveillance techniques could not do it with that much precisionngs helps not only in discovery of novel viral strains on large scale but also provides very rapid detection of these viruses which link with human diseases the ngs technology along with bioinformatics tools have largely influenced the modern viral parthenogenesis studies and viral diagnostics this technology also played great application in the present covid-19 outbreak at initiation of current outbreak of sars-cov2 the samples from the patients admitted acute respiratory distress syndrome were negative for the all suspected already known pathogens the etiological pathogen was identified by only ngs by doing metagenomic rna sequencing and the phylogenetic analysis of its complete genome generated could conclude that it is a new strain of an rna virus which belonged to the coronaviridae family and was designated as sars-cov2 after nucleotide similarity and genome matching with the existing pathogens genome 33therefore this technology has great importance for identifying unknown pathogens and mutation or recombination in the genome of the pathogen in a short span of time but the huge cost of the equipment and chemicals required in this technique restricts its utilization in routine laboratory diagnosis of the diseasespresently quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr is being used for diagnosis of covid-19 and is a gold standard molecular diagnostic technique for many viruses as well single step quantitative rt-pcr with taqman chemistry is more sensitive and specific as this technology is well established and so can be used easily only needs specific primer- probe designed and synthesized remaining components of the reaction remain same as used for other viruses without or with a little change once the first sequence results of the sars-cov-2 virus from china were out candidate diagnostic rrt-pcr assays were designed and made available in the public domain for researchers various agencies or manufacturers have opted different set of genes out of many genes of sars-cov2 orf-1a gene orf-1b gene rdrp gene n gene e gene etc so every assay has varied degree of sensitivityas per the standard protocol one patient is confirmed of infection when both the selected target genes come to be positive httpivdcchinacdccnkyjz202001t20200121211337html 13 while in some reported studies two individual single-step rt-pcr assays based upon taqman-chemistry were performed for identification and amplification of two segment of any two genes mostly n or orf1b from viral genome separately others have used multiplex assays using more than one genes amplification in single reaction httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncovlabrt-pcr-panel-primerprobeshtml 2020 although these methods are very sensitive almost 100 but take longer time for confirmation as the test has to be done in a well sophisticated laboratory the testing has to be done in two steps first step for screening assay using the sars-cov-2-specific e gene and second step for confirmatory assays targeted the rdrp gene n gene and orf-1b the positive control material used for these assays was in vitro transcribed rna of known copy numbers rnase p gene detection as used in other most respiratory viruses is being used as an internal control give the information of the quality of sample collection rna extraction process the standard testing protocol as per who httpsappswhointirisbitstreamhandle10665331509who-covid-19-labtesting-20201-engpdf involves 5 steps 1 sample collection from patient 2 proper transportation of collected samples to the laboratory 3 providing demographic and clinical information to the laboratory 4 sample testing by the laboratory 5 preparing and reporting the correct and appropriate test results testing is carried out at specific centers which further delays the diagnosis and make condition of patient severe these pcr assays provide good results but on the other hand they are laborious and expensive as wellsome studies using rt-pcr syber green dye based assay found to be less specificity than taqman probe based assays similar results were reported recently in china by patients who self-collected saliva and showed 917 1112 positive sars-cov-2 while diagnosing by sybr based rt-qpcr 43 rt-qpcr assays have been reported highly sensitive and specific for sars-cov mers-cov detection and also same for covid-19 but this technology is prone to its false negative rates which could result in severe consequences due to missed diagnosis of covid-19 48 the real example is present from the current outbreak of sars-cov2 where five patients were reported as negative by rt-qpcr but found positive when ct scan examination of their chest was done and recollected samples repeated rt-qpcr all patients were confirmed positive for sars-cov-2 50 the sensitivity of rt-qpcr for detection of sars-cov was reported between 50 and 79 that too depends on their adopted protocol quality of sample time of collection amount maintenance of cold chain and total number of samples 9 51 and needs further improvement using synergistic approachesbesides sensitivity problem rt-qpcr has some other drawbacks such as possible biological safety hazards occurred during transport and sample processing nucleic acid extraction and requirement of sophisticated laboratory equipment like biosafety cabinets that is often available only in few main central laboratory 14 16 technical expertise along with sample transportation which is inevitable makes the overall process time consuming all these drawbacks could make the process less useful in case of health emergency or present global outbreak situation moreover in pcr we are able to detect not only target virus but it can also perform co-detection of several other respiratory viruses which leads increase in false positive or negative results 12 21lamp comparatively novel technique which in process of approval for covid-19 diagnosis is molecular amplification technique that can amplify any genomic material with high efficiency and in shorter time the technique is based on synthesis of target dna at constant temperature of 6065 c using specially designed primer sand enzyme dna polymerase having strand displacement activity instead of heat denaturation as in other pcr techniques 35 and in an hour or lesser time can amplify the target sequence up to more than 109 copies forming a cauliflower shaped structure as a final product consisting a stem and a loop form of dna with many inverted repeatslamp is a user-friendly technique which can provides reliable sensitive and specific results in lesser time as compared to other conventional techniques and therefore become quite popular just after its development focusing its applications in microbial detection 19 20 this technique has the advantage of requiring only single constant temperature and thus eliminating the need of thermocycler and so as power consumptionct scan is also one of the diagnosis techniques having high sensitivity due to which many researchers recommend its use as one of the necessary auxiliary diagnostic method for covid-19 moreover its results come even before clinical symptoms appear typical features by ct of covid-19 patient include bilateral multi-lobar ground-glass opacificities with differently distributions in posteriors and also in peripheral 39 along with sub-pleura ascendance thickened lobular septa with variable alveolar filling and amalgation 41according to a recent report from wuhan the ct is significantly more sensitive than pcr for isars-cov-2 suspected persons the results concluded that in patients having negative rt-qpcr reports more sensitive and accurate conclusion can be achieved using a combination of ct-scan and other standard techniques like rt-qpcr or other sensitive diagnostic testsmoreover the high-resolution ct of the chest is also proved as an essential tool for detection of sars-cov-2 at early stage and to take rapid and necessary intervention 15 therefore various studies recently utilizing chest ct images to diagnose the covid-19 1 15 38 earlier also the typical ct images in patients infected with sars-cov and mers-cov showed similar symptoms as in covid-19 38 39 as per these findings ct scans found to be a great diagnostic tool for screening of covid-19 patients especially in the high prevalence or pandemic areasas the ct scans are indicative and not confirmatory tool for pathogen detection in the covid-19 diagnosis and associated with few shortcomings also such as inability to separate the cases of other pneumonia viral or non-viral and the hysteresis of the abnormal ct imagingserological based testing methods normally use blood samples for detection of virus instead of nasopharyngeal swab samples used in pcr test the blood samples contain either a significant and measurable concentration of antibodies or virus specific antigens the two main type of antibodies in the blood which the test looks for are the immunoglobin g igg and immunoglobulin m igm the bodys way of remembering the prior infection and how it responded to infection in previous encounter is very crucial so that the body is able to attack the same pathogen again is through antibodies igm appears within few days and act as first line of active defense followed by production of igg to start clearing the infection all kind of infections are fought through igm and igg the bodys immune response mechanism can be utilized to detect the particular pathogen the blood test for covid-19 detect the protein signature antigenbiomarkers or antibodies particular to the virus so as for sars-cov2 with the confirmed sars-cov2 specific antibodies in case of antigen detection or confirmed sars-cov2 antigen in case of antibodies detection and not produced for the seasonal flu or other virus currently two types of covid-19 tests have been reported one direct utilizing antigen based on detection of viral component present during the time of infection and the second indirect using antibodies that appears in patients serum later due to development of immune response against the virus httpswwwecdceuropaeuenpublications-dataoverview-rapid-test-situation-covid-19-diagnosis-eueeaantigen detection tests find non-governmental organization httpswwwfinddxorgcovid-19pipeline lists ten rapid antigen detection tests for covid-19 with eu approval under ivds directives 9879ec but yet to come in the market due to non-availability of distributors for these devices however reports from competent authorities indicates the availability of three such ce-marked devices very soonantibody detection tests there are nearly 60 antibody tests marked rapid sars-cov-2 that are expected to come soon in market along various other in-house validated tests for sars-cov-2 by many researchers which can help in early diagnostic at commercial scale 37also a number of point of care poct kits based on igm or igg and elisa for covid-19 showing higher detection rates compared to nucleic acid based detection methods have been developed and pre-tested by many companies but still not in commercial stage 3 elisa based detection kits developed or being developed using antibodies against spike nucleocapsid or membrane and envelope proteins are considered as the one of the most sensitive method for covid-19 diagnosis earlier also this method using n-based igg elisa and s-based igg elisa showed good sensitivity for sars-cov ie 947 and 589 respectively 9 the sensitivity of elisa kit for sars-cov-2 is still under study also antibodies-based diagnostic assays are not useful for early or active diagnosis of covid-19 due to their longer time requirement 7 days or more to be developed by the host to provides positive results and so the detectable antibodies are produced late after appearance of symptoms 3 37 and once developed can persist long after the infection has been cleared there is great urgency to develop an auxiliary method for accurate diagnosis of covid-19 which should be enough sensitive specific and cost effectiverapid tests are the one which involve non-automated mostly qualitative but in some cases quantitative also are used for in vitro diagnostics ivds of many diseases already and now also being tried for covid-19 diagnosis these tests can provide results within 1030 min so their results are considered as instant as compared to the molecular tests which generally takes 46 h moreover these tests are user friendly thus wont require any extensive training or expertise to operate and can be used either in hospital environment in the laboratories or at patient bedside without any difficultypoint of care testing poct as the name indicates can be used at the patients bedside with ease without any experts or trained person to operate these devices are useful for detecting various diseases including infectious viral like hiv influenza hepatitis etc and bacterial disease in cost effective and user-friendly way and help in finding the source of any health outbreaks quickly and providing the enough time to the authorities for taking necessary preventive or therapeutic measures out of many types of poc devices the handheld pocts are of great importance in medical diagnostics which includes various type of biosensorsbiosensor is a self-contained integrated analytical device consisting of the bioreceptor transducer and a signal detector the interaction of bioreceptor with the target analyte produces an electronic signal and through transduces which can then be further amplified by a detector circuit processed and displayedbiosensors helps in development of point of care portable devices for sensitive specific and rapid diagnosis of disease in cost effective way they use various diagnostics principles such as pcr involving rna or dna sequences gel electrophoresis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa also called sandwich assay involving interaction of antigen antibodies and other detection procedures coupled with fluorescent and or radioactive labeling 5nowadays several advanced biosensors-based diagnosis approaches has been utilized for fabrication of innovated and novel handheld devices which can overcome the drawbacks of lengthy gold standard detection protocol these biosensors use the nanomaterials with tunneling and quantum properties leading to enhancement in signal amplification 34 further the nanomaterials are having high surface-to-volume ratio which enhanced their high sensitivity many fold 29 moreover the viruses target analytes are also in nanoscale these all features make the nano-sensors a potential diagnostics tool 4nano-biosensors using aptamers are one of such potent analytical tools for rapid diagnosis of diseases with high sensitivity and specificity in a cost effective and user-friendly manner compared to conventional methods 6 such nano-sensor will have great potential for detection of sars-cov-2 even in person without any symptoms with high sensitivity specificity and selectivity only for covid-19aptamers originated from a word aptus a latin word means fit in 1990 23 24 and consist of oligonucleotides of nucleic acids or even small peptide molecules having high specific binding affinity for certain target molecules leading to increase in sensitive and accurate detection these molecules can be any membrane protein amino acids toxins immunoglobulins cytokines growth factors coupling agents ionic metals intact cells or other small molecules apta-sensors can be easily converted to any specific design through surface activation or modification by chemical treatment to induce linkers and coupling sites due to their high reproducibility and purity stability and reversibility under harsh environmental conditions with vast availability of target specific linkers aptamers are being used as novel diagnostics tools 25 26 36aptamers can specially designed and synthesized for the of sars-cov-2 using its nucleocapsid protein to obtain fast test results within few seconds only and it wont require any sample preparation step pinpoints aptamer based poc for detection of sars-cov2 is in developmental stage for which the developers are claiming that will provide the sars-cov2 test result within 1 min and to be precise in only 30 s httpswwwrapidmicrobiologycomnewspinpoint39s-low-cost-handheld-covid-19-aptamer-based-diagnostic-device-in-developmentan alternative paper-based technology using waste water as samples has been suggested by kang mao et al 32paper based device based on integration of different functional area like for extraction elution purification amplification and detection all in a small inexpensive disposable paper and printed with wax on its surface in the form of zones it is very much possible to complete the whole testing process without any power source or energy just by simply folding the paper in various modes thus it is more beneficial than expensive and complicated multistep techniques these analytical devices provide high-quality fast still very precise method for pathogens detection and additionally low manufacturing cost and user-friendly nature 11 31this technology can act as an alternative detection tool for rapid tracing for the source or presence of causative agents like covid-19 in any pandemic area faeces and urine from disease carriers in the community entering in the sewer system could contain many biomarkers of the virus and same has been confirmed in a recent study which showed that these infectious agents can remain active for several days even after has been disseminated from the patients if found suitable environment 11 31 there is strong potential in this paper-based device to trace the covid-19 transmission in community wastewater by analyzing sars-cov-2 in faeces urine and other excreted output of humanpresently various who referral laboratories along european commission and member states especially working for validation of various commercial testing assays developed for covid-19 and also trying to find rapid diagnostic tests for covid-19 researches are regularly doing clinical trials of rapid diagnostic tests for finally getting approval from regulatory bodies for their use in public health with safety all regulatory authorities like european commission member state authorities find and who are working in close association and updating each and every significant research outcome in the form of product or protocol as earlier as it is validated and being approved at earliest so that these can further be upscaled for device production and distribution to meet the pace of present demand of testing and screeningthe rapid spread of covid-19 across the world has become an intense concern for health officials globally and urgent need for developing better methods for mass screening to prevent the spread of the virus has emerged today only scanning of foreheads for fever using thermal scanner is widely used but this test cannot detect asymptomatic or pre symptomatic infections nor it distinguish the novel coronavirus from other respiratory illnesses either other than rt-pcr sars-cov2 specific other diagnostic tests like rapid antibodies-based kits being used or under development seems not worthy for mass screening it is essential to diagnose suspected cases at the clinic or hospital but results take time anywhere from few hours to some days which is too slow for front-line screening thus the requirement of rapid diagnostic tool like nano-biosensor based technology which can provide the diagnosis result within few seconds is quite high for mass screening and need to be developed at commercial scale as soon as possible there are many methodology and devices aiming rapid diagnosis of covid19 are in pipeline for development and are at different stages these poct biosensors and other alternative devices have the potential to become the technology of future with high sensitivity specificity and reproducibilityin december 2019 a major outbreak from wuhan was reported in the world health organization who country office of china the covid-19 is a highly infectious diseases and after reporting the first case in china it has rapidly covered the entire world and affected the life of millions people on 17th april there are a total 2164111 confirmed cases and 146198 deaths of covid-19 reported globally to the who 1 due to the occurrence of many cases worldwide on january 30th 2020 the world health organization who declared a public health emergency of international concern 2 in india at present the total number of active cases and deaths are reported 12289 and 488 respectively by the government agencies 3 this covid-19 infection also affected badly the united states of america spain italy and other countriesthe occurrence of an epidemic of respiratory infections in wuhan china the cdc country office china documented its etiology which is attributed by a novel virus belongs to coronavirus cov family which includes alpha and gamma coronoaviruses the virus has wide range of host such as humans other mammals and birds the infected one may does not exhibit symptoms and may remain asymptomatic and some may have severe symptoms in their respiratory and digestive organs 45 coronavirus is a rna virus which contains approximately 2732 kb of positive-sense single-stranded rna 45 like other corona viruses the ncov have at least six open reading frames orfs and many other accessory genes at the 5 terminal two-thirds of the genome consists of two open reading frames orfs orf1 and orf2 these orf encodes two polyproteins namely pp1a and pp1ab and further cleaved into 11 and 16 proteins respectively at the 3 terminal the various structural proteins are located such as nucleocapsid n membrane protein m an envelope protein e and spike s these viruses also contain some accessory protein which help in virus replication the s gene help ncov for host specificity and receptor binding and some may also contain hemagglutinin- esterase he protein in their virion 6the covid-19 infected patients have clinical manifestation which includes the fever and cough as primary clinical presentations and others are shortness of breath and myalgia etc some patients may have serious complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and cytokine storm which may leads to death 7 the collection of appropriate specimen is very crucial for detection of most of the infected cases of covid-19 the nasopharyngeal swab usually collected but in some instances we may miss the detection therefore the lower respiratory tract specimens such as sputum bronchoalveolar lavage bal may be the alternate choice 8in this pandemic of sars-cov-2 the reliable early and accurate diagnosis is very crucial to provide timely medical help to the infected individual as well as it helps to the government agencies to prevent its spread to other individuals and saves peoples lives false negative test result may lead to spread of the epidemic in the community similarly the false positive result may lead unnecessary treatment and mental trauma to the patients therefore there is an urgent need to have accurate rapid readily available and reliable diagnostic test for sars-cov-2 infection till date various immunological and nucleic acid amplification diagnostic tests are developed and easily available various integrated point-of-care molecular devices are currently under development and some are available to provide accurate and fast diagnostic services for sars-cov-2 infections
in present crisis of covid-19 an accessible and reliable testing is a need of hour in this review we try to explore the selection of appropriate specimen availability and utility of various diagnostic tools for the purpose of diagnosis of covid-19 infected cases this will help the authorities to utilize the most suitable diagnostic tool for tracking the virus and to take timely action to suppress the transmission 9as per centre for disease control and prevention cdc recommendations the upper respiratory specimens should be collected for rt-pcr based testing of covid-19 and especially the nasopharyngeal specimen is a preferred choice 10 the cdc also recommended that when the nasopharyngeal swab is not possible the other specimen such as an oropharyngeal op specimen nasal mid-turbinate nmt swab an anterior nares nasal swab ns specimen and nasopharyngeal washaspirate or nasal aspirate na specimen can be collected alternatively all specimens should be placed in a tube containing viral transport medium and transported to the laboratory on time similarly for serological assay the blood sample can be collected the healthcare professional should adhere to infection prevention and control guidelines of who and use the personal protective equipment such as gown gloves eye protection and n95 mask while collecting the specimen 11 if the shipping of specimen to the reference diagnostic laboratories required the sample must be transported in triple packaging system the sample vial must be properly labeled and sealed and kept in outer covering of absorbent material primary container and then placed in secondary container after that the secondary container should be placed with frozen gel packs in the thermocol box outer container all the processes including packaging labeling and shipping must be done as per the who guideline 12various studies conducted and have given evidence that the sars-cov-2 can invade digestives system and haematological system along with respiratory system 13 peng et al 13 from china in their study they were collected different types of specimen for detection of sars-cov-2 rna and found highest positivity rate in pharyngeal swab 78 after that equally in blood and anal swab 22 each and 11 in urine another study published from united states they found that stool oropharyngeal swab and nasopaharyngeal swab were positive for sarscov2 while serum and urine were found negative however this study is published as case report and included only one patient 14 a study from china enrolled 41 patients all are laboratory confirmed sarscov2 infected among these only six blood specimens were found positive while all 41 respiratory specimens were found positive 15 another study from china found very interesting results that the virus can be detected in feces and blood along with respiratory specimens however the percentage is not very promising 16in a recently published case report from japan the investigators documented that when the clinical suspicion is high the negative pcr test on throat swabs is not sufficient to rule out the covid-19 infection but the bronchoalveolar lavage bal of the lower respiratory tract specimen should be preferred for diagnosis 17 thus it is very important to conclude the final result of the highly suspected sars-cov-2 infected individuals we should consider collecting various types of specimen this will improve the detection rate and can reduce the false negative results similarly peng et al advocated the usefulness of testing of different specimen types for sars-cov-2 infection to monitor disease changes and progression as well as for establishing a prognosis 13the virus culture can be done by standard methodology as described by kim et al briefly the vero cells which were cultured 1  dulbeccos modified eagles medium dmem supplemented with 2 fetal bovine serum at 37 c with 5 co2 used for the inoculation of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples 18 and after 3 days of inoculation the specific cytopathic effects were observed later on they are also confirmed by using real time rt pcr researcher from wuhan china have done virus isolation on human airway epithelial cells and vero e6 and huh-7 cell lines by inoculation of bronchoalveolar-lavage samples and the isolated virus was named 2019-ncov 19 using the human airway epithelial cell cultures for virus isolation is skilled labor intensive task however these were found very promising for analysis of respiratory pathogens of humans 20 recently an indian study reported the first isolation of sars-cov-2 by using vero ccl-81 cells 21 the inoculated cells with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples visualized for specific cytopathic effects for covid-19 then these cells were fixed dehydrated and cut into sections for transmission electron microscopy with standard methodology described by kim et al 18 kim et al reported that they have observed coronavirus-specific morphology and found the virus particle size ranged from 70 to 90 nm they also found that the virus is observed in wide range of intracellular organelles especially in vesicles 18 viral culture of sars-cov-2 needs to be conducted in a bio-safety level-3 facility the cell culture is very useful for isolation and characterization of viruses but basically the cell culture for virus isolation is not recommended for diagnostic purposesthe immunological test measures the antibodies generated by host bodys immune response against the virus infection or measures the proteins of covid-19 virus present in the respiratory specimens as virus enters in the human body its elicit immune response to produce the antibody against the virus detection of such antibody in infected person is very useful whether the person has symptoms or no symptom thus this type of tests provides valuable information about the person is exposed to this covid-19 or not the only thing is that the antibody detection test is not for the identification of active cases of sars-cov-2 infectionsat the time of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic various reports documented that the detection of viral specific igm and igg are valid for serological diagnosis 22 xiang et al 22 conducted a study in china and found that the serodiagnosis of covid-19 based on igm and igg elisa have great specificity for diagnosis of covid-19 in their study they found that the sensitivity and specificity of detection of igm were 773  100 and for igg detection were 8333 and 950 respectively in the confirmed patients with covid-19 similarly in suspected covid-19 cases the sensitivity and specificity were found for igm 875 and 100 and for igg were 708  966 respectively thus the detection of both igg and igm with higher specificity makes them reliable and could help us to establish the diagnosis of covi-19 patientsin general the lateral flow assay is used in the rapid point of care immunoassay this assay could help us for rapid and on-site detection of covid-19 especially in case of an emergency these assays were developed to detect antigen of sars cov-2 virus or detecting igg and igm antibodies against the sars cov-2 virus infection 23 tang et al 23 emphasized that the detection of igm and igg antibodies by rapid lateral flow assay will play an important role in covid-19 infections and help us to assess the burden of infections find out asymptomatic patients etc 23 covid-19 igmigg rapid test of biomedomics is such of point of care device with 8866 sensitivity available in the market nguyen et al 2020 despite the rapidity and low cost of these immunoassays based on antigen detection for sars-cov-2 previous experience for influenza flu viruses utilizing this type of assay has limitation of its uses while utilizing this type of antigen detection test one should keep in his mind that due to sampling variability and low viral load in the infected person we may miss the caseserological assays are very rapidly developed and they measure the host immune response against the invading pathogens serological assay were used earlier in sars and other corona virus outbreaks and played important role 2425 a study from china documented that by immunehistochemical analysis that we can detect the antigen in the lung tissue of the patients and the detection of igm and igg antiviral antibodies in the serum can provide additional evidences to confirm the covid-19 cases 19 a recent study from china analyzing the family cluster of sars-cov-2 infections revealed that the serology testing can assist in timely diagnosis while screening in close contacts 26 although who has recommended that the serology testing can be used where molecular testing is not available 27 however the study from china emphasized the need of serology testing in this pandemic of covid-19 due to high number of cases 26 immunological tests have limitation to use in early phase of infection because that time the immune response is still building in case of covid-19 infection we are in early phase of developing immunological diagnosis some diagnostic test has been approved by food and drug administration of america but still they are not recommended to use solely for the diagnosis of covid-19 28 similarly who also recommended that these points of care immunodiagnostic test used only in research setting not the purpose of clinical decision making until and unless the evidences also supported 29 even though certain limitations in future these immunological tests may have critical role in the identification of individuals who have recovered from this covid infection in the past the test result may also help us in choosing the convalescent plasma which can be used as treatment option for covid-19 infected individuals 28in acute respiratory infection rt-pcr is routinely used to detect causative viruses from respiratory secretions in nucleic acid testing assay the real time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction real time rt-pcr is one of the best and accurate laboratory methods for detecting tracking and studying the coronavirus real time rt-pcr is a method by which we can detect the presence of specific target genetic material nowadays various fluorescent dyes are used as marker to detect the specific genetic target earlier radioactive isotopes were used as marker the most important aspect of using real-time rt-pcr assays is that the amplification and analysis will be carried out in a closed system therefore the chances of false positive results will be minimized 30the real time rt-pcr facilitates in analyzing the result in real time even though the process is still ongoing which makes it more useful than conventional rt-pcr which provides the result at the end the recent emergence of the coronavirus covid-19 has demonstrated the need of reliable and rapid detection thus in present scenario the real time rt-pcr is the most widely used methods for the detection of coronavirus the molecular testing is still a gold standard for relevant case diagnosis 26 most of the molecular diagnostics being developed are based on real-time rt-pcr assays for covid-19 infection loop-mediated isothermal amplification clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and multiplex isothermal amplification followed by microarray detection are the some other methods which were developed and evaluated worldwide 23for conducting the pcr assay the number of molecular target have been identified within the rna of corona viruses such as helicase hel nucleocapsid n transmembrane m envelope e and envelope glycoproteins spike s 23 hemagglutinin-esterase he open reading frames orf1a and orf1b and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp are some other genes that encode structural proteins can be utilized for the covid-19 diagnosis 23 in this real time pcr assay the viral rna is measured by the cycle threshold ct which is defined as the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross the threshold and becomes detectable the interpretation of result in real time-pcr is based on ct values for specimen a value less than 40 is clinically reported as pcr positive in rt-pcr most of time results are 100 specific but false negative result may also occur which may be due to sampling error or inappropriate timing of sampling 30the who recommended that the e gene assay followed by a confirmatory assay using the rdrp gene can be utilized for first line screening of covid-19 cases 31 and in the united states the cdc asked to use two nucleocapsid protein targets n1 and n2 as molecular assay 32 a study published from hong kong china found that rdrphel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro and have higher sensitivity and specificity among the three developed novel real-time rt-pcr assays targeting the rdrphel s and n genes of sars-cov-2 33it is advisable to use at least two molecular targets to avoid the situation of a potential genetic drift of sars-cov-2 and the cross-reaction with other endemic coronaviruses as well however the ideal design would include at least one conserved region and one specific region to mitigate against the effects of genetic drift especially as the virus evolves within new populations 23 various studies conducted worldwide using molecular assay rt-pcr assay for diagnosis of covid-19 infections table 1
 most of the studies were used at least two target assay in combination for diagnosis of covid-19 infections in a study from germany they have chosen envelope and rna-dependent rna polymerase 31 in another study from hong kong china the researcher first used the nucleocapsid for screening followed by confirmation by the open reading frame 1b 33 similarly cdc conducted a study in the united states by selecting two loci in nucleocapsid gene and found the good performance for detection of coivd-19 32in view of the critical situations of covid-19 infections worldwide various companies attempted to develop commercial kits for detection of sars-cov-2 rna by real time pcr various institutes of indian council of medical research new delhi icmr till date 17042020 evaluated the performance of 31 such commercial kits and among these 14 kits were found satisfactory 39even though the rt-pcr is a tool to do definitive diagnosis of covid-19 but the sensitivity is reported to be lower than chest ct examinations however the chest ct alone does not differentiate between covid-19 pneumonia to other viral pneumonia 40 another molecular method that is loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp reaction could serve as an alternative method to the rt-qpcr to detect covid-19 the lamp is a nucleic acid amplification technique which amplifies the dna in isothermal condition with rapidity and high specificity this method can be utilised for the diagnosis of covid-19 without the need of specialized equipments and trained analysts in near future the point-of-care device based on lamp can be a potential diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of covid-19 infected individuals 41 recently prof feng zhang et al given a crispr-cas13 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats- and associated cas proteins13 based sherlock specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking protocols which is accurate and rapid method for novel coronavirus covid-19 22 kim et al in their study reported that they have constructed the next generation sequencing ngs library by amplifying the full-length genes of the isolates using the synthesized cdna and primers specific for sars-cov-2 18further development and inclusion of these new technologies for the diagnosis of covid-19 can provide a better accurate and rapid tool these developments may also reduce the need of sophisticated equipments and specific training this will help us to reach to a wide community for screening as well as for diagnosing themin a present scenario the early diagnosis is very crucial to identify the infectious cases to prevent community transmission in present scenario various technologies are available to provide better diagnostic services to the community in this outbreak there is need to collect the right specimen on right time for proper diagnosis due to high risk of infection the challenges are to keep healthcare professional safe by having appropriate ppe kits real time rt-pcr assay remain the molecular test of choice for etiologic diagnosis of the covid-19 cases while antibody based immunological test are used as supplementary tools for screening the whole community and confirming with the molecular assay both real time rt-pcr and immunological assay help us to tackle this major outbreak of covid-19 which impacted the life of people and global economy the rapid test kits are in demand for providing rapid diagnostic services in an emergency situation as well at bed-side to the patients in summary the proper utilization of available test in alone or in combination we can detect the covid-19 cases as soon as possible and saves lives of human beingno funding sourcesnone declarednot required42since mid-december 2019 and as of early february 2020 the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov originating from wuhan hubei province china has infected over 25000 laboratory-confirmed cases across 28 countries with about 500 deaths a case-fatality rate of about 2 more than 90 of the cases and deaths were in china 1 based on the initial reported surge of cases in wuhan the majority were males with a median age of 55 years and linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market 2 most of the reported cases had similar symptoms at the onset of illness such as fever cough and myalgia or fatigue most cases developed pneumonia and some severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome 3the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov a betacoronavirus forms a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus of the orthocoronavirinae subfamily 4 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov are also betacoronaviruses that are zoonotic in origin and have been linked to potential fatal illness during the outbreaks in 2003 and 2012 respectively 56 based on current evidence pathogenicity for 2019-ncov is about 3 which is significantly lower than sars-cov 10 and mers-cov 40 7 however 2019-ncov has potentially higher transmissibility r0 1455 than both sars-cov r0 25 and mers-cov r0 1 7with the possible expansion of 2019-ncov globally 8 and the declaration of the 2019-ncov outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostics vaccines and therapeutics to detect prevent and contain 2019-ncov promptly there is however currently a lack of understanding of what is available in the early phase of 2019-ncov outbreak the systematic review describes and assesses the potential rapid diagnostics vaccines and therapeutics for 2019-ncov based in part on the developments for mers-cov and sars-cova systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases pubmed embase and cochrane library to identify published studies examining the diagnosis therapeutic drugs and vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelinesthere were two independent reviewers each focusing on sars mers and 2019-ncov respectively a third independent reviewer was engaged to resolve any conflicting article of interest we used the key words sars coronavirus mers 2019 novel coronavirus wuhan virus to identify the diseases in the search strategy the systematic searches for diagnosis therapeutic drugs and vaccines were carried out independently and the key words drug therapy vaccine diagnosis point of care testing and rapid diagnostic test were used in conjunction with the disease key words for the respective searchesexamples of search strings can be found in table s1 we searched for randomized controlled trials rcts and validation trials for diagnostics test published in english that measured a the sensitivity andor specificity of a rapid diagnostic test or a point-of-care testing kit b the impact of drug therapy or c vaccine efficacy against either of these diseases with no date restriction applied for the 2019-ncov we searched for all in vitro animal or human studies published in english between 1 december 2019 and 6 february 2020 on the same outcomes of interest in addition we reviewed the references of retrieved articles in order to identify additional studies or reports not retrieved by the initial searches studies that examined the mechanisms of diagnostic tests drug therapy or vaccine efficacy against sars mers and 2019-ncov were excludedgiven the rapidly developing and commercial nature of information regarding these developments google search results from the first five pages of each search term were scanned for relevance relevant articles were further identified through snowballing including a search of press releases and grey literature on vaccine manufacturers official websites table s2 a list of potential commercial kits was also provided on 29 january 2020 by dr kim j png personal communication this list was compiled by dr png from web searches and review of latest business news the list served to verify and supplement our teams own search above for review clinical trials was also searched via httpsclinicaltrialsgov to supplement the review of the diagnostics vaccine and therapeutics of 2019-ncov sars-cov and mers-covan initial search identified a total of 1065 articles from pubmed embase and cochrane library there were 236 236 and 593 articles related to diagnostics therapeutics and vaccines respectively figure 1 after reviewing for inclusion and exclusion and the removal of duplications a total of 27 studies were used for the full review figure 1a google search for 2019-ncov diagnostics as of 6 february 2020 table s2 yielded five webpage links from government and international bodies with official information and guidelines who europe cdc us cdc us fda three webpage links on diagnostic protocols and scientific commentaries and five webpage links on market news and press releases six protocols for diagnostics using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr from six countries were published on whos website 9 google search for 2019-ncov vaccines yielded 19 relevant articleswith the emergence of 2019-ncov real time rt-pcr remains the primary means for diagnosing the new virus strain among the many diagnostic platforms available 10111213141516171819 table s3 among the 16 diagnostics studies selected one study discussed the use of rt-pcr in diagnosing patients with 2019-ncov 11 table 1 the period and type of specimen collected for rt-pcr play an important role in the diagnosis of 2019-ncov it was found that the respiratory specimens were positive for the virus while serum was negative in the early period it has also suggested that in the early days of illness patients have high levels of virus despite the mild symptomsapart from the commonly used rt-pcr in diagnosing mers-cov four studies identified various diagnostic methods such as reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp rt-insulated isothermal pcr rt-iipcr and a one-step rrt-pcr assay based on specific taqman probes rt-lamp has similar sensitivity as real time rt-pcr it is also highly specific and is used to detect mers-cov it is comparable to the usual diagnostic tests and is rapid simple and convenient likewise rt-iipcr and a one-step rrt-pcr assay have also shown similar sensitivity and high specificity for mer-cov lastly one study focused on the validation of the six commercial real rt-pcr kits with high accuracy although real time rt-pcr is a primary method for diagnosing mers-cov high levels of pcr inhibition may hinder pcr sensitivity table 1there are eleven studies that focus on sars-cov diagnostic testing table 1 these papers described diagnostic methods to detect the virus with the majority of them using molecular testing for diagnosis comparison between the molecular test ie rt-pcr and serological test ie elisa showed that the molecular test has better sensitivity and specificity hence enhancements to the current molecular test were conducted to improve the diagnosis studies looked at using nested pcr to include a pre-amplification step or incorporating n gene as an additional sensitive molecular marker to improve on the sensitivity table 1 in addition there are seven potential rapid diagnostic kits as of 24 january 2020 table 2 available on the market for 2019-ncov six of these are only for research purposes only one kit from beijing genome institute bgi is approved for use in the clinical setting for rapid diagnosis most of the kits are for rt-pcr there were two kits bgi china and veredus singapore with the capability to detect multiple pathogens using sequencing and microarray technologies respectively with the emergence of 2019-ncov there are about 15 potential vaccine candidates in the pipeline globally table 3 in which a wide range of technology such as messenger rna dna-based nanoparticle synthetic and modified virus-like particle was applied it will likely take about a year for most candidates to start phase 1 clinical trials except for those funded by coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi however the kit developed by the bgi have passed emergency approval procedure of the national medical products administration and are currently used in clinical and surveillance centers of china 40of the total of 570 unique studies on 2019-ncov sars cov or mers-cov vaccines screened only four were eventually included in the review most studies on sars and mers vaccines were excluded as they were performed in cell or animal models figure 1 the four studies included in this review were phase i clinical trials on sars or mers vaccines table 4 44454647 there were no studies of any population type cell animal human on the 2019-ncov at the point of screening the published clinical trials were mostly done in united states except for one on the sars vaccine done in china 44 all vaccine candidates for sars and mers were reported to be safe well-tolerated and able to trigger the relevant and appropriate immune responses in the participants in addition we highlight six ongoing phase i clinical trials identified in the clinicaltrialsgov register 4849 table s4 505152 these trials are all testing the safety and immunogenicity of their respective mers-cov vaccine candidates but were excluded as there are no results published yet the trials are projected to complete in december 2020 two studies in russia 5051 and december 2021 in germany 52existing literature search did not return any results on completed 2019-ncov trials at the time of writing among 23 trials found from the systematic review table 5 there are nine clinical trials registered under the clinical trials registry clinicaltrialsgov for 2019-ncov therapeutics 535455565758596061 of which five studies on hydroxychloroquine lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol mesenchymal stem cells traditional chinese medicine and glucocorticoid therapy usage have commenced recruitment the remaining four studies encompass investigation of antivirals interferon atomization darunavir and cobicistat arbidol and remdesivir usage for 2019-ncov patients table 5besides the six completed randomized controlled trials rct selected from the systematic review table 6 there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at sars therapeutics 92 the studies found from clinicaltrialsgov have not been updated since 2013 while many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavirritonavir or ribavirin only there has yet to be well-designed clinical trials investigating their usage three completed randomized controlled trials were conducted during the sars epidemic3 in china 1 in taiwan and 2 in hong kong 9394959697 the studies respectively investigated antibiotic usage involving 190 participants combination of western and chinese treatment vs chinese treatment in 123 participants integrative chinese and western treatment in 49 patients usage of a specific chinese medicine in four participants and early use of corticosteroid in 16 participants another notable study was an open non-randomized study investigating ribavirinlopinavirritonavir usage in 152 participants 98 one randomized controlled trial investigating integrative western and chinese treatment during the sars epidemic was excluded as it was a chinese article 94there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at mers therapeutics 99 it investigates the usage of lopinavirritonavir and interferon beta 1b likewise many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavirritonavirribavirin interferon and convalescent plasma usage to date only one trial has been completed one phase 1 clinical trial investigating the safety and tolerability of a fully human polyclonal igg immunoglobulin sab-301 was found in available literature 46 the trial conducted in the united states in 2017 demonstrated sab-301 to be safe and well-tolerated at single doses another trial on mers therapeutics was found on clinicaltrialsgova phase 23 trial in the united states evaluating the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics pk and immunogenicity on co-administered mers-cov antibodies regn3048  regn3051 100the existing practices in detecting genetic material of coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov include a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr b real-time rt-pcr rrt-pcr c reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp and d real-time rt-lamp 104 nucleic amplification tests naat are usually preferred as in the case of mers-cov diagnosis as it has the highest sensitivity at the earliest time point in the acute phase of infection 102 chinese health authorities have recently posted the full genome of 2019-ncov in the genbank and in gisaid portal to facilitate in the detection of the virus 11 several laboratory assays have been developed to detect the novel coronavirus in wuhan as highlighted in whos interim guidance on ncov laboratory testing of suspected cases these include protocols from other countries such as thailand japan and china 105the first validated diagnostic test was designed in germany corman et al had initially designed a candidate diagnostic rt-pcr assay based on the sars or sars-related coronavirus as it was suggested that circulating virus was sars-like upon the release of the sequence assays were selected based on the match against 2019-ncov upon inspection of the sequence alignment two assays were used for the rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene and e gene where e gene assay acts as the first-line screening tool and rdrp gene assay as the confirmatory testing all assays were highly sensitive and specific in that they did not cross-react with other coronavirus and also human clinical samples that contained respiratory viruses 11the hong kong university used two monoplex assays which were reactive with coronaviruses under the subgenus sarbecovirus consisting of 2019-ncov sars-cov and sars-like coronavirus viral rna extracted from sars-cov can be used as the positive control for the suggested protocol assuming that sars has been eradicated it is proposed that the n gene rt-pcr can be used as a screening assay while the orf1b assay acts as a confirmatory test however this protocol has only been evaluated with a panel of controls with the only positive control sars-cov rna synthetic oligonucleotide positive control or 2019-ncov have yet to be tested 106the us cdc shared the protocol on the real time rt-pcr assay for the detection of the 2019-ncov with the primers and probes designed for the universal detection of sars-like coronavirus and the specific detection of 2019-ncov however the protocol has not been validated on other platforms or chemistries apart from the protocol described there are some limitations for the assay analysts engaged have to be trained and familiar with the testing procedure and result interpretation false negative results may occur due to insufficient organisms in the specimen resulting from improper collection transportation or handling also rna viruses may show substantial genetic variability this could result in mismatch between the primer and probes with the target sequence which can diminish the assay performance or result in false negative results 107 point-of-care test kit can potentially minimize these limitations which should be highly prioritized for research and development in the next few monthsserological testing such as elisa iift and neutralization tests are effective in determining the extent of infection including estimating asymptomatic and attack rate compared to the detection of viral genome through molecular methods serological testing detects antibodies and antigens there would be a lag period as antibodies specifically targeting the virus would normally appear between 14 and 28 days after the illness onset 108 furthermore studies suggest that low antibody titers in the second week or delayed antibody production could be associated with mortality with a high viral load hence serological diagnoses are likely used when nucleic amplification tests naat are not available or accessible 102vaccines can prevent and protect against infection and disease occurrence when exposed to the specific pathogen of interest especially in vulnerable populations who are more prone to severe outcomes in the context of the current 2019-ncov outbreak vaccines will help control and reduce disease transmission by creating herd immunity in addition to protecting healthy individuals from infection this decreases the effective r0 value of the disease nonetheless there are social clinical and economic hurdles for vaccine and vaccination programmes including a the willingness of the public to undergo vaccination with a novel vaccine b the side effects and severe adverse reactions of vaccination c the potential difference andor low efficacy of the vaccine in populations different from the clinical trials populations and d the accessibility of the vaccines to a given population including the cost and availability of the vaccinevaccines against the 2019-ncov are currently in development and none are in testing at the time of writing on 23 january 2020 the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi announced that they will fund vaccine development programmes with inovio the university of queensland and moderna inc respectively with the aim to test the experimental vaccines clinically in 16 weeks by june 2020 the vaccine candidates will be developed by the dna recombinant and mrna vaccine platforms from these organizations 109based on the most recent mers-cov outbreak there are already a number of vaccine candidates being developed but most are still in the preclinical testing stage the vaccines in development include viral vector-based vaccine dna vaccine subunit vaccine virus-like particles vlps-based vaccine inactivated whole-virus iwv vaccine and live attenuated vaccine the latest findings for these vaccines arebased on the review by yong et al 2019 in august 2019 110 as of the date of reporting there is only one published clinical study on the mers-cov vaccine by geneone life science  inovio pharmaceuticals 47 there was one sars vaccine trial conducted by the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases both phase i clinical trials reported positive results but only one has announced plans to proceed to phase 2 trial 111due to the close genetic relatedness of sars-cov 79 with 2019-ncov 112 there may be potential cross-protective effect of using a safe sars-cov vaccine while awaiting the 2019-ncov vaccine however this would require small scale phase-by-phase implementation and close monitoring of vaccinees before any large scale implementationapart from the timely diagnosis of cases the achievement of favorable clinical outcomes depends on the timely treatment administered ace2 has been reported to be the same cell entry receptor used by 2019-ncov to infect humans as sars-cov 113 hence clinical similarity between the two viruses is expected particularly in severe cases in addition most of those who have died from mers-cov sars-cov and 2019-ncov were advance in age and had underlying health conditions such as hypertension diabetes or cardiovascular disease that compromised their immune systems 114 coronaviruses have error-prone rna-dependent rna polymerases rdrp which result in frequent mutations and recombination events this results in quasispecies diversity that is closely associated with adaptive evolution and the capacity to enhance viral-cell entry to cause disease over time in a specific population at-risk 115 since ace2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine coronaviruses are likely to infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and this may influence the type of therapeutics against 2019-ncov similarly to sar-covhowever in the years following two major coronavirus outbreaks sars-cov in 2003 and mers-cov in 2012 there remains no consensus on the optimal therapy for either disease 116117 well-designed clinical trials that provide the gold standard for assessing the therapeutic measures are scarce no coronavirus protease inhibitors have successfully completed a preclinical development program despite large efforts exploring sars-cov inhibitors the bulk of potential therapeutic strategies remain in the experimental phase with only a handful crossing the in vitro hurdle stronger efforts are required in the research for treatment options for major coronaviruses given their pandemic potential effective treatment options are essential to maximize the restoration of affected populations to good health following infections clinical trials have commenced in china to identify effective treatments for 2019-ncov based on the treatment evidence from sars and mers there is currently no effective specific antiviral with high-level evidence any specific antiviral therapy should be provided in the context of a clinical studytrial few treatments have shown real curative action against sars and mers and the literature generally describes isolated cases or small case seriesmany interferons from the three classes have been tested for their antiviral activities against sars-cov both in vitro and in animal models interferon  has consistently been shown to be the most active followed by interferon  the use of corticosteroids with interferon alfacon-1 synthetic interferon  appeared to have improved oxygenation and faster resolution of chest radiograph abnormalities in observational studies with untreated controls interferon has been used in multiple observational studies to treat sars-cov and mers-cov patients 116117 interferons with or without ribavirin and lopinavirritonavir are most likely to be beneficial and are being trialed in china for 2019-ncov this drug treatment appears to be the most advanced timing of treatment is likely an important factor in effectiveness a combination of ribavirin and lopinavirritonavir was used as a post-exposure prophylaxis in health care workers and may have reduced the risk of infection ribavirin alone is unlikely to have substantial antiviral activities at clinically used dosages hence ribavirin with or without corticosteroids and with lopinavir and ritonavir are among the combinations employed this was the most common agent reported in the available literature its efficacy has been assessed in observational studies retrospective case series retrospective cohort study a prospective observational study a prospective cohort study and randomized controlled trial ranging from seven to 229 participants 117 lopinavirritonavir kaletra was the earliest protease inhibitor combination introduced for the treatment of sars-cov its efficacy was documented in several studies causing notably lower incidence of adverse outcomes than with ribavirin alone combined usage with ribavirin was also associated with lower incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome nosocomial infection and death amongst other favorable outcomes recent in vitro studies have shown another hiv protease inhibitor nelfinavir to have antiviral capacity against sars-cov although it has yet to show favorable outcomes in animal studies 118 remdesivir gilead sciences gs-5734 nucleoside analogue in vitro and in vivo data support gs-5734 development as a potential pan-coronavirus antiviral based on results against several coronaviruses covs including highly pathogenic covs and potentially emergent batcovs the use of remdesivir may be a good candidate as an investigational treatmentimproved mortality following receipt of convalescent plasma in various doses was consistently reported in several observational studies involving cases with severe acute respiratory infections saris of viral etiology a significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following treatment of 025 compared to placebo or no therapy was observed 119 studies were however at moderate to high risk of bias given their small sample sizes allocation of treatment based on the physicians discretion and the availability of plasma factors like concomitant treatment may have also confounded the results associations between convalescent plasma and hospital length of stay viral antibody levels and viral load respectively were similarly inconsistent across available literature convalescent plasma while promising is likely not yet feasible given the limited pool of potential donors and issues of scalability monoclonal antibody treatment is progressing sars-cov enters host cells through the binding of their spike s protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 and cd209l 118 human monoclonal antibodies to the s protein have been shown to significantly reduce the severity of lung pathology in non-human primates following mers-cov infection 120 such neutralizing antibodies can be elicited by active or passive immunization using vaccines or convalescent plasma respectively while such neutralizing antibodies can theoretically be harvested from individuals immunized with vaccines there is uncertainty over the achievement of therapeutic levels of antibodiesother therapeutic agents have also been reported a known antimalarial agent chloroquine elicits antiviral effects against multiple viruses including hiv type 1 hepatitis b and hcov-229e chloroquine is also immunomodulatory capable of suppressing the production and release of factors which mediate the inflammatory complications of viral diseases tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 121 it is postulated that chloroquine works by altering ace2 glycosylation and endosomal ph its anti-inflammatory properties may be beneficial for the treatment of sars niclosamide as a known drug used in antihelminthic treatment the efficacy of niclosamide as an inhibitor of virus replication was proven in several assays in both immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence assays niclosamide treatment was observed to completely inhibit viral antigen synthesis reduction of virus yield in infected cells was dose dependent niclosamide likely does not interfere in the early stages of virus attachment and entry into cells nor does it function as a protease inhibitor mechanisms of niclosamide activity warrant further investigation 122 glycyrrhizin also reportedly inhibits virus adsorption and penetration in the early steps of virus replication glycyrrhizin was a significantly potent inhibitor with a low selectivity index when tested against several pathogenic flaviviruses while preliminary results suggest production of nitrous oxide which inhibits virus replication through induction of nitrous oxide synthase the mechanism of glycyrrhizin against sars-cov remains unclear the compound also has relatively lower toxicity compared to protease inhibitors like ribavirin 123 inhibitory activity was also detected in baicalin 124 extracted from another herb used in the treatment of sars in china and hong kong findings on these compounds are limited to in vitro studies 121122123124due to the rapidly evolving situation of the 2019-ncov there will be potential limitations to the systematic review the systematic review is likely to have publication bias as some developments have yet to be reported while for other developments there is no intention to report publicly or in scientific platforms due to confidentiality concerns however this may be limited to only a few developments for review as publicity does help in branding to some extent for the company andor the funder furthermore due to the rapid need to share the status of these developments there may be reporting bias in some details provided by authors of the scientific articles or commentary articles in traditional media lastly while it is not viable for any form of quality assessment and meta-analysis of the selected articles due to the limited data provided and the heterogeneous style of reporting by different articles this paper has provided a comprehensive overview of the potential developments of these pharmaceutical interventions during the early phase of the outbreak this systematic review would be useful for cross-check when the quality assessment and meta-analysis of these developments are performed as a follow-up study rapid diagnostics vaccines and therapeutics are key pharmaceutical interventions to limit transmission of respiratory infectious diseases many potential developments on these pharmaceutical interventions for 2019-ncov are ongoing in the containment phase of this outbreak potentially due to better pandemic preparedness than before however lessons from mers-cov and sars-cov have shown that the journeys for these developments can still be challenging moving aheadacute respiratory infections aris are a serious public health issue and rank among the top five causes of illness and hospitalization in children during influenza seasons fever and respiratory infection symptoms make up to 25 of all reasons for a visit to an emergency department ed silka 2003 although aris can be caused by bacteria they are most commonly caused by viral infections a rapid diagnosis of a viral infection may lead to a decrease in the use of antibiotics additional testing and possibly admissions the most commonly implicated causal viruses are influenza a and b respiratory syncytial virus rsv human parainfluenza 1 2 and 3 rhinovirus and adenovirus these viruses account for 35 to 87 of children with an ari the variability in the range of positive viral diagnosis may be affected by the choice of viral tests used and their scope of viral detection jennings 2004 weigl 2000 there is a risk of concurrent bacterial infection in children with a confirmed viral ari a study of children aged 3 to 36 months with recognizable viral infections showed a concurrent rate of bacteremia of 001 to 08 greens 1999 a prospective multicenter study of infants less than 60 days old with an ari showed a significant difference in the rate of urinary tract infection between rsv positive 54 and negative infants 101 a nonsignificant difference rate of bacteremia 11 and 23 and no cases of bacterial meningitis among the 251 rsv positive infants and 8 cases out of 938 rsv negative infants not statistically significant levine 2004however symptoms of viral ari overlap with those of bacterial infections such as pneumonia bacteremia and meningitis and in some cases are difficult to distinguish without a confirmed viral diagnosis medical assessment and diagnostic tests are often used before a decision on patient management parental advice andor hospital admission are made these precautionary tests lead to intense use of human health resources nursing laboratory and radiology staff and hospital facilities furthermore these tests are often invasive sometimes unnecessarily prolonging a childs visit to the ed resulting in suboptimal ed service provision and contributing to lengthy ed wait times and overcrowdingaris impose large costs on the health system from a high number of physician visits ed visits hospitalization and antibiotic prescriptions studies comparing health care utilization for aris in children 0 to 15 years old during influenza season and the rest of the year showed significant excess in physician visits 28000 to 51000100000 age specific population annually ed visits 1600100000 age specific population annually hospital admission 300 to 9500100000 age specific population annually and antibiotic prescription 31000100000 age specific population annually most of this burden came from children below three years of age menec 2003 neuzil 2000a study comparing the costs associated with a visit to the ed versus a primary care provider showed that the average cost for assessing a patient for an ari in the ed excluding antibiotics cost is 206 to 221 and in comparison is 101 to 106 in a primary care providers office up to 60 of patients with a common cold are treated with antimicrobials which costs 375 million annually rosenstein 1998 despite most aris being caused by viruses the physician and nursing costs only contributed to 175 of ari management costs martin 2000 this suggests that extra investigations and antibiotic prescribing in the ed may be responsible for much of any unnecessary costsduring the sars outbreak in 2003 there was access to rapid respiratory viral diagnosis in acute care settings that is provision of sameday identification of influenza virus a and b parainfluenza virus 1 2 and 3 rsv and adenovirus this enabled rapid informed patient management decisions and helped with triaging this suggests a role for rapid viral diagnosis in alleviating the burden on eds and improving health service delivery and health resource allocation in the situation of increased use of eds for ari symptoms a prompt viral diagnosis might improve decisionmaking and reduces unnecessary hospital admittance prescription of antibiotics and further diagnostic investigationsthis is supported by observational data from retrospective chart reviews of children admitted to hospital with subsequent confirmed diagnosis of adenovirus infection which revealed a change in management for 36 including revision of antibiotic treatment and use of antiviral therapy rocholl 2004 similarly chart reviews of children testing positive via a rapid influenza diagnostic test were less likely to be prescribed antibiotics in the ed 20 versus 53 p  004 and when admitted were on antibiotics for fewer days 35 versus 54 days p  003 noyola 2000 children with an early diagnosis of influenza also had fewer blood tests 17 versus 44 p  002 and urine tests performed 2 versus 24 p  0006 compared to those children with a late diagnosis sharma 2002advances in virology testing now allow for viral detection within 30 to 120 minutes by direct immunofluorescent antibody detection these have been reported to have high sensitivity up to 90 and specificity up to 99 vega 2005 confirmation of specific diagnosis of viral respiratory infection is now accessible and reliablebetter investigating the possible diagnosis of children presenting to the ed with fever and respiratory symptoms may improve their management by more rational decisions about other investigations and treatmentthis literature has yet to be systematically reviewed there may evidence of substantial reductions in unnecessary investigation costs and antibiotic prescribing for children with ari in the ed by positively identifying a viral illness rather than attempting to exclude a more serious bacterial causeto determine if the use of a rapid viral detection test for children with an ari in eds changes patient management and resource use in the ed compared to not using a rapid viral detection test we hypothesized that rapid viral testing reduces antibiotic use in the ed as well as reduces the rate of ancillary testing and length of ed visits
randomized controlled trials rcts evaluating the use of rapid viral diagnosis in children admitted to the ed with an ari
we included
studies of otherwise healthy children aged 0 to 18 years old orstudies which reported separately on subgroups of children under 18 years of age admitted to an ed with a clinical presentation consistent with an ari fever and respiratory symptoms such as cough runny nose sore throat or congested nose

bonner 2003 this was a single center rct assessing participants presenting to a large american tertiary center pediatric ed with fever and symptoms of an acute respiratory illness for less than 72 hours the goal of the study was to assess whether prior knowledge of a positive influenza test changed physician decisionmaking and management of these participantsresults from this study found a statistically significant lower rate of antibiotic prescription risk ratio rr 066 95 ci 045 to 096 shorter mean ed length of visit 109 min 95 ci 1956 to 224 and lower rate of chest radiography rr 061 95 ci 040 to 092 in participants whos rapid influenza test results were made available to the treating physician a trend for lower rate of blood and urine investigations was also found but this was not statistically significantdetails pertaining to participants outcome measures and limitations are found in the charateristics of included studies tables
poehling 2006 this was a rct assessing participants presenting to a pediatric ed or acute care clinic with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infections data were analyzed and reported separately for these two populations we only considered the study population enrolled from the ed the goal of the study was to assess whether a rapid diagnosis of influenza affects the evaluation and treatment of children with acute respiratory illnessesapproximately 20 of their study population were deemed highrisk medical participants as defined in the publication red book cid 2003 any patient for whom influenza vaccination is recommended 1 children with chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems including asthma 2 children who have required regular medical followup or hospitalization during the preceding year because of chronic metabolic diseases including diabetes mellitus renal dysfunction hemoglobinopathies or immunosuppression including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency hiv virus 3 children and adolescents who are receiving longterm aspirin therapy and therefore might be at risk for developing reyes syndrome after an influenza infection the primary trial author was contacted for further clarificationof these 20 only five participants had a condition which may have met our exclusion criteria congenital heart disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia of unknown severity and possible immune defect reported by parents but unrelated to chemotherapy the rest had asthma which is not an exclusion criteria for our review raw data excluding these five participants was obtained from the primary author and used for this metaanalysisreanalyzed data showed a trend for lower rate of blood and urine investigations and chest radiography but a higher rate of antibiotic prescription in participants with rapid influenza results available to the treating physician but none of these findings were statistically significantdetails pertaining to participants outcome measures and limitations are found in the charateristics of included studies tables

abanses 2006 this was a large single center rct assessing healthy participants aged three to 36 months presenting to a large urban pediatric ed 64000 patient visits per year with fever the goal of the study was to assess how rapid influenza testing of febrile infants and children affected physician decisionmaking with respect to diagnostic testing as well as ed charges and patient time in the ed although the inclusion criteria were based on fever this paper was analyzed as a large proportion of children  60 were found to have respiratory symptoms in the form of tachypneachildren meeting inclusion criteria were randomized into two groups one group had rapid influenza test results available to the treating physician prior to assessment while the other group had influenza testing done only at the discretion of the treating physician after initial assessment study endpoints as stated above were rates of diagnostic testing ed charges and length of ed visitalthough block randomization is mentioned what is described is actually cluster randomization by 24 hour periods despite the initial intent to conduct an rct nonadherence to the protocol led to a significant number of participants not receiving the treatment they were randomly allocated to receive a decision was made to analyze data as per actual treatment received hence a convenience sample although there is mention of itt analysis yielding no significant difference in the outcome measures between the two study groups the results were not reported due to the failed randomization this study did not meet this reviews inclusion criteria
cohen 2007 this was a multicenter cluster rct of 30 community pediatric offices in france 16 offices were randomized to use of quickvue rapid influenza test and 14 were not a total of 602 participants aged one to 17 years old with influenzalike illnesses chills upper respiratory symptoms headaches or myalgia and without focal infections were enrolled the primary objective was to compare oseltamivir use and secondary objectives included comparisons of clinical presentation ancillary testing and antibiotic use between the two study groupsthis study found that with participants enrolled in pediatric offices where rapid influenza testing was used oseltamivir was used more frequently 379 versus 137 p  00001 antibiotics 95 versus 39 p  0008 and chest radiography 40 versus 12 p  0035 was also more frequently used in the rapid influenza testing group statistically and clinically significant differences in clinical features between the two study groups included a younger mean age 47 versus 57 years old p  00001 and a larger proportion of asthmatic participants 159 versus 102 p  004this is the first rct of rapid influenza testing in community pediatric practices this study was not included in this review because the setting was not in the ed one particular concern with this study is the large number of analytical comparisons well over 30 without corrections surrounding the statistical significance level
bonner 2003 and doan 2009 used computer randomization programs to block randomize participants to their study groups poehling 2006 used a random number generator to randomize study days in blocks of four and six iyer 2006 allocated participants to study groups using alternating daysthis intervention does not lend itself to blindingincomplete outcome data were all successfully retrieved by contacting individual study authorsthere was no selective reporting found in the included trialsin the two trials where participants are individually randomized bonner 2003 doan 2009 as opposed to randomizing days like for the poehling 2006 trial there is potential for contamination if many children are rapidly diagnosed with influenza on a given day in the intervention group it is possible that children without rapid viral testing in the control group would be assumed by the treating physician to have influenza due to the commonality in their presentation with children in the intervention group this would introduce a conservative bias reducing the difference in effect between the two study groups and increasing a type ii errorall four studies reported the proportion of participants receiving or being prescribed antibiotics in the ed by study groups three did not find a statistically significant effect despite a trend favoring rapid viral testing bonner 2003 was the only trial to report a statistically significant effect for rapid influenza testing on antibiotic prescription rr  066 95 ci 045 to 096 pooled results showed a nonstatistically significant trend for reduced antibiotic prescription in the ed favoring the treatment group rr 089 95 ci 071 to 112 sensitivity analysis using the three trials deemed adequate higher quality by the method of higgins 2008

and blood cultures separately we anticipated substantial overlap between participants receiving cbc and blood cultures and have analyzed them as one outcome authors were contacted and data for this outcome was provided to analyze them as one outcome all four showed a trend for reduced blood investigations in the treatment group which is not statistically significant pooled results showed a lower rate of blood investigations in the treatment group which was not statistically significant rr 079 95 ci 062 to 10 sensitivity analysis of the three trials deemed adequate by the method of higgins 2008 however we found a significant effect rr 061 95 ci 042 to 089all four studies reported the proportion of participants undergoing urine investigations bonner 2003 and iyer 2006 reported urine analyses and urine cultures separately we anticipated some overlap between participants undergoing urine analysis and urine cultures and have analyzed them as one outcome authors were contacted and data for this outcome was provided to analyze them as one outcome none of the studies found a statistically significant difference in rate of urine investigations between the study groups pooled results showed no meaningful nor statistically significant effect of rapid viral testing on urine investigations in the ed rr 097 95 ci 079 to 119 sensitivity analysis using the three trials deemed adequate by the method of higgins 2008 found similar results rr 093 95 ci 070 to 125all four studies reported on this outcome three did not find a statistically significant effect despite a trend favoring rapid viral testing bonner 2003 was the only one to report a statistically significant effect for rapid influenza testing on chest radiography rr 061 95 ci 040 to 092 pooled results showed a statistically significant effect of rapid viral testing on chest radiography in the ed favoring the treatment group rr 077 95 ci 065 to 091 sensitivity analysis of the three trials deemed adequate by the method of higgins 2008 found a similar but stronger effect rr 059 95 ci 043 to 081only two studies reported on this outcome doan 2009 iyer 2006 neither found a statistically significant effect and pooled results did not find a significant effect either rr 100 95 ci 077 to 129 only doan 2009 was deemed adequate by the method of higgins 2008 hence a sensitivity analysis was not performed for this outcomeonly one study reported this outcome iyer 2006none of the included studies provided data on this outcometests of heterogeneity were performed for all outcome measures there was no suggestion of significant heterogeneity but the small number of trials included in this review may have contributed to the lack of significance on these statistical teststhis metaanalysis demonstrated that the use of a rapid viral diagnostic test did not dramatically affect physician decisionmaking the only exception to this was the fact that a rapid diagnosis of a viral infection decreased the rate of chest radiography use in the ed and then on sensitivity analysis for the rate of blood investigations a weak trend toward reduction in antibiotics and ed length of visit was seen but these were not statistically significantthe results of this metaanalysis suggest a benefit in using rapid respiratory viral testing mainly for reducing the rate of chest radiography and blood investigations but the evidence surrounding antibiotics is still incomplete although a weak trend for a reduction in antibiotic prescription rate was shown this was not statistically significant and the results of individual trials on this outcome were conflicting making the current evidence not yet applicablemost studies of rapid viral testing have been aimed at detecting influenza virus only except for one which used a multirespiratory viral panel while a multiviral panel can capture a larger number of viruses the test used by doan 2009 was laboratory bound and not as freely accessible to clinicians as the rapid influenza test which can be performed at the bedside and therefore offers a much more rapid result to the treating physician although point of care testing for rsv is available and has been shown to have high sensitivity 90 and specificity 92 mackie 2001 we have not found any trials using rapid rsv testing meeting the criteria for our review considering that rsv and influenza formed 73 to 95 of the positive viral tests in the study by doan 2009 perhaps using point of care testing for influenza and rsv in the ed through future studies would provide more evidence to support the practice of rapid viral testing in the edthe evidence we gathered through this review is still lacking information on key issues surrounding implementation of rapid viral testing in the ed we have found no information on safety and side effects of this intervention nor cost comparisons between the rapid viral test and the averted ancillary testing by using this intervention it will be difficult to evaluate the value caregivers assign to averting blood sampling radiography exposure and unnecessary antibiotics as well as shortening their ed visit and may require a different approach from rctsthree out of four of the included studies are high quality rcts the one quazirctiyer 2006 was clearly stated as such and the methodology was well described we have therefore presented the results for individual outcomes where possible with and without the contribution of the quazirctthe bias from contamination which may have been introduced with the two trials of individual subject randomization bonner 2003 doan 2009 would be a conservative one and strengthens the validity of the significant findings in this metaanalysisto the best of our knowledge no bias was introduced during the review processreasons for lack of effect on antibiotic prescription rates and urine investigations are unclear although levine 2004 and byington 2004 reported lower rates of bacterial infections in febrile infants less then three months old who tested positive for viral infection the rate of bacterial urinary tract infection in that group was not negligible up to 7 it is possible that physicians may still be apprehensive in dismissing the potential for a concurrent urinary tract infection despite the presence of a virus and persist in ordering urine tests and prescribing precautionary antibiotics urinary testing is dependant on obtaining a urine sample which in young children may take a long time hence prolong the ed length of visitshowever purcell 2002 reports rate of bacterial infection all were urinary tract infections in febrile rsv positive children up to two years old 13 were less then three months old to be much lower at less than 1 which puts into question this precautionary practice at least in children over three months olda number of rapid viral testing studies report subgroup analyses of participants with positive rapid viral results versus those with negative results these demonstrated that a positive rapid viral diagnosis decreased the number of ancillary tests antibiotics prescribed and ed length of visits while it is interesting to see that a positive result can decrease the amount of additional tests the question is whether the rapid viral test is worth doing before one knows its result as rapid viral diagnosis requires an invasive and uncomfortable test for the children either through nasopharyngeal swabs or washings it is important to determine how it may affect the outcome of the tested population as a whole in the four studies mentioned above the rate of positive viral diagnosis ranged from as low as 19 to 66 19 to 52 for influenza testing alone and 66 for multiviral testing therefore at least onethird of the children received an invasive test that may not have altered the course of their workup or management as one cannot definitively predict whether a child will have a positive test prior to doing it this represents a large number of nonhelpful tests which will actually add to the burden presented by children with febrile respiratory illnesses current evidence is insufficient although promising in supporting the widespread implementation of rapid viral diagnostic testing in the ed to reduce antibiotic prescription and ancillary investigations the combined number of participants from the few available studies was not large enough to statistically detect a significant effect of rapid viral testing on our primary outcome and most of our secondary outcomesas pediatric ed physicians become more comfortable managing febrile children with a confirmed viral diagnosis without further ancillary testing and precautionary antibiotics further trials of rapid viral testing may demonstrate a more sizable impact which would be detected upon itt analyses rather than just in subgroup analyses a large rct is still needed as findings from this metaanalysis found opposing effects on antibiotic use in the ed between studies while they also suggest a positive effect of rapid viral testing on blood investigations and ed length of visit they lacked the power to reach statistical significancefuture studies are also needed to assess the impact of this intervention on other secondary outcomes these include adverse effects of the intervention effects on hospital admissions and the rate of other severe concurrent bacterial infections in addition it will be important to evaluate the cost effectiveness of this intervention before it is implemented more widely

1 at the protocol stage we had intended to assess interrater agreement for quality of trial assessment but as there was no disagreement between the two review authors qd pe regarding the quality assessment of the included trials an overtly complicated adapted kappa for ordinal categorical interrater assessment was felt to be unwarranted2 at the protocol stage we were going to see if subgroup analyses by child age categories would yield important differences in outcomes as so few studies were included in this review pooled results still lacked power to definitively determine the effect of rapid viral testing we concluded that further subgrouping of participants would unlikely yield significant information and did not run such analysesthe review authors wish to thank the following people for commenting on the draft protocol catrina forde olli meurman hsutah kuo sree nair and geoff spurling the review authors also thank ms ruth a milner their biostatistician for her invaluable support and guidance finally the authors wish to thank the following people for commenting on the draft review amy zelmer vidya sharma mary moffatt rajni bhatia rick shoemaker and geoff spurlingannounced as pandemic on 13 march severe acute respiratory-related coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is not only leading to an unexpected public health crisis worldwide fauci et al 2020 but it is also becoming an unprecedented socio-economic burden schoch-spana 2020 in this context world health organization who was urging the international community to perform massive diagnostic testing to fight transmission of the virus and decrease number of undetected cases since testing is also a valuable tool aiding researchers to learn the epidemiology of the disease moreover diagnostics play a decisive role in making timely decisions on treatment and isolation of infected people thereby slowing or stopping the spread of the infectious diseasestesting along with the risk management and the healthcare system is a pivotal response in all outbreaks extraordinary examples of this response are occurring in a few countries for instance south korea is now able to test around 20000 citizens per day using aggressive testing campaigns enabled by drive-through and phone booths tests south korean hospitals phone booth coronavirus tests 2020 south koreas drive-through coronavirus testing stations 2020 testing times 2020 and german laboratories are currently carrying out about 400000 coronavirus tests every week welle 2020 which may be contributing to the lowest mortality rates due to covid-19 in the world however most of countries have a paucity of massive testing given supply problems for example specialized swabs face masks and reagents thomas 2020 or a disparity in terms of politics and public health measurements apuzzo and gebrekidan 2020 cnn et al 2020 wittenberg-cox 2020the technology behind testing is biosensing which aims to detect biological and biochemical agents employing a biologically derived or a biomimetic recognition element while either undergoing a biochemical reaction for example enzyme-based biosensors or binding the target molecule ie analyte in a highly specific way such a binding event can be then transduced to a measurable signal either directly for example by means of impedance measurements or surface plasmon resonance or employing signaling molecules ie labels including enzymes fluorophores or electrochemicallyoptically active compounds dincer et al 2019once china published the coronavirus genetic code in early january polymerase chain reaction pcr-based tests were developed around the world and covid-19 is conventionally being diagnosed by means of this gold standard method chu et al 2020 read online-handbook of covid-19 prevention and treatmentpdf 2020 pcr tests are also crucial in order to take decisions related to contact tracing and isolation of specific citizens it is worth mentioning that thoracic imaging via computer tomography scans portable chest x-rays and flexible bronchoscopy is also valuable in diagnosis therapy monitoring and discharge assessment related to covid-19 infection since as far as it is known it is mainly a respiratory illness covid-19 and coagulopathy - hematologyorg 2020 read online-handbook of covid-19 prevention and treatmentpdf 2020 udugama et al 2020pcr involves amplification of minute traces of genetic material ie the ribonucleic acid rna of the virus leading to highly specific and sensitive detection however pcr tests are generally performed in centralized diagnostic services by highly skilled personnel and their results may take from 4 h up to 3 days apart from this pcr tests are prone to the following limiting factors i sampling error nasopharyngeal swab is suitably performed to take mucus from the ventilatory system however this may give rise to false negatives as optimal sampling moment is still ambiguous ii besides as a sample preparation including cell lysis and nucleic acid purification for pcr analysis is required not only the number of the tests but also the number of extraction kits is a limiting factor for ramping up covid-19 testing shortage of rna extraction kits hampers efforts to ramp up covid-19 coronavirus testing 2020 iii generally pcr samples require specialized handling and transportation genetic material may be denatured during inadequate transportation bringing also about false negatives iv quality of reagents utilized by different pcr kit manufacturers may also affect consistency among results v standard pcr methods may lack of sensitivity potentially giving rise to false negative results in covid-19 patients with unapparent clinical symptoms for patients in recovery this resulted in the heatedly debated issue with the re-infection or more accurately re-detectable positive patients as confirming tests with more-sensitive methods delivered again positive results an et al 2020 vi because of the nucleic acid amplification employed special primers and probes for each target are necessary which limits pcrs flexibility of scaling up for other nucleic acids in an easy and rapid manner vii this previous point could even be a problem for the same target since sars-cov-2 rna is likely to undergo mutations kupferschmidtmar 2020 therefore sequencing of genetic material of the virus should be continuously monitored and confirmed to ensure accuracy of this method in this regard other biosensing technologies offer a complementary approach to standard pcr-based tests not only in terms of sensitivity but also in terms of diagnostics and therapeutic decisions moreover the biosensing community is actively working to improve portability time and cost of pcr-based sars-cov-2 detection nunez-bajo et al 2020 as well as to create easy-to-use pcr-based microfluidic devices with an integrated sample preparation state funds the development of rapid tests for coronavirus 2020 interestingly an international company envisions an alternative approach by detecting covid-19 within the exhaled breath condensate using the combination of pcr and lfa technology since it is an airborne droplet infection the detection of covid-19 on the breath followed by pcr 2020 in contrast to pcr isothermal amplification of genetic material at constant temperature enables to develop point-of-care devices for the rapid detection of nucleic acids a remarkable example of an approved technology for covid-19 determination is shown by the company abbott which delivers results in around 13 min abbott launches molecular point-of-care test to detect novel coronavirus in as little as five minutes - mar 27 2020the possible ways to target sars-cov-2 via different biomolecules are summarized in fig 1
 for the covid-19 testing apart from the aforementioned viral rna novel coronavirus exhibits spike proteins which are immunogenic grifoni et al 2020 hence immune system is able to produce immunoglobulins to trigger an immune response against the pathogen importantly these immunoglobulins are not only valuable to detect covid-19 but also for its potential therapy chen et al 2020 immunoglobulin m igm antibodies are produced during the onset of the infectious disease between 4 and 10 days whereas immunoglobulin g igg response is produced later around 2 weeks immunoglobulin m antibody - an overview  sciencedirect topics 2020 read online-handbook of covid-19 prevention and treatmentpdf 2020in order to overcome the aforementioned issues with pcr-based systems researchers around the world are pushing hard to develop different methods and devices allowing an easy rapid affordable and highly sensitive and selective quantification of nucleic acids in low-resource settings such as doctors practices or directly at home for this purpose a promising and powerful tool is the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr technology mainly employed in gene editing li et al 2019 zuo et al 2017 thanks to its different crispr-associated cas enzymes that can be programmed by single-guide rnas sgrnas or crispr rnas crrnas crispr technology enables to target all types of nucleic acids for a wide range of various targets including bacteria viruses micrornas and cancer mutations in a simple and easily scalable way only by changing the target-specific sgrnacrrna bruch et al 2019b li et al 2019 current crispr-tailored approaches are based on two different detection modes binding- or cleavage-based shown in fig 2
mammoth biosciences and sherlock biosciences leading companies in the field of crispr diagnostics have already presented their crispr-powered assays to enable rapid and low-cost tests for sars-cov-2 employing conventional lateral flow assays lfas sheridan 2020 using the cas12 effector capable of targeting single-stranded dnas and rnas and loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp broughton and colleagues from mammoth biosciences have achieved a detection limit of around 10 copies per l for the fluorescence detection of different regions of the sars-cov-2 viral genome e gene and n gene in extracted patient swab samples within 40 min broughton et al 2020 on the other hand crispr pioneer feng zhang and co-workers from sherlock biosciences have demonstrated the lfa-based colorimetric detection only by the naked eye of s gene and orf1ab gene of covid-19 with detection limits of 10 and 100 copies per l respectively in less than 1 h employing recombinase polymerase amplification rpa along with cas13a enzyme targeting single-stranded rnas zhang et al 2020 this approach is not validated yet with patient sampleshowever these systems still employ a target amplification such as lamp or rpa broughton et al 2020 shen et al 2020 which covers up the crisprs great versatility as different primers and probes for each target are required in this regard two amplification-free biosensing systems using crispr technology have recently introduced the crispr-chip for electrical detection of genetic mutations using cas9 hajian et al 2019 and the electrochemical crispr-biosensor for microrna analysis employing cas13a bruch et al 2019a both groups have announced their interest to extend their systems for an amplification-free on-site covid-19 testing cardean transistorstm made available to companies and government agencies willing to build handheld coronavirus detection devices 2020 diagnostics with molecular scissors  is this also possible for on-site covid-19 tests 2020 besides crispr-biosensors group would like to target two characteristic genome sequences e gene and rdrp gene of sars-cov-2 simultaneously using a multiplexed microfluidic chip in principle crispr-powered approaches allow for an easy adaptation to any nucleic acids and thus can address potential mutations of sars-cov-2 in a timely manner as another nucleic acid amplification-free approach an optical biosensor combining plasmonic photothermal effect and localized surface plasmon resonance has been recently demonstrated to discriminate similar gene sequences with high analytical sensitivity qiu et al 2020another convenient way of sensing is the use of substrates ie sensor material functionalized with recombinant viral antigens which can be exploited to bind the aforementioned immunoglobulins with this it is possible to detect the presence of the novel coronavirus via igm or to provide a history of past infections via igg as these antibodies are much longer present in the blood vogelmar 19 g 2020 in this regard lfas well-known as at-home pregnancy and ovulation tests offer an equipment free user-friendly and rapid platform for optical on-site testing and are the masterpiece of biosensing and nanotechnology so far marquez and morales-narvez 2019 moreover as lfa utilizes cellulose-based materials such as paper it is amenable to mass production at very low costs morales-narvez et al 2017 hence commercial lfas targeting the aforementioned immunoglobulins even simultaneously have already been developed and approved around the world including australia china germany singapore south korea and usa sheridan 2020 these devices are now a valuable tool to monitor the course of sars-cov-2 infection using a drop of human serum plasma or even whole blood offering qualitative results within 15 min at the point of care for example at home or primary care sheridan 2020 interestingly collective positive tests facilitated by lfas could lead to spot herd immunity regions thereby possibly abandoning lockdowns moreover germany is planning to issue immunity certificates allowing citizens with positive antibody tests to stop their lockdown early bienkov however highly sensitive approaches enabling a quantitative testing are also demanded since the measurement of the virus-related immunoglobulin levels can be employed as diagnostic criteria for suspected cases with negative pcr results read online-handbook of covid-19 prevention and treatmentpdf 2020 in addition determination of breadth and kinetics of immune responses can be meaningful to study non-severe cases of novel coronavirus thereby forecasting infection outcome thevarajan et al 2020 although employment of serological tests to determine covid-19 immunity is still under debate feuer and william 2020 mallapaty 2020  likewise the protection capability of face masks was cautiously discussed by who devlin and campbell 2020  we believe that serological test will be a crucial tool to execute serosurveys stadlbauer et al 2020 thereby offering relevant information to take measures aimed at ceasing lockdowns and getting back to common life graduallyother biosensing strategies using antibodies to selectively capture the whole virus exist a very recent example convat project supported by the european union aims at the optical detection of the whole virus in 30 min to determine the viral load viral content per ml in saliva samples whose result would be then followed via pcr in the same platform laura lechuga investigadora del csic llevamos tiempo reclamando que hay que invertir ms dinero en prevencin y anlisis 2020 similarly graphene-based field-effect transistors enabling portable devices have been engineered to determine covid-19 viral load in clinical nasopharyngeal samples using a specific antibody against its spike protein seo et al 2020 viral load which is conventionally determined using quantitative real-time pcr is not only important to determine the severity of the infectious disease but also to monitor viral dynamics in infected patients and a therapy response pan et al 2020 hence viral load determination may help to facilitate decisions driven by personalized medicine thereby effective clinical procedures can be applied nevertheless antibody-based approaches mainly suffer from their relatively slow typically a few weeks development when compared with nucleic acid tests against a new infection as well as from their time-consuming and expensive production depending on the specificity of the employed antibodies they may also suffer from false positives caused by potential cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses importantly existing literature summarizes current commercialized technologies focused on covid-19 diagnosis and compare their strengths and weaknesses mallapaty 2020 sheridan 2020detection of additional biomarkers different than immunoglobulins is another approach to perform effective assessment of clinical progress and provide alertness on severity or critical trends of covid-19 infection they are also valuable as a blueprint to formulate therapeutic procedures the first affiliated hospital zhejiang university school of medicine a top hospital in china with zero fatalities recommends the surveillance of the following inflammatory response biomarkers for the sars-cov-2 infection c-reactive protein procalcitonin ferritin d-dimer il-4 il-6 il-10 tnf- and inf- it is worth mentioning that low total number of lymphocytes at the onset of the disease is also an indicator of poor prognosis whereas severe infections display a gradually decreased number of peripheral blood lymphocytes read online-handbook of covid-19 prevention and treatmentpdf 2020 hence lymphocyte analysis is also an effective resource in this emerging infectious disease the clinical relevance of some of these biomarkers are discussed in table 1
 in this context the biosensing community is urged to create affordable rapid sensitive and multiplexed systems amenable to mass production in order to detect these biomarkers simultaneously besides biosensing devices incorporating artificial antibodies such as molecularly imprinted polymers zamora-glvez et al 2017 or other innovative antibodies ex shark antibodies matz and dooley 2019 would be of great value in emerging infectious disease diagnostics since they are amenable to withstand harsh conditions during handling and deliveryall in all as early career scientists and members of the biosensing community facing the most dramatic situation ever experienced in xxi century we believe that we will undergo other disease outbreaks caused not only by viral but also bacterial pathogens and the world has to rethink the way we cope with such situations thus we offer the following seven recommendations1investment in pandemic preparedness in terms of diagnostic tools is pivotal to prevent the spread of emerging infectious diseases this should be a joint and even an international task of different entities including governments funding agencies academia and industries we believe timely and large-scale testing based on reliable biosensing technology might lead to avoid or soften stringent measures such as lockdowns border closing and travel bans as shown in the example of south korea or iceland2collaborative networks should be formed and involve not only experts in biosensing but also in biosecurity and their corresponding facilities as well as robust biotechnology companies ready for mass production actually getting their central innovation opportunities in testing not dominated by already established methods like pcr the biosensing community will play a critical role to control slow hinder or prevent such pandemic outbreaks3in case of stringent measures such as border closings each country should be prepared ie sustainable and independent in terms of manufacture of biosensing technology and protection equipment for instance germany develops various kind of machines for the production of protection equipment but even germany itself has a limited activity to fabricate its own protection materials such as masks and protective clothing leading to shortages of these items4the aforementioned collaborative networks should be ready to develop new diagnostic tools or adapt the existing ones rapidly and the governments should offer fast-track approval programs such as the food and drug administration - fda to examine those tools rapidly5biosensing devices for testing infectious diseases should rigorously satisfy the following requirements they must be i disposable offering reliable mass production ii accessible and affordable allowing large-scale population screening iii easy-to-use by minimally trained users or even by the patients themselves iv equipment-free or operated with an inexpensive and portable readout unit v rapid enabling short sample-to-result times less than an hour vi able to work with low sample volumes and easily accessible samples for example blood from a finger prick or non-invasive swab samples vii highly selective and sensitive if possible without target amplification delivering accurate results in accordance with central laboratory findings viii with an integrated sample preparation including lysis and isolation for nucleic acid testing or plasma separation for proteomics ix easily scalable and flexible to detect different targets using the same platform such as crispr-powered systems and x capable of multiplexing simultaneous detection of different analytes including controls dincer et al 2017 ideally these systems should also be able to perform multi-omics simultaneously for instance the detection of nucleic acids along with immunoglobulins6internet-of-things connecting sensors via databases with healthcare workers to realize a decentralized healthcare is also an important tool to provide valuable insights in terms of emerging infectious disease scenarios and dynamics determination of herd immunity regions as well as epidemiology and big data in order to secure all these information blockchain technology known from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could be applied for internet-of-things7general population should be trained in advance to perform effective self-sampling for example to collect nasal swabs as well as self-testing especially for lfa-based immunity testing in order to estimate population coverage in this regard it would be helpful to have some classes in the high or secondary school or seminars in companies where the general public gets familiar with issues like sample collection and performing self-tests similar to fire drills

paperon 30 january 2020 the world health organization who declared a global public health emergency 1 over the outbreak of the new coronavirus called the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov which originated in wuhan city in the hubei province of china on 11 february who officially named the disease as the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 2 human-to-human transmission figure 1 has been confirmed by who and by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc of the united states 3 with evidence of person-to-person transmission from three different cases outside china namely in the us 4 germany 5 and vietnam 6 covid-19 has continuously spread to 104 countries the number of confirmed infections reached 109343 on 9 march 2020 7 and the death toll in china has overtaken the sars epidemic of 20022003 and has risen to 3100 2 to slow down the spread of covid-19 at least 50 million people in china have been placed under lockdown 8 on 8 march 2020 italy also undertook the same measures with the northern part of the country placed under lockdown affecting 16 million people 9 the definition of coronaviruses is listed in table 1 the reproduction number r0 ie the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual is estimated to be 268 and the doubling time is estimated to be 64 days 10the manifestation of the covid-19 infection is highly nonspecific including respiratory symptoms fever cough dyspnea and viral pneumonia 20 thus diagnostic tests specific to this infection are urgently required to confirm suspected cases screen patients and conduct virus surveillancein this scenario a point-of-care poc device ie a rapid robust and cost-efficient device that can be used onsite and in the field and which does not necessarily require a trained technician to operate 21 is crucial and urgently needed for the detection of covid-19 figure 2 shows the dramatic impact of early detection of infectious diseases in controlling an outbreak 222324 such a poc device can be used in but is not limited to an emergency situation such as the diamond princess cruise ship case recently it was reported that the diamond princess cruise ship has been quarantined in yokohama japan due to a serious spreading of covid-19 on this cruise with at least 454 infected cases out of 3700 passengers and crew reported by who 7 17 february 2020 the detection of covid-19 may not have been prompt enough as they did not have enough test kits to diagnose all the passengers on the ship in order to timely respond to the rapid spreading of the disease 25the current standard molecular technique that is now being used to detect covid-19 is the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr this protocol has been documented and available online on the who website since 17 january 2020 26 the testing procedure includes i specimen collection ii packing storage and shipment of the clinical specimens iii good communication with the laboratory and providing needed information iv laboratory testing v reporting the results this rrt-pcr technique requires sophisticated laboratory equipment that is often located at a central laboratory biosafety level 2 or above 42627 sample transportation is inevitable as a consequence the time required to obtain the results can be up to 2 or 3 days in the case of a public health emergency such as the covid-19 outbreak this time-consuming process of sample testing is not only extremely disadvantageous but also dangerous since the virus needs to be contained in addition commercial pcr-based methods are expensive and depend upon technical expertise and the presence of viral rna or dna does not always reflect acute disease 282930 furthermore using pcr codetection with other respiratory viruses is frequently encountered in coronaviruses covs and the contribution of positive cov pcr results to disease severity is not always explicitly exhibited 282930 furthermore as of 2 february 2020 in the united states as mentioned in the interim guidelines for collecting handling and testing clinical specimens from persons under investigation puis for 2019 novel coronavirus the diagnostic testing for covid-19 can be conducted only at cdc from 4 february 2020 onwards covid-19 tests can also be done at laboratories designated by cdc likewise in china where the outbreak is ongoing samples had to be sent to beijing for testing as reported on 31 january 2020 31 on 4 february 2020 chinas own cdc deployed a mobile biosafety laboratory to wuhan in the hubei province to assist with the response 3233 on 5 february 2020 an emergency test laboratory biosafety level 2 run by bgi genomics global heartquare shenzhen china was set up in wuhan in the hubei province to assist the covid-19 epidemic 34in order to overcome the current time-consuming and laborious detection technique using rt-qpcr an alternative molecular amplification technique should be deployed loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp reaction is a novel nucleic acid amplification technique that amplifies dna with high specificity efficiency and rapidity under isothermal conditions this method uses a set of four specially designed primers and a dna polymerase with strand displacement activity 35 to synthesize target dna up to 109 copies in less than an hour at a constant temperature of 65 c the final products are stem-loop dnas with multiple inverted repeats of the target bearing structures with a cauliflower-like appearance lamp has high specificity and sensitivity and is simple to perform hence soon after its initial development it became an enormously popular isothermal amplification method in molecular biology with application in pathogen detection lamp uses strand-displacement polymerases instead of heat denaturation to generate a single-stranded template hence it has the advantage of running at a constant temperature simultaneously reducing the cumbersomeness of a thermocycler as well as the energy required lamp technology is proven to be more stable 36 and more sensitive 37 in detection compared to pcr other advantages of lamp compared to those of pcr are shown in table 2 we believe that the lamp assay could be a potential candidate for the point-of-care device application in the detection of covid-19 an example of using lamp in a point-of-care device for the detection of a zoonotic virus causing respiratory symptoms such as the avian influenza virus aiv is the vivaldi veterinary validation of point-of-care diagnostic instrument project 38 with poc devices such as the vetpod 38 veterinary portable onsite detection in the vivaldi project detection time can be less than 1 h besides poc devices using disposable polymer chips and lamp assays as in the vetpod of the vivaldi project a lateral flow strip lfs would also be a suitable candidate for the rapid and on-site detection of covid-19 a device such as covid-19 igmigg rapid test of biomedomics is a good example 39 the sensitivity of the covid-19 igmigg rapid test is 8866 which is expected to be lower than the sensitivity of tests based on lamp-reaction assays 95 therefore a combination of lfs and lamp into one device could be an excellent candidate for poc testing of covid-19furthermore alongside detecting and containing the virus for the sake of a public health response regarding the dynamics of the outbreak the socio-economic impact of covid-19 is equally in urgent need who announced that to fight the further spread of covid-19 the international community has launched a us675 million preparedness and response plan from february through april 2020 43 in 2003 the sars-cov virus pulled the worlds output down by 50 billion the early estimation for the cost to the global economy as a result of the outbreak of covid-19 is about 360 billion 44 this is because chinas gdp shares were approximately 17 globally as of 2019 which was about four times higher than in 2003 and the confirmed infected cases at the time of doing the economic estimation ie at the beginning of february 2020 are more than 2 times larger than the total of sars given that the number of infected cases 109343 confirmed cases is currently approximately 14 times larger than sars cases 45 and that the death toll due to covid-19 has surpassed that of the sars epidemic the economic impact of covid-19 might be much larger than 360 billionfurthermore in order to win the battle against this outbreak information on the epidemiological characteristics such as the identification of the animal reservoirs 46 figure 1 and the risk factor of the disease is also essential the intermediate host carrying the disease is important to identify not only for the current epidemic but also to eliminate a future outbreak together with the all aforementioned factors the race for a vaccination against covid-19 is equally essential although at this stage there is no registered treatment or vaccine for covid-19 zhang has recently mentioned some potential interventions 47 such as nutritional interventions vitamin a b c d e and other trace minerals such as zinc and iron due to the high percentage of identicality in the sequence up to 82 of the genome structure between sars-cov-2 and the sars-cov virus immuno-enhancers and other specific treatment that have been applied for sars could also be considered 47 to use for the treatment of sars-cov-2 first in wuhan china sarscov2 arose as a new viral infection and is currently named coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 new sarscov2 along with the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus merscov and sarscov are different strains of coronaviruses belonging to the coronavirus cluster p zhou et al 2020 sarscov2 the chief pathogen of the human respiratory system is the third zoonotic coronavirus disease and the third major medical crisis with a different genome from sarscov sarscov2 is mostly transmitted by respiratory system droplets gastric tract and close human interaction and is located in the nasal mucosa mouth and lungs of exposed individuals of note middleaged and elderly individuals as well as patients with chronic or autoimmune underlying diseases are most susceptible to be infection by sarscov2 incredibly coronavirus has become a critical challenge in global public health due to rapid development and extreme spread by active carriers in humantohuman transmission riou  althaus 2020 clinically covid19 brings about very severe respiratory infections and lethal sickness the same as sars and mers besides respiratory system injury covid19 hurts various organs including the kidney liver gastrointestinal and neurologic systems yin  wunderink 2018 structurally the coronavirus is characterized as an enveloped nonsegmented and singlestranded rna virus the structure is composed of an envelope e nucleocapsid n membrane m and spike s proteins both e and m proteins have a central role in virus assembly and release of the virus schoeman  fielding 2019 sheikh altaher alnazawi almubarak  kandeel 2020 the s protein an immense multipurpose viral transmembrane protein induces immune responses by mediating the virus attachment to host receptors f li 2016 the n protein a multifunctional protein is identified as a viral rna silencing suppressor the n protein has a substantial role in viral transcription and replication and is involved in packaging the encapsidated genome into virions regarding the overexpression and high immunogenicity of n protein it can be considered as a potential diagnostic target for sarscov2 detection hurst koetzner  masters 2009after exposure the virus enters into target cells and acts by binding to its receptor the socalled angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 ace2 ace2 is present on type i and ii alveolar epithelial cells of healthy lung tissue also it has been reported that organ failure can occur all over the body if organ cells express ace2 the interaction between sarscov2 and ace2 leads to overexpression of ace2 resulting in alveolar cell detriment interstitial and alveolar edema respiratory system failure and ards y zhao et al 2020 among various laboratory abnormalities lymphopenia with or without leukocyte irregularities is commonly observed as a major paraclinical criterion of covid19 infected patients l zhou  liu 2020 according to sarscov2 immunopathogenesis lymphopenia is characterized by a decrease in lymphocytes particularly cd8 t cells and a slight increase in neutrophils wan et al 2020moreover it has been found that sarscov2 can indirectly infect immune cells mostly t cells and macrophages and elicits their destruction increased frequency of infected immune cells lymphopenia and high levels of inflammatory cytokines are considered as the most related elements to covid19 immunopathogenesis j liu et al 2020 in this regard elevated levels of pro and inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor tnf granulocyte colonystimulating factor gcsf macrophage inflammatory protein mip1a monocyte chemoattractant protein1 mcp1 interferon gammainduced protein10 ip10 interleukin1 il1 il2 il6 il7 and il10 have been documented in covid19 patients with severe conditions which generate the cytokine storm it seems that the cytokine storm is the primary phenomenon of virus pathogenesis leading to inflammation lung injury ards and other organ failures wan et al 2020hence there is a critical need for the detection of the infected or suspected cases as soon as possible to apply the appropriate treatments for covid19 and prevent the spread of virus for this reason in this review we will focus on the importance of diagnostic techniques by describing the different clinical and paraclinical diagnostic approaches related assays for both groups advantages and disadvantages technical comparison and food and drug administration fda approved rapid tests figure 1 the current review provides a comprehensive overview of covid19 diagnostic methods due to the importance of diagnosis in preventing the sarscov2 spread and controlling the infectionthe importance of different diagnostic methods of covid19 has been emphasized in many studies several studies have been designed or are underway to investigate the efficacy of covid19 diagnostic methods and have been listed in table 1 overall covid19 diagnostic methods are categorized into clinical diagnosis physical examination clinical features and the radiological findings and paraclinical diagnosis paraclinical diagnostic approaches include molecular assays or nucleic acid amplification tests naats viral sequencing serological assays and viral culture realtime polymerase chain reaction rtpcr assays particularly realtime reversetranscriptase pcr rrtpcr are the most applicable method among naats the rtpcr is usually utilized to detect the sarscov2 virus qualitatively virus sequencing by sanger sequencing and nextgeneration sequencing ngs methods has applications when the results of the molecular assays are unreliable serological assays have been developed based on detecting specific immunoglobulin m igm and igg antibodies or viral antigens recently the use of serological tests to rule out or confirm the infection specifically in negative naats has been suggested due to the ease of use quick presentation of results as well as acceptable specificity and sensitivity contrarily viral culture does not need to be used for detection due to the research aspect of culture however it can be applied to determine the contagiousness of the infection the presence of the virus at different surfaces and study the efficacy of various treatments on cultured cells in the following we have described in detail the different types of diagnostic methods in the two general clinical and paraclinical categoriessample collection is an important procedure that should be done correctly to achieve accurate diagnostic results with regard to the transmission of the sarscov2 through the respiratory tract fecaloral and body fluids anal swabs oral swabs and blood samples are different methods of sample collection for diagnosis of the novel coronavirus w zhang et al 2020 a recent study has analyzed repeated sample collection from positive cases which showed that 15 infected patients still had a virus after days of receiving treatments they further reported that they might have more positive oral swabs on the first day of sampling and more positive anal swabs on the late period of sampling notably prolonged positive stool samples are not correlated with the severity of the disease and some positive rectal swabs may have no gastrointestinal symptoms accordingly the covid19 patients could not be discharged based on negative oral swabs while they could transmit the virus from the fecaloral route according to their reports eight patients 533 had positive oral swabs four patients 267 had positive anal swabs six patients 40 had positive blood samples and three patients 20 had positive serum samples two patients had positive results in both anal and oral swabs but none of the patients with positive blood samples had positive swab results the above results indicated that patients may have negative swabs results while they are still in viremic condition additionally infected patients may have a negative oral swab whereas they have positive anal swabs or positive blood samples wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 also they evaluated the levels of igm and igg antibodies in samples on day 0 and day 5 the positive rate of igm shifted from 50 to 81 and the positive rate of igg shifted from 81 to 100 on the basis of a high detection rate of antibody titers it is beneficial to assess both serological and molecular tests in suspected patientsone of the latest studies has analyzed 1070 samples collected from different sites of 205 infected patients the specimens were collected from the pharynx urine feces sputum blood and nasal fibrobronchoscope brush biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavages were taken from patients in severe conditions or those under mechanical ventilation results have shown that the highest positive rate for the virus belongs to bronchoalveolar lavage specimens 93 also the positive rate of the other specimens was as follows sputum 72 nasal swabs 63 fibrobronchoscope brush biopsy 46 pharyngeal swabs 32 feces 29 and blood samples 1 none of the urine samples showed positive results as a result sampling from different sites of the suspected patients increases the sensitivity rate of diagnosis and decreases the falsenegative results w wang kang liu  tong 2020 another study evaluated the viral load of serial specimens from multiple sites of two patients in beijing their reports indicated that the viral load in sputum and throat swabs elevated on 56 days the sputum specimens showed a higher viral load compared with the other clinical specimens moreover two patients had positive rtpcr test results a day before the onset of clinical symptoms hence infected people can transmit the virus to others before the manifestation of their symptoms pan zhang yang poon  wang 2020 a study has reported a suspected patient with three negative oropharyngeal swabs for covid19 before admission to a hospital in beijing the test results were positive for influenza accordingly 5 days after admission in the hospital his positive test result for novel coronavirus happened by alveolar lavage specimen hence we should consider that the suspected patients with negative test results for novel coronavirus may be diagnosed eventually y han  yang 2019on the basis of the research oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs are common upper respiratory tract samples for diagnosing the novel coronavirus nevertheless we should consider that this kind of sample collection would increase the transmission rate of the virus from patients to healthcare workers furthermore this invasive sample collection method may traumatize the respiratory tracts and cause bleeding especially in patients with thrombocytopenia j fw chan yuan et al 2020 however the mentioned methods are not appropriate for viral load serial monitoring the sputum is a noninvasive specimen from the lower respiratory tract however a case series study demonstrated that only 28 of the suspected patients could produce sputum for the diagnosis process c huang et al 2020 additionally saliva specimens are noninvasive sample collection methods that would not increase the risk of transmission to healthcare workers studies have represented that saliva specimens and nasopharyngeal swabs have a 90 concordance rate indeed some viruses may be identifed in saliva but not in nasopharyngeal samples k k w to et al 2019to et al investigated the novel coronavirus in saliva specimens from 12 laboratoryconfirmed patients in hong kong as a result 11 of 12 patients 917 had positive results in their initial saliva specimens the average viral load of the samples was 33  106 copiesml 99  102 12  108 copiesml the serial saliva samples of the patients demonstrated a declining route of viral load moreover the positive viral culture in saliva showed the existence of the live virus in saliva this study introduced the saliva sample collection as a noninvasive and costeffective procedure for the diagnosis and viral load monitoring of the novel coronavirus patients themselves can make this kind of sample collection interestingly the possibility of nosocomial infection will be decreased by administrating this sample collection type on the contrary humantohuman transmission can easily occur through saliva so it is essential to identify the strategies to prevent the transmission of virus to dentists and healthcare workers sabinosilva jardim  siqueira 2020 to et al 2020 considerably it is required to note that the primary handling of the specimens should be done under biosafety level3 bsl3 conditionsaccording to recent literature the severity of the novel coronavirus has been divided into three subsets mild moderate and severe the patients in the mild category almost always show the signs and symptoms of an upper respiratory viral infection such as mild fever sore throat dry cough nasal congestion headache fatigue and myalgia the clinical symptoms of a serious disease like dyspnea is absent in these patients probably the cases may have a gastrointestinal manifestation diarrhea nausea and vomiting in the moderate group patients exhibit respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath and cough likewise children may have tachypnea at this level the patients in the severe group show fever severe dyspnea respiratory distress reduction in the saturation of the oxygen spo2  90 on room air and tachypnea almost  30 beatsmin at this stage the diagnosis of the disease would be clinical but laboratory tests rtpcr results and radiological findings can assist the clinician to achieve the final diagnosis cascella rajnik cuomo dulebohn  di napoli 2020 another study showed the diagnostic criteria in suspected children at first we should consider the exposure contact with the covid19 infected patients it is essential to know the past medical illnesses and drug histories the substantial issues include immunocompromised or immune deficiency states usage of longterm immunosuppressants severe malnutrition congenital heart disease anomalies of the respiratory tract and bronchopulmonary hypoplasia on the basis of their reports the stratification of suspected children would be as follows
1silent infection asymptomatic patients at this level patients have laboratoryconfirmed covid19 whereas they do not manifest any clinical symptoms2acute respiratory tract infection the patients have only cough fever sore throat fatigue myalgia and nasal congestion the radiological images do not display the involvement of the lung in pneumonia3mild pneumonia at this level radiological images evidence pneumonia patients may have a fever and involvement of the respiratory tract these patients are not in the severe condition of the disease4severe pneumonia the signs and symptoms of these patients are as follows1decrease in the saturation level of oxygen spo2  922increased respiratory rate 70 timesmin 1 year 50 timesmin 1 year3hypoxia nasal flaring and cyanosis4changes in mental status and consciousness5anorexia and the existence of dehydration signs5critical cases these patients need to receive icu care the complications of the critical cases include shock a respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and other organ failures shen et al 2020
the centers for disease control cdc have reported that the newly prevalent virus has mild to severe clinical manifestations in many cases and sometimes leads to death cdc in the suspected patients symptoms almost appear as fever cough fatigue pneumonia and respiratory distress whereass some symptoms such as rhinorrhea diarrhea hemoptysis headache and phlegmproducing cough are rare in these patients adhikari et al 2020 from the recent literature covid19 clinical features have some similarities to the manifestations of the other coronaviruses such as merscov and sarscov the common symptoms of the disease prove that the targeted cells for the virus are located in the lower respiratory tract however few patients indicate involvement of upper respiratory tract symptoms for instance sore throat sneezing and rhinorrhea gastrointestinal symptoms diarrhea are infrequent in covid19 patients while 2025 of the patient with sarscov and merscov had diarrhea one of the recent studies reported that the mortality rate of covid19 is approximately 2 and is lower than those of the other coronaviruses mers mortality rate 30 and sars mortality rate 40 in aged patients chang et al 2020 c huang et al 2020 analyzed the clinical features of the 41 covid19 patients the common clinical features that they reported were fever 98 cough 76 fatigue 44 the production of sputum 28 headache 8 hemoptysis 8 and diarrhea 3 on the basis of their reports 55 of the patients showed dyspnea during their hospitalization they anticipated 7 days as the median time from the onset of initial symptoms to the first admission in hospitals also they predicted 89 days for the median time from the onset of initial symptoms to the development of dyspnea and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards eventually mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit icu admission happened at around day 10 the mortality rate of this cohort study was 15 641 x yang et al 2020 analyzed 52 criticallyill covid19 patients the most common clinical manifestations were fever 98 cough 77 and dyspnea 635 the median time to confirm with imaging findings was 5 days and to icu admission was about 9 days most of the patients in the study had endorgan damage such as ards 67 liver damage 29 acute kidney injury 29 cardiac injury 23 and pneumothorax 2 the mortality rate of the patients was 615 the median duration from icu admission to death was 12 weeks in comparison the nonsurvivors were older and had concomitant past medical histories the nonsurvivor patients were more predisposed to develop ards and to receive invasivenoninvasive mechanical ventilation accordingly older patients 65 years who have ards and concomitant medical illnesses are highly susceptible to death by covid19a recent singlecenter caseseries study has examined 138 hospitalized covid19 patients at the zhongnan hospital of wuhan the average age was 56 and 543 were male the most common clinical manifestations were fever 986 fatigue 696 and cough 594 some complications such as ards 611 arrhythmia 444 and shock 306 caused the transference of 261 of the patients to the icu in comparison the icu admitted older patients had concomitant illnesses who were more likely to have had anorexia and dyspnea on the basis of the final reports the hospitalrelated transmission was estimated in 41 of the patients moreover 26 of patients were transferred to the icu and the mortality rate was 43 d wang et al 2020the seventh australian epidemiological report for covid19 evaluated 295 infected cases the average age of the patients was 47 and most of the patients were aged 5059 and 6069 years also the death cases were older than 70 only 53 of the patients had clinical symptoms the characteristics included fever 69 cough 54 sore throat 46 shortness of breath 35 diarrhea 31 pneumonia ards and joint pain 1 the median interval to recovery from the disease is different in different age groups estimated from 27 days in 2029 years old patients to 36 days in patients older than 70 years old also the severity of the disease has a direct correlation with the time interval to recovery covid19 2020zhao et al evaluated the clinical manifestations of 19 covid19 cases of pneumonia and 15 noncovid19 cases of pneumonia according to the reports the median time from onset of the clinical symptoms to hospital admission was 5 days in covid19 patients and 4 days in noncovid19 patients the most common clinical symptoms were fever and cough in both groups likewise all the patients showed evidence of pulmonary infection on their computed tomography ct images in short there are no significant differences in regard to clinical features and imaging abnormalities between covid19 and noncovid19 patients so laboratory tests and rtpcr results would be helpful to differentiate the covid19 patients d zhao et al 2020 z hu et al 2020 evaluated 24 rtpcr confirmed covid19 patients in nanjing the mentioned cases had not shown any clinical manifestations close monitoring of the patients showed that five patients 208 showed clinical symptoms cough fever etc the younger cases did not develop clinical characteristics the reports of the study demonstrated that the mean communicable time interval from the first positive nucleic acid test result to the first negative result is approximately 95 days on the basis of the reports a substantial proportion of suspected cases are asymptomatic thus close monitoring of these cases by rtpcr laboratory tests and radiological modalities would be required to control the spread rate of virus a recent study has demonstrated that initial symptoms of covid19 infectionthe most complicated symptom of this highlypathogenic virus is respiratory distress also some of the patients revealed neurological signs such as nausea vomiting approximately 1 and headache approximately 8 these signs prove that the virus can invade the central nervous as well furthermore studies demonstrated that coronaviruses could spread from chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors in the lung to the medullary cardiorespiratory center through synapseconnected routes it seems that the infection of the nervous system could be a reason for the respiratory failure of the coronavirusaccording to research the average time interval from the onset of initial symptom to dyspnea is 5 days that to admission in hospital is 7 days and that to receive intensive care is 8 days this latency time interval is enough for the virus to penetrate the nervous system and destroy the medullary neurons y c li bai  hashikawa 2020 both the neuroinflammatory process and hypoxia in the brain would lead to neurological and psychiatric symptoms of the virus steardo steardo  zorec 2020 another clinical symptom of the novel coronavirus is affecting olfactory function the 2019ncov requires ace2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 tmprss2 receptors to enter cells and destroy them olfactory stem cells and olfactory epithelial support cells express both mentioned receptors on their cell surface so anosmia and olfactory dysfunction are new clinical aspects of the covid19 brann tsukahara weinreb logan  datta 2020 a recent case series study evaluated the clinical manifestations of 38 covid19 patients in hubei province onethird of the patients had ocular symptoms such as chemosis conjunctival hyperemia and epiphora they showed that the patients in severe conditions of covid19 may have ocular abnormalities p wu et al 2020taken together the most typical clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus include fever dry cough and fatigue notably the less common symptoms in suspected patients headache nausea and vomiting anosmia cognitive impairments sore throat etc should be considered moreover some patients may not indicate any clinical manifestations at the onset of their illness so it is essential to monitor highly suspect patients with rtpcr laboratory tests and radiological images the clinical characteristics of the other studies have been represented in table 2covid19 sarscov2 as well as other coronaviruses such as sarscov and merscov can lead to coronaviral pneumonia and ards according to recent reports some diagnostic radiological imaging has been discovered in coronaviral pneumonia these findings demonstrate the disruption of pulmonary parenchyma interstitial inflammation and consolidations the ct scan is a preliminary diagnostic approach in covid19 suspected patients with viral pneumonia the typical ct findings include involvement of the lower respiratory tract bilateral and peripheral pure groundglass opacities ggos or combined with consolidations mainly in the subpleural site in the lower lobes and crazypaving patterns thickening the interlobular septa and intralobular lines accompanied by ggos generally bilateral ggos and consolidations in the chest imaging of the patients with clinical symptoms would confirm the diagnosis of the covid19 however normal imaging would not exclude the diagnosis of the covid19 completely kanne 2020 it is worth noting that the related ct lesions increase within the first 10 weeks especially 913 days after infection onset after that a plateau phase happens and reduction in lesions occurs gradually kanne little chung elicker  ketai 2020 pan ye et al 2020 evaluated the imaging findings of 21 rtpcr confirmed covid19 patients by serial ct scan with a 4 days interval on the basis of their reports four stages of the lung involvement are described based on ct findings of the covid19 recovered patients as follows
1earlystage 04 days at this stage some patients may have no ct findings however the next pulmonary cts would demonstrate changes the main abnormalities in this stage are ggos which are allocated unilateralbilateral subpleural in the lower lobes2progressive stage 58 days at this stage the ggos are distributed multifocally in other lobes also consolidations and crazypaving patterns are identified in this stage3peak stage 913 days at this stage the peak involvement of the lungs occurs the ct findings of this stage are diffuse ggos and consolidations residual pulmonary bands and crazypaving patterns4absorption stage 14 days at this stage the absorption and healing process starts it seems that the viral infection is controlled the crazypaving pattern and consolidations do not exist anymore however diffuse ggos may be present as a characteristic of absorbed consolidations
these stages demonstrate that the severity of the lung lesions happens in the first 10 days of ct infection the improvement of the ct findings initiates at least 14 days after the initial symptoms huang et al reported on the clinical epidemiological laboratory and imaging results of 41 covid19 confirmed chinese patients the reports showed the lung involvement of all patients on admission accordingly 40 out of 41 patients 98 had bilateral pulmonary involvement in imaging the chest ct images of the icuadmitted patients showed bilateral lobular consolidations however the chest ct images of the patients out of icu showed bilateral ggos it is worth noting that the consolidations were resolved in later chest cts but the ggos remained c huang et al 2020 song et al 2020 investigated the clinical symptoms laboratory results and chest ct findings in 51 suspected patients according to their reports 77 of patients had only ggos in their imaging 55 had consolidations alone in their ct and 59 had ggo and consolidations simultaneously moreover they reported that patients older than 50 years exhibited more consolidated lung abnormalities among those patients 86 showed bilateral pulmonary involvement also 86 of patients had peripheral lung involvement furthermore the chest ct followup illustrated a 54 improvement and a 31 progression in contrast as a consequence a case with clinical symptoms combined with positive exposure contact which had bilateral and peripheral ggo andor consolidations on ct would be highly suspect for having covid19 lung involvement chung and bernheim 2020 reported the initial ct findings of 21 covid19 patients from three hospitals of three provinces in china three patients 14 had a normal ct scan of the 18 patients the affected lobes were seen as follows one affected lobe in one 5 two affected lobes in two 10 three affected lobes in three 14 four affected lobes in four 19 and five affected lobes in eight 38 the most involved lobe in the initial ct included the right lower lobe in 76 the left upper lobe in 67 the left lower lobe in 67 the right upper lobe in 67 and the right middle lobe in 57 of the 18 patients with lung involvement 16 had bilateral opacities and 2 had unilateral lung opacities the right lung was involved in both groups moreover ggos 57 consolidations 29 a linear abnormality 14 the crazypaving pattern 19 and the peripheral distribution of viral pneumonia 21 were found in patients also they have reported that none of the patients ct had lymphadenopathy pleural effusion cavitation pulmonary emphysema fibrosis and pulmonary nodulesbernheim et al 2020 evaluated the typical ct findings of 121 suspected patients which were related to the time between the onset of the clinical symptoms and the first screening ct scan as a result 2036 patients 56 who had undergone ct imaging 02 days after the onset of clinical symptoms had normal ct they reported that bilateral lung involvement was seen in 1036 28 early patients 2533 76 intermediate patients taking ct 35 days after the onset of the clinical symptoms and 2225 88 late patients taking ct 612 days after the onset of the clinical symptoms it seems that the unilateralbilateral peripheral lung involvement in covid19 patients occurs long time after the onset of the symptomsw yang et al 2020 evaluated the clinical and imaging findings of 149 patients the imaging findings reports demonstrate that lung involvement is more localized in peripheral 359 than central 215 regions likewise the lesions are more in a patchy shape 3935 than oval 66 moreover the results showed that 17 of the 149 patients had normal initial ct findings the chest ct findings of 5 patients turned positive in 7 days but the imaging manifestations of the residual 12 patients remained negative it seems that the absence of imaging findings on ct in covid19 suspected patients could not exclude a patient from the diagnosisng et al 2020 analyzed the radiological findings in the chest radiograph cxr and ct of the 21 covid19 confirmed patients from four previous publications two patients had normal ct findings the predominant imaging abnormality in 19 residual patients was ggo all the ggos and occasional consolidations were in peripheral locations of the lungs except from one patient that had groundglass involvement in the perihilar site also some changes such as pleural effusion pericardial effusion enlargement of mediastinal andor hilar lymph nodes and cavitation were absent in the radiological findings of the patients also they reported that the most involved lobe was the left lower lobe 81 the left upper lobe and the right lower lobe were the same 76 and the involvement of the right middle lobe was less than the others 48 they further reported the cxr findings of five patients which had ct two cxr were normal despite the imaging abnormalities on their ct the remaining three cxrs demonstrated vague lung involvement while their respective cts had shown peripheral lesions yoon et al 2020 evaluated the imaging findings of cxr and ct of the nine covid19 korean patients their reports showed that the ct manifestations of covid19 pneumonia include bilateral and peripheral pure ggo sometimes mixed with occasional consolidations they also reported the obscure radiological findings on cxrs of the patients accordingly ct would be more sensitive for covid19 investigation compared with cxr therefore clinicians and radiologists need to become acquainted with the radiological findings of covid19 pneumonia based on ct images to control the outbreak of the disease successfullyadditionally we should consider that the imaging manifestation of the covid19 is similar to other viral pneumonia bacterial pneumonia and some other lesions sometimes there are challenges in differentiating covid19 from other underlying lung abnormalities by imaging manifestations alone so clinical symptoms laboratory screening tests and the contact history with confirmed patients accompanied by ct would result in the final diagnosis dai  zhang 2020 besides this from one report of the published literature highresolution ct has been suggested to differentiate covid19 lung involvement from other differential diagnoses l chen et al 2020 eventually the final diagnosis of the positive imaging findings on ct laboratory tests clinical symptoms should be verified by positive rtpcr or gene sequencing studies with regard to attention to the ct manifestations of the disease radiologists have a pivotal role in the early and rapid detection of suspected cases thus a chest ct scan is an accessible method that can create a quick imaging diagnosis in patients with clinical symptoms hence the chest ct scan should be performed as soon as possible to detect most covid19 patients at an early stage this would accelerate the isolation process of covid19 patients and also benefit the general populations health statefrom decades ago pooling diagnostic tests have been developed to optimize detection time save on reagents and quickly detect large numbers of suspicious or contaminated cases in infectious disease beneficially intricate equipment and additional training are not required in the use of these tests nguyen bish  aprahamian 2018 pooling has been evidenced for rtqpcr which would allow to rtpcr to detect the lowconcentration rna with further optimization arnold et al 2013 in this context yelin et al 2020 conducted a study to investigate the efficacy of standard rtqpcr in distinguishing a single positive sample within a pool of negative samples using five positive samples and 67 negative samples first they solely confirmed the rna positive samples then combined them with a large number of negative samples which were previously confirmed interestingly they could detect the positive samples in pools of up to 32 samples which could be detected in even up to 64 samples with extra pcr cycles a 10 falsenegative rate was estimated using this technique promisingly this diagnostic pooling test could be used in clinical testing laboratories for detecting the covid19 infected cases furthermore it can lead to broadening the screening capacities and community detection of suspicious or infected individualsdespite the benefits of the rrtpcr technique there are some limitations such as requiring expensive instruments trained experts long procedures high falsenegative results and importantly high risk of disease spread to solve these restrictions the jinzhao song research team proposed using an alternative rapid test with some advantages such as low cost easy usage high sensitivity and the possibility of use at home eltholoth bau  song 2020 in this study a novel closedtube covid19 assay pennramp comprised of a twostage isothermal double stranded dna amplification method was presented to amplify and detect the nucleic acid of the pathogen this diagnostic procedure was designed to simplify the detection of positive cases in a single tube reaction using both recombinase polymerase amplification rpa and loopmediated isothermal amplification lamp techniques in a single tubeit should be noted that there is a possibility of a positive rtpcr result in covid19 recovered patients with this point of view a study evaluated four treated covid19 patients from wuhan china by rrtpcr to confirm whether they could return to work the patients recovery was confirmed by rehabilitation criteria including normal temperature over 3 days relieved respiratory difficulties and confirmed ct imaging based on recovered acute exudative lesions finally confirmation of two separated negative rtpcr results led to hospital discharge and discontinuation of quarantine accordingly rtpcr assays were carried out on throat swabs of patients using biogerm kits 513 days after hospital discharge and discontinuation of quarantine all of which were positive lan et al 2020 surprisingly the results revealed that a proportion of rehabilitated patients can be virus carriers and should continue the quarantine protocol for about 5 days more also the rtpcr assay should be reevaluated to confirm the complete remission of treated patientsaccording to a report in one sarscov2 infected patient with both rtqpcr and ngs the positive results were not confirmedby rtqpcr testing within 3 weeks before obtaining the balf wang et al 2020 this data suggests the high fnr or inconsistency of rtpcr assays which significantly affects the efficacy of the detection of positives cases for example variation in viral rna sequences may affect the primers in the detection of the orf1b and n genes which leads to falsenegative results additionally various infection conditions in patients the natural history of the disease viral load alteration in different anatomic sites and diverse sampling processes with different accuraciesare the other reasons related to the high fnr urgent measures should be usedto optimize appropriate and accurate diagnostic tests as well as the standard operating procedure sop for example the recommendation of using the lower respiratory tract specimens sputum and balf and the nasopharyngeal swab would reduce the fnr y wang et al 2020 moreover paying more attention to related parameters ofthe rtpcr assay including sample reagents transportation and laboratory sop would decrease the high fnr for instance trisol is a key reagent that should be considered due to the application in protecting the stability of rna samples and inactivation of viruses as a suggestion according to previously published studies combinational diagnosis based on using the clinical features laboratory tests ct imaging rtpcr and ngs testing may be more beneficial foraccurate diagnosis of infected patientslaboratory screening tests laboratory findings based on assessing the biological and chemical factors in blood would be helpful for better determination of covid19 infected patients although they do not have higher specificity and sensitivity table 3 for this purpose the complete blood count as well as blood biochemistry measurement should be carried out for each patient according to published results the different common laboratory abnormalities which have been found in sarscov2 cases are as follows low count of white cells leukopenia lower than 1000 a low percentage of lymphocytes lymphopenia decreased level of albumin hypoalbuminemia increased levels of creactive protein crp and erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr c huang et al 2020 moreover there are elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase ast and alanine aminotransferase alt in infected patients due to the abnormal function of the liver increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase ldh and creatine phosphokinase cpk due to myocardial zymogram abnormality have been reported as well moreover a higher level of ddimer was also detected in patients with severe conditions bangash patel  parekh 2020 f zhou et al 2020 the procalcitonin level is mostly normal in covid19 patients but a higherlevel was reported in bacterial coinfectionincreased levels of pro and inflammatory cytokines in the serum of infected covid19 patients also were reported in several studies which is considered as the main reason for the cytokine storm c huang et al 2020 in addition to the laboratory findings as mentioned above detecting the lymphocyte subsets and their levels in the blood samples of patients would provide valuable information for better diagnosis of infection in a study wan et al 2020 indicated the reduced levels of tcell subsets the reduction rates of cd4 t cells were 5290 and 9524 in the mild and severe group of patients respectively moreover cd8 t cells were responsible for 2840 and 6190 reduction rates in the mild and severe groups respectively these data suggest that t lymphocytes were significantly reduced in covid19 infected patients also b cells indicated a 2549 and 2857 reduction ratio in the mild and severe groups respectively notably the limited activity of natural killer nk cells in infected cases was evidenced in the mild and severe group of patients with a 3431 and 4762 reduction ratio respectively furthermore evaluation of proinflammatory cytokines including tnf il1b il7 il8 il9 il10 mip1a mip1b mcp1 ip10 gmcsf interleukin1 receptor antagonist il1ra interferon granulocyte colonystimulating factor gcsf fibroblast growth factor fgf vascular endothelial growth factor plateletderived growth factor in plasma of icu and nonicu patients showed increased amounts compared with the healthy individuals moreover icu patients indicated greater levels of tnf ip10 mip1a mcp1 gcsf il2 il7 and il10 than nonicu patients the higher levels of the mentioned cytokines were correlated with the cytokine storm pulmonary inflammation and lung injuryin a systematic review and metaanalysis study pormohammad et al 2020 investigating the available laboratory data among 2361 sarscov2 patients the results demonstrated 133 leukocytosis 26 leukopenia and 625 lymphopenia furthermore among 2200 patients increased levels of platelets thrombocytosis and crp were reported in 91 and 81 of patients respectively also a case report study by w han et al 2020 reported the clinical diagnosis and alteration of clinical parameters in a 47yearold man infected by covid19 from wuweian the findings revealed an increased level of crp 84 mgl reduced levels of lymphocytes lymphopenia and a slight increase in neutrophil numbers fibrinogen and lactic dehydrogenase 230 ulanother systematic review and metaanalysis investigated the clinical laboratory and imaging features of covid19 patients in 18 studies accordingly the findings reported lymphopenia 431 higher levels of crp 583 and esr 418 a decreased level of albumin 758 and an increased level of ldh 57 rodriguezmorales et al 2020 y liu et al 2020 investigated the correlation between clinical and biochemical indexes and viral loads and lung injury in 12 2019ncov infected patients from shenzhen china the murray score is considered as an index of the severity of acute lung injury in ards a greater score indicates a higher severity in ards patients the study findings revealed the positive correlation between the crp and ldh levels with murray scores however a negative correlation was observed between the albumin and lymphocyte counts with murray scores on the basis of these results a significant relationship can be predicted between severe acute lung injury in covid19 patients and high levels of crp and ldh as well as decreased levels of albumin hypoalbuminemia lymphocyte counts lymphopenia and the percentage of lymphocytes and neutrophils consequently despite the nonspecific findings of blood count and parameters in diagnosing covid19 infected patients these laboratory findings would be helpful in early detection of infected cases in combination with highly specific and sensitive approaches such as ct imaging and rtpcr assayfollowing the exposure to sarscov2 the host immune system releases the igm and igg antibodies against the virus first igm appears in the initial exposure to response to sarscov2 antigens and is involved in the primary immune responses however igg is also engaged in secondary immune responses igm is the first produced antibody with low concentration low affinity and limited maintenance time which is disappeared at the end of the infection contrarily igg is later secreted with high concentration affinity and maintenance time and also persists after infection recovery accordingly igm detection indicates acute infection and igg is a diagnostic index of previous middle or late infection thereby developing elisa tests for detecting these antisarscov2 antibodies would help early detection of positive cases at least a few weeks after infection onset interestingly a large number of suspected cases can be identified in a short time with simple facilities and acceptable sensitivityspecificity rates as well as a low rate of falsenegative resultsin one study w zhang et al 2020 investigated the dynamic alterations of viral presence in both oral and anal swabs derived from covid19 patients who received medical treatments for about 10 days they evaluated the presence of both viral antibody and viral nucleotide levels based on a previously established method both igm and igg in all 39 sarscov2 patients were detected 5 days after infection onset which was undetectable on day 0 as a result the positive rate of igm was enhanced from 50 to 81 and igg reached from 81 to 100xiang et al 2020 conducted the elisa test on 63 covid19 infected patients admitted to jinyintan hospital in wuhan hubei serum samples of patients were assessed by igm capture elisa and igg indirect elisa the study findings revealed that igm was positive in 28 of 63 samples with 643 accuracy 444 sensitivity and 100 specificity also the sample detection of 52 cases indicates a positive igg result with 8254 sensitivity 100 specificity and 888 accuracy moreover 873 sensitivity was obtained using the combinational detection of igm and igganother study by liu liu wang and zheng 2020 was performed to analyze the diagnostic values of igm and igg antibodies against the n protein of sarscov2 in 238 hospital admitted patients with confirmed or suspected sarscovid19 infection surprisingly the elisa findings indicated that suspected cases were positively contaminated by sarscov2 they also detected the igm and igg in 194 cases with a 815 positive rate which was considerably more than the rtpcr assay 643 additionally it was found that elisa detected suspected patients who had negative rtpcr results with a 788 positive rate for igm and iggw liu et al 2020 measured the produced igm and igg antibodies against nucleocapsid protein rn and spike protein rs of sarscov2 in 214 covid19 confirmed patients using the elisa successfully rnbased igm and igg were detected in 682 and 701 of patients respectively besides this rsbased igm and igg were discovered in 771 and 743 of patients respectively findings also reported that positive rates of igmigg were 804 and 822 for rn and rsbased detections respectively furthermore it was found that rsbased detection of igm had a higher sensitivity than rnbased detectionin an investigation by amanat et al 2020 elisa was developed using recombinant antigens originating from the spike protein sp of sarscov2 they showed that screening and identification of covid19 seroconverters were possible as early as 3 days following the symptom onset with high sensitivity and specificity as expected no reactivity was observed in individuals who were not exposed to sarscov2 and were completely naive for sp by reliance on these details exposedimmune and naive people can be easily distinguished in a related study by stadlbauer et al 2020 a detailed protocol was provided for the expression of antigens derived from the spike protein that can be used as a substrate for setting up elisa and other immunological assays they claimed that the presented protocol was adapted to local needs including research diagnostic and clinical laboratories with respect to the applications of elisa in detecting the antisarscov2 igmigg antibodies based on the findings mentioned above it is considered as an applicable serological assay for the detection of covid19 with high sensitivity and specificityin one study long et al 2020 designed a study to investigate the profile of the acute antibody responses through a crosssection analysis of 285 patients and a followup study of 63 patients they assessed the application of the antibody assay as a facilitated diagnostic approach to identify the covid19 infection in both suspicious and asymptomatic close contact cases a mclia kit was used to detect the antisarscov2 igm and igg in the plasma samples based on doubleantibodies sandwich immunoassay using an automated magnetic chemiluminescence analyzer accordingly 1719 days following the onset of symptoms the positive rate of igg was 100 whereas after 2022 days the igm had an around 941 positive rate they also found that the igm and igg titers were gradually increased within 3 weeks after onset of the symptoms however igm indicated a slight decrease after more than 3 weeks moreover it was understood that in patients with a severe condition igg and igm titers were more remarkable than those with the nonsevere condition on the basis of the crosssection analysis and the followup study the findings demonstrated that igg and igm seroconversion were detected in all covid19 confirmed cases 20 days after onset of the symptoms as a consequence they found that the elimination of sarscov2 infection could be confirmed due to the under detectable igm and igg in patients 20 days after symptom initiation and 23 days after exposureanother potent and useful diagnostic serologic immunoassay is the gica which is beneficial for the early detection of covid19 patients the gica technique is based on the specific antigenantibody immunoreactions which is completed within 30 min without requiring intricate equipment and procedures in this context xiang et al 2020 figured out the antisarscov2 igm and igg antibodies using the rapid gica kits in the serum samples of 91 patients results unraveled that igm and igg were positive in 52 and 74 patients respectively in detail 571 sensitivity 100 specificity and 69 accuracy were reported for the igm detecting test also 813 sensitivity 100 specificity and 865 accuracy was obtained for igg detection interestingly the combined detection of igm and igg accounted for 824 sensitivityin another investigation pan li et al 2020 applied the gica assay to detect the igm and igg in infected patients confirmed with rtpcr as a result igm and igg have a relatively low positive rate in the early stages of the disease but gradually increased within the disease progression accordingly the igm positive rate in the early middle and late stages of the disease was 111 786 and 742 respectively moreover the positive rate of igg in the early middle and late stages of the disease was 36 571 and 968 respectively noteworthily combined detection of igm and igg by gica demonstrated the 929 positive rate in the middle stage of the diseaseas for advantages the gica assay has shown high sensitivity particularly 7 days after infection onset in detecting patients with a negative nuclearacid diagnostic it is completed within 15 min without requiring specialist equipment and procedures the gica assay can be utilized with high adoption in areas with limited diagnostic capacity on the basis of this it is recommended to use the gica as a supplementary diagnostic approach it is known as a sensitive complementary and early detection assay despite the mentioned advantages gica provides only qualitative findingsthe lfa a qualitative immunoassay is another potent serological technology used to detect the covid19 infected cases with a rapid simple and lowcost procedure lfa acts based on a paperbased platform for quantifying multiple analytes in a sample within 530 min accordingly it can be employed to detect the presence or absence of the antisarscov2 igm and igg antibodies in blood samples of patients within 15 min simultaneously moreover due to good adoption lfa can be widely used in remote regions developing countries and small laboratories koczula  gallotta 2016 wang et al z li et al 2020 designed a study to detect the igm and igg antibodies in blood samples of 397 clinically positive and 128 clinically negative covid19 patients using the igmigg combined antibody test point of care lfa kit as a result they reported 8866 sensitivity and 9063 specificity for overall testing additionally they found that both igm and igg antibodies were positive in 6448 of patients however false positive and false negative results were also observed using this techniquenucleic acidbased molecular tests and antibody assays have been applied for detecting the sarscov2 infection however a viral antigen has not been developed to identify the infection viral antigens derived from virus proteins are known as specific indications of the virus which appear before the antibodies therefore diagnosing viral antigens would facilitate the rapid screening and diagnosis of infection to prevent virus outbreak and increase survival of patients to recognize the human coronaviruses diseases hcovs utilizing the rapid antigen tests provides an infection diagnosis by a short time low cost and simple equipment procedure unfortunately the low sensitivity of the antigen rapid test limits the broader usage which has been evidenced in the detection of the influenza viruses y chen et al 2016 sastre et al 2011 interestingly to enhance the efficacy of antigen rapid test to detect the sarscov2 and other respiratory viruses colloidal goldlabeled igg can be employed as a diagnostic elementaccording to a study conducted for an antigen rapid test the findings demonstrated the high sensitivity of detecting the n antigen derived from sarscov in the early stages of the infection which was a useful early diagnostic approach for sarscov che et al 2004 di et al 2005 in a prepeer reviewed study diao et al 2020 a cohort of 239 participants with suspected sarscov2 infection was included to detect the viral antigen accordingly the nucleocapsid protein np of sarscov2 was evaluated in nasopharyngeal swab and urine sample within 10 minutes using a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay in this method the nucleic acid test and the nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test were considered as the reference standards for detecting the np in nasopharyngeal swab and urine samples respectively as a result in 141 of 208 patients with positive covid19 nucleic acid results the n antigen was detected with 68 sensitivity likewise in 31 patients with negative nucleic acid tests the n protein was negative with 100 specificity the findings also revealed 72 accuracy total coincidence rate of this antigen rapid test in addition they found that 736 of patients were diagnosed through the detection of n protein in the urine samples consequently the results of this study indicated 94 and 78 sensitivity for n antigen detection in the first 5 days and 610 days after infection onset respectively as a consequence antigen rapid tests can be employed as early rapid accurate and simple diagnostic approaches for covid19 infectionimmunoassay techniques have been developed for the quantitative semiquantitative or qualitative detection of the analytes immunoassays have multiple functional aspects including clinical diagnosis environmental monitoring food testing and biopharmaceutical analysis the direct fluorescent antibody dfa test the microneutralization mn assay np detection assay immunofluorescence assay ifa semiconductor quantum dots qds and protein chip are some examples of immunoassays carried out to detect the concentration of the analytes based on antigenantibody reactions chan et al 2013 roh  jo 2011 accordingly immunoassays can detect related antigens or antibodies of coronavirus and determine the antigenantibody interactions despite the benefits of these simple and rapid immunoassay techniques low sensitivity and specificity have limited their usage however they can be applied as rapid and available diagnostic methods to assist in the early detection of covid19neutralizing antibodies nabs are vital immune factors produced against viral diseases which have principal roles in virus clearance protection and recovery of infected patients according to previously published results the detection of nabs is considered as a gold standard evaluation of antiviral vaccines against polio influenza and smallpox infections and plasma therapy in ebola influenza and sarscov infections van griensven et al 2016 wong dai wu  sung 2003 b zhou zhong  guan 2007 to develop vaccines or transfusion of convalescent plasma for prophylaxis or treating covid19 patients sarscov2specific nabs can be detected in the plasma of recovered patients using the pseudotypedlentiviralvectorbased neutralization assay a sensitive and reproducible test casadevall  pirofski 2020 in one study f wu et al 2020 measured the antisarscov2 nabs in the plasma of 175 adult covid19 recovered patients with common or mild conditions performing the pseudovirus neutralization assay to investigate the correlation between clinical features of infected patients and nabs levels as for results mediumlow id50 500999 mediumhigh id50 10002500 and high id50  2500 levels of nab titers were found in around 17 39 and 14 studied cases respectively however 30 of them have decreased levels of nab titers id50  500 and ten of them have nab titers below the limit of the detection id50  40 moreover they showed that there is a positive correlation between antisarscov2 nabs and crp level whereas no significant association was observed between nabs titers and lymphocyte count in older covid19 recovered patients consequently evaluating the nabs against sarscov2 would provide an understanding of whether they could protect the patients from disease progression and help develop the immunebased treatments like vaccines and plasma infusionaccording to the low viral load of the virus and the high falsenegative rate of the rtpcr results at the initial stages of the disease it is required to screen the suspected patients with ct images fang et al analyzed the sensitivity rate of covid19 lung involvement on chest ct and detection of the virus nucleic acid by rtpcr they reported that the sensitivity of the ct 98 is higher than rtpcr 71 p  001 the reasons for the low effectiveness of the rtpcr approach may be as follows inapplicable clinical sampling rudimentary improvement of nucleic acid detection by rtpcr differences in the detection rate of various companies and low viral load this study has supported the idea of using the chest ct in the early stages to screen suspected patients especially those who have negative rtpcr results fang et al 2020 xie et al 2020 followed five covid19 suspected patients with initial negative rtpcr test results the radiological findings on ct represented ggo andor consolidations they isolated the mentioned patients eventually repeated swab tests and ct scans led to the covid19 confirmed state so it was beneficial to examine the highly suspicious patients with repeated swab tests especially while they had initial negative rtpcr results ai et al 2020 compared the two ct and rtpcr methods in 1014 patients with clinical symptoms as a result 6011014 patients 59 had positive rtpcr results for covid19 and 8881014 patients 88 had positive imaging findings on ct their reports have demonstrated the higher sensitivity rate of ct diagnosis compares to initial rtpcr the serial analysis of rtpcr and ct scans proved that 6093 of the patients had serial positive imaging manifestations for covid19 on ct before the rtpcr tests became positive also the followup ct scans show a recovery process of 42 in the patients before the rtpcr results became negativeearly and accurate detection of positive infected cases is a critical issue in managing the spread of covid19 rtpcr assays are required for confirming the infection however considering the related limitations serological tests may lead to better diagnosis of positive cases for this reason detecting the serum specific antibodies of sarscov2 by elisa technique is recommended due to the capability of tracing immune responses against the virus short time procedure and requiring simple facilities serological tests have potent applications in early diagnosis of infection the advantages of serological assays based on antibody detection include less falsenegative results indicating past infections determining infection stage and estimating time since exposure this means that antibody tests can be used to determine whether a patient with no symptoms has previously had covid19 and could thus be immuneprotected to it as igm can be detected in 3 days after infection onset in most infections it confirms the advantage of early detection of the serological tests compared with rtpcr also the importance of specimen quality for the serological assays is less stringent compared with rtpcr assays importantly falsenegative results derived from sampling quality are fewer in using antibodies for serological diagnosis xiao wu  liu 2020 on the basis of this it has been suggested that using serological assays provides the facility of early diagnosis of positive cases even with an improper sample collection and unsatisfied molecular examinationsas another benefit a broad scale of infection diagnosis is achieved using the elisa technique that detects the antibodies by automatic devices moreover elisa provides the feasibility of identifying a large number of infected cases in a quick turnaround time the other limitations of rnabased assays that led to the critical necessity to use elisa include requiring upscale and expensive lab facilities restrictive biosafety levels low or middle detection sensitivity and specificity different sampling locations and technical experts another essential issue is the ease of using serological tests in the clinical laboratory of any hospital as opposed to the molecular approach that requires a specific and wellequipped laboratory notably reporting on the very mild or asymptomatically infected cases as a large population without viral rnabased testing is another critical aspect that should be considered hence detection of the specific igg antibody as a largescale seroepidemiological study would help understand the true scale of humantohuman transmission and report the accurate rate of covid19 infected cases xiao et al 2020currently encouragingly fda approved the rapid qualitative test for the detection of the antisarscov2 igm and igg antibodies in serum plasma and venipuncture whole blood specimens of covid19 suspected cases the cellex qsarscov2 iggigm rapid acts based on a lateral chromatographic flow immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection and differentiation of antisarscov2 igm and igg antibodies us food  drug administration 2020 promisingly these types of applicable diagnostic tests would contribute to the early detection of infected or suspected cases and prevent the spread of the virusrecently the new abbott id now covid19 test has received emergency use authorization eua from the fda to detect the novel coronavirus sarscov2 as the fastest available molecular pointofcare test the abbott id now test is identified as a rapid isothermal and instrumentbased system that can be used for the qualitative identification of infections interestingly this approach has a unique isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology that provides molecular results in a short time which lets clinicians make evidencebased clinical decisions during a patient visit accordingly it has been reported that the abbott id now assay presents positive results in as few as 5 min and negative results within 13 min based on the rrtpcr assay moreover for the detection of influenza ab strep a and respiratory syncytial virus rsv id now is the pioneer molecular pointofcare platform abbott 2020with regardto the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019ncov worldwide arisen from wuhan china it is critically required to identifypractical strategies for precise diagnostic methods and appropriate treatment choices the rapid humantohuman transmission of sarscov2 even by asymptomatic carriers has led to an intensive health disaster the most common clinical manifestations of the disease are fever cough and dyspnea some complications such as ards acute kidney injury and liver damage may also occur during the process of the disease which can cause death subsequently additionally the elevated levels of pro and inflammatory cytokines elicit the cytokine storm phenomenon which has proved to be a prominent reason for respiratory system destructionthe typical laboratory abnormalities in covid19 patients include lymphopenia hypoalbuminemia and increased levels of crp esr ldh ast alt and ddimer although the characteristics of clinical features and abnormal laboratory finding results can guide healthcare workers toward a primary diagnosis the final detection of the covid19 patients is confirmed by spiral lung ct scans molecular assays and serological tests mostly bilateral and peripheral ggos andor occasional consolidations have been observed in radiological findings of lung involvements indisputably initial chest ct could be performed as a potential diagnostic modality in symptomatic cases especially at the early stages of the disease of note it should be considered that some suspected patients may have no ct findings therefore repeated ct imaging and other diagnostic techniques would assist in ruling out or confirming the suspected individuals the other applicable confirmation methods are rnabased molecular assays among which the rrtpcr test is a goldstandard approach despite the rapid and definite diagnosis of the infected cases highfnr lengthy procedure and the necessity of intricate equipment restricts the utilization of the rtpcr assays compared with ct imaging recently serological techniques have been developed as another quick diagnostic test based on detecting sarscov2specific igmigg antibodies with high sensitivity and specificity besides this it is worth noting that the accurate process of sample collection sampling clinical specimens from multiple sites and different detection rates of positive specimens should be considered to achieve the most accurate test results for covid19 diagnosis in conclusion the profound comprehension of various application aspects of the diagnostic approaches their advantages and disadvantages as well as their appropriate administration could lead to taking efficacious steps forward to prevent the virus outbreak manage the current pandemic state contribute to infected patients recovery and subsequently promote public

the condition adapted to a pandemic situation globally there are 5657529 confirmed cases of covid-19 which includes 356254 total deaths1 the report of ministry of national health services regulations and coordination field epidemiology and disease surveillance division fedsd national institute of health nih islamabad reported the current scenario of disease burden as a total of 64028 confirmed cases and death cases were 1317 till may 28 20202 while 40406 cases still had the status of active cases the disease spread in 213 countries and territories around the world3 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc have reported sars-cov-2 as a respiratory virus hence transmission is adhered to respiratory droplets when an infected or asymptomatic carrier coughs or sneezes and prevention is only possible by maintaining at least a six-foot distance between individuals the virus also spreads by close contact touching a surface or object that is already contaminated and then touching your own nose or mouth4 the most common symptoms of covid-19 are fever dry cough tiredness followed by less common symptoms such as aches sore throat diarrhea conjunctivitis headache and loss of taste or smell patients with serious symptoms observe difficulty breathing or shortness of breath chest pain or pressure loss of speech or movement in clinical settings5 developing countries needed

prof jinzhao song9 conducted a study in mid-february and reported a single and two-stage novel closed-tube covid-19 assay at home clinic or points of entry based on nucleic acid detection and amplification their method includes loop mediated isothermal amplification and is performed in a closed tube with calorimetric detection using bioinformatics tools they designed primers for the conserved region of the viral genome such as open reading frame 1ab orf1ab gene for higher sensitivity they address a two stage isothermal method known as dubbed penn-ramp9 they reported 10 times higher sensitivity with respect to lamp and pcr on purified processed nucleic acid however their study was performed on synthetic samples and requires actual patient samplesyang t et al6 reported their invention of a poc diagnostic device for covid-19 in their research paper published on 18 march 2020 they integrate the mobile phone with a paper-based poc testing device and also the method of pcr was loop mediated isothermal amplification the concept behind their method of nucleic acid detection was adopted from previous research10 they combine a paper-based poc device and lamp technology integrated to a mobile phone app as an accessible covid-19 diagnostic tool that a self-quarantined patent easily collects a nasal swab sample and performs this user-friendly test on such a device the result will be shared through the mobile app to clinicians or the public health concernedtrieu nguyen reported7 in their opinion report on 14 march 2020 about poc testing as paving the road for rapid detection of virus which proposed poc diagnostic as a potential candidate for detecting covid-19 as well as a response to the outbreaks they integrate a mobile phone app with loop mediated isothermal amplification technology lamp on a paper-based poc device lamp has the advantage of being highly sensitive easy and time efficient characterized by a reaction catalyzed in isothermal condition the technology uses strand displacement rather than the conventional heat denaturation principle and therefore the reaction has an advantage to be run on constant thermal environment lamp uses four different primers ie forward inner-outer primer and backward inner-outer primer which are complementary to the template sequence using strand displacement polymerases enzyme catalyze chain elongation with a displaced strand forming a cauliflower-like loop dumbbell structure these loop structures contain multiple sites for the initiation or synthesis of other copies by providing binding sites for another set of primers a swab sample containing covid-19 was transferred in tube and a specific reagent added for lamp reaction after the reaction the colorimetric reaction is detected on a mobile phone app specially designed to detect colorimetric changes on paper and the result is shared with the patient as well as with the public health department for epidemiologic surveillance having high sensitivity and specificity lamp technology is now a popular method in the detection of pathogens in molecular biologypoint-of-care poc testing devices are used for rapid and timely diagnosis for

healthcare-type settings in this era of public health emergency poc testing will significantly contribute towards low cost robust and economical diagnosis and the early detection of covid-19 as well as decreasing the cases of an infectious disease in controlling the outbreak a rapid accurate and cost-effective detection device with little requirement will benefit the individual and government by reducing transportation needs lowering the spread of infection as well as mitigating the cost of testingrapid and accurate testing significantly contributes towards epidemiologic surveillance and future outbreaks of such infectious diseases in-house testing of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr is endorsed by the who and cdc and adopted by many reference laboratories11 12 however in such a challenging time when health care resources are insufficient to combat the situation due to having increasing numbers of patients infected seeking care poc testing shall be regarded as essential for testing viral genome nucleic acid thereby reducing the chances of spreading the infection to distant areas and eluding the consequences of delayed reporting of infectious disease such as covid-19various studies reported the dramatic effect of late reporting of infectious disease as stated by elisabeth reijn et al13 that timely and accurate diagnosis will radically contribute towards effective public health response as well as averting secondary cases and outbreaks of infectious diseases timeliness for infectious diseases is an important factor as delay mostly occurs in a situation of referring the cases by the general practitioner or diagnosing cases to the local municipal health service netherlands health care providers are strictly gratified for reporting to the surveillance department of infectious diseases in order to control secondary cases and develop prevention guidelines and precautionary measures a poc device integrated with a mobile phone app for infectious disease creates a road map towards operative epidemiologic surveillance and public health intervention in the form of active or passive immunization or post exposure rehabilitation such as in the case of covid-19a highly reliable accurate diagnostic poc testing device with high sensitivity specificity positive predictive and negative predictive values is required in order to combat different infectious diseases in the future and in the current situation of the covid-19 pandemic in both developed and underdeveloped countries around the globe mobile phone integration with the testing device eliminates the transportation requisite economic burden and mitigates the spread of infection stakeholders should take the initiative of installing the project on large scale validity and reliability of a poc testing device with disposable kits for diagnosis of various infectious diseases having the capacity to deal with an extensive spectrum of clinical samplesthe authors have no conflict of interest to declarethis work received no specific grant from any funding agencycoronavirus disease-19 covid-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus cov that was originally reported in wuhan hubei province china in december 2019 world health organization 2020a the international committee on taxonomy of viruses named the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 infection by sars-cov-2 causes a respiratory illness that varies in severity from mild upper respiratory symptoms akin to the seasonal flu to severe progressive respiratory failure that requires intensive care and can lead to death asymptomatic carriers of the virus have also been reported and pose a significant public health threat due to their ability to unknowingly spread the virus chan et al 2020a sars-cov-2 represents the third cov in this millennium to cross species from animals to humans and cause a severe respiratory disease after middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 zaki et al 2012 and sars-cov in 2003 drosten et al 2003 ksiazek et al 2003 this novel cov has now been identified as the seventh cov that is transmissible between humans including hcov-229e hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1 salata et al 2019 on 30th january 2020 the world health organization who declared the sars-cov-2 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern and was upgraded to a pandemic on 11th march 2020 at least 4302774 confirmed cases and 289561 deaths worldwide were reported as of 12th may 2020 worldometersinfocoronavirus diagnostic testing is critical during a pandemic as the ability to track the spread of sars-cov-2 is essential for effective disease management and controlsars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna ssrna group iv virus the genome was sequenced from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a patient genbank mn908947 and shared through the global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid platform on 12th january 2020 wu et al 2020 the 30 k base pair genome is highly similar to the human sars-cov and bat cov-sars-like genomes with 14 open reading frames orfs that encode structural replication and non-structural accessory proteins as depicted in figure 1 molecular modeling studies demonstrate that like sars-cov sars-cov-2 is surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane containing structural membrane m and envelope e proteins that interact to form the viral envelope durrant et al 2020 this layer also contains spike glycoproteins s that give the characteristic corona appearance of this family of viruses the spike proteins bind specific host cell receptors to facilitate host cell attachment and entry graham and baric 2010 the nucleic acid-associated protein binds the rna genome and forms the nucleocapsid n other proteins include replication and non-structural accessory proteins that are listed in table 1 reports of different strains of sars-cov-2 suggest an early split from the sars-cov-2 lineage andor the virus is mutating ongoing research provides insight into the unique and conserved features of the genome and proteome of sars-cov-2 to track mutations and generates evidence about the evolution of the virus phan 2020 wang et al 2020 this is important as these changes may affect key structural and non-structural components of sars-cov-2 that can render some diagnostic tests ineffective or less sensitive and can also impact the selection of epitopes for the development of new teststhe spread of sars-cov-2 is primarily by respiratory droplets that arise from individuals that harbor the virus symptomatic individuals with the disease are one source of virus but a major public health concern is transmission by mildly ill or asymptomatic individuals during the incubation period rapid viral diagnostic testing for sars-cov-2 is critical to identify these individuals and facilitate the implementation of protective measures such as social distancing quarantine and isolation that help to mitigate the spread of the virus in the community the development of rapid and accurate tests that detect antibodies post-infection provide information about an individuals exposure to the virus and can be used to monitor the possibility of immunity relapse or reinfection this supports interventions to protect higher risk populations from developing more severe illness and can be used to investigate the efficacy of passive antibody therapies for covid-19 infection this review describes the available testing methods for sars-cov-2 and brings to light the importance of laboratory testing to control this disease and prepare for possible future disease threatsrna is extracted from clinical specimens using approved viral isolation kits corman et al 2020rna is reverse transcribed to cdna and subsequently amplified using a real-time quantitative pcr instrument who announced various primer and probe sets for sars-cov-2 previously developed in china germany hong kong japan thailand and usa world health organization 2020b table 2 primers targeting different sections of the virus genetic sequence including the envelope e gene the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene and the n gene chu et al 2020 corman et al 2020 world health organization 2020b targeting the e gene is reported for highest sensitivity followed by the rdrp gene for confirmation corman et al 2020 some laboratories have multiplexed pcr tests consisting of multiple primer and probe sets located at different regions in the sars-cov-2 genome these assays can be designed to contain primer sets targeting multiple genes simultaneously rdrphel s n chan et al 2020b or to detect different regions in a single target such as the n gene ufad administration 2020
table 2 the use of multiplex assays is potentially beneficial as this can improve sensitivity in cases of loss or degradation of viral rna during specimen collection and nucleic acid extraction or in the event of mutation of the virus genome these assays use in vitro synthesized rna derived from transcripts eg betacovwuhanwiv042019 gisaid access number epiisl402124 as positive controls and to generate standard curves an internal control using rnase p rp verifies the presence and quality of nucleic acid in samples and molecular grade nuclease-free water is used as a negative amplification control a negative patient sample serves both as a negative extraction control to monitor cross contamination across samples and to validate test reagentsrt-pcr is the frontline diagnostic test for covid-19 that is capable of analyzing thousands of specimens in a single day and shows a testing sensitivity of 95 corman et al 2020 the anticipated limit of detection of the sars-cov-2 rt-pcr test is 10 copiesreaction chu et al 2020 which allows early detection of low viral titers gene amplification indicates a positive result for the presence of sars-cov-2 rna and should correlate with clinical observations patient history and epidemiological informationfalse positive results could be generated by cross-reactivity of primers with nucleic acids arising from co-infection with other viruses or bacteria in these cases the agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease matching of the sars-cov-2 rt-pcr primers and probes using reliable libraries eg blast is necessary to ensure there is no homology with other covs like sars-cov from 2003 or other organisms such as staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans false positives can also occur if reagents in a laboratory become contaminated which is a major concern particularly with the high volume of testing encountered during a pandemic a negative patient sample is useful to identify this error in testingfalse-negative results could potentially arise from mutations occurring in the primer and probe target regions in the sars-cov-2 genome negative results do not preclude sars-cov-2 infection and results should be validated with different primer sets against the same gene target and combined with patient history and other clinical data to accurately determine patient infection statusprovisions for testing laboratories the use of approved tests and validation of results with governing authorities to develop master protocols for use by multiple investigators must be in place to achieve rapid testing capacity the output for number of tests per day and number of individuals tested per day relies on the laboratory capacity trained staff reagents supplies and equipment large quantities of specific high-grade reagents are needed to perform tests and supplies can be quickly depleted in a pandemic this impacts the turnaround time for rt-pcr diagnostic testing that ranges between 2 and 5 days strategies to rapidly scale up testing for novel hcovs must be considered for future diagnostic testingpurified rs or rn are immobilized to the surface of a multi-well-plate as capture antigens controls and inactivated sars-cov-2 serum samples are incubated with the antigen for sars-cov-2 antibody-antigen binding a labeled secondary antibody-conjugate eg horseradish peroxidase is bound to the sars-cov antibodies for signal detection by substrate addition and quantificationantibody tests provide the advantage of a simple method of detection of sars-cov-2 antibodies and are convenient to compare multiple samples from a single patient positive rates of detection for sars-cov-2 igg in patients by elisa measurements are 854 and 756931 for igm guo et al 2020 jin et al 2020 reported sensitivities of serum igm and igg antibodies for detection were 481 and 889 and specificities were 100 and 909 with the highest sensitivity for antibody tests recorded 2 weeks after first symptoms of disease the lower igm sensitivity may be because the igm response occurs early then decreases and does not offer a strong detectable signal while igg signals may be more readily detected and present beyond 20 days the incorporation of unique immunoglobulin labels may increase the sensitivity of rapid antibody tests for respiratory viruses li r et al 2018 results from antibody testing could inform infection status and define previous exposure to sars-cov-2 antibody detection is also used to identify recovered patients as human donors for the generation of convalescent patient serum or plasma as an investigational treatment for critically ill patients shen et al 2020the results of sars-cov-2 antibody tests may vary by apparent disease periods by time after symptom onset as well as on the reliability of diagnostic assays it is not yet known when igm or igg antibodies specific to the sars-cov-2 virus will become detectable during an infection how long antibodies persist following infection and the extent of protection of neutralizing antibodies against subsequent infection with the virusthe overall sensitivity and specificity indicate the possibility of false negatives and false positives in this testing method since the risk for recurrent infection with sars-cov-2 is not known for covid-19 detection of one or two antibodies igm andor igg does not necessarily guarantee immunity against reinfection negative results do not rule out sars-cov-2 infection particularly in those who have been in contact with the virus and positive results may be due to past or present infection with sars-cov guo et al 2020 and possibly non-sars-cov strains gaunt et al 2010 it will be critical to conduct stringent evaluation of antibody diagnostic assays to determine the accuracy and reliability of resultsrecombinant systems are routinely used to express recombinant proteins to develop antibody assays however protein-expression systems can result in significant discrepancies between recombinant and native viral proteins for example the use of e coli competent cells produces proteins that lack critical post-translational modifications in human cells eg glycosylation that can alter epitopes and protein conformation gupta and shukla 2018 consequently this can compromise sensitivity and specificity of antigens for diagnostic assays the use of mammalian expression systems to express recombinant proteins will produce antigens with post-translation modifications that more closely resemble human native proteins bandaranayake and almo 2014 leading to higher sensitivity and specificity of assaysserological assays are currently under accelerated development for diagnosis of hcov infections commercial reagents need to be validated by clinical trials using samples from patients with confirmed infections of sars-cov-2 and approved by the regulatory review process nonetheless a rapid and sensitive platform for identification of antibody titers will also support screening to identify and minimize the risk of viral spread to others as well as for epidemiological studies and vaccine evaluation studies the us fda allows the use of rapid antibody tests for sars-cov-2 under emergency use authorization eua this expedites the assessment and optimization of these diagnostic tests with the expectation that any test is sufficiently experimentally validated before it is made available to patients if these tests do not provide accurate results this can impair prevention efforts and delay appropriate treatment during the global pandemic responsetwo drops of blood are sufficient for detection of sars-cov-2 and antibodies by this method this technique delivers results in 15 min and uses visual detection by the naked eye in comparison to rt-pcr 25 days detection of antibodies shows previous viral exposure while detection of antigens indicates active carriers of sars-cov-2 virus the specificity and sensitivity of lifas are comparable for antibody and antigen assaystests to detect sars-cov-2 in patients by identifying viral antigens are more challenging to develop than tests to detect the neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 see below as purified monoclonal antibodies must be generated against target antigens further these assays need to be assessed and optimized using blood from infected patientsthe rapid development of some antigens for assays are led by the use of prototype pathogens and in silico models of antibodyantigen interactions that are used to generate artificial antibody libraries shao et al 2007 antibody phage display technology can be applied to discover antibodies against antigens ledsgaard et al 2018 these can be rapidly generated to produce prototypes of diagnostic tests for validation studies that expedite assessment and optimization before the final commercial diagnostic kits are available integrating fast portable tests with epidemiological surveillance will also provide quick and reliable information to public health authorities monitoring the spread of sars-cov-2several cell lines are suitable for sars-cov-2 transduction including vero monkey kidney cell line huh7 human hepatoma cell line 293t human kidney cell line nie et al 2020 serial dilutions of patient convalescent serum are added to known strains of virus betacovshenzhenszth-0032020 strain virus gisaid access number epiisl406594 shen et al 2020 the mixture is inoculated into a susceptible cell monolayer and incubated for virus adsorption the cytopathic effect can be measured by microscopic examination shen et al 2020 after a 5-day incubation or fluorescence nie et al 2020 or plaque formation following 24 h of incubation the neutralizing antibody titer is the highest dilution of serum that reduces activity of sars-cov-2the svn assay is a highly robust and reproducible test that may be applied to detect sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma samples to identify the best candidates for treatment neutralizing activities along with viral load and antibody titers can be simultaneously monitored in paired plasma samples in patients receiving convalescence plasma to establish algorithms for determining patient and donor factors that predict clinical efficacythe accessibility of the live sars-cov-2 strain is regulated which limits the development of laboratory testing by svn while inexpensive it is a manual assay and requires careful in-house standardization and quality controlthe preliminary case report of positive responses of 5 severely ill patients with covid-19 who were treated in the shenzhen third peoples hospital china using plasma from recovered individuals was recently published shen et al 2020 the convalescent plasma contained functional igg and igm antisars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies that inhibited viral growth in cell cultures notably the snv assay reliably measured the increases in the patients neutralizing antibody titers between 1 and 12 days after plasma transfusion this study was not evaluated in a randomized clinical trial and there are limitations to the data interpretation nonetheless these findings demonstrate the utility of the svn assay for evaluating antisars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies for future convalescent plasma assessment in more rigorous clinical investigations involving a larger cohort of patients with severe covid-19 illnessthis method amplifies dna or rna target sequence in a streamlined and exponential manner for detection and in contrast to pcr does not require thermal cycling a wide variety of nucleic acid detection assays have been developed including loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp a single-tube technique for the amplification of dna and reverse transcription-lamp that combines reverse transcriptase and lamp to detect rna rt-lamp notomi et al 2000 recombinase polymerase amplification rpa li j et al 2018 helicase-dependent amplification hda vincent et al 2004 strand displacement amplification sda walker et al 1992 and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification nasba compton 1991 these assays incorporate isothermal methods to enable primer binding followed by amplification using a polymerase with strand-displacement activity that separates the strand that is annealed to the target sequence for detection amplified gene products can be detected by photometry isothermal nucleic acid amplification is utilized in several commercial molecular diagnostic platforms and is considered the fastest available molecular laboratory and point-of-care test for the detection of novel sars-cov-2the rt-lamp method has been shown to effectively detect sars-cov-2 in clinical samples from individuals with covid-19 yan et al 2020 multiple loop primers targeting the orf1ab gene and the s gene were used for dna strand displacement activity and target amplification that achieved detection of 20 copiesreaction and 200 copiesreaction respectively these results were comparable to rt-pcr amplification the reported 100 sensitivity and 100 specificity and the mean time for detection was under 30 min demonstrates this is a definitive testing methodthis method detected total viral rna derived from cell culture supernatant and 19 nasopharyngeal swab samples 8 positive and 11 negative for sars-cov-2 behrmann et al 2020 this approach integrates isothermal methods for reverse transcription followed by recombinase activity that mediates primer targeting the n gene binding to the homologous sequence in dsdna subsequent amplification by polymerase mediated primer extension achieved 100 diagnostic sensitivity and specificity this method offers potential advantages over rt-pcr for speed scale and portability allowing evidence-based clinical decisions to be made during a patient visitthe crispr assay functionality is being applied for detection of dna or rna using nucleic acid pre-amplification combined with crispr-cas enzymology for specific recognition of sequencesthe crisprcas13a system is a recently discovered crispr-rna crrna guided detection method that is specific for rna and is being applied for sars-cov-2 detection a key feature of this approach is the cas13a formerly named c2c2 enzyme that recognizes and binds targeted rnas in a sequence-specific manner followed by non-specific trans-endonuclease cleavage of non-targeted rna collateral cleavage for signal amplification and nucleic acid detection the cas13a assay can be paired with target nucleic acid amplification for more sensitive results using an isothermal exponential amplification technique most commonly rpa this coupled technique is termed sherlock specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking and allows fluorescence colorimetric lateral flow and other readout approaches to enable the rapid detection of a variety of targets kellner et al 2019unlike in vivo crispr tools the cas13a protein must be recombinantly expressed and purified the endonuclease activity of purified cas13a uses crrna targeting sequences in the s gene and orf1ab in sars-cov-2 rna target site-recognition activates trans-cleavage of reporter probes resulting in increases in fluorescence output signals and confirming the presence of viral rna using synthetic sars-cov-2 the reported performance of this method for detection of target sequences is 20200 am kellner et al 2019 the cas13acrrna platform has been adapted for lateral-flow assays and could have wide applications as a sars-cov2 detector in both research and in the clinic assays can be designed as a paper dipstick test that delivers signals in 3060 min using this is a very promising technology and these positive advances in science offer immense hope for future disease controlrna is extracted from clinical specimens as for rt-pcr and further purified to remove human cytoplasmic and ribosomal rrnaregulating authorities provide interim guidance on the handling of specimens associated with sars-cov-2 cdc 2020b samples for testing can be performed in a bsl-2 laboratory with unidirectional airflow and bsl-3 precautions and respiratory protection and a designated area for personal protective equipment changes are recommended isolation of sars-cov-2 in cell culture and initial characterization of viral agents recovered in cultures of patient samples should be conducted at biosafety level 3 bsl-3 with regulatory approval and guidancefigure 2 and table 3 summarize the main laboratory tests for detection of components of sars-cov-2 and the humoral response to the virus and depict key features of these approaches given the public health emergency that the expanding covid-19 outbreak presents more widespread testing is needed to investigate the disease eg prevalence in the population severity in age groups and to identify individuals who are infected but have few or no symptoms detailed epidemiological data sets will better establish the rates of severe infection and death among infected populationsongoing research is critical to optimize existing antibody tests to determine whether immunity prevents recurrent infection and to investigate the efficacy of passive antibody therapies for covid-19 infection the identification of novel disease biomarkers may be valuable for understanding what makes people susceptible to covid-19 infection and in predicting the severity and progression of disease researchers could request approval to analyze stored samples of human blood or in animals that might be a natural reservoir of the virus specifically guidance would be needed to direct blood and plasma collection centers to allow access of samples from covid-19 patientsthe covid-19 pandemic showcases how quickly information needs to be shared as responders address rapidly evolving situations establishing communication across laboratories worldwide helps to develop master protocols and establish reference panels for use by multiple investigators this will aid in coordinating the collection and use of data and regulatory infrastructure having a range of tests also puts less pressure on one manufacturer or supply chain as different suppliers may use different materials this could help alleviate difficult decisions to limit testing to the most vulnerable patients which can have great public health consequencesrdc and vs contributed to concept and writing of manuscript ac contributed to writing and prepared tables and figure for this manuscriptthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestas the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic spreads specific rapid and practical diagnostic tests will become increasingly critical both for the control of the epidemic and for the management of patients at present outside east and southeast asia diagnosis depends on a clinical case definition that includes travel to or exposure to sick contacts who have traveled to specific parts of the world 1 as the epidemic matures however such epidemiologic connections will be increasingly difficult to demonstrate and a clinical case definition that depends on this information will become increasingly irrelevant in east and southeast asia the rapidly expanding epidemic makes specific viral diagnosis even more essential in such an evolving situation the report by poon et al from hong kong 2 in combination with the published diagnostic technologies of that group and others in europe and the united states 345 takes on extraordinary importance moreover the development and publication of a rapid test for the sars coronavirus in clinical samples just weeks after the first reports of the emergence of the disease 6 is extraordinaryas a historical footnote this technologic tour de force is in extreme contrast to the diagnostic tests that led to the first descriptions of coronaviruses over 35 years ago at that time the most rapid diagnosis was by production of cytopathic effect after subpassage in tissue culture 7 but most coronaviruses were recognized only with the use of human embryo tracheal organ cultures and viral presence was detected by cessation of ciliary motion by electron microscopy of nutrient media or most cumbersome of all by inoculation and production of colds in human volunteers 89 in fact difficulty of diagnosis has dogged the field of human coronaviruses and hampered progress throughout its historythe test described by poon et al 2 looks good it appears to become positive before antibodies first appear as we would expect from a sensitive test for virus in the limited studies described it performed quite well although not as well as we could have hoped sensitivity of 79 and specificity of 98 in relation to acute-to-convalescent seroconversion from melting curves it was judged that the viral sequence did not vary from patient to patient which bodes well for any pcr-based technique clearly the test requires validation in larger series of cases and non-cases to refine estimates of its performance this is particularly critical with regard to its specificity because rapid viral diagnosis is likely to play an extremely important role in areas where sars is not actively epidemic in such settings false positives have the potential to fuel panic and the test will be used much more often in those who do not have sars coronavirus infection than in those who do of almost equal importance will be the demonstration that the test can be exported to other laboratories without loss of sensitivity or specificityto judge the real value of this test and therefore to use it optimally we need much more information what are the best specimens to obtain from patients the germans found that sputum contained a far stronger pcr signal than upper respiratory tract samples 5 poon and his colleagues 2 tested only nasopharyngeal aspirates it could be that if sputum had been used instead the sensitivity of the test would have been closer to 100 when during the course of illness and infection do samples become positive when do they become negative what is the distribution of virus in the body is it in the blood when is it in the urine it appears to be present in the stool but there is almost no information on either the quantity or the timing and duration of sheddinga pcr-based diagnostic test for an infectious disease has advantages and disadvantages it can be expected to be very sensitive it allows a read-out in a matter of hours it also has the potential to be quantitative on the other hand it is expensive and it requires technology and trained technologists often not available in the locality of the disease in addition it says nothing about the infectiousness of the virus that is found like other tests for the virus however it can be anticipated that it will become positive early in the course of the illness allowing the guidance of therapeutic and management decisions as well as early institution of precautions to control contagion if it turns out that it is very sensitive during the course of the disease the value of a negative test may be even greater than that of a positive test in its capacity to relieve patient family and community anxietymoreover a test for virus can give valuable information for those trying to contain the epidemic both locally and globally this test as well as tests for infectious virus need to be applied to a large number of cases in a prospective manner to make educated guesses about when during the course of the illness infected individuals are likely to be contagious case reports of sars have described the presence of fever before the beginning of respiratory symptoms 1011 is virus in respiratory secretions at this stage is it there even before the fever begins in studies of the old coronaviruses in human volunteers virus could be isolated from nasal secretions before the onset of respiratory symptoms 12 is that true here the same questions can and should be asked about fecal sheddingwe already know that antibody to the sars coronavirus appears relatively late in the course of infection there is no information available yet however on the time of appearance of igm antibody and this may prove to be an important adjunctive test in the early identification of infectionsan ideal test for virus will be not only rapid sensitive and specific but also inexpensive and technologically simple so that it is available at the point of care even in small hospitals or in communities in the developing world no tests designed to detect virus in clinical samples have satisfied all these criteria but antigen detection tests probably come the closest the academic biotechnical and epidemiologic forces around the world should be frantically working to create specific and sensitive mono- and polyclonal antibodies to this virus and assembling antigen detection tests that will move us quickly into the next era of diagnosis specific diagnosis will help to lessen fear this test and those that follow it will make a major contribution to public health and the care of patients with respiratory infections as the sars coronavirus spreads through the worldon 17 april 2009 a novel triple-reassortant swine-origin influenza virus pandemic ah1n1 was identified by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc in 2 children living in adjacent counties in california 1 by 12 june 2009 this virus had caused an estimated 29669 cases of infection in 74 countries including 145 deaths worldwide 2 the world health organization raised the pandemic alert level to phase 6 on 11 june 2009rapid diagnosis of influenza is important for initiation of antiviral therapy and implementation of infection control strategies reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr is considered the reference test for diagnosis of influenza because of its high sensitivity and specificity as well as its rapid turnaround time however rt-pcr is expensive and requires trained expertise and batch testing which delays reporting pandemic ah1n1 rt-pcr is currently only available in designated reference or state laboratories adding to the turnaround time in addition the large number of requests for rt-pcr testing has stretched resources resulting in modified recommendations to test only severely ill persons or patients at risk of having serious complications 3because other respiratory viruses frequently cocirculate with influenza viruses and can cause similar symptoms diagnosing influenza on the basis of clinical presentation alone is difficult with reported sensitivity ranging from 38 4 to 79 5 rapid influenza antigen tests point-of-care tests might prove useful because they have a fast turnaround time 1015 min and require minimal training to perform however there are few data on the diagnostic accuracy of rapid influenza antigen tests for pandemic influenza ah1n1 virus 6 soon after the onset of the pandemic influenza ah1n1 outbreak we received reports of poor performance of rapid influenza antigen tests we report our findings of the clinical accuracy of 3 commonly used rapid influenza tests for diagnosis of pandemic ah1n1 influenza

results the majority of patients with pandemic ah1n1 influenza were children and young adults the median age was 125 years range 7 months to 58 years a total of 34 patients 57 were assessed in the emergency department and 26 patients 43 were seen in physicians offices twenty-two 65 of 34 patients evaluated in the emergency department were subsequently hospitalized information for the duration of illness before presentation was available for 38 of 60 patients the majority of patients 76 presented 3 days after developing symptoms influenza-like illness mean interval 28 days range 19 days control patients had a median age of 7 years range 4 months to 66 years 14 control patients 58 presented to the emergency department and 10 42 were outpatientsthe analytic performance of the 3 rapid antigen tests compared with that of the luminex xtag rvp are presented in table 1 the overall respective sensitivity and specificity of the bd directigen ez flu ab test were 467 28 of 60 specimens and 100 for the binaxnow influenza ab test 383 23 of 60 specimens and 100 and for the quickvue influenza ab test 533 32 of 60 specimens and 100 the quickvue influenza ab test was significantly more sensitive than the binaxnow influenza ab test p01 but there was no significant difference between the other rapid antigen tests during the study period the overall prevalence of pandemic ah1n1 virus was 179 95 confidence interval 824-276 among all specimens submitted for respiratory virus rt-pcr testing on the basis of this prevalence the calculated ppvs were 100 for all 3 tests and the calculated npvs were 896 882 and 908 for bd directigen ez flu ab test binaxnow influenza ab and quickvue influenza ab test respectively patient age and duration of symptoms prior to collection of the respiratory specimen did not correlate significantly with the results of rapid antigen tests p05 a higher mfi unit with rt-pcr which correlates with higher viral load was significantly associated with positive results for all rapid antigen tests p01 table 2
discussion rapid antigen tests are commonly used in many hospital laboratories emergency departments and doctors offices most influenza rapid antigen tests are lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays in which patient samples are applied to a chromatographic strip that contains monoclonal antibodies against influenza a and b viruses on-site diagnosis of influenza by point-of-care tests has been shown to limit antibiotic prescriptions use of blood cultures and chest radiography and ultimately to reduce patient costs 7 however rapid antigen tests have demonstrated a wide range of sensitivities for detection of seasonal influenza viruses ranging from 69-96 for the bd directigen ez flu ab test 8 9 649-73 for the binaxnow influenza ab test 8 10 and 197-85 for the quickvue influenza ab test 11 12we found that the 3 rapid antigen tests had low to modest sensitivities for diagnosis of pandemic influenza ah1n1 although all tests demonstrated excellent specificity with no cross-reactivity against other cocirculating respiratory viruses possible reasons for the low sensitivities in our study include the fact that the sample collection technique was not standardized and that specimens were refrigerated and only tested after completion of rt-pcr which may have led to antigen degradation however we think that this is unlikely because our findings are consistent with those of a similar study by ginocchio et al 6 in which rapid antigen tests had a sensitivity of only 178 for pandemic influenza ah1n1 virus compared with the luminex xtag rvp an alternative explanation may be related to differences in test sensitivity for detection of pandemic influenza ah1n1 virus compared with seasonal influenza viruses in a study that used titered pandemic influenza ah1n1 virus grown in cell cultures rapid antigen tests required 115-log higher viral loads than did human seasonal virus for a positive result 13other limitations of our study include the fact that we employed a known convenience sample of positive specimens because of the widespread interest regarding the clinical performance of rapid antigen tests for detection of pandemic influenza ah1n1 virus we used a convenience sample of positive specimens to allow for a quick yet relatively accurate assessment of these tests in addition all specimens were decoded and both investigators performing the tests were blinded to the rt-pcr results finally because the design of our study did not permit an accurate determination of the npv and ppv we calculated these values on the basis of the prevalence of novel influenza h1n1 during the study period these values would clearly vary according to the prevalence of disease and the ppv would be highest during the peak of an outbreak with increased numbers of false-positive results when disease prevalence is low table 1despite modest sensitivities rapid influenza antigen testing could prove to be useful because of the tests speed portability and ease of performance clinicians should be aware that patients presenting with an influenza-like illness and a negative rapid antigen test result should undergo further laboratory testing however a positive rapid antigen test result would allow presumptive diagnosis of novel influenza h1n1 virus infection and should lead to timely institution of infection control measures treatment and prophylaxis finally as we approach the 20092010 winter season it is desirable for manufacturers to develop sensitive rapid antigen kits that can also differentiate seasonal influenza a viruses from pandemic influenza ah1n1 virus in view of their different antiviral susceptibilitiesfrom late december 2019 coronavirus infectious disease covid19 epidemics spread from wuhan china to all over the world including italy

 vivadiag covid19 igmigg rapid test revealed a very poor sensitivity less than 20 indeed the majority of patients that tested positive for covid19 by realtime rtpcr would have been identified as

samples sp rb and fm discussed results fb conceived the studyviruses are responsible for a large proportion of lrtis in children but antibiotics are often prescribed for viral illnesses in addition viral infections cause the majority of febrile episodes in infants 3 months of age 5 however because of the inability to accurately identify the minority of infants who have serious bacterial infections the majority of febrile infants are hospitalized and receive antibiotics existing viral diagnostics such as enzyme immunoassaybased rapid tests are limited in sensitivity and detect only influenza and rsv or in the case of direct fluorescent antibody detection and shell vial culture require a sophisticated virology laboratory furthermore several of the newer pathogens do not grow well in culturebetter diagnostic tests that establish the cause of lrtis in children have the potential to both reduce overall antibiotic use and to improve the targeted use of antibiotics in addition rapid identification of viral infections can help control nosocomial transmission studies using currently approved rapid tests or direct fluorescent antibody testing despite the limitations of these methods have already demonstrated improvements in clinical practice 510bronchiolitis is a disease in children 2 years of age that is characterized by acute inflammation edema and necrosis of epithelial cells lining small airways and increased mucus production leading to bronchospasm wheezing hyperexpansion of the lungs and hypoxia bronchiolitis causes 120000 hospitalizations in infants 1 year of age annually up to 3 of infants are hospitalized for bronchiolitis annually 11 rsv is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and is detected in 4374 of cases however other viruses can cause bronchiolitis and are clinically indistinguishable from rsv-induced disease including parainfluenza virus adenovirus rhinovirus hmpv coronavirus and bocavirus 12 13 with polymerase chain reaction pcrbased testing coinfection with 2 viruses has been detected in 23 of children thus the potential for nosocomial transmission of a variety of viruses among children hospitalized for bronchiolitis is very high diagnostic testing has the potential to influence cohorting clinical management and the prevention of health careassociated infections 13 14community-acquired pneumonia cap is an important cause of morbidity and hospitalization in children in developed countries and one of the leading causes of death in children in the less developed countries 15 the large number of established and emerging pathogens that cause pneumonia and the difficulty of determining the microbial cause complicate the management of pneumonia in children in addition it is difficult to obtain adequate specimens from the lower respiratory tract and nasopharyngeal carriage of potential pathogens is common in healthy children moreover coinfection with 2 pathogens is commonthe etiologies of pneumonia in children differ according to the age of the child the season and the clinical presentation there are relatively few contemporary studies of the etiology of pediatric pneumonia 1619 the studies vary in the population studied case definition clinical specimens test methodology and the number of pathogens sought in prospective studies a potential pathogen was identified in 2485 of children with pneumonia
table 2 summarizes several recent studies of children hospitalized with cap despite differences in the methods used and age groups studied the overall results are generally similar in these studies at least 1 potential pathogen was identified in 7786 of children studied at least 1 virus was identified in 4566 of children mixed viral and bacterial infections were identified in 2333 in most studies viral infections were most common in children 2 years of age but viral causes of pneumonia were important in all age groupsthe use of pcr increases the proportion of children with cap who are found to have viral infection tsolia et al 18 studied 75 school-age children hospitalized with cap with use of conventional cultures and pcr assays for influenza rsv parainfluenza adenovirus mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydophila pneumoniae a pathogen was demonstrated in 58 77 of 75 1 virus in 65 bacterial infection in 40 and coinfection in 35 adenovirus was present in 9 12 parainfluenza in 6 8 influenza virus in 5 7 rsv in 2 3 and hmpv in 1 1 thirty-four children were shedding rhinovirus the significance of detection of this virus was unclear but the authors found rhinovirus carriage in only 1 of 27 healthy children in the hospital during the same period with use of pcr cevey-macherel et al 19 studied 99 children 5 years of age who fulfilled the world health organization clinical criteria for pneumonia they used pcr to detect m pneumoniac pneumonia and 13 respiratory viruses including 4 coronaviruses a potential pathogen was identified in 86 33 had only viral infection 19 had only bacterial infection and 33 had mixed viral and bacterial infection the only clinical sign that helped identify children with bacterial infection was the presence of dehydration procalcitonin and c-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in children with bacterial infection but the sensitivity of these tests was modest 72 and 88 respectively and the specificity was low 58 and 44 respectively there was no association between the radiologic description and the etiology it remains unclear from these studies whether children with coinfection with viruses and bacteria had more severe illnessalthough it is clear that influenza parainfluenza rsv human metapneumovirus and adenovirus are important causes of cap in the absence of bacterial coinfection the role of rhinoviruses and some of the newly described viruses including human coronaviruses and bocavirus is harder to determine rhinoviruses are the most common cause of mild upper respiratory illness and detection of rhinovirus in asymptomatic persons is relatively common 20 21 jartti et al 21 reviewed studies that reported detection of viruses from asymptomatic adults and children although some of the participants were household contacts of ill patients with use of conventional culture rhinovirus detection was uncommon mean 15 range 015 but with use of pcr rhinovirus was detected more frequently mean 14 range 045 the few studies that have performed sequential sampling have shown that pcr positivity is relatively brief 22 23 replication of many strains of rhinovirus is limited at higher temperatures and this was thought to prevent replication in the lower respiratory tract however recent studies demonstrated that rhinovirus can replicate at higher temperatures and infect the lower respiratory tract 24 although season- and age-matched control subjects would be helpful detection of rhinovirus in young children hospitalized with cap has been substantially higher in some studies than would be expected from children with uncomplicated urti 16 25 pcr-based detection and sequencing of rhinoviruses has revealed a greater degree of genetic divergence than was appreciated with culture-based detection 20 26 it is possible that better understanding of these viruses will identify genotypes with greater capacity for lower respiratory tract disease and severe disease 27 28three new coronaviruses capable of infecting humans were described recently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was rapidly identified after outbreaks of severe respiratory disease were detected in china vietnam and singapore in early 2003 29 fortunately only sporadic laboratory-associated cases have been detected since containment of the worldwide outbreaks by the end of 2003 human coronavirus nl63 hcov-nl63 was identified in the netherlands in 2004 30 it has clearly been associated with croup and bronchiolitis and occasionally with pneumonia 3135 human coronavirus hku1 hcov-hku1 was detected in an adult in hong kong in 2005 36 in one of the initial studies in hong kong hcov-hku1 was detected in 24 of patients with cap 36 other studies have shown slightly lower frequency hku1 was detected as the only respiratory pathogen in 14 14 of 1043 specimens from hospitalized children in seattle 34 in a prospective active surveillance study involving children 5 years of age in nashville coronaviruses including hku1 nl63 oc43 and 229e were isolated from 22 of children hospitalized with respiratory disease thus coronaviruses appear to be a significant but relatively uncommon cause of hospitalization among childrenbocavirus was first isolated in 2005 in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from children with respiratory tract infection 37 unlike many other respiratory viruses it is a single-stranded dna virus of the family parvoviridae bocavirus has also been isolated from stool and serum samples bocavirus has frequently been detected in conjunction with other pathogens and may be detected for prolonged periods thus it has been challenging to demonstrate the clinical importance of bocavirus detection 3840 however at least 2 studies showed that isolation of bocavirus alone was more common in ill children than in control subjects 41 42 bocavirus loads were significantly higher in patients with only bocavirus than in those with coinfection 3 43 thus accumulating data support the role of bocavirus as a true pathogen but determining the relevance of isolation from an individual patient remains difficultrespiratory viral infections are an important cause of severe disease in children and adults who receive solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants 4446 children appear to be at increased risk of infection with respiratory viruses compared with adult transplant recipients respiratory viruses can cause severe or fatal pneumonia and may trigger chronic progressive airway obstruction the role of rsv influenza virus adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses has been appreciated for several years and is reasonably well understood the seasonal distribution parallels the epidemiology in the community infections may be attributable to shedding by visitors or staff or from the patients upper respiratory tracts many outbreaks have been described in transplant units with horizontal transmission in recipients of stem cell transplants the mortality associated with lower respiratory tract infection due to the older respiratory viruses is 254544improved molecular detection has led to increased recognition of hmpv coronavirus bocavirus and rhinovirus infections in transplant recipients 47 48 there are reports of severe disease associated with these pathogens however many unanswered questions remain about the risk factors natural history and optimal management of these pathogensaccurate and timely diagnosis of the cause of lrti in children has potential benefits including improved treatment of the individual child decreasing the overall costs of care and reducing selection for antimicrobial organisms due to excessive antibiotic use a specific viral diagnosis may provide reassurance to parents and providersa few randomized trials and case series have examined the potential for viral testing to improve management 57 49 5054 bonner et al 6 conducted a randomized trial of providing emergency department physicians with the results of influenza rapid tests for febrile children for children with influenza access to the test results reduced the number of antibiotic prescriptions the ordering of urinalysis urine culture complete blood counts blood cultures and chest radiographs no differences were seen among those who did not have influenza a quasi-randomized trial of influenza rapid testing showed similar results 51 when the analysis included all children the use of a rapid test did not influence clinician behavior however among those children who tested positive for influenza by either method those with a rapid influenza test were less likely to have urinalysis urine culture or a complete blood count ordered doan et al 50 studied 200 children 3 years of age who were seen in the emergency department for fever and had at least 1 respiratory symptom and randomized them to have a direct fluorescent antibody test for 7 respiratory viruses or routine care there was no statistically significant difference in duration of emergency department stay performance of chest radiographs blood tests and urine analyses or use of antibiotic prescriptions between the groups however children who were tested had a 64 reduction in the likelihood of receiving antibiotics from another provider within 1 week after the visit among those who tested positive for a virus testing was associated with a median 69-min reduction in the duration of the emergency department stayfor transplant recipients with respiratory infection the ability to detect the full range of viral pathogens is critical the known respiratory viral pathogens should be sought in addition to cytomegalovirus epstein barr virus human herpesvirus type 6 and herpes simplex virus highly sensitive multiplex platforms offer obvious advantages over the combination of direct fluorescent antibody testing dfa culture and individual pcr assaysnosocomial viral infections impose a substantial burden in childrens hospitals and pose a particular risk to immunocompromised children 55 early identification allows effective cohorting and isolation the inability to distinguish among the multiple viral causes of bronchiolitis means that the practice of cohorting children by syndrome without a viral diagnosis exposes them to substantial risk of acquiring a new virus during hospitalization virus-specific cohorting should reduce this riskthe largest potential societal benefit may come from reduction in the unnecessary use of antibiotics for lrti in children 56 although many factors contribute to the rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance respiratory tract infections remain the most common reason for prescribing antibiotics and each course of antibiotics adds selective pressure 57the clinical interpretation of the detection of a virus from nasopharyngeal secretions in a child with lrti can be challenging it is possible that the virus is from a resolving upper respiratory infection and not the cause of the lower respiratory tract disease detection of influenza adenovirus rsv and probably human metapneumovirus can generally be assumed to correlate with infection of the lower respiratory tract but coinfection or super-infection with bacteria is not rare a biphasic illness focal consolidation on chest radiograph and elevated inflammatory markers increase the likelihood of bacterial coinfection more research is needed to help determine when isolation of rhinovirus bocavirus or coronavirus is the only cause of pneumonia viral quantification may prove helpful to determine when an isolate is associated with severe disease preliminary results are encouraging 43 5862 but more data using consistent samples and methods are needed to validate the usefulness and to establish cutoff valuesin evaluating new diagnostic platforms it is not enough to demonstrate that the new test correctly identifies the presence of a large number of respiratory pathogens the clinician must be able to interpret a positive test result in the context of the clinical illness and determine the appropriate management it is unreasonable to expect that advanced molecular diagnostic tests will be able to do this in isolation instead as with all tests the result will need to be interpreted with knowledge of the epidemiology of the pathogen pretest probability of infection the patients symptoms and other clinical information additional epidemiologic studies are needed to establish the importance and presentation of several of the more recently diagnosed pathogens we need to better understand the role of multiple infections in lrtiit is also not enough to demonstrate improved diagnostic accuracy the tests must ultimately change the behavior of clinicians and improve patient outcomes although the preliminary results of the aforementioned trials are promising the tests studied are limited in breadth and accuracy and none incorporate detection of bacterial causes of lrti studies are needed that use newer multiplex platforms and that address hospitalized children with pneumonia ideally diagnostic tests should be able to rapidly identify viral and bacterial pathogens and to simultaneously detect antibiotic resistancecoronavirus was for the first time identified in 1960 as a cause of common cold it is an enveloped rna virus single-stranded with a pleomorphic or spherical shape having projections of glycoprotein it has various subtypes such as alpha beta gamma and delta coronavirus along with serotypes of each subtype the human coronavirus oc43-like and 229e-like can also be found in bats pigs birds cats dogs mice and whales coronavirus can be transmitted through airborne droplets and the replication of the virus occurs in the ciliated epithelium that causes cell damage and inflammatory reactions at the site of infection 1 consequently the covid-19 fatality rate 3090 is observed to be higher in the older generation making them the most vulnerable group the milder cases of covid-19 can include nasal congestion sore throat difficulty in breathing chest pains chills kidney failure and pneumonia this virus can infect several organs in the human body such as respiratory hepatic central nervous and gastrointestinal systems the rate of the outbreak of this emerging coronavirus is increasing alarmingly and current methods of diagnosis such as polymerase chain reaction are not ideal as far as the cost-effectiveness accuracy and speed are concerned therefore a faster and simpler method for the detection of viral infections in biofluids can become a front-line tool in order to tackle the spread of this deadly disease 23real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr is used for the detection of covid-19 which is time-consuming as sample preparation is required prior to analysisrt-pcr is also known as quantitative pcr or qpcr and therein the amplification of dna is detected in real time as pcr is in progress by the use of a fluorescent reporter it detects nucleic acids either for their presence or absence or for their amount pcr testing is a highly sensitive technique 10 copies per reaction is the sensitivity that the researcher is relying upon and false-negative tests can result in the failure of detection of covid-19-infected patients 4 therefore the correct procedure for pcr is crucial according to who guidelines regarding covid-19 laboratory testing is now available and research toward improved detection is desperately needed the dynamics of the virus and subsequent immunological responses are significant in molecular testing thus certain factors such as severity of disease in several populations the relationship between the severity and viral concentration duration of shedding development of serological assays and their validation monitoring of mutations that can affect molecular testing and encouragement of sharing of data is significant in order to better manage the covid-19 outbreak the initiation and development of several other molecular techniques to detect the quick and easy prevention and diagnosis of the covid-19 outbreak are crucial to

hence timely detection along with clinical validation of sensitivity and specificity of technique is important to overcome the diagnostic challenges such as implementation of test personnel training quick detection timing and availability of primers and probes the definite need for better techniques and portable technology can benefit researchers and clinicians spectroscopy can offer a promising detection approach through the potential disease molecularchemical biomarkers 4spectroscopy with its advances in technology is central to novel applications in bioengineering natural sciences and now in the medical field both raman rs and infrared ir spectroscopies can help in the diagnosis of infections at the point of care 56 spectroscopic techniques have attracted growing interest as biomedical tools for the early diagnosis and monitoring of human disease the need to study bacteria and viruses has seen a renewed interest with recent technologies capable of providing snapshot information about the overall composition of biological species 78 as a result complex biological samples such as urine cvf blood saliva breast milk etc can now be assessed with unparalleled efficiency and resolution using techniques such as proton nuclear magnetic resonance 1 h-nmr rs and ir 911these analytical techniques are vibrational spectroscopic techniques that look at the molecular vibrations of the chemical structure of molecules the viral proteins or antibody proteins from the immune system response can be detected in the vibrational spectrum 12 wood et al emphasized the need for better methods of diagnosis and reported on the detection of viruses through infrared spectroscopy claiming that it offers significant economic and social benefits to the community 13 recently we successfully separated different types of bacteria by both ftir and raman spectroscopy and the data to be published provides compelling evidence this is encouraging as we strongly believe that both the techniques can be used for detecting viruses as glycoprotein and nucleic acids of these species can be analyzed ultimately paving the way for rapid and accurate diagnosis and continuous monitoringspectroscopy coupled with a multivariate analysis approach could be a powerful tool to explore biomolecules artificial intelligence having the potential to customize deep neural networks that have the ability to learn the spectra could after training make instant predictions regarding spectra additional studies should investigate the diagnostic capability of spectroscopy and machine learning 14 the effectiveness sensitivity and specificity of these methods although significant could still be further improved this pandemic situation around the globe calls for the sharing of data among countries with anonymized samples so that researchers are able to explore diagnostic opportunities and so that a rapid development of point of care testing methodology can be developed strengthening the global fightback against the spread of covid-19 a spectroscopic device based on either ir orand rs for the detection of viruses and bacteria can be developed by analyzing proteins and nucleic acid structure in a multiplexed fashion spectroscopic techniques have immense potential in diagnosing human diseases including bacterial and viral infections inflammatory conditions and various cancers as demonstrated in a schematic diagram in figure 1 currently although pcr can aid in the diagnosis of viral diseases the process is time-consuming and sample preparation intensive proposed spectroscopic techniques can be of immense value for rapid accurate and relatively cost-effective methods of not only detecting infections but also monitoring the monitoring aspect is even more crucial as viruses are known to change their rna in relation to the surrounding environment making it more difficult to find a cure the use of rs and ir combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning will allow the monitoring of the chemical pathway to the progression of the disease and identify any changes in the chemical structure of the viruses and bacteria that may occur in addition due to the ability to precisely determine the chemical structural changes by spectroscopy it should be possible to detect the concentration of various infections in saliva urine blood or serum
the aim should be to develop a spectroscopic test methodology by employing infrared and raman spectroscopies as diagnostic techniques to analyze covid-19 samples and compare spectral results with the current pcr method that is routinely used vibrational spectroscopy will help in understanding the process of viral infection not only it is rapid and accurate detection but also monitoring which could lead to understanding its mutation and drug development for covid-19 as wella complete spectroscopic detection system can be a next diagnostic tool going through different stages of spectral data acquisition defining a test methodology statistical process control and spectral data mining and hence developing a rapid diagnostic systemthis new coronavirus has unique biological characteristics that would challenge any health care systems response including high levels of infectivity21httpswwwncbinlmnihgovbooksnbk554776 last accessed 5272020 as a novel pathogen existing clinical tests could not identify covid19 patients and confirmation of diagnosis required molecular testing for sars-cov-2 viral rna22

the study were positive for influenza a by rapid antigen or any other test methodalthough many studies have examined the utility of the various methods used for diagnosis of respiratory virus infections to our knowledge none have systematically and concurrently examined the performance characteristics of dfa culture rapid antigen testing and pcr on an older adult population barenfanger et al 2000 falsey et al 1996 falsey et al 1995 lam et al 2007 templeton et al 2004 we found that approximately one-fifth of older adult patients with an acute rti had a detectable viral etiology this is somewhat lower than the frequency seen in other studies which have found a viral etiology in approximately one-third of elderly patients with rti using various combinations of culture serology and antigen detection falsey et al 1995 flamaing et al 2003 this study did not have a surveillance group of asymptomatic older adults to establish a causal relationship but respiratory viruses are found generally in a low percentage 5 of adult surveillance specimens when pcr is used jartti et al 2008the data in this study indicate that multiplexed rt-pcr is highly sensitive in detecting respiratory viruses in older adults compared to dfa culture and rapid antigen testing the mfi data from the rvp assay suggest that older adults shed less virus than children during rti virus detection in the older adult population is therefore enhanced by highly sensitive methods such as rt-pcr an additional advantage of the rvp assay is that viruses that are not routinely cultured or stained can be detected such as rhinovirus and coronavirus this is especially useful in elderly patients for whom rhinovirus and coronavirus can cause severe to fatal respiratory disease greenberg 2007 hicks et al 2006 although it may seem intuitive that rvp testing after 24 h of culture would be equally if not more sensitive than rvp on the direct specimen we found the opposite to be true this may be due to the dilution of the specimen with culture media particularly when there were low numbers of infective virus particles in the original sample furthermore r-mix cells are optimized for rapid viral antigen detection at 24 or 48 h but not for propagation of virus wilkey et al 2006 our observation that rvp from the supernatant of a 24-h r-mix culture is associated with reduced sensitivity is an important finding especially for developing diagnostic algorithms for the detection of respiratory virusesdfa on respiratory specimens remains a useful test in young children because they shed large amounts of virus and dfa is quicker and simpler to perform compared to rt-pcr in the older adult population studied here dfa failed to detect a viral pathogen in 8 of 12 possible cases whereas rvp did not miss any cases that were found by dfa culture was even less sensitive than dfa contributing no additional information to the patients tested other studies have also found viral culture to be insensitive especially in older adults falsey et al 1996 although convenient rapid antigen testing for rsv is not recommended for testing in older adults because of its insensitivity in this patient population this finding is corroborated by other investigators casiano-colon et al 2003 falsey et al 1996 no influenza a or b cases were available for testing by rapid antigen thus conclusions on rapid antigen testing for influenza in older adults cannot be madedual infections were not found in older adults in this study whereas in young children they are found in 12 or more of patients tested in other investigations gruteke et al 2004 kuypers et al 2006 the incidence of mixed viral rti in older adults has not been studied using highly sensitive modalities such as rt-pcr but has been reported in very low frequency with use of other test methods such as serology and culture falsey et al 1995 flamaing et al 2003 our study did not include serologic testing another sensitive testing modality but serology is largely retrospective in contrast to the test methods used in this studywe acknowledge that the results of this study may have been affected by the high number of inadequate specimens however specimens were collected by experienced nursing and medical staff moreover this underscores the importance of having highly sensitive diagnostic assays for older adults and highlights the need for modified protocols for specimen collection especially in the elderly population during dry winter conditions the proportion of inadequate specimens overall and among specimens with positive results did not differ statistically this finding suggests that pcr is sufficiently sensitive to detect virus even in specimens with poor cellularity the low number of positive results from dfa or culture may has been due to specimen inadequacy it should be noted that for pcr culture and rapid antigen testing specimen cellularity is not routinely assessed and would be noted only if microscopy eg dfa was performedthis study demonstrates that for older adults a highly sensitive platform is necessary to minimize false-negative test results rapid antigen testing for rsv is not recommended for older adults negative dfa and culture results should be interpreted with caution because these methods are insensitive particularly in the older adult population nucleic acid amplification-based testing with its superior sensitivity serves as the most robust method to detect respiratory viruses in older adults and further study is warranted to determine its clinical

in wuhan city china and later spread to many provinces in china as of may 8th 2020 the world health organization who had documented 3759967 positive covid-19 cases and the death toll attributed to covid-19 had reached 259474 worldwide 1 so far more than 212 countries and territories have confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 infection on january 30th 2020 the who declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern 2 the first sars-cov-2 positive case in india was reported in the state of kerala on january 30th 2020 subsequently the number of cases drastically rose according to the press release by the indian council of medical research icmr on may 8th 2020 a total of 1437788 suspected samples had been sent to the national institute of virology niv pune and a related testing laboratory 3 among them 56342 cases tested positive for sars-cov-2 4 a state-wise distribution of positive cases until may 8th 2020 is listed in table 1 and the cases have been depicted on an indian map figure 1 nearly 197192 indians have recently been repatriated from affected regions and more than 1393301 passengers have been screened for sars-cov-2 at indian airports 5 with 111 positive cases observed among foreign nationals 4 5 as of may 8th 2020 maharashtra delhi and gujarat states were reported to be hotspots for covid-19 with 17974 5980 and 7012 confirmed cases respectively to date 16540 patients have recovered and 1886 deaths have been reported in india 5 to impose social distancing the janata curfew 14-h lockdown was ordered on march 22nd 2020 a further lockdown was initiated for 21 days starting on march 25th 2020 and the same was extended until may 3rd 2020 but owing to an increasing number of positive cases the lockdown has been extended for the third time until may 17th 2020 6 currently out of 32 states and eight union territories in india 26 states and six union territories have reported covid-19 cases additionally the health ministry has identified 130 districts as hotspot zones or red zones 284 as orange zones with few sars-cov-2 infections and 319 as green zones no sars-cov-2 infection as of may 4th 2020 these hotspot districts have been identified to report more than 80 of the cases across the nation nineteen districts in uttar pradesh are identified as hotspot districts and this was followed by 14 and 12 districts in maharashtra and tamil nadu respectively 7 the complete lockdown was implemented in these containment zones to stoplimit community transmission 5 as of may 8th 2020 310 government laboratories and 111 private laboratories across the country were involved in sars-cov-2 testing as per icmr report 1437788 samples were tested till date which is 104 per thousand people 3the recent outbreak of covid-19 in several countries is similar to the previous outbreaks of sars and middle east respiratory syndrome mers that emerged in 2003 and 2012 in china and saudi arabia respectively 810 coronavirus is responsible for both sars and covid-19 diseases they affect the respiratory tract and cause major disease outbreaks worldwide sars is caused by sars-cov whereas sars-cov-2 causes covid-19 so far there is no particular treatment available to treat sars or covid-19 in the current search for a covid-19 cure there is some evidence that point to sars-cov-2 being similar to human coronavirus hku1 and 229e strains 11 12 even though they are new coronavirus family members these reports suggest that humans do not have immunity to this virus allowing its easy and rapid spread among human populations through contact with an infected person sars-cov-2 is more transmissible than sars-cov the two possible reasons could be i the viral load quantity of virus tends to be relatively higher in covid-19-positive patients especially in the nose and throat immediately after they develop symptoms and ii the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 to host cell receptors is higher than that of sars-cov 13 14 the other comparisons between sars and covid-19 are tabulated in table 2 and references for the same are provided here 1 15 16as per the official government guidelines india is making preparations against the covid-19 outbreak and avoiding specific crisis actions or not understating its importance will have extremely severe implications all the neighboring countries of india have reported positive covid-19 cases to protect against the deadly virus the indian government have taken necessary and strict measures including establishing health check posts between the national borders to test whether people entering the country have the virus 17 different countries have introduced rescue efforts and surveillance measures for citizens wishing to return from china the lesson learned from the sars outbreak was first that the lack of clarity and information about sars weakened chinas global standing and hampered its economic growth 10 1820 the outbreak of sars in china was catastrophic and has led to changes in health care and medical systems 18 20 compared with china the ability of india to counter a pandemic seems to be much lower a recent study reported that affected family members had not visit the wuhan market in china suggesting that sars-cov-2 may spread without manifesting symptoms 21 researchers believe that this phenomenon is normal for many viruses india with a population of more than 134 billionthe second largest population in the worldwill have difficulty treating severe covid-19 cases because the country has only 49000 ventilators which is a minimal amount if the number of covid-19 cases increases in the nation it would be a catastrophe for india 22 it would be difficult to identify sources of infection and those who come in contact with them this would necessitate multiple strategies to handle the outbreak including computational modeling as well as statistical and quantitative analyses to rapidly develop new vaccines and drug treatments with such a vast population indias medical system is grossly inadequate a study has shown that owing to inadequate medical care systems nearly 1 million people die every year in india 23 india is also engaged in trading with its nearby countries such as bangladesh bhutan pakistan myanmar china and nepal during the financial year 201718 fy201718 indian regional trade amounted to nearly 12 billion accounting for only 156 of its total global trade value of 769 billion the outbreak of such viruses and their transmission would significantly affect the indian economy the outbreak in china could profoundly affect the indian economy especially in the sectors of electronics pharmaceuticals and logistics operations as trade ports with china are currently closed this was further supported by the statement by suyash choudhary headfixed income idfc amc stating that gdp might decrease owing to covid-19 24economists assume that the impact of covid-19 on the economy will be high and negative when compared with the sars impact during 2003 for instance it has been estimated that the number of tourists arriving in china was much higher than that of tourists who traveled during the season when sars emerged in 2003 this shows that covid-19 has an effect on the tourism industry it has been estimated that for sars there was a 57 and 45 decline in yearly rail passenger and road passenger traffic respectively 25 moreover when compared with the world economy 15 years ago world economies are currently much more inter-related it has been estimated that covid-19 will hurt emerging market currencies and also impact oil prices 2628 from the retail industrys perspective consumer savings seem to be high this might have an adverse effect on consumption rates as all supply chains are likely to be affected which in turn would have its impact on supply when compared with the demand of various necessary product items 29 this clearly proves that based on the estimated losses due to the effect of sars on tourism retail sales lost around usd 1218 billion and usd 30100 billion was lost at a global macroeconomic level we cannot estimate the impact of covid-19 at this point this will be possible only when the spread of covid-19 is fully controlled until that time any estimates will be rather ambiguous and imprecise 19 the oecd interim economic assessment has provided briefing reports highlighting the role of china in the global supply chain and commodity markets japan south korea and australia are the countries that are most susceptible to adverse effects as they have close ties with china it has been estimated that there has been a 20 decline in car sales which was 10 of the monthly decline in china during january 2020 this shows that even industrial production has been affected by covid-19 so far several factors have thus been identified as having a major economic impact labor mobility lack of working hours interruptions in the global supply chain less consumption and tourism and less demand in the commodity market at a global level 30 which in turn need to be adequately analyzed by industry type corporate leaders need to prioritize the supply chain and product line economy trends via demand from the consumer end amidst several debates on sustainable economy before the covid-19 impact it has now been estimated that indias gdp by the international monetary fund has been cut down to 19 from 58 for the fy21 the financial crisis that has emerged owing to the worldwide lockdown reflects its adverse effect on several industries and the global supply chain which has resulted in the gdp dropping to 42 for fy20 which was previously estimated at 48 nevertheless it has been roughly estimated that india and china will be experiencing considerable positive growth among other major economies 31an easy way to decrease sars-cov-2 infection rates is to avoid virus exposure people from india should avoid traveling to countries highly affected with the virus practice proper hygiene and avoid consuming food that is not home cooked necessary preventive measures such as wearing a mask regular hand washing and avoiding direct contact with infected persons should also be practiced the ministry of health and family welfare mohfw india has raised awareness about the recent outbreak and taken necessary action to control covid-19 besides the mohfw has created a 24 h7 days-a-week disease alert helpline 91-11-23978046 and 1800-180-1104 and policy guidelines on surveillance clinical management infection prevention and control sample collection transportation and discharging suspected or confirmed cases 3 5 those who traveled from china or other countries and exhibited symptoms including fever difficulty in breathing sore throat cough and breathlessness were asked to visit the nearest hospital for a health check-up officials from seven different airports including chennai cochin new delhi kolkata hyderabad and bengaluru have been ordered to screen and monitor indian travelers from china and other affected countries in addition a travel advisory was released to request the cessation of travel to affected countries and anyone with a travel history that has included china since january 15th 2020 would be quarantined a centralized control room has been set up by the delhi government at the directorate general of health services and 11 other districts have done the same india has implemented covid-19 travel advisory for intra- and inter-passenger aircraft restrictions more information on additional travel advisory can be accessed with the provided link httpswwwmohfwgovinpdftraveladvisorypdfindia is known for its traditional medicines in the form of ayush ayurvedic yoga and naturopathy unani siddha and homeopathy the polyherbal powder nilavembukudineer showed promising effects against dengue and chikungunya fevers in the past 32 with the outbreak of covid-19 the ministry of ayush has released a press note advisory for coronavirus mentioning useful medications to improve the immunity of the individuals 33 currently according to the icmr guidelines doctors prescribe a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir for severe covid-19 cases and hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of sars-cov-2 infection 34 35 in collaboration with the who icmr will conduct a therapeutic trial for covid-19 in india 3 the icmr recommends using the us-fda-approved closed real-time rt-pcr systems such as genexpert and roche cobas-68008800 which are used to diagnose chronic myeloid leukemia and melanoma respectively 36 in addition the truenattm beta cov test on the truelabtm workstation validated by the icmr is recommended as a screening test all positive results obtained on this platform need to be confirmed by confirmatory assays for sars-cov-2 all negative results do not require further testing antibody-based rapid tests were validated at niv pune and found to be satisfactory the rapid test kits are as follows i sars-cov-2 antibody test lateral flow method guangzhou wondfo biotech mylan laboratories limited ce-ivd ii covid-19 igmigg rapid test biomedomics ce-ivd iii covid-19 igmigg

makesurecovid-19 rapid test hll lifecare limited india and vii yhlo sars-cov-2 igm and igg detection kit additional equipment required cpc diagnostics as a step further on the technological aspect the union health ministry has launched a mobile application called aarogyasetu that works both on android and ios mobile phones this application constructs a user database for establishing an awareness network that can alert people and governments about possible covid-19 victims 37infections caused by these viruses are an enormous global health threat they are a major cause of death and have adverse socio-economic effects that are continually exacerbated therefore potential treatment initiatives and approaches need to be developed first india is taking necessary preventive measures to reduce viral transmission second icmr and the ministry of ayush provided guidelines to use conventional preventive and treatment strategies to increase immunity against covid-19 3 38 these guidelines could help reduce the severity of the viral infection in elderly patients and increase life expectancy 39 the recent report from the director of icmr mentioned that india would undergo randomized controlled trials using convalescent plasma of completely recovered covid-19 patients convalescent plasma therapy is highly recommended as it has provided moderate success with sars and mers 40 this has been rolled out in 20 health centers and will be increased this month may 2020 3 india has expertise in specialized medicalpharmaceutical industries with production facilities and the government has established fast-tracking research to develop rapid diagnostic test kits and vaccines at low cost 41 in addition the serum institute of india started developing a vaccine against sars-cov-2 infection 42 until we obtain an appropriate vaccine it is highly recommended that we screen the red zoned areas to stop further transmission of the virus medical college doctors in kerala india implemented the low-cost wisk walk-in sample kiosk to collect samples without direct exposure or contact 43 44 after kerala the defense research and development organization drdo developed walk-in kiosks to collect covid-19 samples and named these as covid-19 sample collection kiosk covsack 45 after the swab collection the testing of sars-cov-2 can be achieved with the existing diagnostic facility in india this facility can be used for massive screening or at least in the red zoned areas without the need for personal protective equipment kits 43 45 india has attempted to broaden its research facilities and shift toward testing the mass population as recommended by medical experts in india and worldwide 46publicly available datasets were analyzed in this study this data can be found here httpswwwmohfwgovin and httpswwwicmrgovinsk dk and cd were involved in the design of the study and the acquisition analysis interpretation of the data and drafting the manuscript bc was involved in the interpretation of the data cd supervised the entire study the manuscript was reviewed and approved by all the authorsthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of intereston 11 february 2003 the world health organizations who communicable disease surveillance  response csr unit published a report from the chinese ministry of health of an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome in guangdong province with 300 cases and 5 deaths at the same time mass media reported that a pneumonia epidemic in guangdong was causing considerable fear and disruption among the local population but provided no details about the etiology of the apparently infectious diseaseone week later csr reported the detection of an avian influenza a h5n1 virus in a child from hong kong following a visit to mainland china several members of the family had presented with a similar illness to which two of the childs relatives had succumbedalthough many observers were tempted to see a possible causal link between the two reports relating to adjacent geographic areas the chinese ministry of health stated on 20 february that the atypical pneumonia outbreak in guangdong was probably caused by chlamydia pneumoniaedays later a doctor who had treated patients with the disease in guangdong booked into a hong kong hotel for a family reunion in the days until he himself succumbed to the disease in a hong kong hospital he unwittingly infected 2 family members 10 other hotel guests and 4 health care staff he thus became the epicenter for the international spread of the illness traveling hotel guests infected by him brought the disease within days to vietnam singapore canada ireland the usa and indirectly germanyon 12 march 2003 who issued a global alert about cases of atypical pneumonia spreading to hospital staff the alert had been raised by a who doctor working in vietnam dr carlo urbani who recognized this was a novel infectious disease with an enormous potential for nosocomial transmission tragically he himself became infected and later succumbed to it an emergency travel advisory followed on 15 march 2003 reporting the worldwide spread of what was for the first time termed severe acute respiratory syndrome sarsin an unprecedented move who initiated a collaborative multicenter research project to identify the causative agent of sars avian influenza was quickly ruled out several laboratories diagnosed active infections with chlamydia or paramyxoviruses in some  but far from all  patients suffering from sars however there was good evidence that neither of these were plausible etiological agents for the novel infectious diseasethe network comprised laboratories with access to sars patient samples and those with particular expertise on emerging or respiratory viruses for several weeks a spirit of cooperation rather than competition prevailed samples were exchanged and results and findings shared continuously via daily telephone conferences and a password-protected websitewithin weeks groups in hong kong germany canada and the united states of america found a hitherto unknown member of the coronavirus family in sars patients this was achieved through independent studies but certainly benefited greatly from the real-time sharing of interim results although different approaches were employed including cell culture electron microscopy and molecular techniques sequencing data showed all laboratories had identified the same coronavirus previously unknown to human and veterinary virology figure 1
it was shown that sars patients seroconverted against this virus in the course of their illness healthy unexposed control individuals lacked antibody reactivity however it remained to be proven that this novel coronavirus was indeed the etiological agent for sars rather than an innocent bystander newly discovered by thorough studiesafter experimental infection of macaques with the newly isolated agent was shown to cause a sars-like illness and subsequent reisolation of the agent all of kochs postulates had been fulfilled on 16 april 2003 who officially announced that the provisionally termed sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov was the causative agent of sarsbased on this breakthrough tests for the detection of viral sequences and specific antibodies were quickly developed and made available to affected countries in addition numerous scientists embarked on programmes to develop vaccines and drugs or antibodies for prophylactic or therapeutic usewithin a few months the sars outbreak was brought under control on 5 july 2003 who declared that the last chain of person-to-person transmission had been interrupted measures including source isolation of patients  who only became infectious after onset of clinical symptoms  strict infection control in health care facilities timely identification and quarantining of exposed contacts and perhaps also measures to increase social distance such as travel warnings and screening of travelers had led to this remarkable and remarkably rapid successthorough and consistent implementation of these measures eventually brought an end to the sars outbreak even in the worst affected areas in the meantime however several areas  different chinese provinces other than guangdong most prominently the capital beijing but also toronto in canada and taiwan  paid a high price for not implementing adequate countermeasures in a timely fashion typically a so-called superspreader that is a highly contagious sars patient would seek treatment at a poorly prepared facility and by the time the danger was realized scores of staff and patients had become infected and themselves become sources of spreadinterestingly despite the rapid identification of the agent and laboratory tests becoming available almost immediately these formidable achievements did not contribute much to the containment of the outbreak instead it was the prudent and thorough use of old-fashioned measures such as isolation and quarantine that proved to be the key to success identification of suspected cases was based on clinical and epidemiological criteria high fever 38c plus symptoms of respiratory tract infection plus an exposure history the details of which depended on each locations sars status at the time an additional positive sars-cov test result or radiological or pathological evidence of pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome would make it a probable casethe final case count from 1 november 2002 until 31 july 2003 is 8096 with 774 deaths since mid-2003 sars has reappeared on four occasions three involved laboratory-acquired infections which demonstrates the dangers of breaching biosafety procedures and the risks of subsequent further spread in the community by secondary transmission outside of the laboratory the fourth sars outbreak was due to reintroduction from the reservoirto minimize the risk of reemergence who has issued guidelines for the surveillance of possible sars cases risk categories to guide adequate national surveillance strategies to guard against the possible re-emergence of sars are emergence from wildlife or other animal reservoirs emergence or introduction from laboratories or via international travel or low risk of sars-cov emergence or introductionwho also urges all countries to conduct an inventory of all laboratories working with or storing sars-cov and to ensure strict enforcement of biosafety proceduresbefore sars only two coronaviruses hcov-229 e and hcov-oc43 were known to infect humans because they both cause only relatively minor disease and are difficult to propagate in the laboratory they received relatively little attention by diagnostic and research laboratories in contrast several coronaviruses were recognized as animal pathogens infecting pigs dogs rabbits cats mice rats turkeys and chicken some of these had for some time played important roles in veterinary medicineit was obvious that the majority of human sars cases were acquired through transmission from other sars sufferers which proved key to its eventual control however it seemed highly unlikely that this was a previously existing disease entity that was only then being recognized its propensity to cause nosocomial outbreaks often in hospital settings would not have been overlooked for longthe very first sars cases were identified retrospectively in various localities in guangdong province the first of these early cases occurred in foshan in november 2002 and several more over the following weeks in nearby places interest soon focused on these early index cases was there any characteristic these patients had in common that could point to a source of their sars-cov infectionthere was indeed many of these early index patients either worked in kitchens or at markets or lived nearby where they were constantly exposed to a multitude of species of domestic and wild animals that were being traded kept in captivity and finally slaughtered and prepared for consumptionthis provided the impetus for studying animals being sold at guangdong markets infection with coronaviruses closely related to sars-cov was identified in different species most commonly in the masked palm civet paguma larvata but also in the chinese ferret badger melogale moschata and the raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides a further small sars outbreak occurred again in guangdong in late 2003early 2004 molecular analysis of virus isolates from human cases and animals sampled at the same place and time confirmed that this was zoonotically acquired from paguma larvatahowever further investigations revealed that this widely consumed species is most likely not the animal reservoir as most populations studied were uninfected later research identified a multitude of coronaviruses in different species of bats in asia and elsewhere among them what is probably the progenitor of sars-covstudies by different groups demonstrate that sars was the result of spillover from a wildlife reservoir  most likely bats  into an intermediate host or hosts most importantly paguma larvata and from there to the human population rapid viral evolution was demonstrated and most likely was the pivotal factor that allowed sars-cov to rapidly adapt to nonreservoir species table 1
shows the distribution of several different coronaviruses in humans and animals and their classification into different groupsdisease caused by sars-cov may present with rather nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms the differential diagnosis is therefore wide and may include various common respiratory pathogens including influenza parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial viruses rsvthe laboratory diagnosis of sars remains a challenge in fact despite the rapid identification of sars-cov as the etiological agent testing contributed little to the successful control of the 2003 outbreak insufficient test specificity on occasions caused false-positive results leading to considerable confusion in many viral diseases virus shedding is greatest during the early symptomatic phase that is around and immediately following the onset of symptoms unfortunately virus excretion is comparatively low during the initial phase of sars it peaks in respiratory specimens and in stools at around day 10 after the onset of the clinical illnessin addition there are currently no laboratory tests available to reliably diagnose sars in the first few days of illness the highest test sensitivity is achieved with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or lung biopsy tissue at the onset of illness because of the invasiveness of such procedures and the associated risk of transmission nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat washings taken with respiratory precautions and preserved in viral transport medium remain the most important diagnostic specimensmost commonly viral genome detection usually by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr is used diagnostically nucleic acid amplification tests have been designed targeting the orf1b or nucleoprotein genes it has not been clearly proven in clinical studies that they are superiorreal-time rt-pcr of nasopharyngeal aspirates is the most sensitive and rapid method furthermore the determination of viral load in nasopharyngeal specimens or serum has been shown to be of clinical value as it is an important prognostic factorto avoid false-positive results who stipulates that the following should be tested at least two different clinical specimen types eg nasopharyngeal aspirate and stool or the same type of clinical specimen but collected on at least two occasions during the course of the illness eg sequential nasopharyngeal aspirates or the same original clinical sample but two different assays or by repeating the same assay but using a new rna extract for each testsars-cov is cultivable on vero and caco2 cells not only from respiratory materials but also from fecal samples figure 2
 once isolated the virus must be identified as sars-cov using further tests cell culture is a very demanding test but currently with the exception of animal trials the only means to show the existence of a live virusantigen detection in respiratory and fecal specimens using enzyme immunoassay eia is generally less sensitive than rt-pcr however antigen detection in serum specimens with monoclonal antibodies or monospecific polyclonal antibody against the viral n protein was found to be a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of sars as serum antibody levels start to rise from day 7 after onset of illness the sensitivity of the serum antigen assay progressively decreased to 0 at day 21antibody testing allows the indirect diagnosis of sars-cov infection and is unsuitable during the acute illness positive antibody test results indicate previous infection with sars-cov seroconversion from negative to positive or a fourfold rise in the antibody titer from acute to convalescent serum indicates a recent infection a negative antibody test result later than 21 days after the onset of illness is likely to indicate that no infection with sars-cov has taken placevirus-specific serum igg igm and iga antibodies against sars-cov appear at around the same time between days 5 and 17 after the onset of symptoms antibody testing is therefore generally not useful during the first week of illness for antibody testing the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test is more commonly performed than the neutralizing antibody test in cell cultures that again requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory figure 3
 a recombinant nucleocapsid eia may be used as a rapid screening test and possesses a higher sensitivity with detection as early as day 5 after onset of illness single low-titer positive antibody results can be due to cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses and require confirmation by more specific western blotting or neutralization assays who regards seroconversion or an at least fourfold rise in antibody titer between an acute and a convalescent serum as proof of infectionthe updated who guidelines for the global surveillance of sars of october 2004 replace all previous who guidance on sars surveillance and response one key recommendation is that independent of the test used who strongly recommends that during the interepidemic period all countries seek verification of laboratory-confirmed cases of sars preliminary positive cases preferably by an external laboratory that is part of the who sars international reference and verification laboratory network figure 4
human sars-cov are no longer circulating in the human population nevertheless the virus is still present in the animal reservoir and virological laboratories and can reemerge anytime there is no single test that can be used to diagnose sars with a reasonable degree of accuracy diagnosis therefore continues to rely on the clinical examination supported by case definitions that include the risk assessment according to the 2004 updated who guidelines table 2 table 3
 the initial symptoms of sars are nonspecific complicating the differential diagnosis the mean incubation period is 5 days with the range of 210 days although there are isolated reports of longer incubation periods unlike influenza virus where the patients are most infectious in the first 2 days of illness transmission from symptomatic sars patients usually occurred on or after the fifth day of onset of disease which is in line with the rising viral load in nasopharyngeal secretions that peaked at around day 10 there have been no reports of transmission occurring before the onset of symptoms the typical clinical presentation of sars is that of viral pneumonia with rapid respiratory deterioration patients initially develop influenza-like prodromal symptoms fever malaise myalgia headache rigors and nonproductive cough are the major presenting symptoms whereas rhinorrhea and sore throat are less frequently seen clinical deterioration often accompanied by watery diarrhea commonly occurs 1 week after the onset of illness although history of fever is the most frequently reported symptom it may be absent on initial measurement severe cases develop rapidly progressing respiratory distress and oxygen desaturation with approximately 20 requiring intensive care chest radiographs typically show ground-glass opacities and focal consolidations especially in the periphery and subpleural regions of the lower zones progressive involvement of both lungs is not uncommon features during the later stages have sometimes included spontaneous pneumothorax pneumomediastinum subpleural fibrosis and cystic changes nosocomial transmission of sars-cov has been a striking feature of the sars outbreak the majority of the cases have occurred in adults children are less commonly affected than adults and usually have a milder illness the overall mortality rate was approximately 10 age and the presence of comorbidities are poor prognostic indicatorsalthough the sars outbreak was still ongoing during the first half of 2003 significant funding was made available for sars-related researchimmunomodulators ie corticosteroids intravenous immunoglobulins thymosin and anti-tnf were empirically used for the treatment of sars during the initial epidemic the correlation between viral load and clinical outcome suggests that suppression of viral replication by effective antiviral drugs should be the key to preventing morbidity and mortality numerous potential antiviral agents have been identified using different approaches in vitro susceptibility test results demonstrate that ifn-alpha and ifn-beta have some potential activity ribavirin has good activity when tested in human caco-2 cells despite its lack of activity in vero cellsthe viral proteases are important targets for the development of antiviral drugs protease inhibitors like nelfinavir glycyrrhizin chloroquine and many others as well as many herbal formulations have been found to possess some antiviral activity against sars-cov in vitro in addition the use of nitric oxide s-nitro-n-acetylpenicillamine inhalation as an experimental form of rescue therapy for sars appeared to have inhibitory activity against sars-cov screening of chemical libraries has identified several inhibitors of the viral protease and helicase identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as an obligatory cellular receptor for sars-cov contributed to understanding of the sars-cov entry process and helped to characterize two targets of antiviral therapeutics the sars-cov spike protein and ace2 however most of the chemicals or approaches have not been evaluated in human or animal modelsvarious approaches toward producing a vaccine against sars have been pursued including the use of inactivated sars-cov plasmid dna and adenovirus vectors one obvious problem any vaccine would face is whom it should be given to in the absence of sars-cov transmission however waiting until a renewed outbreak occurs before commencing vaccination means that precious weeks would be lost until individuals at risk become immunethe administration of preformed antibodies obtained from human or animal donors or more recently produced in vitro is effective in preventing a number of different infections such as hepatitis b varicella and rsv similarly it could be shown that neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov can protect experimental animals from infectionusing screening of a large naive antibody library by antibody phage display technology neutralizing antibodies were identified and produced that were protective in vitro there was no evidence of enhancement of sars-cov infection by subneutralizing concentrations of these antibodies and immune escape mutants were not generatedin theory this could be an ideal tool if sufficient stocks of such human monoclonal antibodies could be procured they would be ready for use when and wherever sars reemerges one could then passively immunize anyone in contact with the source or patients affording immediate protectionin summary sars was a novel severe infectious disease that presumably originated in guangdong in southern china large-scale wildlife trade and consumption favored the emergence of this zoonosis from a hitherto unrecognized animal reservoir after its zoonotic origins the new agent quickly spread within the human population being transmitted mostly via the respiratory route through close human-to-human contactsars was rapidly disseminated via the metropolis hong kong through international air travel its important potential for nosocomial transmission in the community and in hospitals was soon recognized and allowed for appropriate measures to be instituted in most placesthere was an unprecedented rapid gain of knowledge through global networking and international collaboration led by who unfortunately it took some major outbreaks some of them affecting industrialized countries with modern health care systems until the first sars epidemic was controlled thus in the end rapid success was achieved through traditional sanitary measures mainly rapid identification of suspect cases and isolation of the diseasedfortunately sars-cov has  at least so far  not established itself permanently in the human population its relatively low transmissibility with the exception of superspreaders led to a low basic reproduction number r0 together with the fact that infected individuals only become infectious themselves once they have developed clinical disease this made traditional public health measures very effectiveis the fact that the first pandemic of the twenty-first century was quickly contained reason to take comfort in the knowledge that the history of humankind has reached a phase in which biomedical sciences and information technology are able to deal with such threats probably notfirst the rapid success was remarkable unfortunately though this does not reflect preparedness in 1998 donald burke proposed the following criteria for identifying virus families with a high pandemic risk 1 those that had caused pandemics in human populations in the recent past 2 those with the proven ability to cause larger epizootics and 3 those with an intrinsic propensity to rapidly undergo evolution on the basis of high mutation rate or genome organization favoring recombination intrinsic evolvabilityinterestingly even before the sars outbreak which obviously fulfills the first criterion the coronavirus family should clearly have been regarded as high risk starting in the late 1970s the porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus pedv caused a severe swine epizootic in europe and asia second criterion the high evolvability of the coronavirus family had also been demonstrated the porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv evolved through a deletion mutation in the s gene from the transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev the mutant has a different tissue tropism and is less virulentsecond infectious disease emergence from zoonotic sources was a well-recognized threat long before sars nevertheless it took another  fortunately minor  sars outbreak before decisive steps were taken to control at least the trade in the directly implicated paguma larvata in southern chinastarting shortly after sars had been controlled another agent with pandemic potential has caused an ongoing epizootic of unprecedented proportions highly pathogenic influenza a h5n1 virus transmission to humans occurs almost exclusively through close contact with infected  and sick  poultry despite the possibility that this avian influenza virus will become fully humanized and trigger the next influenza pandemic even activities recognized as high risk such as wet markets have mostly not been curtailedfinally the lessons from sars  particularly the experiences of beijing toronto and taiwan that suffered devastating sars outbreaks during the later phase of the outbreak  emphasize over and over again the enormous importance of open and timely communication at times this may mean admitting to problems that at least initially reflect negatively on the country or territory concerned in the medium to long term however such openness is the only way to prevent consequences that would be much worse although this was widely accepted in the wake of the sars experience and has had a strong influence on the new international health regulations that entered into force in june 2007 the information policies of some countries during the h5n1 epizootic unfortunately do not attest to this at allnotwithstanding its grave consequences in humanitarian political and economic terms sars should serve as an example what can be achieved through international cooperation modern science and rigorous use of traditional approaches even if prudent precautions were suddenly adopted sars will certainly not have been the last highly pathogenic novel infectious agent that crosses the species barrier into the human populationalthough bats must be very high on the list of culprits for emerging viral diseases having been identified as reservoir hosts for a number of emerging viruses there is no reason why other groups of animals should not figure as prominently in future the mechanisms behind emergence have been studied these may be linked to the agent the new host species ie human beings and in certain cases also the intermediate hosts or to the connection between those many of the factors and determinants of disease emergence are related to human activitiesalthough this has accompanied humankind throughout history and in fact may have helped shape human history the speed and the extent of human-induced changes has accelerated markedly in recent times although in the case of sars people were lucky in the end this may be quite different next time round it will be important to improve understanding of emergence to minimize the risks of what is a natural phenomenon but much aggravated by human behavior
forest transition and zoonoses risk parasite zoonoseson 11 february 2003 the world health organizations who communicable disease surveillance  response csr unit published a report from the chinese ministry of health of an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome in guangdong province with 300 cases and 5 deaths at the same time mass media reported that a pneumonia epidemic in guangdong was causing considerable fear and disruption among the local population but provided no details about the etiology of the apparently infectious diseaseone week later csr reported the detection of an avian influenza a h5n1 virus in a child from hong kong following a visit to mainland china several members of the family had presented with a similar illness to which two of the childs relatives had succumbedalthough many observers were tempted to see a possible causal link between the two reports relating to adjacent geographic areas the chinese ministry of health stated on 20 february that the atypical pneumonia outbreak in guangdong was probably caused by chlamydia pneumoniaedays later a doctor who had treated patients with the disease in guangdong booked into a hong kong hotel for a family reunion in the days until he himself succumbed to the disease in a hong kong hospital he unwittingly infected 2 family members 10 other hotel guests and 4 health care staff he thus became the epicenter for the international spread of the illness traveling hotel guests infected by him brought the disease within days to vietnam singapore canada ireland the usa and indirectly germanyon 12 march 2003 who issued a global alert about cases of atypical pneumonia spreading to hospital staff the alert had been raised by a who doctor working in vietnam dr carlo urbani who recognized this was a novel infectious disease with an enormous potential for nosocomial transmission tragically he himself became infected and later succumbed to it an emergency travel advisory followed on 15 march 2003 reporting the worldwide spread of what was for the first time termed severe acute respiratory syndrome sarsin an unprecedented move who initiated a collaborative multicenter research project to identify the causative agent of sars avian influenza was quickly ruled out several laboratories diagnosed active infections with chlamydia or paramyxoviruses in some  but far from all  patients suffering from sars however there was good evidence that neither of these were plausible etiological agents for the novel infectious diseasethe network comprised laboratories with access to sars patient samples and those with particular expertise on emerging or respiratory viruses for several weeks a spirit of cooperation rather than competition prevailed samples were exchanged and results and findings shared continuously via daily telephone conferences and a password-protected websitewithin weeks groups in hong kong germany canada and the united states of america found a hitherto unknown member of the coronavirus family in sars patients this was achieved through independent studies but certainly benefited greatly from the real-time sharing of interim results although different approaches were employed including cell culture electron microscopy and molecular techniques sequencing data showed all laboratories had identified the same coronavirus previously unknown to human and veterinary virology figure 1
it was shown that sars patients seroconverted against this virus in the course of their illness healthy unexposed control individuals lacked antibody reactivity however it remained to be proven that this novel coronavirus was indeed the etiological agent for sars rather than an innocent bystander newly discovered by thorough studiesafter experimental infection of macaques with the newly isolated agent was shown to cause a sars-like illness and subsequent reisolation of the agent all of kochs postulates had been fulfilled on 16 april 2003 who officially announced that the provisionally termed sars-associated coronavirus sars-cov was the causative agent of sarsbased on this breakthrough tests for the detection of viral sequences and specific antibodies were quickly developed and made available to affected countries in addition numerous scientists embarked on programmes to develop vaccines and drugs or antibodies for prophylactic or therapeutic usewithin a few months the sars outbreak was brought under control on 5 july 2003 who declared that the last chain of person-to-person transmission had been interrupted measures including source isolation of patients  who only became infectious after onset of clinical symptoms  strict infection control in health care facilities timely identification and quarantining of exposed contacts and perhaps also measures to increase social distance such as travel warnings and screening of travelers had led to this remarkable and remarkably rapid successthorough and consistent implementation of these measures eventually brought an end to the sars outbreak even in the worst affected areas in the meantime however several areas  different chinese provinces other than guangdong most prominently the capital beijing but also toronto in canada and taiwan  paid a high price for not implementing adequate countermeasures in a timely fashion typically a so-called superspreader that is a highly contagious sars patient would seek treatment at a poorly prepared facility and by the time the danger was realized scores of staff and patients had become infected and themselves become sources of spreadinterestingly despite the rapid identification of the agent and laboratory tests becoming available almost immediately these formidable achievements did not contribute much to the containment of the outbreak instead it was the prudent and thorough use of old-fashioned measures such as isolation and quarantine that proved to be the key to success identification of suspected cases was based on clinical and epidemiological criteria high fever 38c plus symptoms of respiratory tract infection plus an exposure history the details of which depended on each locations sars status at the time an additional positive sars-cov test result or radiological or pathological evidence of pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome would make it a probable casethe final case count from 1 november 2002 until 31 july 2003 is 8096 with 774 deaths since mid-2003 sars has reappeared on four occasions three involved laboratory-acquired infections which demonstrates the dangers of breaching biosafety procedures and the risks of subsequent further spread in the community by secondary transmission outside of the laboratory the fourth sars outbreak was due to reintroduction from the reservoirto minimize the risk of reemergence who has issued guidelines for the surveillance of possible sars cases risk categories to guide adequate national surveillance strategies to guard against the possible re-emergence of sars are emergence from wildlife or other animal reservoirs emergence or introduction from laboratories or via international travel or low risk of sars-cov emergence or introductionwho also urges all countries to conduct an inventory of all laboratories working with or storing sars-cov and to ensure strict enforcement of biosafety proceduresbefore sars only two coronaviruses hcov-229 e and hcov-oc43 were known to infect humans because they both cause only relatively minor disease and are difficult to propagate in the laboratory they received relatively little attention by diagnostic and research laboratories in contrast several coronaviruses were recognized as animal pathogens infecting pigs dogs rabbits cats mice rats turkeys and chicken some of these had for some time played important roles in veterinary medicineit was obvious that the majority of human sars cases were acquired through transmission from other sars sufferers which proved key to its eventual control however it seemed highly unlikely that this was a previously existing disease entity that was only then being recognized its propensity to cause nosocomial outbreaks often in hospital settings would not have been overlooked for longthe very first sars cases were identified retrospectively in various localities in guangdong province the first of these early cases occurred in foshan in november 2002 and several more over the following weeks in nearby places interest soon focused on these early index cases was there any characteristic these patients had in common that could point to a source of their sars-cov infectionthere was indeed many of these early index patients either worked in kitchens or at markets or lived nearby where they were constantly exposed to a multitude of species of domestic and wild animals that were being traded kept in captivity and finally slaughtered and prepared for consumptionthis provided the impetus for studying animals being sold at guangdong markets infection with coronaviruses closely related to sars-cov was identified in different species most commonly in the masked palm civet paguma larvata but also in the chinese ferret badger melogale moschata and the raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides a further small sars outbreak occurred again in guangdong in late 2003early 2004 molecular analysis of virus isolates from human cases and animals sampled at the same place and time confirmed that this was zoonotically acquired from paguma larvatahowever further investigations revealed that this widely consumed species is most likely not the animal reservoir as most populations studied were uninfected later research identified a multitude of coronaviruses in different species of bats in asia and elsewhere among them what is probably the progenitor of sars-covstudies by different groups demonstrate that sars was the result of spillover from a wildlife reservoir  most likely bats  into an intermediate host or hosts most importantly paguma larvata and from there to the human population rapid viral evolution was demonstrated and most likely was the pivotal factor that allowed sars-cov to rapidly adapt to nonreservoir species table 1
shows the distribution of several different coronaviruses in humans and animals and their classification into different groupsdisease caused by sars-cov may present with rather nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms the differential diagnosis is therefore wide and may include various common respiratory pathogens including influenza parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial viruses rsvthe laboratory diagnosis of sars remains a challenge in fact despite the rapid identification of sars-cov as the etiological agent testing contributed little to the successful control of the 2003 outbreak insufficient test specificity on occasions caused false-positive results leading to considerable confusion in many viral diseases virus shedding is greatest during the early symptomatic phase that is around and immediately following the onset of symptoms unfortunately virus excretion is comparatively low during the initial phase of sars it peaks in respiratory specimens and in stools at around day 10 after the onset of the clinical illnessin addition there are currently no laboratory tests available to reliably diagnose sars in the first few days of illness the highest test sensitivity is achieved with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or lung biopsy tissue at the onset of illness because of the invasiveness of such procedures and the associated risk of transmission nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat washings taken with respiratory precautions and preserved in viral transport medium remain the most important diagnostic specimensmost commonly viral genome detection usually by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr is used diagnostically nucleic acid amplification tests have been designed targeting the orf1b or nucleoprotein genes it has not been clearly proven in clinical studies that they are superiorreal-time rt-pcr of nasopharyngeal aspirates is the most sensitive and rapid method furthermore the determination of viral load in nasopharyngeal specimens or serum has been shown to be of clinical value as it is an important prognostic factorto avoid false-positive results who stipulates that the following should be tested at least two different clinical specimen types eg nasopharyngeal aspirate and stool or the same type of clinical specimen but collected on at least two occasions during the course of the illness eg sequential nasopharyngeal aspirates or the same original clinical sample but two different assays or by repeating the same assay but using a new rna extract for each testsars-cov is cultivable on vero and caco2 cells not only from respiratory materials but also from fecal samples figure 2
 once isolated the virus must be identified as sars-cov using further tests cell culture is a very demanding test but currently with the exception of animal trials the only means to show the existence of a live virusantigen detection in respiratory and fecal specimens using enzyme immunoassay eia is generally less sensitive than rt-pcr however antigen detection in serum specimens with monoclonal antibodies or monospecific polyclonal antibody against the viral n protein was found to be a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of sars as serum antibody levels start to rise from day 7 after onset of illness the sensitivity of the serum antigen assay progressively decreased to 0 at day 21antibody testing allows the indirect diagnosis of sars-cov infection and is unsuitable during the acute illness positive antibody test results indicate previous infection with sars-cov seroconversion from negative to positive or a fourfold rise in the antibody titer from acute to convalescent serum indicates a recent infection a negative antibody test result later than 21 days after the onset of illness is likely to indicate that no infection with sars-cov has taken placevirus-specific serum igg igm and iga antibodies against sars-cov appear at around the same time between days 5 and 17 after the onset of symptoms antibody testing is therefore generally not useful during the first week of illness for antibody testing the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test is more commonly performed than the neutralizing antibody test in cell cultures that again requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory figure 3
 a recombinant nucleocapsid eia may be used as a rapid screening test and possesses a higher sensitivity with detection as early as day 5 after onset of illness single low-titer positive antibody results can be due to cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses and require confirmation by more specific western blotting or neutralization assays who regards seroconversion or an at least fourfold rise in antibody titer between an acute and a convalescent serum as proof of infectionthe updated who guidelines for the global surveillance of sars of october 2004 replace all previous who guidance on sars surveillance and response one key recommendation is that independent of the test used who strongly recommends that during the interepidemic period all countries seek verification of laboratory-confirmed cases of sars preliminary positive cases preferably by an external laboratory that is part of the who sars international reference and verification laboratory network figure 4
human sars-cov are no longer circulating in the human population nevertheless the virus is still present in the animal reservoir and virological laboratories and can reemerge anytime there is no single test that can be used to diagnose sars with a reasonable degree of accuracy diagnosis therefore continues to rely on the clinical examination supported by case definitions that include the risk assessment according to the 2004 updated who guidelines table 2 table 3
 the initial symptoms of sars are nonspecific complicating the differential diagnosis the mean incubation period is 5 days with the range of 210 days although there are isolated reports of longer incubation periods unlike influenza virus where the patients are most infectious in the first 2 days of illness transmission from symptomatic sars patients usually occurred on or after the fifth day of onset of disease which is in line with the rising viral load in nasopharyngeal secretions that peaked at around day 10 there have been no reports of transmission occurring before the onset of symptoms the typical clinical presentation of sars is that of viral pneumonia with rapid respiratory deterioration patients initially develop influenza-like prodromal symptoms fever malaise myalgia headache rigors and nonproductive cough are the major presenting symptoms whereas rhinorrhea and sore throat are less frequently seen clinical deterioration often accompanied by watery diarrhea commonly occurs 1 week after the onset of illness although history of fever is the most frequently reported symptom it may be absent on initial measurement severe cases develop rapidly progressing respiratory distress and oxygen desaturation with approximately 20 requiring intensive care chest radiographs typically show ground-glass opacities and focal consolidations especially in the periphery and subpleural regions of the lower zones progressive involvement of both lungs is not uncommon features during the later stages have sometimes included spontaneous pneumothorax pneumomediastinum subpleural fibrosis and cystic changes nosocomial transmission of sars-cov has been a striking feature of the sars outbreak the majority of the cases have occurred in adults children are less commonly affected than adults and usually have a milder illness the overall mortality rate was approximately 10 age and the presence of comorbidities are poor prognostic indicatorsalthough the sars outbreak was still ongoing during the first half of 2003 significant funding was made available for sars-related researchimmunomodulators ie corticosteroids intravenous immunoglobulins thymosin and anti-tnf were empirically used for the treatment of sars during the initial epidemic the correlation between viral load and clinical outcome suggests that suppression of viral replication by effective antiviral drugs should be the key to preventing morbidity and mortality numerous potential antiviral agents have been identified using different approaches in vitro susceptibility test results demonstrate that ifn-alpha and ifn-beta have some potential activity ribavirin has good activity when tested in human caco-2 cells despite its lack of activity in vero cellsthe viral proteases are important targets for the development of antiviral drugs protease inhibitors like nelfinavir glycyrrhizin chloroquine and many others as well as many herbal formulations have been found to possess some antiviral activity against sars-cov in vitro in addition the use of nitric oxide s-nitro-n-acetylpenicillamine inhalation as an experimental form of rescue therapy for sars appeared to have inhibitory activity against sars-cov screening of chemical libraries has identified several inhibitors of the viral protease and helicase identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as an obligatory cellular receptor for sars-cov contributed to understanding of the sars-cov entry process and helped to characterize two targets of antiviral therapeutics the sars-cov spike protein and ace2 however most of the chemicals or approaches have not been evaluated in human or animal modelsvarious approaches toward producing a vaccine against sars have been pursued including the use of inactivated sars-cov plasmid dna and adenovirus vectors one obvious problem any vaccine would face is whom it should be given to in the absence of sars-cov transmission however waiting until a renewed outbreak occurs before commencing vaccination means that precious weeks would be lost until individuals at risk become immunethe administration of preformed antibodies obtained from human or animal donors or more recently produced in vitro is effective in preventing a number of different infections such as hepatitis b varicella and rsv similarly it could be shown that neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov can protect experimental animals from infectionusing screening of a large naive antibody library by antibody phage display technology neutralizing antibodies were identified and produced that were protective in vitro there was no evidence of enhancement of sars-cov infection by subneutralizing concentrations of these antibodies and immune escape mutants were not generatedin theory this could be an ideal tool if sufficient stocks of such human monoclonal antibodies could be procured they would be ready for use when and wherever sars reemerges one could then passively immunize anyone in contact with the source or patients affording immediate protectionin summary sars was a novel severe infectious disease that presumably originated in guangdong in southern china large-scale wildlife trade and consumption favored the emergence of this zoonosis from a hitherto unrecognized animal reservoir after its zoonotic origins the new agent quickly spread within the human population being transmitted mostly via the respiratory route through close human-to-human contactsars was rapidly disseminated via the metropolis hong kong through international air travel its important potential for nosocomial transmission in the community and in hospitals was soon recognized and allowed for appropriate measures to be instituted in most placesthere was an unprecedented rapid gain of knowledge through global networking and international collaboration led by who unfortunately it took some major outbreaks some of them affecting industrialized countries with modern health care systems until the first sars epidemic was controlled thus in the end rapid success was achieved through traditional sanitary measures mainly rapid identification of suspect cases and isolation of the diseasedfortunately sars-cov has  at least so far  not established itself permanently in the human population its relatively low transmissibility with the exception of superspreaders led to a low basic reproduction number r0 together with the fact that infected individuals only become infectious themselves once they have developed clinical disease this made traditional public health measures very effectiveis the fact that the first pandemic of the twenty-first century was quickly contained reason to take comfort in the knowledge that the history of humankind has reached a phase in which biomedical sciences and information technology are able to deal with such threats probably notfirst the rapid success was remarkable unfortunately though this does not reflect preparedness in 1998 donald burke proposed the following criteria for identifying virus families with a high pandemic risk 1 those that had caused pandemics in human populations in the recent past 2 those with the proven ability to cause larger epizootics and 3 those with an intrinsic propensity to rapidly undergo evolution on the basis of high mutation rate or genome organization favoring recombination intrinsic evolvabilityinterestingly even before the sars outbreak which obviously fulfills the first criterion the coronavirus family should clearly have been regarded as high risk starting in the late 1970s the porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus pedv caused a severe swine epizootic in europe and asia second criterion the high evolvability of the coronavirus family had also been demonstrated the porcine respiratory coronavirus prcv evolved through a deletion mutation in the s gene from the transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev the mutant has a different tissue tropism and is less virulentsecond infectious disease emergence from zoonotic sources was a well-recognized threat long before sars nevertheless it took another  fortunately minor  sars outbreak before decisive steps were taken to control at least the trade in the directly implicated paguma larvata in southern chinastarting shortly after sars had been controlled another agent with pandemic potential has caused an ongoing epizootic of unprecedented proportions highly pathogenic influenza a h5n1 virus transmission to humans occurs almost exclusively through close contact with infected  and sick  poultry despite the possibility that this avian influenza virus will become fully humanized and trigger the next influenza pandemic even activities recognized as high risk such as wet markets have mostly not been curtailedfinally the lessons from sars  particularly the experiences of beijing toronto and taiwan that suffered devastating sars outbreaks during the later phase of the outbreak  emphasize over and over again the enormous importance of open and timely communication at times this may mean admitting to problems that at least initially reflect negatively on the country or

cooperation modern science and rigorous use of traditional approaches even if prudent precautions were suddenly adopted sars will certainly not have been the last highly pathogenic novel infectious agent that crosses the species barrier into the human populationalthough bats must be very high on the list of culprits for emerging viral diseases having been identified as reservoir hosts for a

recent times although in the case of sars people were lucky in the end this may be quite different next time round it will be important to improve understanding of emergence to minimize the risks of what is a natural phenomenon but much aggravated by human behaviorthe management of febrile infants younger than 3 months in the emergency room er is challenging as they have a higher risk of serious bacterial infection sbi than older children and because clinical evaluation has a low sensitivity and specificity in identifying those infants with sbi1-6 therefore additional examinations are usually performed to diagnose sbi or to identify those infants at higher and lower risk of sbi accordingly a large proportion of these infants considered at higher risk of sbi are admitted to the hospital and treated empirically with intravenous antibiotics while awaiting microbiological confirmation whereas those at lower risk of sbi can be managed as outpatients provided adequate surveillance can be ascertained1-6traditional viral and bacterial diagnostic techniques allow to find the etiology of febrile episodes in about half of the cases only78 with the development of molecular techniques the ability to diagnose viral infections has improved substantially in recent years multiple real-time polymerase chain reactions pcrs have been developed increasing the detection rate for cultivable viruses or allowing the detection of non- or difficult-to-cultivate viruses9 more recently techniques such as multiplex pcrs or microarrays allow the codetection of large panels of viruses in a single assay10 furthermore these new tools can now generate accurate results within a few hours11 in several clinical situations rapid report of microbial pathogens identification from clinical specimens has been shown to significantly improve the management and the outcome of infected patients enabling rapid adjustment of antibiotic treatments shortened hospital stay and lower hospitalization costs1213 regarding the management of febrile infants younger than 3 months several authors have shown that infants presenting a proven viral infection have a significantly lower risk of sbi14-18 an early diagnosis of a viral infection could help consider a larger proportion of febrile infants at lower risk for sbi and lead to a more conservative approach regarding additional invasive procedures antibiotic treatments or hospital admission while the molecular techniques allowing this early diagnosis are more expensive than conventional methods their real clinical benefits remain poorly studiedthe aims of this prospective study were to evaluate the analytical performances of a multiplex diagnostic tool detecting the most frequent respiratory viruses as compared with our set of homemade real-time pcrs and the potential contribution of these molecular methods to the etiologic diagnosis of febrile episodes in infants younger than 3 months of lifethe study was conducted at

observation while 23 required supportive treatment one single episode classified as low risk at er discharge ended to be a bacterial proven infection namely a campylobacter jejuni enteritis among the 59 infants with febrile episodes considered at low risk of sbi and hospitalized for observation 42 71 ended to have a documented viral infectionthis is the first prospective study reporting the contribution of a large panel of techniques including molecular methods for multiple respiratory viruses to establish the etiology of febrile episodes in infants younger than 3 months we evaluated the possible contribution on clinical decisions in parallel with the chronology of the availability of the laboratory results that led to episode documentation our study presents the limitation of having been conducted mainly during the autumn-winter season in a single center this can explain the important rate of infants presenting respiratory symptoms nevertheless the rate of sbi is similar to those reported in the literature235 as is the predominance of uti among our sbi demonstrating that our cohort can be considered as representative of the etiologic case mix usually observed among febrile episodes in infants younger than 3 monthsidentifying infants at risk of sbi among those presenting a febrile episode remains an important challenge and several scales based on clinical biological and microbiological data have been recommended1-6 in the past years important advances have been made in terms of laboratory techniques that either help better identify high-risk infants or confirm sbi more rapidly such as procalcitonin level20-24 or rapid bacterial identification from blood culture by maldi-tof matrix-assisted laser desorptionionizationtime-of-flight mass spectrometry25 other authors have focused on detecting infants at low risk of sbi using clinical scores26 documenting a viral infection has also been shown to contribute to identify febrile infants at low risk of sbi9-13 however as having a proven viral infection does not fully rule out the risk of sbi especially uti15-17 viral tests cannot replace blood or urine analysis but must be seen as additional tools in the management of these patientscurrent routine viral tests are rapid and relatively sensitive in pediatric population but are available for a limited number of viruses only as a consequence viral infection is not always documented on time to affect the clinical carein our study the infants considered at low risk of sbi when discharged from the er that finally turned out to have a proven viral infection represented about 20 of the total cohort n  42 these numbers are similar to those published by huppler et al who identified in a large meta-analysis of 21 studies a similar rate of infants 30 that were observed without receiving empiric antibiotic therapy or sent back home after being identified at low-risk27this population namely low risk infants with a presumed viral infection is probably the population that could benefit the most from adding molecular tools to their management sparing them the bundle of downsides associated with hospitalization and empiric antibiotic therapy including costs adverse effects development of resistant organisms nosocomial infections and psychosocial stress on family dynamicsthe present evaluation demonstrates that molecular techniques greatly improve the detection rate of viral infections especially in the challenging group of febrile infants without clinical source among which the increase in microbiological documentation was nearly 20 the clart pneumovir was the most powerful tool tested multiplexing 11 viral targets with a sensitivity rate of 96 and a negative predictive value of 95 however it also presented 2 potential drawbacks its lack of specificity false-positive results for rhinoviruses and the fact it does not target all circulating coronavirusesunfortunately as the molecular methods used here are expensive and need trained staff they are not yet routinely used in the management of febrile infants younger than 3 months28 furthermore to be useful in clinical practice the results of these techniques should be available during the timespan in which patients management treatment and follow-up are decided new sample-in answer-out point-of-care platforms that enable fully automated detection of comprehensive panels of respiratory pathogens in about 1 hour are now available and should soon enable this expected improvement of patients management29in conclusion our study demonstrates that the use of molecular techniques increases to 76 the proportion of documented etiology in febrile episodes in infants younger than 3 months we have also identified the population in which these techniques have the highest contribution making these tests available 24 hours24 and 7 days7 could help lightening the management of these patientsour study provides adequate information to design a prospective study

of the workcoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 formerly known as 2019-ncov appeared in china for the first time and subsequently spread worldwide 12 on 30 january 2020 the world health organization who officially announced the covid-19 epidemics as a threat to public health internationally and subsequently in march 2020 the global situation escalated into the covid-19 pandemic johns hopkins university reported over 7600000 cases of infection and more than 427000 deaths as of 13 june 2020 3 as a result of this rapidly progressing covid-19 pandemic and the limited laboratory-based molecular testing capacities new point-of-care poc scalable rapid diagnostic tests have been invented recently as easy-to-use tools to allow covid-19 diagnostics outside of laboratory settings what is more the urgent need to multiply testing for covid-19 has been clearly identified as an essential element of the anti-coronavirus strategy all over the worldthe diagnostic sensitivity specificity and accuracy concerning suspected covid-19 infection based on controlled testing and performance data from clinical settings is of substantial importance in the context of limiting the scope of coronavirus epidemics unreliable and unproved tests may not detect patients with active infection or may incorrectly indicate covid-19-negative patients as positive hampering healthcare efforts the diagnostic laboratory and point-of-care tests pocts used in order to detect sars-cov-2 are first of all reference tests based on molecular technique real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay rt-qpcr as well as serological antibody-detecting and antigen-detecting tests for auxiliary purposes at present only molecular quantitative reverse transcription pcr rt-qpcr testing of respiratory tract samples is the recommended method for the identification and laboratory confirmation of covid-19 cases as these methods were evaluated for their quality and safety through the world health organization who protocols 45 on the other hand based on current scientific evidence who recommends the use of poc immunodiagnostic tests for research purposes and at present they should not be utilized in a clinical decision-making setting and in patient care until fully validated with supporting data available however they can be useful in epidemiologic research or disease surveillance and further evolve as a critical step to develop covid-19 vaccine in future at the time of increased demand for hospital services clinicians governments and health services urgently need a fast sensitive but at the same time inexpensive diagnostic test in order to rapidly manage patients regarding admissions to hospitals meant for covid-19 treatment therefore the role of an approved and reliable diagnostic test in the covid-19 care pathway is of the utmost importanceas in the case of other infectious diseases the rt-qpcr method as well as serological tests are suitable for the in vitro diagnostics ivd of patients suspected of being infected with sars-cov-2 genetic assay based on the rt-qpcr technique performed in real time especially plays a role at the early stages of viral infection when the virus multiplies quickly as this technique enables direct detection of the pathogens genetic material a different approach in diagnosing infection is represented by serological methods based on detectingin blood serumof antibodies that act specifically against viral proteins which are produced in response to sars-cov-2 serological ivd tests detect antibodies which are responsible for neutralizing the virus therefore this implies that they are used when the immunological reaction against sars-cov-2 virus is already taking place these ivd measures can determine how fast antibodies fighting the virus are produced which may influence the identification of subjects who already developed immunity the results of serological ivd tests should not be used as basis for diagnosing ruling out infection with sars-cov-2 or informing about infection status 6the relatively quick discovery of the composition of the full genome of sars-cov-2 early during the epidemics made it easier to develop specific starters and normalized laboratory protocols for covid-19 the protocol of the first rt-qpcr test focused on rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp envelope e and nucleocapsid n of sars-cov-2 was published very early indeed at the end of january 2020 providing a brief description the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 is equipped with a receptor-binding domain rbd a structure similar to the original sars-cov that emerged for the first time in 2002 functionally important orfs 1a and 1b and other main structural proteins including the spike s membrane m envelope e and nucleocapsid n proteins are also well interrelated and clearly annotated according to previous reports the m and e proteins are essential for virus assembly while the s protein is crucial for affinity and attachment to host cells as the rbd of the s protein enables binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 the s protein on the surface of the viral particles and has been reported to be highly immunogenic the n protein the main structural protein of sars-cov-2 is responsible for the transcription and replication of viral rna the packaging of the encapsulated genome into virions and interactions with the cell cycle of host cells in addition coronaviruses contain the n protein which has a substantial immunogenic ability and is abundantly expressed during viral infection figure 1 the sn proteins are targeted as potential antigens for serodiagnosis of covid-19 similarly to other diagnostic methods that were implemented for diagnosing sars disease based on sn proteins 7the progress made in recent years in the diagnostics of infections enables the application often simultaneously of numerous methods in order to detect respiratory viruses effectively the choice of suitable tests depends upon the type of virus to be detected the presumed number of antigens patient population to be tested as well as the technical abilities and experience of the testing unit the validation of rt-qpcr tests seems to be an important step in combating the new coronavirus one of the most significant parameters regarding the efficiency of the diagnostic procedure is most probably the one related to the minimum amount of analyte which may be detected and quantitatively determine by means of a particular test the parameters describing those properties are known as limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq in many laboratories lod is used interchangeably with sensitivity analytical sensitivity orand detection limit this may be misleading though as sensitivity is also understood and used in other ways sensitivity and clinical diagnostic specificity are two different parameters diagnostic sensitivity is the proportion of true positive results to the sum of true positive and true negative results a sensitivity ratio of 100 implies that all the sick people have been identified the specificity of a test is the proportion of true negative results to the sum of true negative and false positive ones the specificity of 100 implies that all healthy people in a given test have been correctly identified as healthynot having the condition as indicated in table 2 sensitivity and specificity of tests is already about 100 with a few exceptions still one can notice differences in analytical sensitivity of the test lod the vast majority of molecular tests kits contain a so-called internal positive control ipc that can be utilized either as an extraction control or internal control the ipc is essential for an evaluation of whether the genetical material extraction procedure and amplification stage were carried out correctly the failure in ipc detection using a patients specimen may indicate the improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical material as a consequence of nucleic acid loss or the transposition of pcr inhibitors and the lack of sufficient biological material in the collected sample it needs to be noted that many molecular tests may not provide sets for extraction stages and they need to be acquired separately however all tests reviewed here that detect the rna of sars-cov-2 contain ipcanother important factor which describes a diagnostic test is the analytical specificity it is the ability of a test to detect a specific target eg a virus it is of great importance to check whether the starters used in pcr test are specific to a given virus there are two components of analytical sensitivity cross-reactivity and interference cross-reactivity may occur if in a sample collected from a patient there are organisms which are genetically related that imitate the virus analysed which causes test starters to cross react as shown in table 3 the producers have analysed their tests from the perspective of cross-reactivity unfortunately that analysis is selective and does not concern the same micro-organismsamong the many contemporary technologies available special attention should be paid to rapid lateral flow immunoassay lfia also referred to as immunochromatographic tests perhaps they are not so much appreciated in the scientific community as pcr methods or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa tests despite the fact that they do find application in diagnostics more and more often they differ depending on the type of test but the basic principle of their action is invariably the samethey make use of the unique property that antibodies possess that of selective binding to a specific particle or group of similar particles antigen lfias provide an uncomplicated and relatively inexpensive tool meant for detecting the presence or absence of a given component in the examined specimen such as the presence of a virus in an analyzed blood sample examination with the use of those tests is possible for various types of test materialwhole human blood blood plasma serum stool urine sweat cerebrospinal fluid or even tears 9 the test principle is based on an immunological method using specific antibodies most often in complex with colloidal gold where a drop of the examined substance first moves along the nitrocellulose membrane using capillary phenomena after the sample is absorbed by the membrane the antigen should the test prove to be positive binds to the colloidal gold complex and respective antibodies consequently the effect of that reaction is the formation of a complex which will be detected by the test the interpretation of results consists of confirmation or ruling out of the presence of antigens in the examined sample based on color test strips that appear in the test 2122 the brief comparison of advantages and disadvantages of immunochromatographic tests is presented in table 4at present most immunoenzymatic tests available are based on the immunochromatic technique the difference between those tests depends upon the molecule assayed pc or antigens structure performance time and diagnostic material it may be supposed that in future rapid tests will enable easier and quicker diagnostics of many diseases without the necessity of performing tedious and complicated procedures this would reduce the waiting time for obtaining results and accelerate decision making regarding suitable treatment 272829the detection of specific sars-cov-2 serum antibodies allows for a rapid cost-effective and reasonably sensitive clinical diagnosis of covid-19 as immunoglobulins such as igm provide the initial humoral response during the first stage of viral infection prior to the onset of the adaptive high-affinity igg response essential for long-term immunological memory research indicates that after sars infection antibodies of the igm class may be detected in patients blood about 6 days after the infection while igg may be already detected after 8 days as sars-cov-2 belongs to the same large family of viruses which includes those causing middle east respiratory syndrome mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars it should be assumed that the process of producing antibodies will be similar to that in case of other viruses belonging to that family while the detection of igg antibodies and igm antibodies acting against sars-cov-2 may be an indication of infection moreover the detection of igm antibodies usually indicates a recent exposure to sars-cov-2 whereas the detection of igg antibodies in case of covid-19 indicates exposure to the virus some time ago 30serological tests detecting solely the igm class of antibodies should find applications for diagnostic purposes when using tests which detect both igm and igg antibodies one should remember that a positive result may be the evidence of past infection not active infection table 5 negative results from serological tests do not exclude sars-cov-2 infection as the window period delay in the production of antibodies may exceed 7 days serological tests may also give false positive results this may be the case of past or ongoing infection with virus strains other than sars-cov-2 such as coronavirus hku1 nl63 oc43 or 229e moreover the first tests assessing the titer of iga class antibodies have been launched which from the perspective of immunology is of extreme importance as it provides the possibility of testing for antibodies in a material other than blood samples collected from patients eg respiratory tract secretionsserological tests are thus applied as an adjunctive method for monitoring the epidemiological situation yet they may be performed faster and are less costly than genetic tests this diagnostic method has a limited sensitivity yet efforts to improve it are ongoing as it is useful for monitoring the infection due to insufficient data concerning among others the dynamics of immunological response to infection and the diagnostic value of available tests for detecting igm and igg class antibodies comprising sensitivity specificity positive and negative predictive value in many countries it is currently not recommended to use serological tests for diagnostic purposes table 6 displays the evaluation of serological tests validated by the fda and table 7 provides a comparison of the selected immunochromatographic tests for sars-cov-2 based on sensitivity specificity sample type and test performance timein serological ivd the so-called window period is of much importancethat is the time when specific antibodies are not yet detectable in a patients blood in the initial phase of an infection the production of antibodies is initiated but their level is still low and thus test results may prove negative anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies appear quite late ie a few days after clinical manifestations which is why serological tests cannot be used as a basic tool in diagnosing sars-cov-2 infections 32the detection of specific anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies is possible about 10 days after the first clinical manifestations of infection thus this serves the purpose of confirming contact with coronavirus and is of enormous importance from an epidemiological perspective as it allows us to detect subjects who had the infection but were asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic and could have been the source of infection for other people silent carriersvectors it also allows us to determine the spread of covid-19 infection in the population a comparative review of currently available serological immunodiagnostic covid-19 tests is presented in table 8the protein microarray method pmm is a proteomic screening technique serving the purpose of simultaneousparallel quantitative and qualitative analysis of mixtures containing many proteins the chip used is composed of a supporting surface eg modified glass plate nitrocellulose membrane or microtitration plate on which the matrix of capturing proteins is immobilized in accordance with the determined formula performing the function of a probe the material captured may be antibodies enzymes or ligands protein analyte added to the matrix may be modified by means of various types of markers among others radioisotopes fluorescence luminescence markers the interaction between micromatrix proteins and analyte induces an analytical signal registered by means of suitable equipment the advantages of protein micromatrices include the short time required for analysis modest consumption of samples and reagents high sensitivity automation of testing they allow us to investigate the functions and effects of proteins on large scale 3334the newly developed pepperchip sars-cov-2 proteome microarray pepperprint based on the sars-cov-2 genome derived from the virus isolate wuhan-hu-1 genbank id mn9089473 enables us to serologically screen about 5000 individual peptides spanning the whole viral proteome sequences of orf1ab protein surface glycoprotein orf3a protein coat protein membrane glycoprotein orf6 protein orf7a protein orf8 protein nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and orf10 protein have been elongated and connected by means of neutral gsgsgsg connectors the elongated protein sequences have been transcribed into 4883 different peptides composed of 15 amino acids printed in two repetitions 9766 peptide sites in order to obtain high-resolution epitope data in the case of sars-cov which emerged in 2002 it was demonstrated that the application of pmm is characterized by enhanced sensitivity as more chinese subjects were diagnosed as sars-positive when applying pmm in comparison with elisa tests the pmm seems to be more reliable as it allows us to determine more protein antigens of the virus 35 an additional advantage of such tests is the possibility of automating the entire analytical process unfortunately the method has several imperfections including the repeatability of the test itself while the cost of the testing and equipment used for micromatrix diagnostics is significant which makes the pmm method less accessible in standard laboratory settings 36undoubtedly the scalable and reliable pocts used in the community and outside laboratories would have the opportunity to reduce the time to obtain covid-19 diagnostic results and might support early implementation of isolation resources and infection control measures from a medical workforce point of view antibody- and antigen-detecting tests appear to have a significant role in identifying healthcare workers who recovered from sars-cov-2 infection to assess their suitability to provide frontline health services on the other hand the false negative serology tests could cause spread of covid-19 unjustified reassurance and a change in public behavior undoubtedly the negative results of serology tests swabs should not be treated as definitive for ruling out but a positive test results are beneficial to rule in coronavirus infection the sufficient accuracy of serology tests used more widely will allow us to make an appropriate decision regarding lifting restrictions on a national level nevertheless the wider implementation of pocd will ultimately support public health strategies about the potential lifting of social distancing restrictions in future 30 moreover with the limited data available at present for antibody-detecting and antigen-detecting rapid pocd further intense research into their potential diagnostic utility is highly encouraged if these tests demonstrate adequate accuracy it is likely that they could potentially be used as triage tests for quick identification of patients who are suspected of contracting covid-19 reducing the need for expensive reference molecular pcr testing 46 finally it is worth noting the psychological and behavioral consequences of correctly established and known immunity status within the communityrecently a test has been developed based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crisprcas12a with visual readouts the test can detect 10 copies of the virus gene in merely 45 min providing simple and reliable diagnostic method which additionally demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in order to enable fast diagnosis at the hospital or on admission the test has been provided with an ssdna reporter labeled with a blank green fluorescent particle which will be split off by the cas12a protein when the nucleic acid of sars-cov-2 is found in the detection system in this way a green signal of fluorescence will be obtained visible with the naked eye in the light with a wavelength of 485 nm the high specificity of the test was obtained by designing 15 crrnas which may distinguish the polymorphisms of a single nucleotide with other viruses related to sars in four domains orf1a or orf1b n and e genes 37the search for new diagnostic methods is continued because sars-cov-2 is spread by droplets while the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity index for rt-qpcr tests is the highest for broncho-alveolar lavage bal higher than for sputum or nosethroat swabs scientists recently proposed the use of exhaled breath condensate ebc for diagnostic purposes ebc is most similar in its biochemical composition and origin to bal examinations with the use of ebc are a relatively novel diagnostic method used mainly to assess inflammation within the respiratory tract and its components reflect the composition of the fluid lining the bronchi and alveoli ebc is a condensed form of small droplets of the fluid lining the lungs which is usually exhaled it contains various components from small ions to proteins and organelles it may even contain viruses fungi and bacteria taking samples of the condensate is safe totally non-invasive easy to perform it may be repeated many times it may also be performed on patients with severe complications of covid-19 its enormous advantage is that in may be performed in small children with the use of special facial masks the course of the examination is such that the patient is requested to exhale when breathing uneventfully for some 10-15 min to an apparatus provided with a cooling system which allows us to accumulate the condensate in which sars-cov-2 may be detected the application of this method seems justified from a public health perspective the false positive results that are presently obtained contribute the continued spread of the virus worldwide 3839the optimization of laboratory diagnostics is the most dynamically developing field in the time of the covid-19 pandemic supporting contemporary medicine government decisions and healthcare strategies the efforts of scientistclinician teams focus first of all upon implementing the most reliable diagnostic tools however because covid-19 is a new nosological entity there are not enough data as of yet that would enable the determination of standards for the interpretation of serological pocts as with any other infectious diseases the diagnostic value of a test is not only about the method of collecting the material the quality of the sample and the equipment applied equally essential pre-analytical considerations are also the time point when a sample is collected as well as a suitable procedure storage and handling prior to analysis from the moment of collecting the biological material to the assaying stageacute respiratory tract infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality especially during the winter months the elderly the immunocompromised and patients with respiratory problems such as emphysema and asthma are particularly vulnerable to developing severe disease viruses that commonly cause respiratory illness include influenza virus parainfluenza virus respiratory syncytial virus rsv adenovirus and human metapneumovirus these viruses produce a range of symptoms including fever rhinitis pharyngitis and myalgia to more serious complications such as bronchitis bronchiolitis pneumonia and death boivin et al 2004 influenza virus and rsv are among the most common viral agents and rapid identification of the aetiology of infection allows better patient management in terms of treatment and infection control woo et al 1997 rapid detection of viral respiratory pathogens is also important for monitoring emerging influenza strains which may cause epidemics or pandemics conventional detection methods for influenza virus include cell culture antigen detection serological tests and immunofluorescent antibody-based ifa methods however these tests are either too slow to allow timely diagnosis or they lack sensitivity and specificity more recently immuno-chromatographic point of care tests poct have been developed which have fast turn around times aslanzadeh et al 2008 selvarangan et al 2008 however these assays often have limitations in sensitivity and specificity when compared to molecular tests boivin et al 2004 the development of molecular diagnostic assays with superior sensitivity and significantly reduced turn around times when compared to conventional methodologies has led to them being considered to be the gold standard for respiratory virus detection leven 2007 numerous real-time rt-pcr assays for the detection of influenza virus and rsv have been described in either monoplex gueudin et al 2003 kuypers et al 2004 smith et al 2003 stone et al 2004 van elden et al 2001 or multiplex format brittain-long et al 2008 gunson et al 2005 hymas and hillyard 2009 the regional health protection agency newcastle laboratory tests all respiratory samples with a panel of in-house multiplex real-time pcr assays which target influenza a and b parainfluenza 14 rsv a and b rhinovirus adenovirus human metapnuemovirus and coronaviruses nl63 oc43 229e however it is not feasible to provide urgent out of hours testing based on this multiplex format therefore alternative virus specific testing is preferable for urgent individual samples a rapid real-time pcr-based diagnostic test for rsv and influenza a and b which can be performed in a relatively short turn around time would be extremely useful for patient management goodrich and miller 2007 in addition the resulting improved treatment of patients presenting with respiratory illness would help infection control reduce nosocomial spread and reduce the length of patient hospital stay woo et al 1997the smartcyler is a rapid random access modular real-time pcr instrument which can perform 40 pcr cycles in less than 1 h habib-bein et al 2003 the aim of this study was to evaluate two multiplex real-time rt-pcr assays on the rapid smartcycler real-time pcr system for the detection of influenza a and b and rsv the assays used the respiratory syncytial virus analyte specific reagent asr bead and the influenza ab asr bead cepheid sunnyvale usa which contain pcr primers and probes in a lyophilized bead format the rsv asr bead contains primers and fam-labelled probes targeting the n nucleocapsid protein gene of rsv types a and b the influenza ab asr bead contains primers and a fam-labelled probe and an alexa fluor 532-labelled probe for the detection and differentiation of influenza a and b respectively when reconstituted the asr bead provides sufficient primers and probes for two 25 l pcr reactions the influenza a and b asr reagents have not been evaluated previously to determine their utility for the detection of influenza in clinical samples from patients with respiratory disease in this study the asr reagents were evaluated in real-time rt-pcr assays using the smartcycler real-time pcr instrument the new assays were applied to the detection of influenza virus and rsv in a collection of samples previously tested using an in-house multiplex real-time rt-pcr assaya collection of 196 respiratory samples from patients with acute respiratory tract infections were tested in this study samples were collected previously during the 20042008 winter respiratory seasons sample types included nasopharangeal aspirates nasal

the diagnosis of respiratory disease leven 2007 multiplex assays targeting a wide range of individual viruses are now considered to be the gold standard for diagnosis of viral respiratory disease and test results can be achieved within a few hours of samples being received in the laboratory stone et al 2004 however the majority of laboratories batch samples together and perform one or more test runs per day therefore turn around times can be slower than other rapid tests such as those used as poct in addition it is not feasible for many laboratories to provide multiplex pcr testing outside of the normal laboratory opening hours therefore alternative pcr-based methods which can be performed using a random access real-time pcr instrument would shorten turn around times with obvious benefits for patient carein this study two rapid real-time pcr assays were evaluated for the detection of influenza and rsv in respiratory samples using the smartcycler real-time pcr instrument the rsv and influenza assays were applied to a total of 196 samples tested previously in our in-house multiplex real-time pcr test and comparison of the results demonstrated a concordance between the two tests of 985 the smartcycler rsv test failed to detect rsv in a single sample which was detected by the in-house multiplex assay this false negative result may have been due to degradation of the sample because the extracted nucleic acids were stored at 80 c for greater than 1 month following testing by the in-house multiplex assay prior to re-testing by the smartcycler assay the sample also produced a high ct value 382 in the original in-house assay indicating it contained relatively low numbers of target virus the smartcycler influenza assay failed to detect influenza a in two samples which were positive for influenza a in the in-house multiplex assay again the extracted nucleic acid from these samples had been stored at 80 c for greater than 1 month therefore sample degradation may have occurred one of these samples also had a relatively high ct value 405 in the in-house assay indicating that it contained low levels of target virus these three samples were re-tested in the in-house assays and the original results confirmed the smartcycler assay also failed to detect influenza b in a sample demonstrated to contain both influenza a and b again this may have been due to sample degradation during storage or alternatively this may reflect differences in the sensitivity of the smartcycler assay for the different influenza types finally these false negative results in both the smartcycler rsv and influenza assays may be due to sequence variation in the target gene of the assays which may adversely affect the binding of the primers or probesinterestingly the ct values generated by the smartcycler assays for the positive samples were lower than those of the in-house test eg influenza b mean reduction in ct value was 74 sd  16 indicating that the smartcycler assay may be more sensitive than the in-house test alternatively these differences may be due to the way the two real-time pcr instruments calculated their ct values relative to the automatically calculated threshold and cut offs the positive predictive value of the smartcycler tests were 100 for both rsv and influenza and the negative predictive value was 977 and 951 respectively for rsv and influenzathe smartcycler asr bead-based primers and probes simplified the assay preparation steps reducing the time taken for assay set up considerably when compared with our in-house assay if this assay plus the random access real-time pcr system was used in conjunction with a rapid nucleic acid extraction instrument such as the qiagen ez1 instrument barkham 2006 dundas et al 2008 sample turn around times could be significantly reduced and pcr assay set up simplified this may facilitate the more urgent testing of respiratory samples by real-time pcr methods outside of the normal working day or outside of the batched runs during normal working day overall the asr bead-based assay and the smartcycler instrument provide sensitive specific and rapid detection of rsv and influenza virus in clinical samples from patients with respiratory disease introduction of rapid real-time pcr methods for the diagnosis of illness caused by rsv and influenza particularly outside of the normal laboratory working day would improve patient management and treatmentthroughout human history infectious diseases have had an important role in shaping and evolving our world pandemics and epidemics have been commonplace as the density of the worlds population and international travel and trade have increased to support the global spread of pathogens microbial pathogens are constantly evolving and new pathogens are continually emerging from nature the recent emergence of many new pathogens including hiv enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli west nile virus legionella pneumophila cryptococcus neoformans subspecies gattii and various influenza a strains is actually biology taking its normal course as microorganisms evolve to exploit new or altered ecological niches12 therefore it is no surprise that the first pandemic of the twenty-first century appeared quickly late in 2002 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov causing significant morbidity approximately 8500 cases and mortality 774 deaths and had an estimated economic impact of us 90 billion worldwide3the sars outbreak provided an excellent opportunity to attempt to harness the power of modern science to provide rapid solutions to a public health emergency and placed pressure on many microbiologists worldwide to identify and sequence the virus characterize the disease apply modern epidemiological techniques to track and trace the virus and its origins and develop strategies to treat and control the pathogen worldwide scientists responded to these challenges with extreme vigour and many achievements were made fig 1 including identifying the causative agent sequencing its genome developing animal models of infection and determining where the pathogen originated in nature and how it was globally spread in human communities however despite the acquisition of this large body of scientific information as sars was spreading around the world a method of controlling the virus was required in case it escaped containment measures this meant that alternative therapeutic and preventative methods were urgently neededthe development of vaccines and other therapeutic agents usually takes at least a decade and costs hundreds of millions of dollars yet a practical solution for sars was needed before the beginning of the next respiratory virus season in addition other new microbial threats are likely to emerge and scientists will again be asked to provide rapid solutions so a fast and successful response to sars could provide an example of how science can be effectively applied in response to other new and emerging diseasesunfortunately the usual scientific process is not designed to be focused on quickly solving a practical problem grant applications peer review and funding mechanisms are traditionally not rapid processes responding to emerging infectious diseases of pressing public health importance requires a scientific process that is significantly different from traditional procedures such a response must focus the science directly on a practical solution to the problem and solve several scientific problems in parallel instead of in sequence the sars pandemic provided the perfect opportunity to attempt to develop such a system
a savi solution to sars
with the emergence of sars many scientific groups worldwide began to study the disease canada was particularly affected by sars  there were 438 cases 44 deaths and a world health organization who travel health advisory was issued  and therefore had a strong interest in the pandemic34 the michael smith genome sciences centre in vancouver had an emergency management plan in place that allowed the entire facility to be dedicated to the rapid sequencing of an infectious agent in collaboration with the british columbia centre for disease control and health which supplied the sars clinical virus strain known as toronto 2 or tor-2 this centre generated the first genome sequence of the sars-cov within six days of receiving the viral nucleic acid5 several other groups followed with other genome sequences shortly thereafter67the key to sequencing the genome so quickly was having a rapid response emergency management plan already in place this entailed a top-down management approach to be taken with team members in parallel projects able to dedicate their time and expertise to their assigned tasks this success coupled with the concern that in canada quarantine would not contain the sars-cov led to the provincial british columbia government providing cdn 26 million in april 2003 to establish the sars accelerated vaccine initiative savi that was dedicated to developing a human sars vaccine as rapidly as possible a vaccine approach was chosen for several reasons including previous success with animal coronavirus vaccines the ease of product development and the use of vaccines to prevent infection in cases of defined risk exposure such as healthcare workers in hospitalssavi was established to apply rapid response research to a public health issue it was designed with only one goal  to develop a safe and effective human sars vaccine as rapidly as possible all savi-funded vaccine-development initiatives were evaluated with this goal in mind a senior management committee was established that had significant expertise in animal coronavirus vaccines and epidemiology clinical trials and grant-funding mechanisms an emergency management strategy was adopted with weekly teleconferences between all members as well as regular management committee discussions parallel research strategies were designed with vaccine development as the ultimate goal so in addition to identifying vaccine candidates immunological assays clinical trials regulatory affairs and international collaborations were all developed in parallel instead of sequentially as soon as the genome became available a bioinformatics web site was created which was used by savi scientists as well as many other sars researchers around the world see sars bioinformatics suite in the online links box in addition there was a large demand worldwide for full-length sequenced clones of the various sars coronavirus genes several programmes were put in place to clone and express viral proteins that could be used both as reagents and in vaccine studies methods were developed for growing the virus in tissue culture using vero cells and a neutralization assay was developed both of which were necessary for vaccine developmentan important factor in producing a vaccine quickly is the early availability of information about the basis for immunological protection against disease although the immune correlates for protection against sars-cov are not yet completely defined individuals convalescing from sars are known to develop high titres of neutralizing antibodies8 the appearance of these neutralizing antibodies coincided with the onset of resolution of sars pneumonia910 and as with other coronaviruses11 there is an inverse relationship between disease severity and the levels of pre-existing serum antibodies so neutralizing antibodies are likely to be important in protection against sars t-cell immunity is also likely to be necessary for protection from sars as it is for many other viruses for instance low concentrations of cd4 and cd8 t cells during a sars infection are correlated with increased disease severity and mortality12 and specific human leukocyte antigen hla class i alleles have been correlated with sars susceptibility13 taken together the data indicated that a vaccine for sars would need to induce neutralizing antibodies and possibly cd4 and cd8 t-cell responses this knowledge proved helpful in selecting vaccine candidates and immunization approachesthere are many potential vaccine strategies that can be considered for the sars-cov including a whole killed viral vaccine an attenuated virus such as adenovirus or vaccinia virus expressing sars proteins recombinant sars proteins or dna vaccines successful vaccines have been developed for animal coronaviruses indicating that one or more of these strategies might work information about which sars proteins could be used as candidate vaccine antigens was also obtained from the development of other animal coronavirus vaccines14 these include the spike s surface glycoprotein that is found on the viral surface giving the viral particle a crown and therefore its name and the nucleocapsid n protein that is found inside the viral particle and which packages the rna viral genome fig 2 deciding on which antigens and which vaccine approach to use posed significant challenges as each has both advantages and disadvantagesmost research groups chose a particular vaccine method that they were familiar with by contrast savi chose to develop three vaccine approaches in parallel only making the final decision on which candidate should progress to human clinical trials after a direct comparison of the three vaccines in relevant animal infection models this strategy also provided the opportunity to use more than one vaccine in a prime-boost strategy if necessary although this approach initially required more work it was thought that it would significantly increase the likelihood of a successful vaccine being developed so work began on the three strategies developing whole killed inactivated virus developing a recombinant s protein and modifying adenovirus and vaccinia virus to express the sars-cov s and n proteins both whole killed virus and recombinant s protein were targeted at inducing neutralizing antibodies whereas the adenovirus and vaccinia virus vectors were targeted at inducing both cellular immunity and neutralizing antibodies as the main goal of savi was to expedite vaccine development only approaches and adjuvants that were already approved for use in humans were used in the studies despite the potential advantages of many newer adjuvants15 and technologies such as dna vaccines16 that were not approved by the us food and drug administration fda using this rapid response model savi scientists were able to develop three vaccine candidates within six months these candidates are now being tested in ferret and mice models of sars with results of vaccine efficacy expected by mid-july 2004another important consideration in vaccine testing is the availability of a relevant animal infection and challenge model when the vaccine studies were initiated there were no animal models available but it was assumed that they would be developed quickly as rapid vaccine development was the ultimate goal it was decided assuming they became available to initially test the vaccine candidates in the most relevant animal infection model possible  non-human primates small-animal vaccine models can be misleading and time consuming soon after a macaque infection model was published1718 and significant efforts were made to secure primates for these studies however recently there have been significant concerns that primate models are not the best infection models and tests in many laboratories indicate that they only exhibit mild respiratory infections19 at present ferrets seem to be the most relevant disease model20 and relevant murine models have been developed that allow viral replication21 owing to the high costs of doing primate experiments in biosafety level iii containment facilities and the concerns about the relevance of a primate challenge model at present savi vaccines are first tested in ferrets and mice and then in non-human primates or other small animals for safety and immunogenicity similarly other groups are testing adenoviruses22 modified vaccinia viruses23 and a dna vaccine24 in both murine and macaque models although this additional step adds time to the project it is necessary and imperative to show protection in an animal infection model that closely mimics human disease it was anticipated that testing in multiple animal models would also help eliminate concerns regarding vaccine-induced immune enhancement or immunopathology14
rapid response issues raised
in addition to the fundamental scientific questions associated with vaccine development there are several related issues that impacted directly on the success of the project fig 3intellectual property to successfully commercialize a vaccine a strong intellectual property position is needed25 savi was fortunate in that it is partnered with the group that sequenced the sars-cov and they protected the genome sequence5 however additional intellectual property issues will arise as the project progresses and there will also be pre-existing intellectual property in place that must be incorporated such as the use of live attenuated vectors or protein expression systems savi decided to not make itself a legal entity but to leave the ownership of intellectual property with the inventors and their home universities this saved significant time as intellectual property mechanisms are already established at the various partner universities and issues such as royalty rates are already settled an appropriate way to deal with intellectual property remains a significant challenge worldwide for the development and commercialization of sars vaccinesregulatory issues regulatory issues are another consideration when rapidly developing a vaccine vaccines often take many years to develop yet the need for a sars vaccine was urgent so at the beginning of the initiative discussions were held with the appropriate regulatory bodies health canada and the us fda to gain their support and obtain documents describing regulatory guidelines for biological agents in addition savi worked with regulatory authorities and consultants to define the steps that were needed for vaccine development including the use of clinically approved cell lines for vaccine generation avoidance of animal products for vaccine production identification of plasmids and vectors suitable for human vaccines understanding the vaccine manufacturing process under good manufacturing practice gmp and an understanding of what was needed to file a pre-investigational new drug application for vaccines it was important to establish exactly what was needed and to begin to solve these issues quickly difficult questions arise when one attempts to obtain rapid approval for a vaccine for example can clinical trials take place in a country such as china where sars is prevalent and still be approved for use in north america can the trials be expedited who should the vaccine be tested on  healthcare workers who are at risk in a hospital setting or an at-risk community population what happens if the number of sars cases decreases such that there is not a population that is at risk from sars on which the vaccine can be tested as is currently the case the regulatory agencies in canada and the united states were extremely supportive and willing to work according to a riskbenefit platform and if sars had developed into the next major pandemic they would have done everything possible to expedite the approval process to counter the risk of disease now that sars is currently not a major threat most agree that normal regulatory approval mechanisms should apply and expediting vaccine approval might be unnecessaryhandling the media any major disease outbreak receives significant media attention and there is a continual demand for updates about research progress into potential therapeutics and preventatives such as vaccines therefore mechanisms need to be in place to deal responsibly with media requests as these projects progress consequently a system was established that enabled effective communication with the media as needed and provided a consistent message that handled but did not expand expectations and provided important messages about the progress of the project media briefings were also provided every six months scientific symposia were held every six months to keep the entire savi group of collaborators abreast of progress being made in different areas of the projectfunding mechanisms an important hurdle in rapid response research is distributing funds to researchers in a timely manner the timeframe from starting to write a peer-reviewed grant application to when funds are received in the laboratory is usually more than one year which is unsuitable for rapid response research so rapid funding mechanisms must be established to ensure that appropriate research is carried out in a timely manner when savi was established the michael smith foundation for health research the provincial health research funding agency in british columbia was used to control and dispense the research funds using a five-member senior management committee consisting of senior scientists a rapid review mechanism was established short 2-page focused research proposals together with a proposed research budget which dealt directly with aspects of vaccine development were solicited and accepted from the research community the committee reviewed and evaluated the projects on the basis of scientific merit and the direct need for the project and funds were dispersed to successful applicants immediately  usually 24 hours after the application was submitted while ensuring that applications were peer-reviewed this rapid review process significantly enhanced the speed of the project and proved important in bringing together disparate research communities into a common effort researchers who obtained funding are still held accountable to standard grant regulations and research guidelines including adequate accounting and reporting on completion of the project a project director periodically reviews progress with each of the funded collaborators to ensure adequate progress and relevance as well as coordinating diverse research groupsinternational collaboration and vaccine development as sars was a pandemic international coordination and collaboration was essential the who had an important role in coordinating responses during and following the epidemic in addition in october 2003 the who hosted a meeting in geneva that was attended by nearly all of the main research groups working on the sars-cov and sars vaccines this meeting was useful in many respects including allowing the various groups to discuss strategies and progress resolving intellectual property and regulatory issues and selecting and developing animal models several additional collaborations were formed at this meeting as well as a better understanding of where the world stood with regard to vaccines more recently in february 2004 the who held a meeting in rotterdam to reach a consensus regarding which animal models represent the best infection models to test sars vaccine candidates although a macaque model has been described for sars17 there were still questions regarding its suitability for vaccine testing at least three north american laboratories have had little success in observing lung pathology and severe clinical signs in macaques after live sars-cov challenge19 factors such as the dose or strain of sars-cov the route of administration and the day of autopsy might account for the variability between the laboratoriesthe consensus at the who meeting in rotterdam was that standardization of conditions for sars-cov challenge was needed in the different laboratories before non-human primates could be used for vaccine testing some strains of mice such as balbc and c57 have been shown to support sars-cov replication but do not demonstrate significant pathology or clinical disease21 other small-animal models for sars such as ferrets20 and hamsters unpublished observations at the who meeting in rotterdam 2004 ref 19 also support viral replication and demonstrate some level of pathology that is similar to humans these animals offer an alternative inexpensive disease model compared with non-human primates although reports on the use of these small animals for sars-cov vaccine testing is scarce however despite these different animal models no single animal species has been shown to reproduce all of the clinical signs and lethality that is observed in humans that are infected with sars-covanticipating that a re-emergence of sars would be most likely to occur close to its original site of origin savi initiated a collaboration with chinese scientists in guangdong province in southern china this resulted in a bilateral agreement to work together on sars vaccine trials this collaboration was greatly facilitated by strong political support from both china and canada two countries that were significantly affected by sars the most obvious question is how sars vaccines will be evaluated for human efficacy given the lack of human sars cases globally this year ordinarily phase i to phase iii human clinical trials are designed to provide an understanding of the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in humans as well as identification of correlates of immunity without an outbreak of sars that could be used to test the efficacy of the vaccines in humans licensure of the vaccine under emergency conditions might have to take place under the fdas animal efficacy rule which states that vaccines or other biological agents can be licensed if they meet two criteria human safety and the demonstration of adequate protection against a deliberate infection challenge in two species of animals see vaccine policy in the online links for the sars vaccines to go directly from animals to humans under these conditions vaccine efficacy and safety must be evaluated in animals followed by phase i safety evaluation and immunogenicity testing in healthy human volunteers such a phase i study is currently ongoing in china with an inactivated sars virus19 at present there are not enough sars cases to test the vaccine further in phase ii and iii trials despite the lack of an ongoing sars threat rapid response initiatives such as savi will continue to be necessary as it is important to have a vaccine available should sars return furthermore such initiatives are strongly supported by internationally recognized scientists each with a strong expertise in a particular area of research and development this is in contrast to pharmaceutical companies where product focus is more diffuse and the expertise is suitable for gmp vaccine manufacturing and organizing clinical trials in humans
rapid response lessons learned
the ability to do rapid research in response to an emerging infectious disease has significant appeal as sars was seen as a major public health threat in canada and several countries in asia these countries in particular felt compelled to actcollaboration and cooperation experiences in canada indicated that the concept of working together in rapid response research towards a sars vaccine was rapidly accepted by all researchers who were approached in fact other scholars from the non-life-science areas of academia also freely offered their time and skills to deal with related problems all scientists were willing to contribute their relevant expertise and a portion of their laboratorys resources to work towards a common goal with no particular individual gain immediately obvious although this willingness is probably accentuated when one perceives a significant threat to ones country it is also a powerful motivating factor when seeking to obtain particular expertise during rapid response research similarly international cooperation and coordination are needed to avoid significant duplication and redundancy of efforts as well as to share progress in an ideal situation expertise around the world would be coordinated but this poses major logistical and political challenges the who had a pivotal role throughout the sars pandemic not only in tracking the disease but also by convening meetings of researchers working on potential vaccine therapeutics and diagnostics in the face of future pandemics a coordinated international rapid response research approach will be essential to develop new ways of controlling these scourges a main difficulty with sars research was the limited availability of clinical samples to researchers and the standardization of such samples some countries had national centres for disease control that collected and coordinated clinical samples whereas in others it was left to the individual hospitals an important problem with studying emerging infectious diseases that was exemplified by sars is patient consent when clinical samples are taken especially early during the outbreak the potential research uses of such samples are not known and it is difficult to specify exactly what they will be used for however having a large collection of clinical samples is crucial to understanding an infectious disease and mechanisms for collecting and sharing such samples must be in place before an outbreak occursmanufacturing considerations for any vaccine or therapeutic product to be used in human clinical trials it has to be made under stringent gmp26 ideally all rapid response research would be done under such conditions from the start but this is nearly impossible especially with infectious agents instead once a candidate vaccine or therapeutic is identified the work has to be reproduced under such conditions which significantly lengthens the production time at the outset if standardized cell lines such as vero cells attenuated viral vectors such as adenovirus and adjuvant alum are chosen that are already approved for human use significant time can be saved in product development1526 sars is particularly challenging as it requires biosafety level iii containment all animal studies must be done in stringent containment facilities of which there are only a few in the world similarly if a whole killed viral vaccine is to be manufactured highly specialized biosafety level iii gmp facilities are needed again few of which exist worldwide27 owing to the perceived threat of biological agents several biosafety level iii containment facilities have recently been approved for construction however performing rapid response research on highly infectious agents that are new to the world places a major burden on such specialized facilities especially biosafety level iii large animal primate and gmp facilities efficient use of such space requires global cooperation and judicial prioritizationcommercialization commercialization of a sars vaccine raises several complex issues as it seems that sars is not a worldwide threat at present there is not a significant commercial market so vaccine companies are unwilling to spend the hundreds of millions of dollars that are needed to commercialize a vaccine as they are unlikely to recover their expenses28 there are several reasons why industry is unwilling to commit to developing specific vaccines first the huge cost of vaccine development up to us 500 million and the small and uncertain revenue from traditional vaccines have made vaccine manufacturers wary of investing in development and production scale-up second the lack of understanding of some diseases and the complexity of the science involved in producing the appropriate immune response for vaccines are also a deterrent finally consumers are more willing to pay for treatment than prevention this is one reason why vaccines represent less than 2 of the world pharmaceutical market2829 the solution to this problem is the establishment of public healthbiotechnology industry partnerships public and private sectors need to work together to ensure a winwin system for vaccine development governments can help support vaccine development in several ways set up public-sector laboratories and research facilities to help reduce research and development costs sponsor human clinical trials to reduce costs and help acceleration of the product to market set up tax credits to stimulate research and development in selected areas set up public sector advocacy to stimulate demand and purchase large volumes or stockpiles of vaccines which would help reduce market uncertainty2829 companies provide valuable expertise in areas such as gmp production facilities and clinical trials and are therefore poised to take products further down the commercialization route successful contracts have been established between the us national institutes of health nih and two vaccine companies to produce gmp-grade whole-killed vaccine that the nih can test in phase i human clinical trials this should be ready for use in about one year although often difficult to structure partnerships between corporate entities and research agencies are crucial to move findings from rapid response research forward into clinical practice
concluding remarks
many valuable lessons were learned from the sars pandemic research methodologies are significantly improved and the application of rapid response research to sars demonstrated that it is possible to rapidly identify a new pathogen sequence its genome and develop preventative therapeutic and diagnostic approaches within a very short time frame fig 1 although it required a slight redirection of researchers and resources the response to sars has shown that there are ample mechanisms available to use emergency management procedures and apply them to rapid response research with a direct goal in mind2730 although one cannot predict where or what the next pandemic will be we know with certainty that there will be more we need to learn from our research experiences with sars and put the mechanisms and models in place to allow us to effectively respond rapidly to such threats by so doing we will be in a much better position than just relying on quarantine isolation and infection-control precautions which may or may not contain the outbreak these approaches will provide the world with new and better ways to control emerging infectious diseases in a just-in-time fashionthe recent novel corona virussevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 or 2019-ncov pandemic and the subsequent disease caused by the virus coronavirus disease 2019 or covid-19 has generated global concern given its rapid spread in multiple countries and possible fatal progression of the infection initially many patients reported exposure at a large seafood and animal market in wuhan china suggesting animal-to-person transmission of the virus however since then many patients have reported no exposure to animal markets indicating that person-to-person transmission is occurring there is currently no vaccine or targeted therapeutic for sars-cov-2sars-cov-2 infection is difficult to diagnose early in infection as patients can remain asymptomatic or present with non-specific clinical symptoms including fever cough or shortness of breath symptoms may appear in as few as 2 days or up to 2 weeks after exposure 1 quantitative reverse transcription pcr qrt-pcr for covid-19 in respiratory samples is currently the standard for diagnostic molecular testing however this requires expensive equipment and trained personnelreverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp is a one-step nucleic acid amplification method based on pcr technology that has been used to diagnose infectious diseases 2 rt-lamp has several advantages making it attractive for clinical utility this includes high specificity and sensitivity and ability to be completed in less than an hour furthermore it can work at various ph and temperature ranges which is advantageous for clinical samples 3 lastly the reagents are relatively inexpensive and can be stable at room temperature we have previously used rt-lamp to detect zika virus in clinical serum and urine samples as well as in crude lysates of single mosquitos 45this study describes an rt-lamp methodology that can detect sars-cov-2 in simulated patient samples as well as clinical samples in 3045 minutes the test

conditions removing the forward and backward inner primers or the loop primers did not result in a positive result fig 1 in order to determine the lower detection limit of the rt-lamp reaction for sars-cov-2 a dilution series ranging from 100 ng to 006 fg sars-cov-2 dna olgio was amplified fig 2 this corresponds to approximately 38021010 to 228 copies of virus the viral load in patients has been reported to range from 641 copiesml to 1341011 copiesml with a median of 799104 in throat samples and 752105 in sputum samples 10 the limit of detection was estimated to be 008 fg which is approximately equal to 304 viral copies this dilution series was run in parallel with qrt-pcr using primers that targeted this same region of the sars-cov-2 genome the qrt-pcr ct values for the dilution series are reported in s1 tableto demonstrate the clinical utility of this system for sars-cov-2 detection we spiked various human specimens with sars-cov-2 middle east respiratory syndrome mers betacoronavirus england-1 btcov or murine hepatitis virus mhv control oligos mers btcov and mhv spiked samples were used to test the specificity of the rt-lamp assay spiked specimens included serum urine saliva oropharyngeal swabs and nasopharyngeal swabs as we wanted to verify that substances present in these samples would not interfere with rt-lamp samples were directly used for rt-lamp without performing nucleic acid isolation only samples containing sars-cov-2 but not mers btcov or mhv had positive rt-lamp reactions indicating specificity of the reaction for sars-cov-2 fig 3 furthermore rt-lamp could be successfully completed using human serum urine saliva oropharyngeal swabs and nasopharyngeal swabsthe sequences of the rt-lamp primers were also compared to aligned sequences of various strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses sars or coronaviruses commonly associated with the common cold human coronavirus strains 229e nl63 hku1 or oc43 these other coronaviruses had 2754 nucleotide mismatch with our rt-lamp primers making it highly unlikely they would give a positive rt-lamp result supporting the specificity of this assay for sars-cov-2 table 2 given that viruses are prone to genetic mutation we likewise examined if rt-lamp primers had any mismatch with 27 different isolated strains of sars-cov-2 from various locations the 27 strains were from different regions of china hubei zhejiang and guangdong providences france thailand finland united states and australia the strains were collected and sequenced from 12242019 to 01292020 thus these 27 strains reflect more than one region and time point there was 0 mismatch with all the strains examined suggesting that these rt-lamp primers would identify all 27 strains of sars-cov-2 examined s2 tablewe next sought to determine if rt-lamp could detect sars-cov-2 in samples collected from patients with covid-19 patients with covid-19 symptoms were confirmed positive or negative for sars-cov-2 using standard clinical qrt-pcr testing using the same rna from the patients that was used for the qrt-pcr testing rt-lamp was in agreement with the qrt-pcr results in 95 n  1920 of the sars-cov-2 positive by qrt-pcr patients fig 4a and 90 n  1820 of the sars-cov-2 negative by qrt-pcr patients fig 4b given that spiking nasopharyngeal swabs samples in viral transport media with sars-cov-2 control oligos was able to work with rt-lamp fig 3 we next tested to determine if rt-lamp could detect sars-cov-2 directly without rna isolation in these nasopharyngeal swab samples rt-lamp detected 40 n  410 of sars-cov-2 positive by qrt-pcr patients and 100 n  1010 of the sars-cov-2 negative by qrt-pcr patients fig 5 the samples that were positive by rt-lamp all had a high level of viremia as indicated by the ct values less than 24 ct by qrt-pcr in contrast all the samples negative by rt-lamp had a ct value greater than 24 ct by qrt-pcrgiven the rapid emergence of sars-cov-2 and the severe complications that can result including acute respiratory distress syndrome ards pneumonia and even death improved diagnostic options that are fast reliable easy and affordable are required this is critical since sars-cov-2 infection can rapidly progress from hospital admission to ards in as few as 2 days and sars-cov-2 infection can be fatal 1 qrt-pcr is specific and sensitive however qrt-pcr requires trained clinical laboratory personnel to use specialized equipment in a qualified laboratory setting since this virus is spreading rapidly and is highly contagious centralized labs have had trouble keeping up with testing demands in part due to a significant shortage in available qrt-pcr tests despite significant investments by local governments and private industry this feasibility study demonstrated that rt-lamp allows rapid detection of sars-cov-2 in a variety of common human specimens collected for clinical testing including serum urine saliva oropharyngeal swabs and nasopharyngeal swabscurrently clinical testing for sars-cov-2 is done by central testing laboratories which may take one or more days this study sought to improve upon this by developing a potential point-of-care test point-of-care testing has several advantages for sars-cov-2 point-of-care testing should be fast easy to use by a range of users low cost and require little if any laboratory infrastructure furthermore the test needs to be reliable sensitive and specific rt-lamp meets these requirements and therefore has large value for screening and testing for sars-cov-2 in potentially exposed populations other groups are working to adopt rt-lamp for sar-cov-2 into alternative readouts for example the primers designed by our group along with two other primer sets were adopted for fluorogenic oligonucleotide strand exchange osd probes 11 this method could allow multiplexing and thus more than one genomic target of sars-cov-2 to be included in an assay furthermore this group also demonstrated that the rt-lamp primers described here and modified for osd are compatible for rt-lamp with the bst dna polymerase large fragment bst-lf which possesses reverse transcriptase ability as well as dna polymerase activity this detected down to 100 sars-cov-2 genomes 11 and bst-lf can be made by bacteria without a purification step useful for situations with an interrupted supply chain or in settings that are resource poor rt-lamp including the primers described here are also currently being adopted for lamp-seq 12 this could allow large scale processing using barcoding and next-generation sequencing to pool samples and subsequently identify positive individualsrt-lamp was sensitive for detection of sars-cov-2 we were able to detect down to the equivalent of approximately 304 viral copies bharda et al have also reported that use of all six of our rt-lamp primers can detect down to 100 copies of sars-cov-2 genomic rna 11 the viral load in patients has been reported to range from 641 copiesml to 1341011 copiesml with a median of 799104 in throat samples and 752105 in sputum samples 10 as such rt-lamp is sensitive enough for detection of sars-cov-2 in clinical sampleswe sought to determine if this rt-lamp assay worked in a range of different samples that might be collected in a clinical setting or as a possible non-invasive screening tool this was important to determine since it may not be feasible to always collect certain specimens for example swabs used for nasopharyngeal sampling as well as viral transport media has experienced shortages recently although sars-cov-2 has been reported to not be detectable in serum of all patients 13 serum may also be difficult to collect from patients who are critically sick or dehydrated or from elderly children and neonates furthermore not all biological samples may be compatible with rt-lamp some sample types may contain chemicals that inhibit nucleic acid assays if the sample is tested directly without first isolating the rna rt-lamp worked in all the human sample types tested when sars-cov-2 control olgios were spiked into the samples we tested this in samples collected from several individuals to control for variation in sample composition across different people we also demonstrated that rt-lamp has similar performance to qrt-lamp in detecting sars-cov-2 in rna isolated from clinical nasopharyngeal samples overall rt-lamp was positive for 95 n  1920 of samples positive by qrt-pcr and rt-lamp was also negative for 90 n  1820 of samples negative by qrt-pcr the two samples that were positive by rt-lamp but negative by qrt-pcr could represent false positives contamination or increased sensitivity of rt-lamp compared to qrt-pcr while rt-lamp can be prone to false positives we have taken several precautions to control for this in our assay set-up and false positives will usually not be positive if the samples are tested again on retesting these samples they were still positive which suggests that they are not false positives while we use good laboratory practice to reduce contamination we cannot exclude this possibility lastly it is possible that rt-lamp can be more sensitive than qrt-pcr as this has been previously described although one of the samples that was positive by qrt-pcr was negative by rt-lamp 14we previously demonstrated that rt-lamp for zikv does not require prior rna isolation from urine or serum samples 45 the use of unprocessed samples could save considerable time and reduce costs therefore we tested rt-lamp with nasopharyngeal swabs placed in viral transport media directly without an rna isolation step in order to detect low levels of viremia we increased the sample volume added to the rt-lamp reaction from 23 l and also increased the rt-lamp incubation time from 30 to 45 minutes rna was also isolated from these samples to verify which samples contained sars-cov-2 by qrt-pcr rt-lamp detected 40 n  410 of sars-cov-2 positive by qrt-pcr patients and was negative for 100 n  1010 of the sars-cov-2 samples also negative by qrt-pcr the samples that were positive by rt-lamp all had a high level of viremia as indicated by the ct values less than 24 ct by qrt-pcr this data suggests that the viral transport media may contain inhibitors possibly glucose that make rt-lamp less effective hence rt-lamp was only able to detect sars-cov-2 in samples with high levels of virus for clinical utility rt-lamp has better performance in rna purified samples compared to direct testing of nasopharyngeal swabs placed in viral transport media it may be that direct testing of nasopharyngeal swabs is possible for clinical utility by rt-lamp if the nasal swabs are placed in an alternative matrix such as saline water or ideally a preservative that can stabilize the rna and render the virus inactive the potential for direct rt-lamp testing of other sample types such as saliva is also possibleprimers were designed for a conserved span of sars-cov-2 sequence that was found in 27 isolated sars-cov-2 strains but was a sequence that was also divergent from related coronavirus sars given that all the isolated strains of sars-cov-2 thus far have shown very little genetic differences we anticipate that this rt-lamp will detect sars-cov-2 with the same level of confidence as qrt-pcr as with any molecular test including pcr it is possible that viral evolution may impact primer binding but this can be monitored as new strains are sequenced of the mutations thus far reported as of april 5 2020 15 none of the reported mutations corresponded to the sequence targeted by these rt-lamp primers this sars-cov-2 rt-lamp assay was highly specific as it did not give a positive result for mers btcov and mhv the rt-lamp primers also had significant mismatch with numerous strains of sars 2740 mismatch and common cold associated human coronavirus strains 229e nl63 hku1 or oc43 4954 mismatch making it highly unlikely to have cross-reactivity with these other respiratory viruses we tested a range of temperatures from 57c to 65c all the temperatures gave comparable results indicating that rt-lamp for sars-cov-2 has a large working temperature range with an optimal temperate of 63c we also tested a range of incubation times from 1545 minutes the optimal time for detection of rt-lamp products was 3045 minutes however sars-cov-2 rt-lamp products were detectable by uv light excitation or banding patterns on gels in as little as 15 minutesthis study has several limitations first sars-cov-2 is biosafety level 3 so our laboratory was unable to work directly with purified virus as such most of the experiments presented here used a nucleotide oligo of sars-cov-2 corresponding to the genbank mn908947 sequence similarly we were unable to directly test related coronaviruses and instead used nucleotide oligos from the same region of those viruses the primers were further evaluated for specificity by blasting them to related coronavirus sequences however we have demonstrated that rt-lamp can detect sars-cov-2 in rna isolated from nasopharyngeal swab samples at a similar detection rate with qrt-pcr furthermore rt-lamp could detect sars-cov-2 in some nasopharyngeal swab samples directly without an rna isolation step this does represent a proof-of-feasibility for this assay in that these rt-lamp primers can detect sars-cov-2 in clinical samples and should be highly specific for sars-cov-2 and not detect other related viruses although rt-lamp reactions are highly specific it is not a quantitative test other groups are working at improving the read outs of rt-lamp assays including the use of smartphone-integrated sensors to make interpretation of the assay even more user-friendly 16 rt-lamp reactions can have a higher rate of false positives compared to qrt-pcr as such we took several precautions including having a lateral work flow for experiments using filter pipet tips and including a thermolabile uracil-dna glycosylase udg in all reactions to prevent possible carry-over contamination of rt-lamp products from previous reactions this study was not powered to determine sensitivity in a clinical population lastly this is a rapidly developing area of study and all the information presented at the time of publication represent the authors best knowledge at the time as our understanding of sars-cov-2 continues to develop this information may changehere we describe a fast and robust assay for detection of sars-cov-2 in 3045 minutes this simple assay could be used outside of a central laboratory on various types of biological samples this assay can be completed by individuals without specialty training or equipment and may provide a new diagnostic strategy for combatting the spread of sars-cov-2 at the point-of-riskrespiratory virus infections often have a seasonal distribution especially in temperate climates and while the peak incidence varies year to year there is often a predominant seasonal occurrence rsv and influenza both have a peak incidence in winter and these peaks usually do not coincide but overlap parainfluenza virus piv 3 usually peaks in winter with piv 1 and piv 2 peaking in autumn and early winter the picornaviridae cause infections all year round with enteroviruses more common in summer and autumn while rhinoviruses are more common in winter and spring adenoviruses tend to cause infections year round as do the herpesviridae except for varicella which is more prevalent in the late winter and early springviral culture is the original method used for diagnosing respiratory virus infections and culture for viruses using primary and immortalized cells was expanded for wider diagnostic use in the 1950s the main advantage of traditional cell culture methods is the ability to isolate and identify a wide range of viruses1 this has enabled the identification of many viruses including those commonly causing respiratory infections  influenza rsv piv 14 adenoviruses measles enteroviruses rhinoviruses vzv cmv and hsv more recently recognized viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and hmpv have also been grown in cell culturefor virus isolation to be successful careful attention needs to be paid to a number of issues these include the selection of appropriate patients collection of adequate specimens transport of the specimen to the virology laboratory under optimal conditions and processing methods of the clinical samplesrespiratory samples for virus isolation include nasopharyngeal aspirates nasopharyngeal andor oropharyngeal swabs nasopharyngeal washes bronchioalveolar lavages sputum and lung biopsies other than open lung biopsies all other specimens are contaminated with commensal respiratory flora dacron or polyester swabs collected from the respiratory tract should be placed into viral transport medium containing antibiotics the specimens should be kept cool at 28 c or on wet ice until inoculation of the cell cultures to maintain virus infectivity especially for labile viruses such as rsv2
detection of viruses in cell culture requires considerable expertise and is performed by microscopic examination looking for degenerative morphological changes in the cell monolayer called cytopathic effect cpe not all viruses grow in all cell types so clinical specimens are usually inoculated into several types of cells to provide an environment for the isolation of a suitable range of viruses the use of a broad range of cell types potentially allows for the isolation of agents which are not expected rather than limiting detection to only a few virus types this approach will also allow the detection of more than one virus in any given specimen which can occur in up to 510 of immunocompetent individuals and more frequently in immunocompromised patients especially with viruses which have latency such as cmv and hsv recently commercially produced co-cultivated cryopreserved cells have become available for the rapid identification of viruses r-mix rapid cell culture diagnostic hybrids is a patented cell monolayer containing a mixture of a549 and mink lung mv1lu cells3 after 2472 h of culture using pooled or single fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc-labelled monoclonal antibodies directed against influenza a and b rsv parainfluenza 13 and adenoviruses rapid identification of a respiratory virus infection can be establishedgrowth of a virus in cell culture indicates the presence of viable replication competent virus a finding which cannot be determined using antigen or nucleic acid detection in addition the propagation of an isolate provides virus for antiviral susceptibility testing serotyping and epidemiological studiesmore recently newer viral culture formats have been developed which allow for more rapid detection of viruses which is very useful for detection of those viruses which grow slowly in conventional cell culture decreasing the time until cpe is detectable has been achieved for many viruses by centrifugation of the culture after the sample has been added as viruses are unable to be centrifuged with conventional centrifuges the enhanced detection may result from better contact between cells in the specimen and the cell culture thus allowing for earlier and more extensive infection of the cell culture sheet furthermore the detection of viral protein production antigen detection before there is evidence of cpe in conventional culture has also decreased the time to identify a virus and thus enhanced clinical utility of viral culture testing the detection of viral protein production is usually performed using a fluorescent-labelled eg fitc monoclonal antibody directed against a viral protein processing and reading these cultures is labour intensive however most common viruses can be detected in 2448 h alternatively enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa detection of viral proteins in cell culture supernatants has also been performedmore recently transgenic cell lines with virus-induced reportable elements have been developed for use in viral culture this uses a gene promoter which is quiet in uninfected cells but is sufficiently upregulated by viral transactivator proteins and with sufficient specificity that it does not allow heterologous viral transactivating proteins to activate the promoter4 this technology has been exploited to allow detection of hsv-1 or -2 using the baby hampster kidney bhk cell line stably transformed with the promoter of ul39 from hsv linked to the escherichia coli lacz gene hsv can be detected within 24 h of infection using chromogenic substrate which turns infected cells from colourless to blue hsv infected cells are easily identified and this technique could be expanded to determine viral titre in specimens if required this system is marketed by diagnostic hybrids under the name elvis enzyme-linked virus-inducible system5
the ability to detect viruses was significantly enhanced by the development of monoclonal antibodies mab directed against specific viral proteins for the viruses hsv-1 hsv-2 vzv cmv influenza a influenza b parainfluenza 13 and adenovirus and linked to the fluorescent molecule fitc these staining procedures are rapid samples are batch run and results are usually available within 13 h depending on the number of specimens tested rapid immunofluorescent if staining methods for the direct detection of viral antigens in respiratory specimens have excellent specificity and very good sensitivity most respiratory viruses produce cpe in conventional cell cultures but often this is slow or very minimal in extent the rapid detection of the respiratory viruses influenza a influenza b parainfluenza 13 and adenovirus by if is available in many laboratories and is extremely useful for the detection of these viruses especially in paediatric patients who shed relatively large amounts of virus and for a longer period than do adults the performance characteristics of the test depend on the type of specimen age of the patient duration of illness mab reagent and level of expertise of the laboratory staff generally if methods for respiratory viruses are a little less sensitive than culture with the exception of rsv however the greater sensitivity of rsv if compared with rsv culture is due to the lability of rsv which is rapidly inactivated in samples that are not kept refrigerated and transported to the laboratory quickly for inoculation into cell cultures within a short period after collection of the specimen the reported sensitivities of if detection of respiratory viruses varies but are broadly 90 for rsv 80 for influenza a and b 70 for parainfluenza 13 and 50 for adenoviruses6 mabs directed against hmpv have been developed and are currently under investigation to establish their clinical utilitymembrane-based cassette-based enzyme immunoassays eias optical immunoassays and immunochromographic or lateral-flow systems have been introduced for less technically demanding detection of respiratory viruses7 some can now differentiate viruses eg influenza a from influenza b rsv from influenza a and include a positive control to monitor performance of both the assay and the user a significant aim of the manufacturers of these tests is to allow for testing to occur in the consulting physicians office these techniques have the advantage of decreasing turn-around time for test results and have considerably simplified the technical component but these tests are not as sensitive or specific as viral culture or direct if dif for detection of respiratory viruses the positive predictive value of these assays is usually higher when there is a greater prevalence of disease in the respiratory virus season and the virus in question has been shown to be circulating in the community by viral culture or if during periods of relatively high prevalence positive results can usually be accepted as correct however negative results should be confirmed by a second method eg dif or culture8
viruses can be detected in clinical samples using highly specific nucleic acid probes that are complementary in sequence to viral rnas or viral dnas or by using a nucleic acid amplification technique such as polymerase chain reaction pcr branch chain dna detection bdna or nucleic acid sequence based amplification nasba these techniques are becoming increasingly available in diagnostic laboratories but testing for multiple viruses using molecular methods is considerably more expensive than with conventional techniques and the methodology needs to be developed in house evidence would suggest that testing using molecular methods is a little more sensitive than conventional approaches but the information available to date is variable9
during the past few years new influenza viruses isolated in hong kong h5n1 appear to have spread from poultry to a small number of persons who have shown a high mortality rate this has caused a high degree of global concern as spread of avian influenza a strains to humans is usually very uncommon but several hundred human cases of h5ni infection have been identified in countries across the world10 the major limitation to this virus causing a pandemic with a huge impact on health and the economy is the failure of the h5n1 influenza a to establish sustained human-to-human transmission were this to occur a pandemic would be inevitable commonly available routine diagnostic tests in laboratories can differentiate influenza a from influenza b however they are unable to identify the subtype identification of the strain of influenza can be performed by a variety of methods at reference laboratories if required11
laboratory diagnosis of influenza virus infection by isolation of the virus in cell culture is the gold standard technique this technique however is slow and does not allow for diagnosis within the time frame for specific treatment however virus isolation remains critically important for epidemiological studies the recognition of specific types of influenza circulating in the community and identification of new types and thus pandemics the information on influenza types is used to design vaccines for the upcoming influenza seasoninfluenza culture can be performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates nasopharyngeal swabs throat swabs and sputum or lung biopsy tissue or bronchoalveolar lavages specimens should be kept at 4 c until processed more recently rapid cultures involving growth of influenza for up to 3 days and then labelling cells with antibodies directed against influenza a using an immunoperoxidase or fluorescence technique have been developed these techniques are rapid and relatively inexpensive but do require a high degree of technical competency they can accurately differentiate influenza a or b from other viruses but are not suitable for identifying the h type of influenza a thus these tests would not be diagnostic in the early stages of a pandemic when the new h type of influenza a would be co-circulating with the old h type direct detection of viral antigen in respiratory specimens can also be performed and is the technique of choice for a rapid sensitive assay reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr is now available in many laboratories and can differentiate influenza a and b and other viruses it can also be used to identify differing h or n types of influenza adetection of an immunological response with a fourfold or greater rise in serum antibody titres using haemagglutination inhibition or complement fixation techniques when acute and convalescent samples are compared also provides evidence of acute infection with the influenza a or b virus serological tests are rarely diagnostic in individual cases within a timeframe that allows judicious use of anti-influenza drugs but they are very useful for tracking epidemics in the community elisa tests for igm on a single sample are also available igm and iga specific antibodies against influenza peak about 14 days after infection and igg specific antibody peaks at about 47 weeks serological diagnosis and typing of influenza virus can be complicated by the fact that the anamnestic response to infection is highest for the strain causing the primary infection even when there is subsequent infection by other strains this has been termed the doctrine of original antigenic sin and can lead to a lack of strain specificity with serological testsparainfluenza virus types 1 2 and 3 occur worldwide and among persons from all age groups parainfluenza viruses 4a and 4b are much less frequentparainfluenza 1 occurs in epidemics usually during autumn in alternate years parainfluenza 2 occurs sporadically and parainfluenza 3 tends to cause annual winter epidemics in temperate climates parainfluenza 13 are the main causes of croup in infants and young children under 5 years of age parainfluenza 3 can also cause viral pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants and small children parainfluenza 4 occurs very infrequently and is usually associated with mild symptoms of upper respiratory tract illness rhinorrhea pharyngitis and cough primary infection with parainfluenza provides some measure of immunity but this immunity is not complete or long lasting and re-infections occur commonly but they are rarely as severe as the illnesses seen with primary infectionlaboratory diagnosis of parainfluenza infection is based on viral isolation in tissue culture and this remains the gold standard respiratory secretion specimens must be kept at 4 c until processed parainfluenza grows relatively slowly taking 35 days and as these viruses do not cause a direct cpe they are detected using haemadsorption adsorption of guinea pig red blood cells to infected cells rapid diagnostic tests for detection of viral antigen in respiratory specimens using dif are specific for each of the parainfluenza virus types and show high sensitivity and specificity rt-pcr procedures can either detect single viruses or parainfluenza as a group with high sensitivity and specificitya serological response with detection of a fourfold of greater rise in serum antibody levels between acute and convalescent samples collected about 3 weeks after the onset of acute illness may also provides evidence of infection antibody can be measured using complement fixation haemagglutination inhibition or neutralization interpretation of a serological test relative to the parainfluenza type producing the infection may be complicated by heterotopic antibody responses seen in some infected individualsrsv was first isolated in 1956 from a laboratory chimpanzee with an illness resembling the common cold and shortly after it was demonstrated to be a human pathogen epidemiological studies have shown that rsv represents the single most important cause of serious lower respiratory tract disease especially bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and children rsv can cause severe pneumonia and death in persons with underlying immune deficiencyrsv belongs to the family paramyxoviridae and the genus pneumovirus it is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded negative-sense non-segmented rna genome with at least 10 viral proteins antigenic analysis of rsv has identified two subgroups a and b based on their reactivity to a panel of monoclonal antibodies with the b strain further differentiated into two variants b1 and b2 annual epidemics of rsv occur during winter in temperate climates and the two subgroups usually co-circulate in the same geographical area often with a predominance of subgroup adiagnosis of rsv is commonly made by direct examination of respiratory secretions using if or an eia technique a number of commercial rapid point-of-care diagnostic eia kits which identify rsv antigen in respiratory secretions are now available these kits provide a high degree of sensitivity or specificity although they are not as sensitive as dif rsv can also be grown in cell cultures but the virus is extremely labile and great care must be taken in transport to ensure that is remains at 4 c rsv can also be diagnosed serologically using complement fixation by the detection of a fourfold rise in antibody titre however like most respiratory virus serology this testing is not clinically useful because of the delay in diagnosis furthermore infants may possess maternal antibodies thus complicating interpretation of serological dataadenoviruses were isolated from the primary cell cultures of adenoids from children in the early 1950s adenoviruses are non-enveloped particles which contain linear double-stranded dna surrounded by an icosahedral capsid with fibre-like projections extending from each of the 12 capsid verticesadenovirus infections occur worldwide and transmission varies from sporadic to epidemic since adenoviruses are very stable they can be easily transmitted in the environment by fomites adenoviruses are an important cause of upper and lower respiratory tract disease with types 1 2 3 5 and 7 accounting for about 85 of all infections rarely adenoviruses can be isolated from the lungs livers kidneys and brains of patients with fatal infectionadenoviruses can be isolated in cell cultures and presumptively recognized by their characteristic cytopathic effect currently 52 human adenovirus serotypes have been identified and they can be grouped into six subgenera designated a through f based on differing classification schemes concerned with the guanine g and cytosine c content of their dna determined using dna restriction analysis procedures or pcr12 individual isolates can be serotyped using haemagglutination inhibition neutralization or if however this is very time consuming and not routinely available adenoviruses can be detected directly in respiratory secretions using if pcr elisa and immunochromatography adenovirus infection can be diagnosed serologically using complement fixation by detection of a fourfold or greater rise in antibody titre during convalescence type-specific antibody responses can be assayed by haemagglutination inhibition elisa and neutralization assay however except for epidemiological investigations antibody determination is a much less efficient means for determining infection than using direct methods such as pcr or antigen detectionrhinoviruses are a group of more than 100 serotypes and cause more common cold minor upper respiratory tract illness than any other virus that infects the respiratory tract they account for about one half of common colds occurring in children and consequently cause substantial absenteeism from schools in persons with underlying lung disease and immune disorders rhinoviruses can cause pneumoniarhinoviruses belong to the family picornaviridae which are small non-enveloped viruses with a single-stranded positive-sense rna genome unlike enteroviruses also picornaviridae rhinoviruses are inactivated when exposed to mild acid ph 5 accounting for their failure to infect the gastrointestinal tractrhinoviruses also caused otitis media in infants and children being recovered from middle ear fluid in 10 of subacute or chronic cases that are negative for bacteria recent studies associate rhinovirus infection with exacerbations of asthma and with acute lower respiratory tract disease especially in persons with chronic obstructive airway disease and cystic fibrosis and those who are immunocompromised rhinoviruses prefer to grow at lower temperatures than many other respiratory viruses 3334 c and grow less well at the higher temperature of the lungs than in the nose however they can establish infection in the lungtype-specific immunity develops following infection and is characterized by igg neutralizing antibodies in serum and secretions long lasting immunity best correlates with the level and secretion of iga antibody from the nasal mucous membranesdiagnosis of rhinovirus infection rarely requires laboratory testing but virus isolation detection of viral rna by rt-pcr antigen detection by dif in cells from respiratory secretions or detection of a fourfold rise in antibody titres by neutralization test or eia can be performed if required viral isolation in cell culture is very sensitive especially when collected early in the illness viral isolation is labour intensive and requires several days with confirmation of the individual rhinovirus serotype requiring further antigenic characterization with type-specific antibody therefore it is not used as a routine diagnostic test rt-pcr is unlikely to be available except as a research procedurethe human coronaviruses 229e and oc43 are an important cause of the common cold and belong to the family coronaviridae genus coronavirus they are enveloped with a helical nucleocapsid possessing a single-stranded positive-sense rna genomecoronavirus infections occur sporadically throughout winter and spring and are distributed worldwide they are spread by large droplets via the respiratory route children commonly experience one coronavirus infection per year which is about three times more frequently than adults coronaviruses are associated with 1015 of upper respiratory tract illness mainly causing common colds and otitis media pneumonia rarely occurs with non-sars coronavirus infectiontype-specific antibodies to single coronavirus types develop in response to infection and persist for about 4 months circulating and mucosal antibody confers protection from illness and the possession of coronavirus antibodies increases with age with circulating antibody found in most children older than 6 years nevertheless re-infections are commonlaboratory diagnosis of coronavirus infections can be achieved using virus isolation detection of viral antigen by if detection of viral rna by rt-pcr andor demonstration of a fourfold or greater rise in antibody titre during convalescence virus isolation is complicated and is not generally recommended as a routine diagnostic test since most illnesses are minor common colds procedures for antibody measurement include elisa neutralization and hemagglutination inhibitionsars was first recognized in china in november 2002 and rapidly spread around the world with significant morbidity and mortality and clusters of affected patients eg healthcare workers and family contacts13 a coronavirus was identified as the cause interestingly children and adolescents had significantly less severe disease than adults14 the sars coronavirus can be detected using rt-pcr or viral culture due to the very high transmissibility of this agent and the severe outcomes any patient considered to have sars should be isolated and laboratory specimens collected with high level precautions the laboratory should be notified as culture of the sars coronavirus should only be attempted in high biocontainment facilities and specimens may need referral to external public health laboratoriesdutch researchers reported the isolation of an agent that induced cytopathic effects on cultured cells from 28 respiratory specimens collected over a 20 year period15 electron microscopy revealed filamentous viral-like particles suggesting that the agent was a virus using random arbitrarily primed-pcr the virus discovered was found to be a member of the paramyxoviridae family and the first human pathogen of the genus metapneumovirus it was named human metapneumovirus hmpv since its initial discovery hmpv has been identified worldwide in general hmpv infection accounts for approximately 212 of paediatric lower respiratory illness16
rt-pcr detection is the only reliable method of detection at present there are no standard methods for isolating hmpv in culture although this is possible and monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus by dif are being tested for clinical utilityhuman bocavirus is a newly discovered parvovirus that was first identified in sweden but which occurs globally17 18 bocavirus has been detected in young children with respiratory distress many with pneumonia with interstitial infiltrates noted on chest x-ray however whether bocavirus is a cause of respiratory disease is yet to be fully determinedcommon colds are very common and are usually self-diagnosed the term cold does not constitute a single viral entity but rather a syndrome of nasal congestion sneezing rhinorrhoea and pharyngitis with more severe clinical disease associated with high fever in children colds are generally self-limiting with a median duration of 910 days many viruses from a variety of viral families may be associated with this syndrome but the pattern of symptoms associated with colds does not appear to vary significantly between agents approximately 4050 of colds are found to be associated with rhinovirus infection with other frequently occurring agents including coronaviruses enteroviruses and non-primary infections with parainfluenza virus and rsv transmission of most of the viruses responsible for the common cold is by direct contact and inoculation of virus into the upper respiratory tract infection with rhinovirus results in the development of long lasting antibody which is protective against re-infection with the same serotype this also produces a degree of resistance to challenge with heterologous rhinovirus serotypes but this protection is incomplete and short livedrecognized complications of colds include secondary bacterial infection of the paranasal sinuses andor middle ear and exacerbations of asthma or bronchitis viral otitis media commonly complicates colds in children probably due to eustachian tube dysfunction with rhinoviruses19 rsv influenza virus and adenovirus20 detected in the middle ear fluids in 2040 of cases of otitis media with effusion in childrenspecific viral diagnosis is generally not attempted but if required isolation of the aetiological agent in cell culture can be performed rt-pcr may be more sensitive for detection of these agents especially rhinoviruses enteroviruses and coronavirusespharyngitis is a very common reason for seeking outpatient medical care it can be divided into a syndrome with nasal symptoms which has a predominately viral cause and cases without nasal symptoms and caused by a diverse spectrum of aetiological agents including group a and non-group a streptococci chlamydia pneumoniae mycoplasma pneumoniae and epsteinbarr viruscroup or viral laryngotracheobronchitis is a clinically distinct illness that predominately affects children under 3 years of age the characteristic physical finding in croup is inspiratory stridorpivs account for about 75 of cases of croup21 of which piv 1 and piv 2 are the most commonly associated other causes of croup include rsv influenza a and b rhinoviruses adenoviruses as well as m pneumoniae m pneumoniae and influenza tend to cause croup in older children piv 2 and influenza a are associated with more severe disease22 but generally the clinical presentation of the croup syndrome due to individual agents is similar measles which is a rare cause of croup can cause especially severe disease23 a specific viral cause for croup can be established with viral culture but is not routinely performed as the clinical syndrome is sufficient for diagnosis and managementbronchiolitis is due to inflammation of the bronchioles leading to a clinical syndrome characterised by obstruction of expiratory airflow usually proceeded by nasal congestion and rhinorrhea there may often be history of exposure to an adult or sibling with a cold or minor respiratory illness or exposure to another infant with bronchiolitis within the day care setting mild conjunctivitis may occur in about one third of cases and otitis media is recognized in 510 the hospital course is variable but most infants improve within 34 days24
bronchiolitis is a disease predominately of infancy and the epidemiology of this disease closely parallels the incidence of the major infectious cause rsv the peak incident age is in infants between 2 and 6 months with over 80 of cases occurring in the first year of life25
rsv causes the majority of cases of bronchiolitis however other respiratory viruses include pivs influenza and rhinoviruses piv 3 and adenovirus types 3 7 and 21 are relatively uncommon but may be associated with more severe disease including bronchiolitis obliterans26 rhinoviruses can cause bronchiolitis in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia26 27 28 pertussis is occasionally confused with bronchiolitis anatomic defects such as vascular rings foreign bodies and gastro-oesophageal reflux are additional differential diagnosesbronchiolitis and pneumonia are both part of the spectrum of lower respiratory tract involvement frequently co-exist and cannot be clearly distinguished pneumonia is defined by the development of abnormalities in alveolar gas exchange accompanied by inflammation of the lung parenchyma often associated with visible changes on chest x-ray ct scanning or gallium scanning there can be considerable variety to the presentation of viral pneumonia depending on the age and immunological competence of the host as well as the specific viral pathogen viral pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with a compromised immune systemthe clinical presentation varies considerably with the specific causative agent but typically includes fever and lower respiratory tract symptoms and signs such as tachypnoea non-productive cough wheeze and increased breath sound very young infants may present with apnoeic episodes with minimal fever bacterial superinfection is a potential and serious complication of viral lower respiratory tract infection particularly with influenza underlying cardiopulmonary disease such as valvular heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are well recognized risk factors for increased severity of disease with viral pneumoniadiagnosis of the specific cause of an acute pneumonia due to a particular viral agent is complicated by difficulty in obtaining appropriate lower respiratory tract samples for culture and in isolating or detecting certain pathogens and additionally by the frequent asymptomatic shedding of some viruses eg herpes simplex virus or adenoviruses while viruses are clearly important and frequent causes of pneumonia in young children they are less apparent in older children rsv has been associated with the largest proportion of viral pneumonia in young children particularly if accompanied by bronchiolitis29 piv 3 and influenza a and b are significant causes of pneumonia in children especially during periods of epidemic prevalence30 adenoviruses are frequently isolated from children with respiratory disease and are implicated in about 10 of childhood pneumonias however their true impact is difficult to access because of the long intermittent asymptomatic respiratory shedding of adenoviruses in children adenoviruses have been described as cause of significant outbreaks of viral pneumonia in institutionalized children pneumonia is the most frequent serious complication of measles rhinoviruses have been associated with community-acquired pneumonia in children despite their apparent temperature sensitivity other occasional causes are enteroviruses hsv and vsvserological diagnosis essentially establishes a temporal but not a causal relationship between a viral infection and a clinical syndrome and a positive serological result may be misleading during times of high prevalence of a particular viral agent
respiratory virus infections are a major source of morbidity and mortality globallynew respiratory viruses with epidemic and pandemic potential continue to be identifieddiagnosis of respiratory virus infections continues to improve with new technological methods
the covid-19 pandemic is probably the most challenging health crisis of the modern era as of april 2020 more than 180 countries around the world have registered at least one confirmed case of the novel coronavirus infection with more than 25 million positive patients around the world 1as the world health organizations general director pointed out testing is crucial 2 the detection of sars-cov-2 the virus that causes covid-19 is achieved via the detection of the viral rna by real-time polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr 3 when properly collected and if the specimens collected for the analysis contains the virus rt-pcr has high specificity and sensitivity however this technique has some limitations such as the narrow number of patients that can be tested in a given time the increased risk of exposure to a high-dose of virus for the healthcare workers collecting the sample throat-swabbing can generate aerosol and a considerable amount of time from the test to its response 4 in addition if the sample is not properly collected which may be the case in a mass emergency screening where a single operator performs hundreds of swabs in a single shift this may lead to a high number of false-negative results with an overall sensitivity of about 3040 56 furthermore the rt-pcr requires certified laboratories expensive equipment and trained technicians to operatefinally a major constraint remains the cutoff value to ascertain whether a test is positive or not generally when a given value is reached the specimen tested is considered positive however the degradation of the probe-based fluorophore by cross-contamination or by nonspecific amplification of background nucleic acids forces the adoption of an arbitrary cut off below which the medical report is given as negative this operating procedure outside the clinical context can lead to evaluation errors raising the number of false-negative results moreover real-time amplification efficiency varies within and between laboratories and a set cutoff might not be constant across runs therefore it is recommended to normalize cutoff with relative or absolute quantification approaches 7the world health organization who has fostered the development of new strategies to standardize the diagnosis of covid-19 8 yet most countries have been completely unprepared for the onslaught of the virusa possible alternative to rt-pcr is the assessment of the immune response of the host to the virus however we cannot research covid-19 by merely translating the technologies and the know-how already in place and that comes from the study of other not comparable diseases in these three months since the beginning of the outbreak no protocols or real experimental studies have been carried out we still do not know about the immune response of the human body to sars-cov-2 and it is still unclear how we can evaluate the antibody production for the diagnosis of covid-19 and how to use igm and igg detection in single patients and the population for epidemiological purposes only recently the idea of producing easy-to-use decentralized point-of-care poc tests emerged and then deploying them widely 9 poc tests are simple easy to administer and to interpret and they can accelerate clinical decision-making and take some of the workload off centralized test laboratories for example sheridan 9 recently reported the current main commercial rapid test for sars-cov-2 in nature biotechnologysome are ten-min lateral flow immunoassays that detect igm and igg antibodies directed against sars-cov-2 xiamen amonmed

serological test cellex developed a similar one which is now also approved for the eu by the fdathe available poc tests need to be studied in the current emergency setting the who proposed a protocol template better to assess the effectiveness of serology testing 12 this is also consistent with what is suggested in the updated version of laboratory testing for coronavirus disease covid-19 in suspected human cases 8 however it is currently impossible to assess and compare all the different poc tests because of the lack of reliable dataas our aim is to evaluate the efficacy of covid-19 rapid tests and serological assays in real-life settings with a particular focus on territorial emergencies and the ongoing pandemic we designed a research protocol aimed to establish how to use these diagnostics correctly taking into account the different possible clinical and epidemiological scenarioscovid-19 is the clinical presentation of the infection of the virus sars-cov-2 13 the diagnosis is currently based on the detection of the rna of the virus via a nucleic acid amplification test naat according to corman et al 14 rt-pcr has a sensitivity and specificity of about 100 provided that the sample is taken with the proper and timely technique the choice of the perfect samples to use for rt-pcr is still under debate wenling et al 15 analyzed samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sputum nasal swabs fibro-bronchoscopy brush biopsy pharyngeal swabs stools and blood rt-pcr on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid demonstrated the highest positive rates 93 followed by sputum with 72 recent studies suggest the use of rt-pcr on stools because the virus can attack the bowel 16 according to ai et al 17 the combined use of computed tomography ct and pcr can increase diagnostic sensitivity however ct often is not available in territorial settings and primary care or for screening purposes according to el-tholoth et al 18 rt-pcr has some limitations for the screening and diagnosis of covid-19 because the test is difficult to use in the community and because of the high number of false-negatives observedthe detection of specific igm and igg antibodies against sars-cov-2 is a possible strategy to diagnose the infection the immune response triggered by the infection is currently under investigation similarly the long-term modification of the antibodies levels cannot be known at the moment the use of a fast performing validated a serological assay is requested by different authors such as xiao 19 and hick 20 but also the national health commission and state administration of traditional chinese medicine suggests the use of a serological test with igm and igg for covid-19 to confirm the negative results an emblematic example came from the recent italian experience patient zero was negative to all tests performed during the onset of the symptoms namely the pharyngo-nasal swab for rt-pcr and the serological test 19 these observations support the idea that two negative serological tests are necessary to rule out the infection when a quantitative analysis is available the following procedure should be respected two paired serum samples should be taken from the patient with a suspected diagnosis of covid-19 patients with clinical symptomology suggestive of the disease or close contacts with patients with a known positive test for sars-cov-2 infection baseline serum should be taken as early as possible within the incubation period of contact and convalescent serum should be taken 24 weeks after the last contact positive serum-specific igm or specific igg antibody title in the recovery phase 4 times higher than that in the acute phase can be used as diagnostic criteria for suspected patients with negative naat igm is usually measurable 10 days after symptom onset while igg is detectable 12 days after the patient is symptomatic in fact the optimal timing for the convalescent sample needs still to be establishedwhen compared to naat the serological test appears more suitable for screening purposes in a population a recent study from jin et al 20 emphasizes the utility of the serological test in a wide cohort also when there are few positive patients not only when the probability pre-test is high bai et al 21 used igm to define negative and positive case in wide samples from a general population and encouraged the use of the serological test also in asymptomatic patients to confine the spread of the outbreak this is also consistent with an interesting article by li et al 22 that recommends the use of serological surveys to determine the incidence of subclinical infectionsthis test however may have some limitations to avoid false-positives because of cross-reactivity the antigen used for the serological test should come from properly purified sars-cov-2 according to meyer et al 23 and following the whos recommendations the right choice and the appropriate purification of antigens is essential to obtain validated serological tests in fact cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses can be challenging therefore only the most recent testsvalidated from laboratories that have isolated the viruscan be usedserum antibody determination methods include among others colloidal gold immunochromatography elisa enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay chemiluminescence immunoassay xiang et al 24 recently compared elisa to gica colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay both have high sensitivity and specificity without a significant difference h0ha 005to enhance the accuracy of the diagnosis liu et al 25 suggested using rt-pcr in the first days from the infection and then to use the serological test alone for the disease monitoringli et al 10 described the results from the use of a rapid serological test in 525 patients the test had a sensitivity of 886 and a specificity of 9063 for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2immune response to a first-time infection needs time to grow symptoms can occur while the organism is preparing to fight and in the first days from infection the immunoassay can be negative indeed no cross-reactivity was detected in subjects with previous coronaviruses infection 26 a similar level of precision is reported by cassaniti et al in a letter to the editor where the authors do not endorse the use of the colloidal gold rapid test in emergency settings for triage of patients with suspected covid-19 26 nevertheless this recommendation remains controversial as there are some inconsistencies within the results presented the sampling methods the data processing and the patients targeted for the study on the other hand more recently long qx et al emphasized the importance of serological testing both in clinical and epidemiological settings 27a rapid test for sars-cov-2 is the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip assay zhang et al 27 demonstrated that the eukaryotic spike proteins expressed rs1 and rs-rbd-mfc are more appropriate than the prokaryotic nucleocapsid proteins for covid-19 serological diagnosis the gica sandwich used to detect total antibodies is a powerful complement to the current standard rna-based tests they prepared six recombinant proteins including three s spike proteins rs1 rs-rbd rs-rbd-mfc and three n nucleocapsid proteins rn rn1 rn2 because the s protein is a transmembrane protein three s protein fragments were prepared using a eukaryotic expression system while three n proteins were prepared using a prokaryotic expression system preliminary evaluation by indirect elisa revealed that the three s proteins rs1 rs-rbd rs-rbd-mfc were superior in performance lower background and higher optical densit values to the three n proteins however the antigenicity of s proteins and that of the n proteins could not be confirmed in this study because the influence of prokaryotic expression method used to produce the n proteins is difficult to predict they speculated that this difference is due to the relatively high sensitivity and early response to the s antigen compared to the n antigen in patients with covid-19 thus the n proteins antigenicity should be studied after expression in a eukaryotic system in futurezhang et al 28 selected two recombinant proteins with the highest elisa titers rs1 and rs-rbd-mfc to develop a sandwich-format gica strip to detect total antibodies igm and igg against hcov-19 gica colloidal gold immunochromatography assay a simple and rapid serological method is especially suitable for timely diagnosis and large-scale sample screening the performance of the gica strip which was evaluated with 814 clinical samples showed to be rapid 10 min highly sensitive 8689 and specific 9939 by diagnosing covid-19 in rt-pcr-negative patients who were clinically confirmed covid-19 positive by ct a recent study showed that the sensitivity of the total antibody igm and igg test is higher than that of the igm or igg test 29currently there is no gold standard for the identification of covid-19 positive or negative subjects however the commonly adopted standard is the rt-pc carried out with the methods suggested by the who 2 we therefore selected the articles and data set where the control was the rt-pcr carried out on selected groups of people certainly negative eg healthy rt-pcr negative volunteers or affected by covid-19 rt-pcr positive symptomatic patientsthe data for the test validation are derived from li 10 capello 30 paradiso 31 cassaniti 26 as well as the data provided by the manufacturer provided by the producer alpha pharma inc bitonto bari 70031 italy available on httpswwwa-psit in the article by paradiso 31 it was not possible to deduce the data referring only to igmit should be noted that the specificity was very high in all studies table 1 all the trials included patients enrolled in the early stage of pandemics with no known exposure to sars-cov-2 and no symptoms of covid-19 ie healthy volunteers with no contact and asymptomatic and with negative rt-pcr those patients could be reasonably considered true negative subjects starting from this assumption basically no false positives were recorded nevertheless because of the peculiarity of this infection and because of the epidemiology of the pandemic a negative rt-pcr and a negative medical history cannot rule out a possible sars-cov-2 infection even in asymptomatic patients so that it would be difficult to compare the results of any test with a gold standard aimed to assess the sensitivity and sensibility of the test itself thus research protocols in the future should consider some specific features of the infection of the way it spreads among the population and of the immune response of the host to the disease for this reason the comparison with rt-pcr alone is not enough to establish the effectiveness of quantitative or qualitative serologic tests besides the long-time persistence of immunoglobulins in the serum of the immunized persons should be addressed as well as the absence of viral rna at the sites of the swabs that can give negative pcr results in healed immunized patients table 1 shows the sensitivity and specificity data of the colloidal gold rapid test versus rt-pcr oropharyngeal swab as published in individual articles cassaniti-a column was computed based on data reported in the article relative to igmstill because of these reasons the collected sensitivity values may vary widely among the different studies consequently at present we cannot establish a mean sensitivity value in addition the variations are possibly determined by the time of testing and by the eligibility criteria which were not uniform in the different studiesin any case the high precision indicates the absence of analytical errors determined by cross-reactivity as also reported by some authors 26to better understand the variability in sensitivity and better assess the accuracy of the test we considered results of igg and igm testing separately we performed the analysis via the meta analytic approach to evaluate the heterogeneity of the effect size the results are shown in the forest plots of figure 1 igg and figure 2 igmfor the igg figure 1 odds ratios we found both significant fixed p  0001 and random effects p  0001 heterogeneity was very high with cochrans q  461 p  00001 while the i2 statistic accounting for variations due to actual heterogeneity and not to chance was 902 ci 95 from 799 to 952 performing a second meta-analysis data not shown using all the pooled cassaniti igg data we did not find substantial differences for fixed effects we found again p  0001 whereas for random effects we obtained p  0002 cochrans q was 3778 p  00001 and the i2 statistic was 894 ci95 from 781 to 949in addition for the igm figure 2 odds ratio we found significant fixed and random effects p  0001 in both cases heterogeneity was less high than igg for cochrans q we got 609 p  01072 thus a not significant heterogeneity even keeping p  01 as significance cutoff as suggested by higgins et al given the low number of studies 32 and the i2 statistic was found 508 ci95 from 00 to 837 furthermore for igm we performed a second meta-analysis data not shown using all the pooled cassaniti igm data for fixed and random effects we found again p  0001 with a cochrans q  502 p  01702 and the i2 statistic was 403 ci95 from 00 to 798both meta-analyses revealed a high inconsistency at least in its broad confidence interval the i2 statistic is given by the ratio q-dq where d accounts for the degrees of freedom of the system eg the number of meta-analyzed studies minus one in the case d  q then one keeps i2  0 with a ci of 95 from 00 to 100 for this reason adding a study to the meta-analysis can potentially decrease the inconsistency if the studies are very few as in our case however the heterogeneity observed and therefore the inconsistency can also be explained by the differences in patient selection and in the timing of the test the time-lapse from time 0the moment of the possible contact and infectionto the time the test was performed it would be therefore advisable to produce clinical protocols that could standardize the procedure and the classification of patients including the time of possible exposure the prevalence of the disease in a population the time of the onset of the symptoms and the type and timing of other tests performed on the subjects in fact as the heterogeneity in sensitivity observed in the previous studies may depend on the different settings and the different timing it would be advisable to serially test patients recording and evaluating the immune response dynamics over timethis is a research protocol based on a template addressing complexity that is aimed mainly to investigate the possible use of a rapid test for the evaluation of the disease in a population when specific conditions are consideredalthough the result of a rapid diagnostic test offers only binary information positive or negative igm positive or negative igg the result can be crucial in assessing a patient when all the complexity of this disease is considered moreover it can provide a useful tool for the continuous screening of high-risk populations for the implementation of public health programshowever as advised before the information coming from the test alone can be worthless if we do not consider the whole pictureaccording to these criteria we classified the patients to be tested according to the possible inception point and therefore the possible clinical scenario we then produced different groups based on exposure and risk of exposure on the selection criteria and on the immune response to the different tests used to detect the infection these criteria are summarized in table 5this classification allows the evaluation of the upper and the lower limits of the time-lapse where we can place the inception point for each group considered as for figure 3aside from selected and limited cases in fact we cannot establish the exact time of the infection yet we can still gather valuable information if we evaluate the results of the test in different clusters and populations we consider for this specific purpose patients routinely attending primary care facilities or an outpatient department a general practitioners survey or any other health center in the communitywe might apply a similar scheme also in acute settings however we consider the peculiarity of the territorial emergency where asymptomatic patients can unconsciously spread the infection and the characteristics of a primary care department where patients can be followed-up over a longer periodfor our purpose enrolled patients would be classified according to the groups presented in table 5 and for their demographic features in addition all the available information on the recent and past medical history should be recorded with a particular focus on pre- and post-covid-19 results of laboratory testing and other investigations see table 3 and on behaviors or medical conditions that may increase the risk of becoming infected and of becoming seriously illpatients will be serially tested with the colloidal gold vivadiag covid-19 igmigg rapid test the suggested frequency is weekly a shorter interval may be suggested in high-risk settings each patient enrolled in the study would perform an rt-pcr test at the beginning of the study and if symptomaticpatients should be regularly tested up to six months after the estimated time of contagion investigators will record the symptoms and any other medical investigation together with their date of onset and resolutionthe primary outcomes areto establish the accordance of the test with the clinical features of the disease and to assess how the test results change over time in the different clusters of patients as summarized in table 5to establish the reliability of the serologic rapid test to detect a sars-cov-2 infection and therefore its sensitivity and specificity when the integration of anamnestic clinical laboratory molecular imaging criteria are considered as the gold standardthe secondary outcome is the comparison of the serological rapid test with the rt-pcr commonly used to make an etiological diagnosis of covid-19in fact we cannot classify patients according to the results of a single test is positive or negative patients moreover the immune response of the host is still unknown as well as the level of immunity secondary to the infection thus the negative or positive status cannot be assessed and cannot be established by the result of a test the serological response should be interpreted with information coming from the clinical reports consequently before drafting conclusions the data analysis at the end of the study must consider the following considerationsif the test is positive even in the presence of a negative pcr the patient should be considered positive and treated according to his or her clinical picture when igm alone is positive the serological test shows a recent infection even if the patient has not developed any symptoms yet on the other hand if the test is positive for igg alone and the patient is asymptomatic the result can be used for epidemiological purposes some recent investigations 27 however show an inconsistent response of igm and igg in different patients with a seroconversion of both the immunoglobulin classes that reach 100 after a window periodif the test is negative in a symptomatic patient with a high exposure risk the serological test should be routinely repeated considering the window period between the time 0 of the infection and the production of circulating antibodieseven if rapid tests are designed to reduce the measure errors to avoid a false negative it is essential to follow the producers instructions to avoid procedural mistakes for this reason we chose for our research protocol a test based on a very easy procedure such as those already in use for other diseases also in very limited settings and laboratories with very poor resources or auto-diagnostic kits the test is also easy to perform and to read for minimally trained personnel nevertheless because we do not have yes-or-no tests available and given the characteristic of covid-19 it is unlikely that those can be created in the future the clinical assessment of the patients remains crucial this implies that medical history should be correctly collected and clinical signs must be accurately recorded to increase the chance of making a proper diagnosis prognosis and management planlastly all the data collected should be shared with other researchers to prompt further studies and consequently the whole dataset should always be made availablethis protocol dubs a first research trial clinicaltrialsgov identifier nct04316728 available from httpclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct04316728 aimed at evaluating the immune response of negative patients during a covid-19 outbreak plus the clinical performance of the test in early detection the infection and the reliability of the test in those patients who develop clinical signs of covid-19 during the trial preliminary unpublished data match the observations reported in table 1 showing a good correspondence with other research studies and also suggesting a role of serological test for the screening of asymptomatic patientsthe 2020 novel coronavirus pandemic is showing how weak the idea of global health is this worldwide emergency asks and needs prompt answers and original solutions the early diagnosis of coronavirus remains a major issue as a proper screening strategy can improve the design and implementation of workable public health models aimed to confine the virus and to reduce its devastating effect on the population it is therefore paramountalso considering the clinical complexity of this new diseaseto develop accurate user-friendly kits that can help doctors and healthcare workers to make a diagnosis of covid-19 thus molecular scientists must be front-runners in this race against the virus providing their expertise and the unique research capability of their fieldwe investigated the quick detection approach targeting viral igm or igg antibodies with the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic icg strip assay in comparison with real-time rt-pcr testing the advantages of the icg strip viral antibody detection are obvious first of all the sensitivity of the icg strip is comparable especially after 7 days of onset the detection capacity in nuclear acid-negative clinically diagnostic patients is impressive therefore icg strips are highly recommended to be utilized as the supplementary diagnostic approach in clinical applications the icg strip can also be widely adopted in areas where diagnostic capacity is limited secondary the icg strip assay is operational as it is ready to use and timesaving the assay can be finished within 15 min without specialized equipment third unlike oral swab sampling that may cause stimulated retching and coughing which increases the exposure risk of laboratory technicians the blood collection could avoid the unnecessary risk and reduce the operation steps that may cause aerosol fourth the detection of antibodies may also indicate the disease recovery as immunoglobulins are among the most important soldiers in the battle of viruses patients who initially detected as virus-positive and gradually became negative but with detectable igg or igm during the disease progression may be considered as recovered from this battle it is noteworthy that the icg strip can only provide qualitative results but the serological elisa assay against the viral antibody offered the quantitative antibody titer and is regarded as the superior alternation at this point last but not least the strip can be used for community surveillance and therefore for the design of public health strategies aimed to confine the dissemination of the virus to contain an ongoing epidemic and to call off whatever restrictions and measures are needed to reduce the spread of the disease in a timely mannerin conclusion the main advantages of the serological test are higher accuracy in detecting a sars-cov-2 infection even in asymptomatic patients or before the onset of the symptoms when the test is performed after a significant amount of time from the suspect day of contagion and the simpler way of use that allows operators with minimal training to screen a high number of people with fewer sampling mistakes finally it reduces the exposure of health workers performing the test to the virustaking into account the background and in particular long results 27 we speculate that serological tests although needing to be more thoroughly studied could be indispensable weapons for front-line doctors who work in a decentralized setting to have rapid answerstherefore it is crucial to gather all the possible information every time a patient is tested and assessed to understand better how the infection and the immune response work so that we can build risk classes and individual and population profiles that could help clinicians and health policy-makers to define a better strategy to fight the infection and the spread of the disease allowing at the same time people and society to safely go back to normal or more regular lifewe finally endorse and foster a proactive collaboration among molecular researchers and clinicians with the creation of multicentric studies aimed to produce tools that can be used as weapons for the war against this invisible enemy that may undermine the future of the same humankindin 1998 a triple-reassortant swine influenza virus from human swine and avian genomes was identified in the usa 1 ten years later humans were found to be infected with these influenza viruses 2 a novel human influenza a h1n1 virus caused a worldwide respiratory disease outbreak in april 2009 the major transmission route for influenza virus is via respiratory droplets released while coughing 3 4 5 influenza virus replicates in the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract which destroys the host cells further spreading to infect other cells the clinical manifestations of influenza are fever headache myalgia fatigue rhinorrhea sore throat and cough the impact of influenza outbreaks is much higher in children than in adults most healthy adults will recover after 37 days 6 7 8 influenza ah3n2 was the predominant serotype during the 20102011 season whereas the ah1n1 2009 virus still cocirculated with the ah3n2 and influenza b strains 9 the pandemic influenza ah1n1 outbreak resulted in over 18449 deaths in over 214 countries until 2012 10 11conventional diagnostic testing of influenza virus included virus incubation and nucleic acid amplification test virus incubation is the first method used to diagnose virus infections while it takes about 7 days to amplify the virus in the host cells a nucleic acid amplification test is the most sensitive method to detect virus infection but pretreatment of the sample including virus isolation and nucleic extraction still requires about 1 day the above methods are not suitable for the rapid screening of influenza virus 12 in vitro diagnostic devices ivds play crucial roles in disease diagnosis because of their rapid and convenient properties diagnostic accuracy of ivds is dependent on their sensitivity and specificity a previous study evaluated the 3m rapid detection test for the respiratory syncytial virus and found the sensitivity and specificity of the device to be 74 and 100 respectively 13 in april 2011 a study conducted by iregbu et al 14 on the performance of dual path

 the unbroken broken and dotted lines represent the mean mean  1 standard deviation sd and mean  2 sd in the sensitivity tests respectively for ah1n1 the sensitivity of all products was within mean  1 sd fig 1a as to ah3n2 sensitivity however the products e i l and m fell into the mean  2 sd range fig 1b seven products from five imported flu-ivds did not have test sensitivity labeling therefore ha concentrations were used to determine their sensitivities in table 4
 the sensitivities of these seven samples against h1n1 h3n2 and flu b were 5001000 ngml 5003250 ngml and 10006750 ngml respectivelyprevious researchers have used clinical specimens to monitor the clinical performance of flu-ivds a study by drexler et al 17 found that binaxnow influenza ab rapid test kits had a poor clinical sensitivity the sensitivity was 111 for the pandemic h1n1 2009 virus 16 positive cases against 144 polymerase-chain-reaction-confirmed cases a study by uyeki et al 20 also showed that the quickvue influenza a  b test had a low sensitivity 27 for the detection of both influenza a and b viruses the center for disease control and prevention screened 45 specimens with positive results for novel influenza a h1n1 using directigen ez flu a  b and obtained a sensitivity of 49 23we assumed that one of the reasons for the discrepancies was that the human epidemic strains of influenza viruses used in the flu-ivds did not match the current influenza virus outbreak strains pandemic influenza virus strains varied from year to year and from country to country for example the influenza atexas177 strain was used as the master influenza virus strain to develop the monoclonal antibodies in the binaxnow influenza ab rapid test however the major virus strain that caused the influenza outbreak in taiwan was the type ataiwan4392009 h3n2 and type ataiwan90422008 h1n1 other flu-ivds failed to mention the master influenza virus strain used in their preparations therefore inappropriate master influenza virus strains used in the flu-ivd preparations may contribute to the low detection sensitivity moreover studies have shown that analytical sensitivity did not directly reflect the clinical sensitivity on patient specimens the analytical sensitivity of influenza h5n1 detection and seasonal influenza was the same although their clinical performances were poor 23 24 manufacturers should follow who recommendations for the annually pandemic influenza virus strains to be used in their preparation of the flu-ivds in order to improve the quality we also suggest that the class level for flu-ivds in taiwan for government regulations be elevated so that the government can monitor the quality of ivds using a lot release system furthermore taiwan fda should establish a reference or proficiency panel to evaluate in vitro flu-ivds in the near futurepatients suffering from respiratory illness such as cough asthma and emphysema are usually diagnosed with acute respiratory tract infections viruses such as influenza virus coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus commonly cause respiratory tract infections 25 several studies have conducted a specificity test by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis for different respiratory-tract-infection-related viruses 26 27 the specificity of flu-ivds played an important role in the selective interaction of influenza a and b viruses according to the epidemiological studies hcov caused 15 of common colds in adults of which oc43 was the most common 28 hence we used the common hcov-oc43 to determine the specificity of flu-ivds in this study and the result showed that not all flu-ivds cross-reacted with hcov-oc43 suggesting good specificity table 5
in conclusion seven domestic and 31 imported flu-ivds were collected to analyze the sensitivity and specificity analytical sensitivity of flu-ivds for ah1n1 ah3n2 and flu b was 5001000 ngml 1000 ngml and 1000 ngml respectively average sensitivity of ah1n1 and ah3n2 for flu-ivds was log10 58  05 ccid50ml and log10 66  05 ccid50ml respectively no products cross-reacted with hcov-oc43 our results could provide more information for future policy-making strategies and preparedness against seasonal and pandemic influenzacoronaviruses belong to the family coronaviridae which includes four

unlike the endemic hcovs sars-cov and mers-cov are maintained in zoonotic reservoirs the

based on genetic relatedness to other betacoronaviruses sars-cov-2 likely has a zoonotic

are the diagnosis of viral pneumonias such as caused by sars-cov-2 involves collecting
the correct specimen from the patient at the right time the endemic hcovs have been
detected from a variety of upper and lower respiratory sources including throat nasal
nasopharyngeal np sputum and bronchial fluid 122324 wang et al have just reported that oropharyngeal op swabs
n  398 were used much more frequently than np swabs

and testing of both upper and lower respiratory samples sputum bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid bal is recommended 26 however the
collection of sputum and particularly bal via bronchoscopy increases biosafety risk to
healthcare workers through the creation of aerosol droplets proper use of personal
protective equipment ppe by healthcare workers is important bronchoscopy is a highly
technical procedure requiring well-trained staff and may not be available in many parts of
the world upper respiratory specimens are easy to collect thereby increasing access to
testing for patients with mild symptoms and in the resource limited settings sars-cov
and mers-cov rna are also detected from stool urine and blood specimens although
generally less reliably than from respiratory specimens 2628 an exception is sars-cov
rna which is consistently detected in feces at about two weeks after symptom onset 2629
for the most sensitive detection of endemic hcovs upper respiratory specimens should be
collected within the first few days of symptom onset the dynamics of rna shedding in mers
and sars patients may reflect the specimen source severity of illness as well as
underlying risk factors among hospitalized patients who did not require ventilator
support mers-cov rna levels in the upper respiratory tract usually peaked in the first
week after symptom onset among eventual fatal cases requiring ventilation rna levels in
lower respiratory tract specimens peaked between weeks 2 and 3 27 similar shedding patterns were seen for sars-cov rna
positive rates peaked in upper respiratory tract specimens at 710 days after symptom
onset and then steadily declined after that while rna positive rates in lower respiratory
tract specimens remained higher throughout 3 weeks after onset of illness 26 in one study diabetes was associated with
prolonged mers-cov rna shedding in the respiratory tract 27viral pneumonias typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum thus a
nasopharyngeal swabwash is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for
testing nasopharyngeal specimens may miss early infection a deeper specimen may need to
be obtained by bronchoscopy alternatively repeated testing can be used because over
time the likelihood of the sars-cov-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases

accessed 15 february 2020in december 2019 the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 started in wuhan in china 1 but the coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 rapidly spread to other countries as well 2 the first infected patient in the netherlands was detected on the 27th of february 2020 3 accurate diagnostics are fundamental in the fight against this increasing pandemic moreover hospitals would benefit from rapid detection of this virus infection in patients who acutely present to hospitals with respiratory symptoms suspected for covid-19 time delay in the establishment of diagnosis increases logistic challenges and causes stagnation of patient flow in emergency departments as these patients are unable to be transferred to appropriate hospital wards or intensive care units icus when results of the diagnostic tests are still pending 4nucleic acid amplification tests nats are the gold standard because of the high specificity although sensitivity may depend on the timing of disease presentation sampling location and severity of illness 5 nevertheless it usually takes about 4 to 24 hours before laboratory-based results become available depending on specific nat platforms and laboratory organisation therefore numerous lateral flow immunochromatographic assays lfas have been introduced into the market and some countries have stocked up on such rapid tests these lfas detect the presence of igm and igg against sars-cov-2this study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of lfas and compare these to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa and nats in suspected covid-19 patientspatients presenting to a teaching hospital in the netherlands were eligible between march 17 2020 and april 10 2020 when they had respiratory symptoms that were suspected for respiratory tract infection patients were sampled from the oral cavity and subsequently from the nasal cavity using the same nasopharyngeal swab which was tested by nats in some cases sputum samples were tested because of persisting clinical suspicion on covid-19 despite a negative nat on nasopharyngeal swabs nats were performed according to the national reference method that was established after international collaboration 6 or by the ce-ivd kit genefindertm covid-19 plus realamp kit using the sample to result platform elite ingenius the institutional review board waived the need for informed consent as tests were performed on samples which had been acquired for routine clinical care irb protocol number 2020-034 and according to hospital procedure all patients were informed about the possibility of an opt-out if they had objections against the use of left-over material for research to improve or validate diagnostic testing procedures the study was conducted in accordance with helsinki declaration as revised in 2013first in a pilot phase 20 nat-positive and 5 nat-negative patients were retrospectively selected for which six lfas were performed on heparin plasma samples obtained upon hospital presentation figure s1 which corresponded to the dates of molecular testing lfas were included from boson biotech cellex dynamiker biotechnology orient gene biotech prometheus bio and wantai rapid test any visible band for either igg igm or unspecified ig was indicative for a positive result second based on the sensitivity and specificity results in the pilot study the best performing lfa was further evaluated in an extended cohort of randomly selected patients third this lfa was prospectively tested in consecutive patients between april 6 and april 10 fourth specificity was additionally tested in a historical control group of randomly selected sera of 50 adult patients in september 2019 as sars-cov-2 was not circulating at that time finally samples were also analysed by the wantai sars-cov-2 ab elisa kit which detects total antibodies and interpreted according to manufacturers instructions both clinical information and reference standard results were unavailable to the performers of lfas and the elisaall analyses were performed using sas 92 cary north carolina we compared groups using non-parametric tests for continuous variables and chi-square test or fishers exact test for categorical variables as appropriate p-values 005 were considered to be statistically significantin the pilot study sensitivity characteristics of lfa were very heterogenous ranging from 220 10 95 confidence interval ci 0-23 to 1120 55 95ci 33-77 table 1
 we decided to continue with the orient gene biotech covid-19 iggigm rapid test ogbrt as it had the highest sensitivitya total of 111 patients including the 25 from the pilot study were retrospectively selected between march 16 and march 29 subsequently 117 consecutive patients were prospectively included between april 6 and april 10 in total 228 patients were included with a median age of 61 years interquartile range iqr 46-74 117 52 were male 21 9 were admitted to the icu within 24 hours and median c-reactive protein crp upon hospital presentation was 31 iqr 7-95 mgl table s1 median time from symptom onset to sample collection was 7 iqr 4-14 daysogbrt had an overall sensitivity of 4399 43 95ci 34-53 and specificity of 126129 98 95ci 95-100 table 2
 sensitivity increased to 3152 60 95ci 46-73 in patients with at least seven days of symptoms and to 2133 64 95ci 47-80 in patients with crp 100 mgl upon presentation however there was no significant difference between patients requiring icu care within 24 hours after presentation and remaining patients of the 43 both ogbrt and nat-positive patients 14 were both igg and igm positive 10 only igg positive and 19 only igm positivethe elisa showed sensitivity and specificity of 5995 62 95ci 52-72 and 125128 98 95ci 95-100 respectively sensitivity increased to 3848 79 95ci 68-91 in patients with

was positive and the lfa negative whereas in 3 nat-positive patients the elisa was negative and the lfa positive figure s2in the randomly selected historical control sera the lfa and the elisa specificity was 4950 98 95ci 94-100 and 5050 100 95ci 100-100 respectively lfa showed a very weak igg line in one samplethis study shows that the sensitivity of lfa was low in patients suspected for covid-19 presenting to the hospital but it improved in patients with at least seven days of symptoms and in those with crp levels 100 mgl upon presentation specificity of lfas and the elisa was very high and fulfilling a frequently used criterium of at least 98 the elisa had a higher sensitivity compared to lfasseveral countries including spain and the united kingdom have purchased one or more of these lfas however our study findings underline that cautiousness is required when considering implementation of such tests interestingly cellex rapid test which is currently the only rapid diagnostic test that is fda approved performed less than ogbrt in our pilot study another rapid test was reported to have a sensitivity below 20 in acute patients referred to emergency department 7 other studies showed higher sensitivities of lfas up to 90 in unspecified patient groups with more time between disease onset and testing or missing information regarding timing of sampling 89 test performance characteristics as provided by manufacturers were higher than those observed in our study which is related to different selection of positive and negative controls in our study we primarily included consecutive patients presenting to the hospital which represents clinical practice and clinical sensitivity ie diagnosing covid-19 upon hospital presentation rather than analytical sensitivity ie detecting the presence of antibodies at that moment the observed higher sensitivity in patients with at least seven days of symptoms is in line with findings from other studies 10 11there are some study limitations to consider this study included a wide comparison of six different lfas an elisa and nats but more tests are available on the market nevertheless both lfas and the elisa were limited in sensitivity suggesting that antibody production is not always detectable or at least not yet detectable during the early phase of infection second nat as reference standard remains suboptimal and it remains possible that in some cases actual infections were missed in some patients nats were only positive in sputum and negative in nasopharynx whereas the majority of patients were only tested by nasopharyngeal swabs third the subgroup of patients admitted to the icu was limited precluding definite conclusions in this groupin conclusion the high specificity of lfas may contribute to rapidly confirm covid-19 accelerate decision-making in emergency rooms and routing to appropriate hospital wards yet negative lfa results are unreliable to exclude covid-19 due to the limited sensitivity of these tests therefore these lfa tests cannot replace molecular diagnostics in acute care settings but should only be used as an additional triage tool when improvement of hospital logistics is

with severe pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death 1 since september 2012 27 countries have reported cases of mers and who has been notified of 2079 laboratory-confirmed cases with at least 722 deaths by the end of august 2017 2 mers coronavirus mers-cov is a novel virus that belongs to the family coronaviridae and the genus betacoronavirus causes the disease 3 human-to-human transmission appears to be limited to family and health care settings 4 in general a significant proportion of the cases are suspected to be a result of zoonotic transmission serological evidence of mers-cov infection of dromedaries was reported from saudi arabia united arab emirates uae oman qatar jordan pakistan and africa 2 5 6 in addition mers-cov rna has been detected in nasal swabs of dromedaries in qatar oman saudi arabia egypt and uae 2 6 7 8 moreover widespread circulation of different genetic variants of mers-cov in camels with geographic clustering of human and camel mers-cov sequences 6 9 few studies have provided evidence for zoonotic transmission of mers-cov from camels 6 10 11 but the mechanisms of direct or indirect zoonotic transmission have yet to be knownrecently oie has certified bionote rapid mers-cov ag assay for the qualitative detection of mers coronavirus antigens from nasal swabs in dromedary camels with high virus titer herd test and as a complementary test to estimate spread of infection to facilitate risk analysis eg surveys herd health schemes and disease control programs 12in this study mers prevalence rates in relation to locations and seasons were investigated in livestock markets and slaughterhouses in saudi arabia moreover the sensitivity and specificity of the bionote rapid mers-cov ag test was assessed compared with the real-time reverse transcriptase pcr rtrt-pcrthis study was conducted from december 2015 to august 2017 at the ministry of environment water and agriculture mewa riyadh saudi arabia a total of 698 dromedary camels were examined including 435 animals in the livestock markets jeddah al-gandria al-toki arar and najran and 263 animals in south riyadh slaughterhouse table 1
 two swabs were collected from each camel one on viral transport media copan italia italy examined for rtrt-pcr and the second swab on the buffer of rapid mers-cov ag testall collected nasal swabs from dromedaries on viral transport media were transferred to the riyadh veterinary laboratory within 2472 h after collection to be investigated for mers-cov rna by rtrt-pcrcamels less than two years of age were considered young while those over two years old were considered adult the majority camels in slaughterhouses were young less than 2 year age sampling procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the mewa saudi arabiabionote rapid mers-cov ag test kit is a qualitative test it was performed for all samples according to the manufacturing protocol briefly the camel nasal swabs were transferred directly into a tube containing the assay diluents the test strip was then placed into the test tube with the arrows on the strip pointing down and the results were read after 15 min the test was considered negative when only the control c line appeared whereas it was considered positive when both the test line t and the control line c appeared in the absence of the control line c the test was considered invalidmers-cov rnas were extracted from nasal samples by qiagen viral rna extraction kit according to the manufacturers protocol qiagen gmbh hilden germany the rtrt-pcr targeting upstream gene upe of mers-cov was used for screening 13 confirmation was done using the open reading frame orf 1a 5 l of extracted rna was subjected to rtrt-pcr using upe primers using a lightmix molecular dx mers-cov upe kits roche according to the manufacturers protocol all positive samples by the upe assay were then confirmed by orf1a previously described 14to investigate the genetic relationship between the ten mers-cov isolates and other strains whose genomes are available in genbank the whole-genome for ten positive rtrt-pcr samples riyadh 5 and jeddah 5 were ion torrent sequenced according to the primeramplicon combinations 123 sequencing reactions as described earlier 15 the evolution analysis based on full genome sequencing of mers-cov was carried out with mega7 the evolutionary distances were estimated by means of the neighbor-joining method based on kimura 2-parameter method bootstrap analyses were performed with 1000 repeat samples of the data sets 16data collected from the study animals were entered in a microsoft excel sheet then imported into the statistical package for social sciences spss for windows version 220 spss inc chicago illinois for statistical analyses appropriate for each variable the association between mers-cov prevalence in camels and the study variables location season and age were analyzed using the 2-tailed chi-square test and logistic regression model the statistical significance was considered when p  005the results of rapid mers-cov ag assay showed that positive samples of mers-cov were 23 in jeddah livestock market 14 in al-gandria 13 in al-toki 2 in najran 58 in south riyadh slaughterhouse and no positive samples were recorded in northern boundaries table 1 in general the prevalence of mers infection in camels in animal markets and slaughterhouses by rapid screening assay showed 158mers-cov rna detection rate by rtrt-pcr from nasal swabs was showed that 95 positive samples for mers-cov rna in jeddah market 33 samples in al-ganderia market 50 in al-toki market 2 in northern boundaries market 4 in najran market and 210 in south riyadh slaughterhouse table 1 in general the prevalence of mers infection in camels in animal markets and slaughterhouses by rtrt-pcr was 564the genomic sequences obtained from ten camels nasal samples were assembled with mers-cov genomic sequences obtained from the genbank the analysis showed complete similarity between mers-cov camel isolates and mers-cov sequences recovered from human cases fig 1
the rapid mers-cov ag assay was used to examine 698 camel nasal swabs compared to rtrt-pcr 195 nasal swabs were positive in the rapid screening assay showing rapid specificity of 100 in addition 199 nasal samples that were negative in the rapid assay compared to rtrt-pcr showed rapid assay sensitivity of 4949 table 2
the result revealed that a high prevalence rate of mers infection in winter months ranging from 20 in al-toki livestock market may 2017 286 in najran market 337 in al-ganderia market 76 in al-toki market january 2017 85 in jeddah market to 915 in south riyadh slaughterhousethe prevalence of mers infection showed a decreased pattern in summer months ranging from 48 in al-toki livestock market august 2017 81 in south riyadh slaughterhouse august 2017 to 10 in arar livestock marketthe overall prevalence of mers-civ rna in dromedaries in summer mothers juneaugust were lower either by rapid assay 062 or by rtrt-pcr 62 in comparison to higher prevalence rates in winter months decembermay by rapid assay 203 or by rtrt-pcr 715 table 1the prevalence rates of mers-cov rna were significantly higher in young animals 2 years of age indicating increased infection of young camels and high rates of positive samples recorded either by rapid assay 223 or by rtrt-pcr 716 while mers-cov rna prevalence rates were lower in dromedaries 2 years of age either by rapid assay 58 or by rtrt-pcr 33 table 1dromedary camels are likely to be the primary source of middle east respiratory syndrome virus mers-cov infection in humans the routes of direct or indirect zoonotic transmission are yet unknown in this study the prevalence rates of mers-cov were investigated in dromedaries at the livestock markets and slaughterhouse in saudi arabia this study was based on the screening of nasal swab samples by bionote rapid mers-cov ag test kit and by real-time pcr assay targeting the upe and orf1a genes and characterizing genetic diversity of the mers-cov genome sequencesthe presented study showed that high rates of mers-cov infection among dromedary camels in livestock markets and slaughterhouses in saudi arabia the overall prevalence of mers infection in camels in livestock markets and slaughterhouses by rtrt-pcr was 564 previous studies reported a prevalence of 292 of mers-cov infection in al-ahsa province slaughterhouse 17 also a high proportion of 59 of dromedaries 62105 shed mers-cov rna in the central doha animal market and adjoining slaughterhouse in qatar 18 in egypt the mers-cov rna prevalence in nasal swabs at slaughterhouses was 147  among 584 camels 7the analysis of the obtained data based on the season demonstrated that high mers infection rates in winter months varied from 20 in al-toki livestock market to 915 in south riyadh slaughterhouse while the prevalence of mers infection showed a decreased pattern in summer months varied from 48 in al-toki livestock market to 10 in arar livestock market in general prevalence rate of mers infection in camels in winter months by rtrt-pcr was 715 and summer months was 62 in addition the analysis of the data based on age showed that young camels 2 years of age had higher prevalence of mers-cov rna 716 compared with adult camels 2 years of age 33 indicating increased rates of mers-cov infection of young camels these results were in agreement with the previous reports showed that the mers-cov infection in camels was recorded in winter season and young age camels appear to be the highest risk of mers-cov infection 5 6 7the sequences of mers-cov genome were aligned with reference sequences obtained from the genbank the phylogenetic analysis was performed using mega7 genetic analysis revealed a complete identity between camel mers-cov isolates from riyadh and jeddah regions and mers isolates recovered from human patients the similarity of mers-cov sequences recovered from camels and human patients indicating the increased risk of potential zoonosis and camels act as intermediate hosts transmitting the virus to humans these results are consistent with many previous studies 6 9 10the performance of commercial rapid mers-cov ag assay to detect mers-cov antigen was compared with the mers upe and open reading frame 1a orf1a real-time reverse transcriptase pcr rtrt-pcr assay in camel nasal swabs the data showed that out of the 698 camel nasal swabs tested 195 were mers-cov positive and 503 were negative by the ica while 394 were positive and 304 were negative by the upe and orf1a real-time rtpcr therefore the sensitivity and specificity of the ica compared to those of the real-time rt-pcr were 4949 and 100 respectively previous reports recorded sensitivity and screening quality of the ica assay found to be 939 and 100 respectively compared with that of rtrt-pcr also they reported that the ica was less sensitive for the detection of mers-cov antigen 105 tcid50 than was the upe real-time pcr 104 tcid50 the difference between the assay sensitivities might be regarded to the release of subgenomic rna after the onset of cytopathogenic effect cpe in cell culture including the upe target fragment as previously reported 13 14 19 also the rapid mers-cov ag assay cannot detect mers-cov loads  104 or ct value 30 previous report pointed out that the mers-cov rtrt-pcr assay is the specific assay for molecular studies in a variety of animal species and human 12 13 overall rapid screening tests are less sensitive than are confirmatory tests however the advantages of using rapid screening tests are the high throughput and rapid turnaround time without requirements of sample preparation and the use of special equipment therefore the ica is considered satisfactory to be used for screening camel herds against mers-cov antigen across animal markets and slaughterhouses followed by a confirmatory test for positive samplesin conclusion the high prevalence of mers-cov infection among dromedary camels in livestock markets and slaughterhouses especially in winter months and young age animals should be considered as high-risk areas for zoonosis especially for peoples with professional contact with live camels and their bodies in addition to these locations are the drivers of mers-cov circulationno funding sourcesnone declarednot

time to first result from sample preparation to detection of rt-pcresi-ms was 8 h 1 h of rna extraction 4 h of rt-pcr and 3 h of processing in esi-ms the estimated throughput of rt-pcresi-ms was 300 samples with 2 technicians and 24 working hours which represented 1080 pcr reactionsthis study was a hospital-based retrospective pilot proof-of-concept study designed to demonstrate the capacity and to determine the performance of the novel rt-pcresi-ms platform on mock-up samples and previously frozen clinical samples compared to clinical virology assays our study showed that this novel assay was rapid and able to detect and subtype multiple respiratory pathogens in the hospital with 879 accuracy compared to conventional clinical virology assays our study also indicated that pathogens not detectable by traditional clinical virology methods could be successfully detected by the rt-pcresi-ms platformthe rt-pcresi-ms platform has several advantages including rapid turnaround time and a more detailed pathogen characterization ie relative semiquantification typing and subtyping of species versus conventional culture methods the current common diagnostic methods in our clinical virology laboratory are culture-based which may take days to yield results and are labor-intensive and expensive anzueto and niederman 2003 although some rapid antigen tests offer faster detection times their individual lower sensitivity and specificity limit their clinical utility as a sole methodology ginocchio 2007 the rt-pcresi-ms platform has the capability to detect multiple pathogens efficiently and with high sensitivity as well as the ability to determine the quantity of pathogens which would be potential biomarkers of infection course or severity however further prospective validation study will be needed to determine clinical performance of this assaywhile determining the performance of novel assays similar problems have appeared for the discordant analysis of results between the new assays and reference standard tests some researchers confirmed result of the novel assays discordant to the conventional culture or rapid antigen test by another multiplex rt-pcr assay liolios et al 2001 pabbaraju et al 2008 it remains controversial regarding how to examine a potentially more accurate novel assay versus the current alloyed standard doring et al 2008 proposed that clinical evidence of infections should be included in the validation of the novel nucleic acid test however our study design did not permit detailed clinical data collectionwe recognize several limitations of our design first the operation of rt-pcresi-ms was performed almost a year after the initial tests done in clinical virology utilizing excess npa obtained from clinical virology resulted in some specimens not being processed until more than a year after collecting them from patients although the effect of length of storage of npa has been shown to be minimal within 2 months ward et al 2004 the impact of longer periods of storage remains unknown ward et al 2004 demonstrated that multiple freezingthawing cycles did not significantly alter the concentrations measured before freezing the influenza samples while frisbie et al 2004 indicated influenza rna could degrade in the 70 c freezer and may result in some loss of sensitivity the second limitation is that we could not send every specimen for secondary analyses because of insufficient volume of some samples this is an inherent limitation of the retrospective design used here however because almost half of the discordant results was verified by another pcr-based method 12 out of 25 it might have little impact on the estimate future study is merited to perform parallel comparison on every sample by another reference test eg another pcr-based method to better characterize the performance of the platform third we could not test the performance of rt-pcresi-ms on every subtype of clinically relevant respiratory viruses because of the design of the study for those viral subtypes not demonstrated in this pilot study ie parainfluenza types 2 and 4 adenovirus types a and df further study will be required to determine the performance of this novel platform lastly we only performed 5 repeats in the lod experiment in which we utilized the 100 detection 55 criteria to determine the lod but not the 95 detection rule that generally applied in lod studies although the fewer repeats in our study may have limitation in precision of the lods the 100 detection still should be considered a conservative estimate in this pilot study that could provide some evidence for further studiesin conclusion we demonstrated that the innovative rt-pcresi-ms technology could rapidly and accurately detect and subtype most viruses identified by conventional virologic methods detection of conventional viruses missed by clinical virology and unconventional viruses required additional confirmatory testing to further determine the performance characteristics the rt-pcresi-ms method is a promising diagnostic platform for the rapid identification of conventional and unconventional viruses and merits further prospective evaluationinfections of the upper and lower respiratory tract can be caused by a diversity of pathogens both viral and bacterial community-acquired respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of hospitalization and responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality especially in infants the elderly and immunocompromised patients the etiological agent in such infections differs greatly according to season and age of patient with highest prevalences being those of respiratory syncytial virus rsv in children and influenza virus in adults rapid microbiological diagnosis of a respiratory infection is important to ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy and for the effective implementation of isolation precautions 1in the last decade many conventional diagnostic methods such as culture and antigen detection assays have been replaced by molecular assays for diagnosing respiratory tract infections multiplex real-time pcr assays have been developed and implemented for routine diagnostic application detecting a wide variety of pathogens 27 these assays have shown high sensitivity and specificity but the limited number of fluorophores that can be used per reaction resulted in the need to run several real-time pcr assays to cover a broad range of relevant pathogens commercial assays using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification mlpa a dual priming oligonucleotide system dpo or a microarray technology were developed to overcome this problem and are able to detect up to 19 viruses simultaneously 8 9 all applications mentioned require nucleic acid extraction prior to amplification for routine diagnostics these methods are most suited for batch-wise testing with a turnaround time of 6 to 8 h to decrease the time to result and enable random access testing syndromic diagnostic assays have been developed these assays combine nucleic acid extraction amplification and detection in a single cartridge per sample and are suitable for decentralized or even point-of-care testing poct with a time to result of 2 ha novel rapid diagnostic cartridge-based assay for the detection of respiratory tract pathogens using the eplex system fig 1 was developed by genmark diagnostics inc carlsbad ca the eplex respiratory pathogen panel rp panel is based on electrowetting technology a digital microfluidic technology by which droplets of sample and reagents can be moved efficiently within a network of contiguous electrodes in the eplex cartridge enabling rapid thermal cycling for a short time to result following nucleic acid extraction and amplification detection and identification are performed using the esensor detection technology fig 2 as previously applied in the xt-8 system 10in the current study the performance of the syndromic rp panel was compared to those of laboratory-developed real-time pcr assays using clinical specimens previously submitted for diagnosis of respiratory pathogensthe 323 positive clinical specimens contained a total of 464 respiratory pathogens as detected by laboratory-developed real-time pcr assays table 1 as shown in table 2 the 57 nonnasopharyngeal non-nps specimens comprised 69 of the total 464 respiratory pathogens testing all samples with the rp panel resulted in an overall agreement for 452 974 targets from 311 specimens prior to discrepant analysis of the specimens containing a single pathogen the detected targets were concordant in 209217 specimens for samples with coinfection the same pathogens could be identified in 7781 2222 and 33 in the case of 2 3 and 4 pathogens present respectively eight of 12 discordant targets pcrrp had a positive result with threshold cycle ct values of 35 fig 3 retesting with a third assay confirmed 10 of 12 real-time pcr-positive targets being human bocavirus hbov n  3 rhinovirus rv n  2 parainfluenza virus type 2 piv2 n  1 human coronavirus hcov oc43 n  1 hcov 229e n  1 hcov hku1 n  1 and human metapneumovirus hmpv n  1 the two unresolved pcrrp results consisted of two hmpv-positive samples ct values of 332 and 383the rp panel yielded a positive result in 17 specimens where the laboratory-developed test ldt remained negative pcrrp including 15 additional pathogens previously undetected by ldt in the 323 positive specimens and one influenza a h1n1 2009 virus that was detected as influenza a virus by ldt table 1 seven of these 15 additional targets could be confirmed including three of rventerovirus ev all confirmed as rv two of piv4 and one each of hbov and hcov nl63one of the selected negative samples tested positive for human adenovirus hadv in the rp panel but could not be confirmed by discrepant testing all other negative specimens tested negative in the rp panel as wellboth middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov isolates could be detected by the rp panel by testing a 10-fold dilution series of both isolates it was shown that mers-cov with a ct value of 30 in the laboratory-developed real-time pcr assay could be detected using the rp panel while detection with a ct value of 30 was achievable but was not reproducible in every instanceof the 12 specimens from the quality control for molecular diagnostics qcmd 2016 respiratory ii pilot external quality assessment eqa study panel 10 were detected in full agreement with the content as reported by qcmd table 3 the 2 false-negative tested specimens both contained hcov nl63 of which one was a coinfection in an hmpv-positive sample both specimens had been tested with the laboratory-developed real-time pcr assay as well and were found positive for hcov nl63 both with ct values of 374the qnostics evaluation panel consisted of 17 samples including 15 different respiratory pathogens and one negative sample table 3 the rp panel detected 15 of the specimens in agreement with the content whereas hadv type 1 and chlamydophila pneumoniae were not detected real-time pcr detection of these specimens was performed to confirm the presence of the respective pathogen in the specimen and was found positive for both hadv ct value of 314 and c pneumoniae ct value of 354the performance of the eplex rp panel was assessed by retrospective testing of 343 clinical respiratory specimens obtained in 2009 to 2016 comprising five different types of specimens although the rp panel had been ce in vitro diagnostic ce-ivd cleared for detection of respiratory pathogens from nps swabs only we included a range of alternate sample types that can be obtained and tested for respiratory pathogens in the diagnostic setting by including a total of 57 respiratory non-nps specimens with different pathogens table 2 it was shown that the rp panel was able to accurately detect the pathogens in the different types of specimens as the assay showed 100 concordance with ldt for sputum samples preprocessing with sputasol was introduced after the initial 6 tested specimens since 1 false-negative result was found which was resolved on retesting with sputasol pretreatment further studies need to determine the frequency of preprocessing of sputum samples before efficiently running the rp panelspecimens for inclusion in this study were previously tested at two different sites using both their own systems and validated assays although the initial setups of the ldt assays were the same 11 12 minor adjustments of the assays and the use of different pcr platforms may affect the performance of the ldts and therefore were a limitation of this studycomparison of the results from the rp panel with the results from the routine multiplex real-time pcr showed an agreement of 974 in 464 pathogens tested figure 3 shows that pcrrp targets are mainly targets with a low viral or bacterial load based on ct values analysis of real-time pcr results with ct values of 35 provided an agreement between the rp panel and laboratory-developed real-time pcr of 991 specimens containing pathogens with a high load ct value of 30 were all detected correctly by the rp panel independently of the type of specimen type of pathogen or the number of different pathogens in a specimen this finding is in line with earlier evaluation of the genmark xt-8 system using the same esensor principle of detection 10 with 29 concordant targets with a ct value between 35 to 40 and 4 targets with a ct value of 40 the rp panel showed good detection rates with regard to lower viral or bacterial loads as well fig 3although the performance of the rp panel appeared to be excellent using the tested specimens in this study for piv4 n  2 and c pneumoniae n  0 the number of clinical specimens that could be analyzed was too low for a proper assessment of the assay which was a limitation of this studyin 14 different specimens the rp panel identified 15 pathogens that had not been detected by routine testing pcrrp in addition one influenza a virus detected by ldt could be detected as influenza a h1n1 2009 virus by the rp panel one of the selected negative samples was shown to contain an hadv while all other pcrrp targets were detected as copathogens to other positive targets in the samples all the pcrrp targets were found in samples obtained from 1 institute discrepant analysis on the eluates of these samples was performed using the ldt of the other institute where seven of the additionally detected pathogens could be confirmed by discrepant testing these samples showed a relatively low viral load based on the mean ct value found 333 probably around the limit of detection of the initial ldt it was unclear whether the 8 unresolved pcrrp targets are false positive or the results of more efficient detection of multipathogen infections by the esensor technology 10a small number of ldt-negative specimens n  20 was included in this study since the main objective of this study was to determine the performance of the rp panel in detecting respiratory pathogens although this is a limitation of the current study we believe that this issue will be addressed extensively in upcoming prospective clinical studiesowing to the lack of clinical specimens containing mers-cov dilutions of two different culture isolates were tested in this study of which dilutions with ct values of 30 as shown by the laboratory-developed real-time pcr assay could be detected consistently it should be noted that the real-time pcr assay has been developed for research use and has not yet been validated for clinical useassessment of the rp panel using eqa samples from qcmd and qnostics showed results that are in line with the results obtained from clinical specimens a total of 4 targets included in the eqa samples could not be detected using the rp panel showing ct values of 35 n  3 and 314 n  1 when tested by real-time pcrthe rp panel on the eplex system enables rapid testing and can be used as a diagnostic system in either a laboratory or a decentralized setting that is closer to the patient the assay turned out to be rapid and straightforward to perform compared to routine testing hands-on time of the rp panel was very low 2 min whereas the hands-on time of the routine testing was about 30 to 45 min depending on the nature and number of samples tested the overall run time of the platforms was also in favor of the eplex system as it takes approximately 90 min for nucleic acid extraction amplification hybridization and detection whereas routine testing takes up to 2 h and 45 min using different systems and multiple real-time pcr assays in multiplex an important advantage of the eplex system is the possibility of random access testing compared to batch-wise testing in the current diagnostic real-time pcr approach with a relatively short turnaround time and the potential to randomly load and run up to 24 specimens the eplex system is very suitable for testing stat samples which require immediate testing in contrast to ldts where ct values represent a quantitative indicator the eplex system generates qualitative results only the ct value is dependent on many different factors such as sample type and course of infection and can therefore differ greatly even within a single patient hence a qualitative result eg identification of the pathogen is the major factor for patient managementthe costs of reagents per sample are relatively high for eplex compared to ldt however when taking into account the hands-on time of technicians and the clinical benefit of more rapid results the assay will most likely be more cost-effective studies evaluating a rapid diagnostic assay for respiratory pathogens such as the filmarray respiratory panel biofire diagnostics salt lake city ut have already shown the impact of rapid diagnostics for respiratory pathogens since it decreased the duration of antibiotic use the length of hospitalization and the time of isolation delivering financial savings 13 14 although the rp panel on the eplex system has the same potential clinical studies remain to be conducted to fulfill this potentialin conclusion this study shows excellent performance of the genmark eplex rp panel in comparison to laboratory-developed real-time pcr assays for the detection of respiratory pathogens from multiple types of clinical specimens and eqa samples the system provides a large amount of useful diagnostic data within a short time frame with minimal hands-on time helping to reduce laboratory costs for labor and deliver a faster result to the clinician in order to aid in appropriate antimicrobial therapy therefore this syndrome-based diagnostic assay could be used as rapid diagnostic testing in many different settingsclinical specimens selected for this study have previously been submitted and tested prospectively for diagnosis of respiratory infections at either the specialist virology center at the royal infirmary of edinburgh rie or the medical microbiology laboratory at the leiden university medical center lumc specimens were selected using the laboratory information management system of the corresponding institute without prior selection based on ct value ethical approval for this study was granted by the medical ethical committee provided that anonymized samples were used a total of 343 clinical specimens 286 nasopharyngeal nps swabs 21 sputum samples 16 bronchoalveolar lavage bal fluid samples 10 throat swabs and 10 nasopharyngeal aspirates were used for this study 323 positive and 20 negative in the absence of clinical samples middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov isolate jordann3 and recombinant mers-cov isolate emc2012 were tested finally the qcmd 2016 respiratory ii pilot study panel 12 samples and a custom external quality assessment eqa evaluation panel of 17 samples provided by qnostics ltd glasgow united kingdom were testedin short the routine testing method consisted of total nucleic acid extraction by the nuclisens easymag system 45 min biomrieux basingstoke united kingdom or the magna pure lc system 45 min to 1 h 30 min depending on the number of samples roche diagnostics almere the netherlands at the rie and the lumc respectively an input volume of 200 l per specimen and elution volume of 100 l were used for all specimen types amplification and detection were performed by real-time pcr using the abi 7500 fast thermocycler 1 h applied biosystems paisley united kingdom or the bio-rad cfx96 thermocycler 1 h 40 min bio-rad veenendaal the netherlands at the rie and the lumc respectively real-time pcr assays were tested with updated versions where needed of primers and probes as described previously 11 12original clinical specimens were retrieved from storage at 70c and thawed at room temperature after vortexing 200 l of the specimen was pipetted into the sample delivery device with a buffer provided by the manufacturer for 16 out of 21 sputum samples preprocessing was done using sputasol oxoid basingstoke united kingdom according to the manufacturers procedures with the exception of washing the sputum and incubation at 37c for 15 min on a shaker at 500 rpm after gentle mixing of the specimen and buffer in the sample delivery device the mixture was dispensed into the cartridge using the sample delivery port which was subsequently closed by sealing with a cap after scanning of the barcode of the eplex rp panel cartridge and the barcode of the corresponding sample the cartridge was inserted into an available bay of the eplex system the test then started automatically and ran for approximately 90 mina single cartridge of the rp panel is able to detect 25 respiratory pathogens including differentiation of subtypes of influenza a virus parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus rsv table 1 internal controls for extraction bead delivery and movement within the cartridge are present as well as those for amplification digestion and hybridization of dna and rna targets for every specimen tested a sample detection report was created comprising the results for all targets and internal controls results of the targets are reported as positive or not detected if an internal control fails this will be noted on the detection report and samples should be retested with a new cartridgein the case of discrepant results the discordant sample was retested either with a new eplex cartridge if the real-time pcr was positive and the rp panel was negative pcrrp or with the laboratory-developed real-time pcr assay in the case of pcrrp results for unresolved discrepancies additional testing with a third pcr assay different primers and probe was performed for final resolutionthe covid-19 pandemic caused
by the sars-cov-2 virus has led to more than three million confirmed
cases with over 211000 deaths globally as of april 27 2020 the
living and working conditions of billions of people worldwide have
been significantly disrupted due to different forms of social distancing
and lockdowns in many cities the world economy has been remarkably
weakened as a result of business shutdowns and major restrictions
on travel widespread availability of accurate and rapid testing procedures
is extremely valuable in unraveling the complex dynamics involved
in sars-cov-2 infection and immunity to this end laboratories universities
and companies around the world have been racing to develop and produce
critically needed test kitsone of the many challenges for
containing the spread of covid-19 is the ability to identify asymptomatic
cases that result in spreading of the virus to close contacts a study
of the passengers on a diamond princess cruise ship forced into temporary
quarantine from an early outbreak of covid-19 estimated the asymptomatic
proportion among all infected cases at 179 95cri 1552021 therefore the actual number of sars-cov-2-infected
individuals may be much higher than currently accounted for based
on positive test results2 having accurate
convenient and rapid testing for widespread deployment can aid in
eliminating the silent spread of covid-19 by asymptomatic viral carriersbecause covid-19 exhibits a range of clinical manifestations from
mild flu-like symptoms to life-threatening conditions it is important
to have efficient testing during the early stages of infection to
identify covid-19 patients from those with other illnesses this avoids
unnecessary quarantines of negative individuals and the spread of
infection by positive individuals early diagnosis permits physicians
to provide prompt intervention for patients who are at higher risk
for developing more serious complications from covid-19 illness more
complicated diagnostic testing based on viral genomic sequencing is
an essential tool for determining the rate and degree of mutational
variability associated with sars-cov-2 and for identifying newly emerging
strains of the virus for more effective vaccine development until
a commercial vaccine becomes available it is important to identify
individuals who have been infected with sars-cov-2 with or without
accompanying symptoms and who have developed antiviral immunity
this allows for additional analyses of strength and durability of
immunity across general populationscommercially available
covid-19 tests currently fall into two major categories the first
category includes molecular assays for detection of sars-cov-2 viral
rna using polymerase chain reaction pcr-based techniques or nucleic
acid hybridization-related strategies the second category includes
serological and immunological assays that largely rely on detecting
antibodies produced by individuals as a result of exposure to the
virus or on detection of antigenic proteins in infected individuals
it is important to reemphasize that these two categories of tests
serve overlapping purposes in management of the covid-19 pandemic
testing for sars-cov-2 viral rna identifies sars-cov-2-infected individuals
during the acute phase of infection serological testing subsequently
identifies individuals who have developed antibodies to the virus
and could be potential convalescent plasma donors it also furthers
the ability to conduct contact tracing and monitor the immune status
of individuals and groups over time3timely diagnosis effective treatment and future prevention are
key to management of covid-19 the current race to develop cost-effective
point-of-contact test kits and efficient laboratory techniques for
confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection has fueled a new frontier of
diagnostic innovation in order to assist ongoing innovation we developed
this report to provide an overview of current covid-19 diagnostic
trends and strategies based on conventional and novel methodologies
including crispr it includes current information on test kits and
developers as well as data on covid-19 diagnostic trends based on
journal publication information extracted from the cas content collections
and medlinert-pcr relies on its ability to amplify
a tiny amount of viral genetic material in a sample and is considered
to be the gold standard for identification of sars-cov-2 virus currently
rt-pcr tests for covid-19 generally use samples collected from the
upper respiratory system using swabs in addition a few studies have
also been done using serum stool or ocular secretions57 recently the rutgers clinical genomics laboratory developed an
rt-pcr assay taqpath covid-19 combo kit that uses self-collected
saliva samples which is quicker and less painful than other sample
collection methods lowers the risks to healthcare providers and
may enable higher volume testing89as illustrated
in figure 1 rt-pcr
starts with laboratory conversion of viral genomic rna into dna by
rna-dependent dna polymerase reverse transcriptase this reaction
relies on small dna sequence primers designed to specifically recognize
complementary sequences on the rna viral genome and the reverse transcriptase
to generate a short complementary dna copy cdna of the viral rna
in real-time rt-pcr the amplification of dna is monitored in real
time as the pcr reaction progresses this is done using a fluorescent
dye or a sequence-specific dna probe labeled with a fluorescent molecule
and a quencher molecule as in the case of taqman assays an automated
system then repeats the amplification process for about 40 cycles
until the viral cdna can be detected usually by a fluorescent or
electrical signal10rt-pcr has traditionally been
carried out as a one-step or a two-step procedure one-step real-time
rt-pcr uses a single tube containing the necessary primers to run
the entire rt-pcr reaction two-step real-time rt-pcr involves more
than one tube to run the separate reverse transcription and amplification
reactions but offers greater flexibility and higher sensitivity than
the one-step procedure it requires less starting material and allows
for the ability to stock cdna for quantification of multiple targets11 the one-step procedure is generally the preferred
approach for detection of sars-cov-2 because it is quick to set up
and involves limited sample handling and reduced bench time decreasing
chances for pipetting errors and cross-contamination between the rt
and real-time pcr stepsto date the majority of molecular
diagnostic tests have utilized the real-time rt-pcr technology targeting

in table 1 in section 25 and supporting information irt-pcr tests
are constantly evolving with improved detection methods and more automated
procedures for example the eplex sars-cov-2 test developed by genmark
diagnostics inc21 uses the true
sample-to-answer solution eplex instrument to detect sars-cov-2
in nasopharyngeal swabs each test cartridge contains reagents for
magnetic solid-phase extraction of viral rna cdna amplification
and detection combining electrowetting and genmarks esensor
technology target dna is mixed with ferrocene-labeled signal probes
complementary to specific targets the target dna hybridizes to the signal and capture probes which are both bound to gold-plated
electrodes the presence of a target is determined using voltammetry
which generates specific electrical signals from the ferrocene-labeled
signal probealthough rt-pcr is the most widely used method
for detecting sars-cov-2 infections it has the disadvantage
of requiring expensive laboratory instrumentation highly skilled
laboratory personnel and can take days to generate results as a result
a number of companies and laboratories around the globe are working
to further improve the efficiency and timeliness of the rt-pcr technologies
and develop various other techniquesrt-lamp has been developed as a rapid and cost-effective testing
alternative for sars-cov-2 as shown in figure 2 rt-lamp requires a set of four primers
specific for the target generegion to enhance the sensitivity and
combines lamp with a reverse transcription step to allow for the detection
of rna the amplification product can be detected via photometry
measuring the turbidity caused by magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate
in solution as a byproduct of amplification the reaction can be followed
in real time either by measuring the turbidity or by fluorescence
using intercalating dyes since real-time rt-lamp diagnostic testing
requires only heating and visual inspection its simplicity and sensitivity
make it a promising candidate for virus detection23as shown in table 1 in section 25
a few of the currently available molecular assays for detecting sars-cov-2
utilize real-time rt-lamp technology such as the id now covid-19
test from abbott diagnostics see supporting information i for details this point-of-care test is rapid 13 min or
less and is used to detect sars-cov-2 viral rna in upper respiratory
swabs but is limited to one sample per run2425the rt-lamp test prepared by zhang et al uses reverse transcriptase
warmstart rtx from biolabs to convert the viral rna to cdna which
is subsequently amplified by the dna-dependent dna polymerase bst20
warmstart for rapid colorimetric detection with a dna-binding dye
syto-9 thermofisher s3485426 the enzyme
is a unique in silico designed rna-directed dna polymerase coupled
with a reversibly bound aptamer that inhibits rtx activity below 40
c it is particularly well-suited for use in lamp the colorimetric
lamp has been shown to be effective at detecting viral rna in cell
lysates at levels of approximately 480 rna copies without interference
providing an alternative to rt-pcr for rapid and simple detection
of sars-cov-2 rnatma is a patented single tube isothermal
amplification technology modeled after retroviral replication which
can be used to amplify specific regions of either rna or dna much
more efficiently than rt-pcr27 it uses
a retroviral reverse transcriptase and t7 rna polymerase and has been
used for detection of nucleic acids from multiple pathogens on the
basis of this principle hologics panther fusion sars-cov-2
test was developed validated and issued emergency use authorization
eua by the us food and drug administration fda28 the panther fusion platform is distinctive because of its
high testing throughput up to 1000 tests in 24 h and its capability
to simultaneously screen for other common respiratory viruses whose
symptoms overlap with covid-19 using the same patient sample and collection
vialthe initial step involves hybridization of the viral rna
target to a specific capture probe and an additional oligonucleotide
containing a t7 promoter primer which are captured onto magnetic
microparticles by application of a magnetic field then the captured
rna target hybridized to the t7 promoter primer is reverse transcribed
into a complementary cdna the rnase h activity of the reverse transcriptase
subsequently degrades the target rna strand from the hybrid rnacdna
duplex leaving a single-stranded cdna which includes the t7 promoter
an additional primer is used to generate a double-stranded dna which
is subsequently transcribed into rna amplicons by t7 rna polymerase
these new rna amplicons then reenter the tma process allowing this
exponential amplification process to generate billions of rna amplicons
in less than 1 h the detection process involves the use of single-stranded
nucleic acid torches that hybridize specifically to the rna amplicon
in real time each torch is conjugated to a fluorophore and a quencher
when the torch hybridizes to the rna amplicon the fluorophore is
able to emit a signal upon excitationclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats crispr represents a family of nucleic acid sequences found
in prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria these sequences can be
recognized and cut by a set of bacterial enzymes called crispr-associated
enzymes exemplified by cas9 cas12 and cas13 certain enzymes in
the cas12 and cas13 families can be programmed to target and cut viral
rna sequences29two companies mammoth
biosciences and sherlock biosciences established by the crispr pioneer
scientists are independently exploring the possibility of using the
gene-editing crispr methodology for detection of sars-cov-2 the sherlock
method developed by sherlock biosciences uses cas13 that is capable
of excising reporter rna sequences in response to activation by sars-cov-2-specific
guide rna30 the detectr assay by mammoth
biosciences relies on the cleavage of reporter rna by cas12a to specifically
detect viral rna sequences of the e and n genes followed by isothermal
amplification of the target resulting in a visual readout with a
fluorophore31 these crispr-based methods
as depicted in figure 3 do not require complex instrumentation and can be read using paper
strips to detect the presence of the sars-cov-2 virus without loss
of sensitivity or specificity these tests are both low-cost and can
be performed in as little as 1 h these tests have great potential
for point-of-care diagnosis43233an alternative method of isothermal nucleic acid amplification
known as rolling circle amplification rca has attracted considerable
attention for nucleic acid detection since in isothermal conditions
it is capable of 109-fold signal amplification of each
circle within 90 min rca is advantageous in that it can be performed
under isothermal conditions with minimal reagents and avoids the generation
of false-positive results frequently encountered in pcr-based assays
an efficient assay for the detection of sars-cov by rca was previously
performed in both liquid and solid phases and used to test clinical
respiratory specimens34 this method however
has not been deployed for detection of sars-cov-2 at this pointmicroarray assays have been used for rapid high-throughput detection
of sars-cov nucleic acids as shown in figure 4 they rely on the generation of cdna from
viral rna using reverse transcription and subsequent labeling of cdna
with specific probes the labeled cdnas are loaded into the wells
of microarray trays containing solid-phase oligonucleotides fixed
onto their surfaces if they hybridize they will remain bound after
washing away the unbound dna thus signaling the presence of virus-specific
nucleic acid35 the microarray assay has
proven useful in identifying mutations associated with sars-cov and
has been used to detect up to 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms snp
associated with mutations in the spike s gene of sars-cov with 100
accuracy36the ability to detect different
emergent strains of sars-cov-2 may become necessary as the covid-19
pandemic evolves and microarray assays provide a platform for rapid
detection of those strains as a result of mutational variation although
one of the drawbacks of microarray testing has been the high cost
generally associated with it a nonfluorescent low-cost low-density
oligonucleotide array test has been developed to detect multiple coronavirus
strains with a sensitivity equal to that of individual real-time rt-pcr37 in addition a portable diagnostic platform
based on the microarray chip has been used to identify nucleic acids
specific to the mers coronavirus as well as to influenza and respiratory
syncytial viruses38this diagnostic technique for identification
of sars-cov-2 relies on a dual approach involving the use of amplicon-based
sequencing in addition to metagenomics sequencing metagenomics sequencing
is used primarily to address the background microbiome of infected
individuals it allows for the ability to rapidly identify both the
sars-cov-2 virus and other pathogens contributing to secondary infections
influencing the severity of covid-19 symptoms amplicon-based sequencing
of sars-cov-2 allows for potential contact tracing molecular epidemiology
and studies of viral evolution metagenomics approaches such as sequence-independent
single primer amplification sispa provide additional checks on sequence
divergence this dual technique is particularly relevant to sars-cov-2
in assessment of its rate of mutation and to detect its possible recombination
with other human coronaviruses both of which have implications for
vaccine development and antiviral efficacyamplicon and metagenomics
minion based sequencing were used by moore et al 2020 to rapidly
within 8 h sequence the genome of sars-cov-2 and the other microbiome
in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from patients with covid-19 by the
isaric 4c consortium39 for the amplicon-based
system the group chose 16 primer binding sites from conserved regions
in the sars-cov-2 genome to sequentially amplify roughly 1000 bp fragments
with an approximately 200 bp overlapping region these primer sets
were then used to generate 30 amplicons from the cdna which were
subsequently sequenced using miniona next-generation shotgun
metagenomics sequencing platform has been developed by illumina with
the ability not only to detect the presence of multiple strains of
coronaviruses but also to comprehensively examine multiple pathogenic
organisms present in a complex sample the illumina metagenomics workflow
involves sample preparation using their truseq ribo-zero gold rrna
depletion kit library preparation using truseq stranded total rna
sequencing using the illumina benchtop sequencing system and final
data analysis using their lrm resequencing module or idbydna explify
platform40while the scientific literature has enumerated many different molecular
genetic assays that have been used to detect viral nucleic acids over
the years most recent assays developed to detect the sars-cov-2 virus
rely on rt-pcr and isothermal nucleic acid amplification technologies
because of the urgent need for assays for covid-19 diagnosis manufacturers
commercial laboratories and molecular-based laboratories can request
eua for their tests from the fda or other regulatory agencies for
diagnostic purposes new tests approved by the fda for emergency use
are based on analytic validity and developed under idealized conditions
using verified positive samples and negative controls without a requirement
for demonstrated clinical validity41 eua
approval for tests from manufacturers and commercial laboratories
limits the testing to be done in clinical laboratories that have been
certified under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of
1988 clia on the other hand the eua approval of tests from molecular-based
laboratories laboratory developed tests limits the testing to be
done at the single laboratory that developed the test and is certified
under cliaof 112 currently available molecular assays for
detecting sars-cov-2 detailed in supporting information table s1 90 utilize pcr or rt-pcr technologies 6 utilize
isothermal amplification technologies 2 utilize hybridization technologies

designed for detecting and quantifying substances such as peptides
proteins antibodies and hormones the test can be qualitative or
quantitative and the time to results is typically 15 h in
the case of sars-cov-2 as shown in figure 5a the plate wells are typically coated with
a viral protein if present antiviral antibodies in the patient samples
will bind specifically and the bound antibodyprotein complex
can be detected with an additional tracer antibody to produce a colorimetric
or fluorescent-based readout elisa is speedy has the ability to
test multiple samples and is adaptable to automation for increased
throughput but can be variable in sensitivity and is suitable
for point-of-care determinationsthis test is typically a qualitative positive
or negative chromatographic assay that is small portable and used
at the point-of-care the test is a type of rapid diagnostic test
rdt as the result can be obtained in 1030 min in practice
fluid samples are applied to a substrate material that allows the
sample to flow past a band of immobilized viral antigen if present
anti-cov antibodies are collected at the band where along with co-collected
tracer antibodies a color develops to indicate the results as shown
in figure 6 the test
is inexpensive and requires no trained personnel but provides only
qualitative results when used in conjunction with symptomology a
diagnosis of infection may be feasible rapid antigen tests section 36 where anti-cov
antibodies are used in place of immobilized viral antigen allow for
a more direct assessment of ongoing infectionneutralization assays
determine the ability of an antibody to inhibit virus infection of
cultured cells and the resulting cytopathic effects of viral replication
for this assay patient samples of whole blood serum or plasma are
diluted and added at decreasing concentrations to the cell cultures
if neutralizing antibodies are present their levels can be measured
by determining the threshold at which they are able to prevent viral
replication in the infected cell cultures the time to results for
neutralization assays is typically 35 days but recent advances
have reduced this to hours4950 this type of testing
requires cell culture facilities and in the case of sars coronavirus
biosafety level 3 bsl3 laboratories despite these limitations
determination of neutralizing antibodies is important in the short
term for the therapeutic application of convalescent plasma and in
the long term for vaccine developmentluminescent immunoassays comprise methods that
lower the limits of detection for antibody-based reagents generally
they involve chemiluminescence and fluorescence cai et al have developed a peptide-based magnetic chemiluminescence
enzyme immunoassay for diagnosis of covid-19 and diazyme laboratories
inc san diego california announced the availability of two new
fully automated serological tests for sars-cov-2 that are run on the

this platform utilizes a cell-based immunosensor that couples capture
of the virus with signal amplification to provide a result in 35
min the biosensor is slated to be available for research purposes
in may 202054complementary to molecular genetic assays are
the rapid antigen tests that allow detection of viral antigens5556 as shown in figure 5b these tests rely on specific monoclonal antibodies to provide
a mechanism for the capture of viral antigens from an analytical sample
these assays are not restricted to a particular format examples include
a colorimetric enzyme immunoassay for sars-cov in 200457 an enhanced chemiluminescent immunoassay for
sars-cov in 200558 and more recently a
fluorescence lateral flow assay59 for the
detection of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid proteintable 2 provides a collection of current available serological and
immunological assays for covid-19 diagnosis and a complete list of
similar assays is provided in supporting information table s21215 finally while serological and immunological tests have a huge potential
for tracing the sars-cov-2 virus most of these tests are still in
the development phase serological testing has been used to a limited
extent to determine infection status in combination with molecular
genetic assays seroprevalence and immune protection status for
healthcare workers this testing is impacted by the fact that
only a subset of patients with positive molecular genetic assay results
for sars-cov-2 infections are seropositive due to the delay in antibody
production there is currently no clear or strong evidence correlating
seropositivity with immune protectiona significant research effort has been devoted
to the development of new covid-19 diagnostic tests that are faster
and more reliable since the outbreak of the covid-19 crisis over
500 journal articles related to laboratory testing have been published figure 7 shows that the number
of journal articles focused on covid-19 diagnostics has significantly
increased over the past few months indicating a continuous research
and development effort in this areatable 3 lists 10 notable
journal articles published from january 31 2020 through april 10
2020 these articles that highlight a variety of covid-19 diagnostic
methods were selected based on a number of factors including journal
impact factor and number of citationsdownloadsmany of the diagnostic methods discussed are based on patented technologies developed over the past 20
years and scientific journal publications related to diagnosis of
viral infections sars-cov-2 belongs to the genus betacoronavirus
that also includes sars-cov and mers-cov therefore diagnostic studies
on those closely related coronaviruses may shed light on the ongoing
efforts to develop effective diagnostic assays for sars-cov-2 infection
more information about patents related to detection of sars-cov and
mers-cov is provided in supporting information iinucleic
acid and amino acid sequences in cas registry obtained from sars-cov-2-related
journals were analyzed for potential applications in diagnostics table 4 lists selected journal

information from sars-cov-related patents is provided in the supporting information table s3while the past few months have witnessed rapid progress in diagnostic
kit development for covid-19 the race continues to develop even more
efficient laboratory techniques and cost-effective point-of-care
test kits that can be deployed in mass quantities this report provides
a broad survey of molecular genetic assays and serological and immunological tests for
identification of covid-19 infection while rt-pcr has been the dominant
technique for detection of viral rna other nucleic acid assays including
isothermal amplification assays hybridization microarray assays
amplicon-based metagenomics sequencing and the cutting-edge crispr-related
technologies are also under development or have resulted in approved
tests60 the efficiency of such testing
has also been significantly improved this report also provides trend
analysis of journal articles related to covid-19 diagnostic techniques
the number of fda eua-approved tests available for covid-19 diagnosis
keeps growing but the many new tests are still in various
stages of development ultrarapid test kits and point-of-care tests
are a major focus of development in order to speed up the response
time for treatment and eliminate the need for elaborate laboratory
equipment and waiting time involved with testing in approved laboratoriesthe urgent need for accurate and rapid diagnosis of sars-cov-2
infection remains critical as global healthcare systems continue to
operate during the course of the covid-19 pandemic in particular
serological and immunological testing of infected asymptomatic and
symptomatic individuals and their close contacts is expected to
be in high demand in addition to its role complementary to molecular
genetic testing to confirm suspected cases this type of testing would
provide valuable information about the course and degree of immune
response as well as the durability of immunity in both infected individuals
and participants in vaccine clinical trials
the results from these tests may assist epidemiological assessment
and can be used to manage the return to normal activities however
many questions regarding serological tests remain to be addressed
including their degree of sensitivity and specificity finally it
remains to be confirmed that the presence of antibodies against sars-cov-2
indeed correlates with immunity to the virusin summary significant
progress has been made in the development of diagnostic tests despite
all the remaining questions and challenges ongoing global efforts
are working to communicate and facilitate new diagnostic assay development
and worldwide test kit delivery to promote more accurate and faster
diagnostic solutions a number of organizations are supporting these
efforts by inviting assay developers to submit their test products
for independent evaluation or by providing huge investments for greater
collaboration as similar initiatives and knowledge sharing become
available including collaborative technological advancements it
is likely that the covid-19 diagnostic market will continue to thrive

mortality iuliano et al 2018 shi et al 2019 on the other hand there are emerging infectious diseases which were according to the definition by the who hitherto unknown or rare but are now rapidly spreading either in number of cases or geographically who 2014a in the last 20 years in addition to the emergence of novel influenza and coronaviruses advances in molecular detection methods have led

polyomaviruses ki and wu kipyv wupyv were first discovered in 2007 allander et al 2007 gaynor et al 2007 and although often detected in samples their role in causality of respiratory illness is still under discussion reviewed in jartti et al 2012 in 2007 the human rhinovirus group c rv-c was introduced when newly sequenced strains differed significantly from the existing groups a and b lee et al 2007 finally avian influenza viruses aiv such as iav h5n1 h7n7 or h9n2 crossed the species barrier to infect humans several times in the last years reviewed in kim et al 2016lab-based techniques still dominate the field of virus diagnostics classical methods such as virus cultures electron microscopy and serology have been complemented by nucleic acid amplification tests naats sequencing including next generation sequencing and different antigen detection methods today in most clinical settings naats have replaced virus cultures as the gold standard due to their high specificity faster turnaround times and absence of limitations posed by the need for susceptible cell lines fox 2007in contrast to lab-based tests point-of-care tests pocts are performed at the site of sample collection eg bedside physicians office or emergency department and provide results usually in 2 h basile et al 2018 vos et al 2019 furthermore they require only little hands-on time and no specific laboratory training as most critical steps are automated in a single device the latter may range from handheld to benchtop size and is not designed for high-throughput sample processing pocts and other fast diagnostic tests performed in laboratories but provide results within 12 h may be called near-pocts prompt identification of the causative pathogen may help the responsible healthcare professional choosing the appropriate treatment or take the right decisions in outbreak situations regarding hospitalization and quarantine brendish et al 2015in this review we provide a brief overview of

sars-cov-2 as well as specific subtypes of aiv h5n1 h7n9 h10n8 and reassortant iav strains remains challenging schuster and williams 2018 who 2020a the diagnosis of most of these viruses is based on molecular techniques that can only be performed at specialized referral centers recently there has been increased interest in using pocts in other settings such as emergency departments although implementation might be hampered by the need for specific training bouzid et al 2020 naats have higher sensitivity than immunochromatographic assays but generally they require a higher degree of technical skills and training drancourt et al 2016 polymerase chain reaction pcr remains the gold standard technique for the diagnosis of aiv subtypes while who recommends against the utilization of rapid tests in avian flu diagnosis who 2005 monne et al 2008 schuster and williams 2018 rv-c is typically detected from nasopharyngeal specimens using reverse transcriptase pcr rt-pcr and specific species and serotypes can be further identified by semi-nested pcrs or sequencing bochkov et al 2011 jartti et al 2012 schuster and williams 2018diagnosis of hbov was based on the detection of the specific igm antibody along with a 4-fold increase of the igg titer or low igg avidity indicative of seroconversion but adaptive immune response requires several hours or even days to develop thus the utility of such tests in acute settings is limited soderlund-venermo et al 2009 as hbov dna persists in airway secretions for months after an acute infection quantitative pcr along with serology are currently the preferred diagnostic methods christensen et al 2019 viral dnaemia mrna detection via rt-pcr and antigen immunodetection assays have shown some promising results but further studies to

different types of sensors for rapid identification of respiratory viruses have been developed recently by using a gold-coated array of carbon electrodes the authors were able to detect mers-cov spike protein in the picogram range within 20 min layqah and eissa 2019 this electrochemical assay is based on the competitive binding of a mers-cov antibody either to the virus in the sample or to the immobilized antigen on the electrode which can be measured by a reduced peak current through the chip in theory this technique can be easily expanded to simultaneously detect multiple viruses however its diagnostic performance needs to be validated with the use of patient samplesdifferent types of biosensors for aiv detection use nanobio hybrid materials reviewed in lee et al 2018 in one of those approaches a dna probe coupled to a field-effect transistor enabled detection of target dna down to 1 fm lin et al 2009 another sensitive technique is based on surface plasmon resonance spr in which biomolecules bound to a metal surface lead to the reduction of the reflection of an incident light beam tang et al 2010 chang et al 2018 with a new antibody against a recombinant aiv h7n9 the authors were able to reach a detection limit of a few hundred copies per ml nasal fluid within 10 min of processing time although still experimental the characteristics of this approach render it a promising candidate for a future rapid poctin a capillary convective pcr ccpcr the reagents circulate across a temperature gradient in a simple capillary tube which allows run times shorter than 30 min chou et

method into a 15 kg device for the automation of the detection of different iav strains zhuo et al 2018 although fast and sensitive manual rna extraction limits the use as poct so far hardick et al presented another portable naat device not only for the detection of iav but also for ibv rsv and mers-cov it is based on a rt-pcr in microfluidic cards but likewise lacks automated nucleic acid extraction hardick et al 2018alternatively to nucleic acid-based techniques giant magnetoresistive gmr biosensors function comparable to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay but use magnetic labels instead of enzymes or fluorophores coupled to detection antibodies hall et al 2010 with such a sensor wu et al constructed a handheld device which in connection with a computer or smartphone was able to detect iav h3n2 in purified and disrupted virus solutions wu et al 2017 although h3n2 strains are circulating already since 1968 in the human population smith et al 2004 this method is likely adaptable to emerging aivs with the use of appropriate capture antibodiesby designing a prototype for a lateral flow assay for approximately 5 us huang et al proved that the simultaneous detection of iav and ibv in swab samples is possible at very low costs huang et al 2017 however the sensitivity of this prototype needs significant improvements before it can be used under clinical conditions instead of constructing a completely new apparatus cui et al used commercially available glucose test strips together with specifically designed glucose-bearing substrates to test for the cleavage activity of iav neuraminidase in spiked samples cui et al 2017although the majority of the presented approaches and prototypes focuses on the detection of influenza viruses most of them can theoretically be applied to emerging or new viruses with only minor changesin comparison to pcrs isothermal naats do not require complex devices when working with extracted nucleic acids reverse

respiratory viruses has taken up pace in recent years healthcare professionals hospital managers and laboratory directors will need to update and re-evaluate best practices regularlythe advancement of diagnostic capabilities may change the way we identify document and communicate respiratory viral infections in the future along with these developments the expectations of patients and healthcare professionals may change as well ie patients will want to know the responsible pathogen and their clinical prognosis with the development of specific antiviral therapies and vaccines new diagnostic algorithms will be needed to ensure the highest quality of care while containing costsfrom a viewpoint of quality of care and clinical management timely infection control and the ability to act upon results the future will likely belong to portable clia-waived rapid diagnostic tests that take 1020 mina key criterion for the evaluation of diagnostic tests will be their clinical utility ie their ability to identify the current culprit for the patients symptoms and to distinguish relevant pathogens from bystander pathogens more research is needed to correlate clinical outcomes and laboratory dataa second concern will be the correct timing of diagnostic testing with regards to a patients course of illness the sensitivity and positive predictive value of a diagnostic test depend on specimen quality and virus load which is usually higher in children and early in the course of illness duration of viral shedding and patients immune status future diagnostic algorithms will need to consider these factors in addition to the epidemiology of viruses in the respective season or regionthe initial criticism of pocts was directed toward a lack of sensitivity and a high degree of variability in test results early studies during the 200910 flu pandemic reported sensitivities for influenza pocts ranging from 20 to 70 for the same test kit rath et al 2012 in published evaluation studies it was not entirely clear whether pocts were performed at the bedside or whether samples were sent to the laboratory which would constitute a near-poct these methodological inconsistencies also impaired the value of meta-analyses comparing the point-of-care performance of different commercial tests chartrand et al 2015 the reported performance differences also hint to the fact that the training and experience of the staff performing the test have an impact procedural concerns were most pronounced with early-stage lateral flow strip tests where the result was read manually second-generation antigen pocts and modern molecular pocts achieve significantly higher reproducibility and sensitivity through automation of key steps in the process in 2018 the fda implemented new performance regulations setting new sensitivity thresholds required for pocts to maintain approval fda 2017 as a result only several influenza pocts were taken off the market the role of regulators in setting quality standards for pocts cannot be underestimated zhang et al 2016 azar and landry 2018in addition to the reliability of the poct result itself the hands-on time and the time-to-result are still critical for user-acceptance at the bedside it is expected that future pocts will be more robust and easier to useas the majority of acute respiratory infections ari is of viral origin these infections are common reasons for inappropriate antibiotic use harris et al 2016 tief et al 2016 studies have raised the expectation that expanded use of virus diagnostics at the point-of-care may help to limit the use of antibiotics bonner et al 2003 the european health action plan on amr european parliament 2018 and the oneill report on tackling drug-resistant infections globally oneill 2016 both point to rapid diagnostics as a key instrument in tackling amr including pocts in antimicrobial stewardship programs might increase their acceptance by physiciansthe ability to direct the right treatment to the right patient at the right time facilitates precision medicine in the future advanced virus diagnostics may be combined with biomarker pocts for the prediction of individual-level host responses to further target treatment to those who are most likely to benefit from ita major obstacle to expanding the use of pocts is cost in fact pocts would be most impactful in settings where the majority of early treatment decisions are made the current pricing schemes however seem too high for broad-scale testing in the community and emergency departments in addition to pricing reimbursement strategies need to be reconsidered even in hospital emergency rooms per-capita standard reimbursements disincentivize the use of virus diagnostics in patients with ari up-to-date economic models are needed to clarify the cost-effectiveness of different types of poctsthe steepest increase in antimicrobial resistance is being observed in low-middle income countries lmic who-paho 2018 for lmic portable pocts with multi-modality for known and emerging pathogens or simple lab-based instrumentation with nominimal need for cold chain or refrigeration of reagents may be the most likely to succeednone of the currently commercially available pocts covers all viruses discussed here tables 1 2 supplementary table 1 to date the same holds true for new technologies as well however it is conceivable that these techniques may be adapted to other respiratory viruses after having shown their usefulness in practice especially biosensors have the potential for a wider spectrum of applications they also do not encounter the major limitation of naats as pocts the extraction of nucleic acids ali et al 2017 for these tests even less obvious complications like the stability of the plastic materials against required chemicals have to be overcome for future highly specific nucleic acid-based poctsany ideal poct should fulfill the assured criteria of the world health organization to be applicable in resource-limited settings mabey et al 2004 currently this is most likely true for tests based on lateral flow immunochromatography but coming improvements eg in miniaturization and battery capacity may facilitate the use of other test principles basile et al 2018while economic benefits of pocts and better outcomes for the patients are still discussed it is likely that these tests will gain further importance with decreasing processing costs and improved robustnesscs and pn planned structured and edited the manuscript pn searched the literature and integrated all

2020 on 20 january 2020 world health organization who declared the outbreak of covid-19 a global public health emergency of international concern zheng et al 2020 the incidence of covid-19 has increased drastically with more than three million cases reported worldwide causing more than 200000 deaths baud et al 2020 the clinical manifestation of covid-19 ranges from mild illnesses such as fever cough and dyspnea to life-threatening syndromes including pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome or even death bedford et al 2020 bernheim et al 2020 covid-19 has high transmission capability making the prevention and control difficult chen s et al 2020 as there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for covid-19 early and prompt diagnosis is important to reduce the risk of life-threatening complications and mortality through appropriate health care lee et al 2020 xiao and torok 2020with the advances in poc testing chip-based eg polydimethylsiloxane pdms biosensors and paper-based biosensors eg lateral flow test strips or three-dimensional 3d paper-based microfluidic biosensors have been developed for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases choi et al 2017 yew et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 they are widely used to detect antibodies antigens or nucleic acids in crude samples such as saliva sputum and blood based upon colorimetric fluorescent or electrochemical detection approaches choi et al 2015 tang et al 2017a yee et al 2018 they offer many advantages such as being affordable sensitive specific user-friendly rapid and robust equipment-free and deliverable to end users assured gong et al 2017 toms et al 2019 the result can be obtained in a fast and simple manner which allows rapid decision-making hence minimizes the risk of human-to-human transmissionin view of the escalating demand for rapid diagnosis of covid-19 a mini review that summarizes the recent progress in developing poc biosensors for covid-19 is highly desirable in this review article the most recent advances in poc biosensors including both chip-based or paper-based biosensors for the detection of covid-19 infection are reviewed the advantages of each biosensors along with the commercially available covid-19 biosensors are summarized finally the existing challenges and future perspectives of developing robust and fully integrated poc biosensors for covid-19 are briefly discussedchip-based biosensors have been broadly used for point-of-care diagnosis of infectious diseases they are mainly made of pdms or polymethyl methacrylate pmma zarei 2017a zhang et al 2017 these biosensors allow automated precise manipulation of fluid flow with small volume of samples they are able to minimize reagent consumption which enables high throughput analysis dincer et al 2017 nasseri et al 2018 pdms chip-based biosensors in particular have attracted scientific interest due to its biocompatibility high transparency and cost-effectiveness nayak et al 2017 they have been explored in both antibodies and nucleic acid detection for monitoring infectious diseases wang et al 2016 darwish et al 2018 recent studies have focused on the development of sample-to-answer platform for nucleic acid testing as they are more sensitive and specific than antibody assays for example a study has developed a sample-to-answer lab-on-a-disc biosensor loo et al 2017 this pdms-based biosensor consists of multiple channels that allows automated nucleic acid extraction isothermal amplification loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp and real time signal detection syto-9 dye is used for detection which binds to the double-stranded dna from lamp reaction and emits green fluorescence the intensity of fluorescence signal indicates the amount of target detected the biosensor is self-contained for performing sample heating and chemical lysis for both extraction and amplification processes the entire sample-to-answer processes take 2 h while the platform is portable the size of biosensor is relatively large which requires further improvement the biosensor can be readily customized to detect covid-19 viruses in the near futuremore recently one group has integrated digital amplification process into a sample-to-answer chip-based biosensor to quantify nucleic acids which further simplifies the entire process of nucleic acid testing yin et al 2020 the biosensor integrates nucleic acid extraction multiplex digital recombinase polymerase amplification rpa and fluorescence detection into a single biosensor it is mainly made of pdms layers with a glass slide as a supporting substrate the specific primer mixture and all of the reaction solution for rpa except magnesium acetate are added onto three different detection areas and lyophilized once the sample is added the cell is lysed and the nucleic acids bind to the magnetic beads following the washing and elution steps the reagents are passively driven into the digital rpa area using vacuum-based self-priming approaches for isothermal amplification followed by fluorescent imaging as the fluorescence probe is labeled with carboxyfluorescein fam which is detectable by the uv light the fluorescence signal intensity is proportional to the concentration of amplicons the biosensor could achieve three main steps of nucleic acid testing within 45 min without requiring complex instrument and control systems this integrated biosensor shows immense potential to rapidly and accurately detect covid-19 in patient samplesbesides fluorescence signal detection colorimetric detection approach has also been used in chip-based biosensors the output of isothermal amplification eg lamp has been visualized by colorimetric indicators eg calcein or hydroxynaphthol blue hnb that interact with amplicons or byproducts ie pyrophosphate seok et al 2017 quyen et al 2019 wang et al 2019 calcein binds manganese ions that quench fluorescence and the complex interacts with pyrophosphate to express fluorescent signal dou et al 2019 hnb changes color from violet to sky blue upon reacting with pyrophosphate yang et al 2018 to improve the portability and functionality of chip-based biosensors one has developed an automated portable sample-to-answer biosensor coupled with a smartphone for colorimetric detection of pathogens ma et al 2019 it consists of a microfluidic structure layer a hydrophilic layer a pdms hydrophobic layer and a glass substrate the biosensor is able to i purify pathogens with specific affinity reagent pre-conjugated to magnetic beads ii conduct lysis at low temperatures iii perform lamp and iv quantify the results based on colorimetric signals hnb is used as an indicator or visual dye for amplicons as mentioned the lamp reaction changes the color of lamp products from violet to sky blue the entire process is about 40 min which is automatically performed and being monitored using a smartphone future work should include storing the reagents on chip to make it more applicable at remote settingspaper-based biosensors have attracted more significant attention for use in poc testing as compared to chip-based biosensors owing to their cost-effectiveness biodegradability as well as ease-of-fabrication functionalization and modification hu et al 2017 bhm et al 2018 choi et al 2019 with these characteristics they are able to achieve rapid onsite poc testing in remote settings tang et al 2017b lateral flow test strips in particular have been widely used for the detection of covid-19 they are designed to detect igg and igm in patient whole blood serum and plasma samples li et al 2020 sheridan 2020 each test strip generally consists of i a sample pad to add patient samples ii a conjugate pad containing covid-19 antigen conjugated with gold nanoparticles gold-covid-19 and gold-rabbit igg iii a nitrocellulose membrane that consists of a control line coated with goat anti-rabbit igg an igg test line coated with anti-human igg an igm test line coated with anti-human igm as well as iv an absorbent pad that absorbs waste li et al 2020 sheridan 2020 in the presence of igm andor igg in patient samples the antibodies react with gold-covid-19 antigen to form a complex which moves across the nitrocellulose membrane and interact with the anti-igm andor igg at their respective test line the gold-rabbit igg in turn reacts with anti-rabbit igg coated at the control line to produce a visible red color a positive igm and a negative igg or positive at both lines indicate a primary or acute infection while a positive igg with a negative igm shows a secondary or later stage of infection du et al 2020 li et al 2020apart from antibody testing some lateral flow test strips with sample-to-answer capability have been used for nucleic acid testing which could potentially detect covid-19 nucleic acids in respiratory samples for instance a group has introduced a fully integrated paper-based biosensor that involves three main steps of nucleic acid testing ie nucleic acid extraction lamp and detection producing colorimetric signal detected by lateral flow test strip rodriguez et al 2016 however this integrated biosensor requires an external heat block for amplification to simplify the platform for poc applications a small and portable heater has been developed in combination with four-layered paper-based sample-to-answer biosensor choi et al 2016a this biosensor consists of fast technology analysis fta card and glass fiber for nucleic acid extraction and lamp along with an integrated lateral flow test strip for visual detection each functional layer is separated by hydrophobic polyvinyl chloride substrates that control the fluid flow from one layer to another to further simplify the processes a semi-automated fully disposable and integrated paper-based biosensor has been developed tang et al 2017c this integrated biosensor consists of a paper-based valve and a sponge-based reservoir to extract nucleic acids from crude samples a portable battery and a heater integrated into the platform for isothermal amplification ie helicase dependent amplification hda as well as a lateral flow test strip for colorimetric detection the proposed biosensor allows on board reagent storage with the use of sponges and equipment-free isothermal amplification which significantly simplifies user steps more recently lateral flow test strip has been combined with paper folding technologies for sample preparation lamp and lateral flow detection reboud et al 2019 the integrated test strip consists of buffer chambers that regulate fluid flow acetate films which prevent sample evaporation filter paper-based valves that prevent lamp reagent from mixing with other reagents and a lateral flow test strip this integrated technology is suitable for use in resource-limited settings to test crude samples eg sputum offering great potential to rapidly detect nucleic acids of covid-19 50 minbesides lateral flow test strips several 3d paper-based microfluidic biosensors have been developed to detect proteins or nucleic acids at the poc xia et al 2016 lam et al 2017 these biosensors usually detect targets based on fluorescence or colorimetric detection approaches metal ions eg magnesium calcium or silver have been used in 3d paper-based microfluidic biosensors to react with base purine or pyrimidine from double stranded dna to form a stable complex that show fluorescent signal upon uv irradiation for example a fully integrated and foldable biosensor encapsulated with agarose have been developed for long-term reagent storage and multiplex fluorescence detection trinh et al 2019 the biosensor consists of a reaction zone and a detection zone agarose that carries lamp reagents and silver nitrate reaction indicator is deposited and stored in reaction and detection zones for at least 45 days the sample is added into reaction zones which are then closed with an adhesive sealing film to avoid sample evaporation before being placed on a portable heater for amplification following the amplification process the sealing film is removed and the detection zone is folded and soaked into the reaction zone uv light is used to visualize the reaction between amplicons and silver ions the brown color intensity of the test zone increased along with the increased concentration of amplicons the biosensor is simple and user friendly which is expected to detect covid-19 nucleic acids in patient samplesmore recently as a new alternative fuchsin has been explored for the detection of dna amplicons based upon colorimetric detection approach using a 3d paper-based microfluidic biosensor trinh and lee 2019 in the absence of dna amplicons addition of sodium sulfite molecule and fushsin produces fushsin leucosulfonic acid or leucofushsin which is colorless in the presence of dna amplicons aldehyde groups of the dna bind to sulfonate groups and the bond between hydrogen sulfite and the central c atom is broken producing the fuchsin with chromophoric structure which appears to be purple signals mello and de campos vidal 2017 the proposed biosensor is composed of a sample zone a reaction zone and a detection zone the detection zone consists of paper strips with fuchsin stained lines briefly sample is injected into the sample zone which is sealed with an adhesive sealing film to prevent sample evaporation the reaction zone is folded to bind to the sample zone and the biosensor is turned upside down to enable the flow of sample from sample zone to reaction zone the biosensor is heated on a hot plate at 65c for 30 min for lamp after lamp the sealing film is peeled off and the hydrochloric acid is injected into the reaction zone sodium sulfite is subsequently added and the changes of fuchsin-stained line color is observed unlike the above-mentioned biosensors this biosensor produces simple colorimetric signals detectable by the naked eyes without requiring any external readers which shows promising for rapid diagnosis of covid-19 infections at the pocapart from developing chip-based and paper-based biosensors other material-based biosensors such as textile-based film-based or carbon-based biosensors have also been introduced for potential use for covid-19 parrilla et al 2016 afsahi et al 2018 mogha et al 2018 they are developed to improve the functionality and detection sensitivity of the existing biosensors providing more promising choices for practical use textile-based biosensors such as thread-based fabric-based or cloth-based biosensors have been developed with simple fabrication processes and improved assay performance one study has incorporated polysiloxanes with tunable hydrophobicity into thread-based biosensors to delay fluid flow in lateral flow assay and improve detection sensitivity choi et al 2018a similar to conventional lateral flow test strip the fluidic delay in thread increases interactions between gold nanoparticles-antibodies aunp-ab and targets with the optimum conditions the increase in interactions produces more aunp-ab-target complexes showing 10-fold more sensitive than the unmodified biosensors this biosensor is simple-to-fabricate and highly sensitive which shows immense potential in detecting igg and igm in covid-19 patients for appropriate health monitoringin addition to textile-based biosensors film-based biosensors have been developed to detect infectious microorganism from crude samples for instance a film-based biosensor has been introduced which consists of a transparent polyester film substrate a sample chamber a cover a reaction chamber and a waste chamber kukhtin et al 2019 microarray 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylamide gel elements are synthesized with the incorporation of oligonucleotides into gels and polymerization under uv irradiation the gel elements are covalently attached to the substrate briefly both sample and master mix are first introduced into chambers the capillary action promotes uniform filling of the chamber and amplification is subsequently performed wash buffer is then introduced and the pressure leads the waste to the waste chambers lastly fluorescent imaging and analysis are performed the flexible film substrate used in the study offers several advantages for poc testing i allows covalent attachment of gel without pre-treatment processes ii has low background fluorescence iii has transparent properties that allows optical inspection iv able to withstand thermal cycling and compatible to amplification processes this flexible film allows easy fabrication and is user-friendly which costs 500 times less than other substrates ie glass demonstrating its potential for detecting covid-19 virus in patient samplesapart from these 2d materials such as graphene or black phosphorus have also been integrated into biosensors for poc diagnosis which could potentially be used for covid-19 testing jin et al 2017 choi et al 2018b liu et al 2018 for example a recent study has introduced a portable graphene-based electrochemical biosensor for highly sensitive poc testing kampeera et al 2019 graphene-based electrodes are constructed by screen-printing mainly due to low cost ease of fabrication and high production rate the screen-printed graphene electrodes spge are synthesized by either substituting carbon with graphene or incorporating graphene into carbon paste spge have been reported to show superior electrochemical properties than commonly used screen-printed carbon electrodes spce by having a higher electron transfer rate and a larger electrochemical surface area after nucleic acid extraction lamp is performed using a simple heating block the interaction between spge and amplicons results in a shift in cathodic current which stems from the intercalation of redox probe to double-stranded dna this phenomenon enables quantification of lamp product a portable mini potentiostat is used in combination with spge for on-site detection the next step should be the integration of extraction platform into the proposed biosensor to make it more portable and user-friendlybesides graphene black phosphorus bp or phosphorene-based biosensors have also been extensively explored for medical diagnosis qian et al 2017 ge et al 2019 luo et al 2019 bp displays excellent electrochemical properties which enhances assay sensitivity and selectivity owing to its inherent redox properties for example a recent study has reported the development of a label-free electrochemical biosensor with an aptamer-functionalized bp nanostructured electrode kumar et al 2016 the bp nanosheets are coated with poly-l-lysine pll that allows functionalization of bp with antiab-aptamers the aptamers are immobilized onto the nanosheets via the coulomb interaction between aptamers and pll the presence of target antigens causes the direct oxidization of iron ii to iron iii at the electrode surface through the mechanism of electron transfer as compared to reduced graphene oxide rgo bp-based biosensors show a higher detection sensitivity and specificity achieving the detection limit down to pg level compared to ng level achieved by rgo biosensors the proposed biosensor would allow highly sensitive detection of igg or igm against coronavirus in patient blood samplesin summary this review article discusses the poc biosensors that made of pdms paper and other flexible materials such as textile film and carbon nanosheets for rapid diagnosis of covid-19 the cost-effectiveness simplicity rapidity and portability of these biosensors play a crucial role in poc applications antibody tests are suitable to detect the late stage of infections while nucleic acid tests detect the presence of nucleic acids viruses at the early stage of infection showing a higher sensitivity and specificity than antibody tests however current nucleic acid tests require three key steps ie nucleic acid extraction amplification and detection involving more complicated processes than that of antibody tests in fact most of the commercial poc biosensors for covid-19 are paper-based biosensors or lateral flow test strips for antibody detection igg and igm that produce colorimetric signal while these antibody tests display lower specificity compared to nucleic acid tests they have helped shortening the turnaround time for rapid diagnosis allowing fast decision making future work should include specificity improvement or combination with other tests such as rapid nucleic acid tests to further confirm the test resultrecent studies have integrated sample-to-answer processes into a single biosensor to detect nucleic acids of pathogens and human antibodies against the pathogens which could be further explored to detect covid-19 infections in addition current works have also attempted to improve detection sensitivity simplicity and performance of biosensors assay sensitivity can be enhanced through enzyme-based signal enhancement he et al 2011 sample concentration moghadam et al 2015 or much simpler fluidic-control strategies choi et al 2016b further nucleic acid tests in particular that involves three key steps should be simplified and integrated into a single biosensor for poc use the biosensors discussed in this review show immense potential to be developed into a self-contained platform for the detection of covid-19 infections outside the laboratory particularly in the remote settings or developing areasin the future more studies should focus on simplifying user steps and incorporating all key steps into a single biosensor at minimal cost loo et al 2019 the capability of storing all reagents on chip is vital to eliminate the requirement for large storage equipment deng and jiang 2019 whereas the multiplexing capability of biosensors would increase throughput dincer et al 2017 as compared to other detection approaches such as fluorescence and electrochemical detection approaches colorimetric detection represents the most common approach mainly due to its simplicity and the ability to observe signal with the naked eyes the biosensors that produce colorimetric signals enable visual detection without requiring extra tools such as uv lamp which would be helpful for rapid on-site diagnosis chan et al 2016 yang et al 2019 quantification which provides more accurate readout has been achieved using smartphone apps which could be performed by untrained users at poc settings future studies should further improve the function of smartphone and specific smartphone apps that enable on-site data analysis while allowing data storage to track patient health status roda et al 2016 wang et al 2017 liang et al 2019 xu et al 2020 additionally incorporating portable power sources such as batteries into biosensors would significantly advance their functionality especially in rural areas where electricity supply is limited zarei 2017b in short emerging poc biosensors with the aforementioned capabilities could rapidly identify the spread of covid-19 and guide appropriate health care playing a key role in managing the outbreakthe author confirms being the sole contributor of this work and has approved it for publicationthe author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interestcoronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 due to a novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is now a global pandemic there are more than 15 million confirmed cases across almost every country in the world and at the time of writing early april 2020 there were close to 100000 recorded deaths1 the diagnosis of covid-19 can be challenging and like any disease entity a number of factors including disease stage disease prevalence patient profile and sample type and quality amongst other factors can influence diagnostic test performance in this review we outline the performance outcomes of key tests used to diagnose covid-19 and considerations that modulate performance safety of health-care workers collecting the samples laboratory safety aspects and experimental approaches such as detection of volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath mass spectrometry studies of different sample types methods of signal amplification and utility of other novel approaches are not discussed herecountry-specific indications and criteria for testing have evolved rapidly and are being updated as information emerges and as the epidemic progresses these recommendations have been guided by the phase of the epidemic and available resources generally speaking testing for covid-19 currently should be considered in anyone with symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection upper or lower and with or without systemic symptoms such as fever fatigue and myalgia25 in mild disease testing directs the need for self-isolation and identification of new cases through contact tracing and testing of contacts as the epidemic progresses and with forecasted limited testing capacity testing may be directed to specific subgroups or those with enhanced risk of a poor outcomein the clinical setting covid-19 will form part of the differential diagnosis of any acute respiratory presentation including infectious causes of pneumonia eg bacterial influenza other viral pneumonia pneumocystis pneumonia tuberculosis tb acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd acute pulmonary embolism cardiac failure and other conditions relevant investigations will depend on the clinical context and will likely include pulmonary imaging relevant laboratory investigations blood cultures and interrogation of urine andor lower respiratory tract specimens to rule in a viral mycobacterial fungal andor a bacterial cause clinical and laboratory parameters that may suggest viral infection may include pyrexia acute malaise and myalgia and lymphopenia c reactive protein crp is unhelpful in distinguishing covid-19 from other infections procalcitonin is elevated in severe covid-19 and when there is secondary bacterial infection67 in early disease procalcitonin may distinguish covid-19 from bacterial infections but not from other viral diseases data are awaited to confirm this supposition in those with underlying asthma or copd the presence of pulmonary infiltrates may favour a respiratory infection-related cause though a cardiac cause must also be considered in the differentialthe most common sample types sent for testing usually by means of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr are nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples obtained with a swab placed in viral transport medium there is already considerable shortage of reagents and swabs meaning that dry swabs are being sent to the laboratory in some centres dry swabs are less costly and more conducive to community-based testing but data are urgently required to determine the comparative sensitivity of dry swabs compared to using viral transport medium taking into account the time from sample acquisition to sample processing samples from the lower respiratory tract including sputum tracheal aspirate bronchial washings and bronchoalveolar lavage may also be sent in patients with covid-19 disease samples from the lower respiratory tract are more likely to test positive discussed below viral rna can also be detected in stool in 30 of cases and in blood in 1 of cases 8 but rarely in urinerecent data from infections in special contexts such as cruise liners9 and in close contacts of covid-19 patients 10 have demonstrated that sars-cov-2-specific rt-pcr may be positive in the early phase of the disease and that viral shedding in the asymptomatic phase and in the early prodromal phase can be considerable1112 at present screening of asymptomatic individuals by rt-pcr has been constrained by limited testing capacity and the need to focus on public health efforts and resources on symptomatic personsin symptomatic individuals 8090 of patients have mild symptoms not requiring hospitalisation depending on age and the presence of risk factors 1020 of symptomatic persons may require admission to hospital because of respiratory or other complications individuals in this enhanced risk category may have one or more risk factors including age greater than 50 years comorbidities history of significant tobacco smoking and underlying immunocompromising illnesses1013 in mild disease especially in the early stages the rt-pcr false negative rate is 304081415 a meta-analysis reported that a single test 10 days post symptom development had a 33 false negative rate using a nasopharyngeal swab 5289 for a throat swab16 ai et al reported a false negative rate of 41 in a cohort of 1014 hospitalised patients the estimated median interval between the initial negative test and subsequent positive rt-pcr result was 51  15 days17 a selection of other studies reported false negative rates of between 3 and 291820 notably some patients required up to five repeat tests before a positive result was ascertained19 this false negativity phenomenon may be due to several factors including a low viral load below the detection limit of the assay low sample volume or cellular mass during acquisition sampling location upper versus lower respiratory tract sample degradation during transport or storage sample processing methodology and the timing of sampling in relation to the stage of the disease rt-pcr positivity may progressively increase during the course of the disease14test accuracy will depend on the quality of the specimen collected20 it has since been shown that specimens from the lower respiratory tract have a higher viral load and hence more likely to test positive than specimens from the upper respiratory tract821 nasopharyngeal specimens have better yield compared to oropharyngeal samples815 in hospitalised patients with severe disease wang et al found a sensitivity of 93 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 72 in sputum and 63 in nasal swabs sensitivity ranged from 0 to 32 in pharyngeal swabs faeces blood and urine8 given these considerations a negative test from an upper respiratory tract specimen should be repeated after 13 days the optimal timing is unclear or a lower respiratory tract specimen obtained to exclude a false negative result if clinical suspicion is high22viral shedding in asymptomatic early prodromal minimally symptomatic individuals and after resolution of symptoms all help us to explain the rapid and extensive spread of covid-19 in patients with more severe diseases including those with lower respiratory tract infection but also in individuals with mild disease high viral loads can be detected often for several days after the resolution of symptoms23 the significance of this remains unclear though recent data from a limited number of patients suggest that rt-pcr positivity does not necessarily mean shedding of infectious virus after symptom resolution11 zhifeng et al demonstrated that rt-pcr using nasopharyngeal samples can be negative even when there is ct scan evidence of covid-19 pneumonia24 ali et al showed an improvement in disease extent in 42 of ct scans prior to rt-pcr tests becoming negative17 it is unclear whether patients whose symptoms have resolved but who continue to have detectable viral rna in respiratory samples can transmit infection furthermore when symptoms have resolved and especially given limited testing capacity it remains unclear when patients may be discharged from icu into the general ward setting or from hospital into the community setting especially if there are other individuals with high-risk profiles living in the same household thus there are no clearly defined guidelines about when it is safe for social mixing to occur after symptoms have resolved health-care workers safety must be taken into account when collecting sputum and should ideally be performed in an infection-controlled environment or in the open air in ambulant patientscurrently rt-pcr is the imperfect gold standard for the diagnosis of covid-19 the development of molecular detection assays has been facilitated by the sequencing of sars-cov-225 the assay consists of two principal steps i viral rna extraction from patient specimens performed manually or using automated platforms and ii reverse transcription and pcr amplification using specific primers and specific probes for real-time detection see figure 1 for an overview the use of robotic systems allows for increased throughput for rna extraction and pcr set-up because of current resource constraints trained personnel and reagents and the necessity to rapidly deliver test outcomes most diagnostic laboratories are skipping the post-extraction rna quality and quantification check which is costly and labour-intensiveseveral sars-cov-2 targets are being used and these include the envelope e nucleocapsid n rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp genes and two large open reading frames orf1aorf1b and rnase p4 generally at least two target genes need to be identified for sars-cov-2 confirmation however interpretation algorithms differ with respect to the number of genes that need to be detected for the test to be considered positive for some protocols results are interpreted as indeterminate or negative if one of the genes is not detected whereas for others identification of one gene is used as screening test while that of the subsequent genes serves as a confirmatory test4 from a laboratory perspective multiplexing of targets allows for better efficiency shorter turn-around times and more optimal management of laboratory consumables26 vogel et al evaluated nine primerprobe sets27 they confirmed that each pair had a detection efficiency of 90 but there were differences in the ability to differentiate true negatives from positives in patients with a low viral load some sets led to inconclusive results due to non-specific background amplification including the initial sets issued by the usa cdc but with subsequent rectification with viral evolution nucleotide substitutions may emerge that could affect primerprobe binding regions that could alter the sensitivity of pcr indeed a potentially problematic mismatch in the rdrp-sarsr reverse primer has already been confirmed threshold cycle ct value of the target gene remains the quantitative end point to ascertain viral load and depending on the kit used this value generally lies in the 3040 range427 to control for non-specific pcr inhibition an internal positive amplification control eg sars-cov-2 e-gene rna sars-cov frankfurt 1 rna is included in the assay whilst a negative control interrogates for contamination during sample preparationdigital pcr dpcr was used to perform a quality assurance verification of rt-pcr28 dpcr involves partitioning a sample into many individual parallel pcr reactions allowing even a single molecule to be amplified more than a million-fold using this technique sensitivity was significantly improved from 282 by rt-pcr to 874 by rt-dpcr28 moreover 1516 close contacts that were inconclusive with conventional rt-pcr likely because not all the targets of interest were detected were dpcr positive the overall sensitivity specificity and diagnostic accuracy of rt-dpcr was 90 100 and 93 respectively moreover the higher sensitivity of rt-dpcr translated into detection of viral rna for longer periods compared to conventional rt-pcr in convalescing patients while rt-dpcr is more sensitive and suitable for detecting low viral loads its accessibility is limited by the complexity of the system cost implications and the inability to multiplex target genes of interest29several automated rapid nucleic acid amplification tests have recently received fda approval for emergency use cepheids xpert xpress sars-cov-2 run on the gene xpert platform detects multiple gene targets and can provide a result within 45 min30 abbotts rapid covid-19 test run on the abbott id now device can provide results within 13 min31 the former may be convenient in some countries like south africa that have an extensive gene xpert infrastructure and the technology lends itself to onsite point-of-care testing using portable xpert platforms like xpert edgewhile rt-pcr currently remains the imperfect gold standard for the rapid confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection ongoing genetic evolution of the virus highlights the need to closely monitor and review the methodology based on emerging data it is possible that a better stage-specific reference standard may emerge incorporating immunoassay resultslimited testing capacity remains a challenge to widespread surveillance and testing in south africa expanding testing services to research-based laboratories is fraught with challenges including the need for accreditation of laboratories sanas in south africa and personnel hpcsa in south africa capacity shortfalls are further compounded by an international and country-wide shortage of kits and reagents and severe reduction in international freight shipping capacity however the implementation of rapid automated molecular testing xpert xpress sars-cov-2 will be helpful if enough cartridges can be procuredseveral antigen-based immunoassays have been developed that detect antibodies in serum or plasma32 one such assay was recently fda approved and the foundation for innovative new diagnostics website lists over 200 companies that are either making or have made such assays33 some are rapid lateral flow assay lfa based while others are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa-like tests both formats have antigen impregnated on a test line or on a plastic-plate surface and detect human igg or igm and sometimes also iga antibodies in the meanwhile rapid capture assays that detect viral antigens in nasopharyngeal aspirates have also been developed and are being evaluated in tandemdespite the proliferation of different testing devices and kits that are emerging there are hardly any independent validation data on which specific assays work optimally therefore the sensitivity specificity and predictive values of individual tests in different contexts remain unknown a web-based resource has been developed that lists assays that have now been approved for use in specific countries34 some tests purchased by specific countries have already been found not to meet expectations35 in spain one of worst hit european nations health authorities purchased thousands of rapid serological tests from a biotech company in china but these were later found to have a sensitivity of 3036 south african companies have already produced iterations of lfa platforms and they are currently being evaluatedone concern is test specificity as there are four common human coronaviruses that cause up to a third of common cold episodes poorly designed antibody tests may cross-react with pre-existing anti-coronavirus antibodies high false positivity rates may erroneously indicate disease in those without covid-19 resulting in wasted public health contact tracing efforts unnecessary anxiety and even worse unintended exposure of individuals to covid-19 in testing centres and wards if they are hospitalised suboptimal sensitivity with lfa formats without a signal amplification step is a potential concern as often lfa depending on the context may have suboptimal sensitivity compared to elisa-based assays however to what extent this applies to covid-19 remains to be seenseveral recent papers describe longitudinal antibody responses in patients with covid193740 broadly speaking igm responses tend to become detectable 37 days after the onset of symptoms3941 robust responses generally develop during the second week of illness3738 given these considerations antibody-based tests are not recommended to be used for first line diagnosis within the first few days of symptoms there is some evidence that combining antibody and rt-pcr data during the early phase of disease may be useful and may have some incremental benefit though further studies are required however the south african health product regulatory agency and other agencies have recently indicated based on guidance from the south african national institute of communicable diseases and the who that serological testing is not suitable for diagnosis of acute sars-cov-2 infection and should be limited to epidemiological surveys at least until more data becomes availableindeed there is an undisputed role for immunoassays in surveillance studies which may guide public health planning and to define the trajectory of the epidemic their potential role for targeting vaccination in certain subgroups is being investigated some have suggested that immunoassays could identify previously infected and recovered health-care workers and other essential workers who could potentially return to work with the assumption that they are immune to reinfection whether this is the case and for how long immunity lasts with covid-19 remains unclear thus the validity of the concept of immunity passports remains unclear42there are currently no data on how diagnostic management and prognostic considerations may be different in hiv-infected versus uninfected persons in hiv-infected patients presenting with a respiratory tract infection the general possibilities outlined above have to be considered including considering pcp and tb in the differential diagnosis although well documented it is not widely appreciated that between 10 and 20 of community-acquired pneumonia or acute lower respiratory tract infection in sub-saharan africa and parts of asia is due to mycobacterium tuberculosis4345 and this proportion is even higher in hiv-infected persons4345 it is also possible that covid-19 infection may unmask sub-clinical tb in both hiv-infected or uninfected persons on the other hand and particularly in hiv-infected persons covid-19 pneumonia like in the case of influenza45 may be associated with a poorer prognosis in hospitalised patients with tb whether sars-cov-2 viral load will be higher in hiv-infected persons and therefore rt-pcr sensitivity better remains unclear in hiv-uninfected persons co-infection with more than one pathogen has already been documented eg co-infection with covid-19 and influenza andor bacterial organisms46 it is possible that co-infection with more than one pathogen may be more frequent in hiv-infected persons or those with advanced immunosuppression these unanswered questions will only be resolved once more data become availablethe rapidly spreading covid-19 pandemic has exposed capacity weaknesses in health-care and laboratory testing systems although the mainstay of testing remains rt-pcr there are several drawbacks including a significant false negative rate in the early course of the disease assay cost and lack of assay simplicity and the requirement for complex laboratory infrastructure there is an emerging shortage of reagents including rna extraction kits that is likely to worsen already many centres are using dry nasopharyngeal swabs because of the shortage of viral transport medium antibody-based immunoassays have been developed although they have a limited role in the early diagnosis of symptomatic patients their incremental benefit over rt-pcr assays and their role in other applications including surveillance and targeting individuals for vaccination and redeployment into the workforce are under investigationviral diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health the world has witnessed several viral epidemics in past twenty years that include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-1 in 2003 h1n1 influenza in 2009 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012recently an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was detected in wuhan city hubei province of china and reported to china country office of the world health organization who on december 31 2019 the national health commission of china reported that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in wuhan city the etiological agent of the atypical pneumonia was isolated on january 7 2020 by the chinese authorities as novel coronavirus 2019-ncov the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus identified was shared to other countries to develop specific diagnostic kits on january 12 2020 subsequently the ministry of public health thailand the ministry of health labour and welfare japan and republic of korea reported their first imported case of lab-confirmed 2019-ncov on 13 january 13 january 15 and january 20 2020 respectively subsequently international committee on taxonomy of viruses termed it sars-cov-2 due to similarity of its symptoms to those induced by the sars on february 11 2020 the who announced that the disease caused by this new virus as a covid-19 which is the acronym of coronavirus disease 2019 on march 11 2020 who declared this disease as pandemic as of march 30 2020 who has reported 693224 case and 33104 death that has occurred worldwide 1coronavirus cov belongs to coronaviridae family of order nidovirale cov are single-stranded rna viruses ssrna having a spike glycoprotein on the envelope giving it a crown-like appearance when seen on electron microscope the subfamily orthocoronavirinae has four genera of covs alpha-coronavirus beta-coronavirus delta-coronavirus and gamma-coronavirus furthermore the genus beta-coronavirus divides into five sub-genera or lineages while bats and rodents are considered to be the genetic sources of alpha and beta-coronavirus avian species represents the genetic sources of delta and gamma-coronavirus 2to date seven human coronaviruses hcov have been identified the a lineage of beta-coronavirus such as hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 as well as alpha-coronavirus such as hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 causes common colds and self-limiting respiratory infections in contrast b lineage of beta-corona virus causes sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2 covid-19 while c lineage of beta-corona virus causes mers-cov both responsible for recent epidemics with a variable clinical severity of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary involvement and associated significant increase in mortality 3covid-19 is a single-stranded positive sense rna virus having a diameter of 60140 nm with a round or elliptic shape however it often exists in pleomorphic form its rna genome contains 29891 nucleotides encoding for 9860 amino acids and shares 999 sequence identity suggesting a very recent host shift into humans 45 like other covs it is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat besides these viruses can be effectively inactivated by lipid solvents including chloroform ether 75 ethanol peroxyacetic acid and chlorine-containing disinfectant chlorhexidine does not inactivate this virus 4 5coronaviruses are naturally hosted by bats and it is believed that most human coronaviruses are derived from the bat reservoir 56 genomic sequence studies of covid-19 have identified nearly 50 79 and 96 similarity to mers-cov sars-cov-1 and bat sars-related coronavirus respectively 7 8 9 the specific route of transmission to human from natural reservoirs is still yet to be known however some of the studies suggests pangolin could be the intermediate mammalian hosts since spike protein of sar-cov-2 are nearly identical to one virus isolated from pangolin it is believed that pangolins could have provided a partial spike gene to sars-cov-2 to infect mammals 1011 a recent study has also shown a development of new variations at the functional sites in the receptor-binding domain of the spike of sars-cov-2 and viruses from pangolin likely caused due to either a natural selection or mutations or recombination or both 12nevertheless once human is infected virus could also be transmitted from human-to-human through the respiratory droplets and aerosols from coughing and sneezing like other respiratory pathogens including sars-cov-2 sars-cov-2 also uses the angiotensin converting enzyme ii ace2 receptors like the sars-cov 13the incubation period of covid-19 could vary from 3 days to 14 days based on the data from chinese cdc the longest time from infection to symptoms was 125 days 95 ci 9218 days the chinese epidemic also doubled about every seven days and on average each patient transmits the infection to an additional 22 individuals suggesting the basic reproduction number r0 or r naught to be 22 which is a bit lesser compared to r0 of the sars-cov-1 epidemic of nearly 30 in 20022003 1415 an epidemiological and transmission difference in characteristics between sars-cov1 mers and covid-19 has been summarized in table 1
a recent study from a genetic analysis of sars-cov-2 genomes n  103 found this virus to be evolving into two major types designated as l and s with two different snps while the l type is more prevalent 70 aggressive and spread more quickly as seen in the early stages of the outbreak in wuhan the s type 30 is an ancestral version evolutionarily older and less aggressive it appears that the frequency of the l type has decreased after early january 2020 and it is hypothesized that the change in selective pressure might change the behavior of this virus it is thought that coercive human interventions may have placed a more severe selective pressure on the l type to mutate to s type conversely the s type might have been increased also due to a relatively weaker selective pressure 13these ultra-rapid development in viral epidemics strongly suggest an urgent need of understanding about these viral dynamics to cope up with this public health emergency of covid-19there may be a variety of symptoms that a patient with covid-19 may present with the usual triad to suspect is fever dry cough and dyspnea it may be classified as asymptomatic or symptomatic carrier or infective state from mild prodrome to profusely symptomatic depending upon immunity status of patients there are reports of conjunctivitis gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea vomiting nausea abdominal pain some critically ill may present without fever but with abdominal pain anorexia and dyspnea less common symptoms were gastrointestinal anosmia dysgeusia 13 overall the case fatality rate was varied between 23 and 5 with an average of 3 poor prognostic epidemiological risk factors include older age male sex smokers and associated comorbidities including obesity hypertension diabetes chronic pulmonary diseases cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease more the number of risk factors more is the severity at presentation 18depending on the clinical features of covid-19 patients are generally divided as mild moderate severe and critical 18a

serology blood sampling is much easier than swab sampling from oropharynx or nasopharynx two kinds of serological test can detect covid-19 - a enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay elisa and b immunochromatography card test elisa is considered better compared to card test due to higher sensitivity while elisa has sensitivity of 873 card test has a sensitivity of 824 and both have specificity of 100 however card test is convenient cheaper and offers a rapid turnover 25 elisa is based on rp3 nucleoprotein to detect igm and igg against sars-cov-2 although elisa has quick turn over time however it may have a false positive results due to n nucleocapsid proteins of sars-cov-2 1626 cross reactivity is expected with sars-cov-1 infection since there is 90 homology in genetic sequence with sars-cov-2 hence s protein transmembrane glycoprotein spike elisa should be developed specific to sars-cov-2
reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction rt-pcr rt-pcr and genomic sequencing wherever available is the gold standard and confirmatory test for covid-19 overall the sensitivity of rt-pcr is nearly 70 with a 30 false negative rate and its sensitivity decreases from 90 on day 1- to 3 post-symptoms to nearly 80 on day 6 and  50 by day 14 27 for rt-pcr specimen collection from the upperlower respiratory tract or sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage samples to be performed under strict precautions and should be taken as early as symptom onset to obtain high virus concentrations 28 it should be noted that rt-pcr may take few hours to 2 days for reporting and second sample with different viral gene may be needed if initial test is negative moreover rt-pcr may be false negative at a times eg low viral load in very early phase or in late phase of disease mutation of covid-19 virus or other technical difficulties in collection of samples similarly result may be false-positive in influenza or other respiratory pathogens in either case it is important to remain vigilant other issues with rt-pcr is incorrect sample collection and processing potential risk to health care workers due to aerosol transmission beside delayed report delivery requirement of expertise setup of laboratory and the cost 27although both serology and rt-pcr are complimentary to each other however since antibodies can appear as early as 1-day post-symptoms it is estimated that igm-elisa can detect more cases than rt-pcr on day 55 of illness 27 while another study reported a higher sensitivity 667 of rt-pcr in first week compared to the serological test 380 however during second week the serological test had higher sensitivity than rt-pcr collectively this suggest ideally to combine both the modalities of test to increase the sensitivity for early detection and diagnosis of covid-19 2728 indeed the combined igm-elisa plus rt-pcr has been shown to detect 986 of cases versus 519 with a single rt-pcr 26 27 28from the available evidence 1625 26 27 28 and to put the things in to perspective it is logical as well as advisable but not superseding any recommendation if any that  a for the rapid screening of sars-cov-2 carriers symptomatic or asymptomatic combined igm- igg-elisa may offer a better utility and sensitivity compared to a either a igm- or igg-elisa test alone b all symptomatic subjects or contacts should be assessed with rapid antibody testing first if positive then rt-pcr should be done as the confirmatory test c all highly suspicious cases should undergo rt-pcr first even if the rapid antibody tests are negative d if antibody test is negative initially it should be re-tested after 710 days
bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage bal may be done when sputum sample cannot be obtained to rule out alternative diagnosis such as tuberculosis and other bacterial or fungal pneumonias and to remove bronchial mucous plugs strict precautions are to be taken while doing bal to avoid aerosol infections the sensitivity positivity rates of rt-pcr in patients with sars-cov-2 in different specimen in was lowest for urine 0 and highest for bal 93 as summarized in table 4

recently a mrna-1273 vaccine that targets the spike s protein of the coronavirus has been manufactured by vaccine research center moderna a unit of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases in usa the trial began on 16 march at the kaiser permanente washington health research institute in seattle washington in total of 45 males and females aged between 18 and 45 where the participants will be divided into three cohorts and will be administered 25 g mcg 100mcg or 250mcg dose 28 days apartpresently treatment of covid-19 is only supportive and prevention is the only way to reduce the community transmission convalescent sera from covid-19 positive patients has been approved by fda in severe and critical patients only 27 although no anti-viral therapy or other drugs till the time of writing is proven to work substantially against the covid-19 in humans few small-scale studies have claimed some benefit with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in less severely ill patients other drugs which are also being tried include lopinavirritonavir remdesivir favipiravir oseltamivir ribavirin interferon beta tocilizumab and abidol 32 multiple rcts are currently undergoing with these agents and results are eagerly awaitedsars-cov-2 is more infectious than sars-cov-1 and mers-cov most infections with covid-19 are generally mild and self-limiting however even asymptomatic carriers may spread infection newer possibilities of feco-oral transmission are also speculated rapid diagnostic tests will be helpful for screening and diagnosing covid-19 patients trials for specific anti-viral drugs and vaccine are currently underway to curb the pandemic meanwhile isolation and containment is only way of prevention from contracting covid-19we hereby declare that we have no conflict of interest related to this articlethe world is experiencing the expansive spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 in a global pandemic that was first reported on december 31 2019 in wuhan china what began as cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology was identified as a novel coronavirus on january 7 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 the illness that comes from sars-cov-2 was named a pandemic by the world health organization who on march 11 2020 1 by that time it had ravaged much of china the epidemic is accelerating the time from the first reported case to the first 100000 cases was 67 days it took 11 days for the next 100000 cases 4 days for the following 100000 cases and 3 days for the subsequent 100000 cases as of march 31 2020 there are 858669 cases and 42151 deaths in the world attributed directly to covid-19 188530 cases and 3889 deaths in the united states a 503 and 685 increase respectively in 2 days we should remember that 1 month ago on march 1 there were only 30 cases in the united states 2 every region of the globe is currently impacted by covid-19 3the enormous strain this pandemic is placing on health care systems across the world is palpable from testing capacity to supply chains for personal protective equipment ppe specimen collection swabs and supplies and equipment including ventilators for those requiring hospital care new approaches are needed to scale up testing for covid-19 to reduce the needs for ppe and specimen collection swabs and to allow testing for sars-cov2 outside of health care facilitiesnew cases of covid-19 infection and casualties continue to multiply and mixed messages abound as the public health world has urgently recommended covid-19 prevention measures they are being questioned as being too vast hard to follow invasive to our lifestyle and damaging to the economy public health experts have either been sidelined in the covid-19 response decisions or have found themselves at odds with much of the information being presented by political leadership in the united states the country currently with the largest number of covid-19 cases president trump extended the initial 15-day national slow down and called for social distancing until april 30 2020 in an attempt to reduce the spread of the virus 45 states like california illinois and new york have implemented state-wide stay-at-home ordinances while other states have implemented less restrictive measures or no statewide measures at all 6-8 determining the proper scale and timing of these measures is critical to controlling the spread of covid-19 and the numbers of lives lost we believe that the best public health evidence must inform activities in three priority areas to stop this pandemic 1 coordinated and consistent stay-at-home orders across multiple jurisdictions including potential nationwide mandates 2 rapid scale-up of sars-cov-2 testing and 3 improved health care capacity to respondthere is public health consensus that limiting the number of contacts between persons can slow covid-19 transmission in a community and give time for health care systems to respond the most substantial of these approaches is a government order to stay at home except for food and medical needs although there are now multiple theoretical and practical models about how stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions could slow covid-19 transmission it is clear from all of them that consistency in implementation and communication is key these policies will only be effective if they are implemented in a coordinated manner across large geographic regions where people commonly move but there remain multiple examples of these public health interventions not being uniformly implemented for instance our city atlanta georgia quickly implemented several local variations of stay-at-home recommendations from multiple city and county levels that comprise our metropolitan area yet the state-wide recommendation was only implemented several weeks later this meant that people who are told not to come to work in one atlanta county had no such order where they lived and continued to congregate in public places this patchwork response is not unique to the united states and illustrates an underlying lack of understanding about how to use these public health measures to slow the transmission of infectious diseasesthis inconsistency in implementing public health measures has also created substantial amounts of public confusion and fodder for social media conspiracy theories hyperpartisanship and distrust of experts covid-19 is the first true global pandemic of the social media era offering new opportunities for rapid distribution of accurate public health information to millions of people unfortunately these critical public health communications about actions to take to protect oneself from covid-19 are not easy to differentiate from inaccurate or even dangerously wrong information having correct information that is well reasoned and delivered through consistent messaging are all pillars of behavior change including changing peoples transmission-related behaviors in response to covid-19 9 social media is now one of the most predominant ways that people get information and public health must find better ways to communicate about mitigation plans through these forumsdecisions about covid-19 mitigation policies must be informed by the best epidemiologic information which requires rapid scale-up of covid-19 testing this will require rapid development of new diagnostic tests laboratory capacity testing supply chains and health care personnel to collect the specimens novel testing strategies under development including the use of rapid diagnostic tests serological tests and self-collected specimens will improve our ability to screen a large number of people quickly and give us a new understanding of the extent of exposure disease and recovery this information will be vital to epidemiologic modeling to support information-driven decision making on the appropriate timing and scope of the response there are also a rapidly growing number of examples of innovative approaches to implementing covid-19 testing including some examples of successful large-scale screening programs like drive-up testing in south korea where thousands of tests were delivered each day 10changing the course of covid-19 disease in heavily impacted countries such as the united states will require a massive scale-up of testing compared to what has been conducted to date for instance in the united states the rate of total covid-19 testing up to this point is just under 3000 tests per 1 million people or 964865 overall since january 10 2020 11 that has been an admittedly dismal response to testing with a focus mainly on those who are most severely ill this rate of testing does not meet the needs of the health care sector response much less the needs to better understand covid-19 epidemiology in a way that will make control measures most effective we should be testing at least 1 million us residents every week 03 of the population during this phase of the pandemic additionally there is a need for shorter time from test to results to better guide care and isolation decisions and we must find new ways of reaching more people with testing without overburdening our already taxed health care systemsthe control of movement and scale-up of covid-19 testing will only be successful in truncating the covid-19 pandemic and reducing lives lost if there is an immediate commitment of resources to improve the capacity of the health care sector to respond reports from multiple countries already impacted by covid-19 predict that health care capacity will be rapidly exceeded as transmission grows under the current predictions of covid-19 transmission the ability of the health care sector to respond will certainly require coordination of efforts to increase the capacity of hospital beds ventilators protective equipment and the clinicians who use themprotecting the health and safety of health care workers is vital to the health of each of us and to the workings of our health care system there needs to be a high level of commitment to the safety of health care professionals by providing them with the tools to prevent nosocomial covid-19 infections although this implicitly means making sure all health care workers have appropriate ppes this can also come in the form of telemedicine and other virtual care trends such has chatbots that capitalize on advances in technology to provide care for patients outside of a hospital setting until the time hospitalization is needed this form of care protects our health care workforce and maximizes the scope of care that can be provided with less impact on the hospital settingour global public health response to covid-19 will only be successful if we rapidly generate the best data to inform decisions from our political leaders regarding resources and policies to slow transmission and improve our response this is an unprecedented global public health crisis that will require not only strong political commitment and courage but also innovation on a capacity and timing scale that was inconceivable 3 months ago what we do right now and how quickly we do it will directly change how long covid-19 is with us and how many people will die it is critical that science-based information guide our public health strategies and that leaders listen to our best informationmuch of public health is about making changes to improve human life but without much announcement it is impossible to determine the number of lives saved due to epidemiologic research yet it is unquestionable that our discipline has saved millions of lives through the implementation of interventions and preventative programs our training to understand and use data to protect our communities has not been needed more it is also our responsibility to use our skills wisely and in a steadfast way that does not bend to the whim of politics but instead affirms what we know loudly if needed and highlights what we still need to determine as quickly and accurately as possible to protect our worldin december 2019 an increasing number of pneumonia cases appeared in wuhan hubei state in china thorough analytical studies accomplished by epidemiologists demonstrated that the spread of the disease might be related to wuhan south china seafood market 1 dedicated in-depth studies using high-throughput sequencing revealed a new beta-coronavirus that was called 2019 novel coronavirus 2019- ncov 2 in january 2020 the world health organization who renamed the virus as sars-cov-2 and the disease as covid-19 3despite the attempts to limit the spread of the virus within the city it rapidly disseminated to other states in china which may be due to the movement preceding lunar chinese new year 4 within weeks the infection had spread to many other countries worldwideby january 20th many countries including japan south korea and thailand had reported their first cases the next day the first case was confirmed in the usa the virus continued to spread until its first case was recorded in the philippines february 2nd france february 14th iran february 21 st by february 23th the first case appeared in italy then many countries through europe reported their first cases 5considering the largely increasing cases throughout the world world health organization who has announced a global pandemic on march 12th 2020 6 as of may 23th at 1500 eastern european summer time covid-19 has affected 209 countries with more than 5 105 881 confirmed cases and 333 446 deaths 7coronaviruses covs comprise a heterogeneous group of enveloped positive sense and single-stranded rna viruses owned their names due to 912 nm long surface spikes that look like a corona equal to crown in latin they can cause many diseases including respiratory gastrointestinal heart and neurological pathologies with variable severity among animals and humans 8depending on the available data bats may be the initial hosts of covid-19 it may be transmitted to humans through pangolin 9 or other wild animals 2 confronted at the huanan seafood market then disseminated through human to human transmission current data showed an incubation period of 3 days with a range of 024 days with a high probability of asymptomatic transmission 10the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars was considered the first pandemic infection related to coronavirus it started in china between 2002 and 2003 due to a new sars-cov coronavirus it disseminated to 29 countries in 2003 due to the travel movement throughout the world affecting 8098 patients with a case-fatality rate of 96 and then sars disappeared nosocomial transmission of sars-cov was common bats were considered as the primary reservoir although unproven as the actual source while the intermediary source was considered civet cats in the wet markets in guangdong 11the second coronavirus-related outbreak was the middle east respiratory syndrome mers which was caused by mers-cov mers appeared in april 2012 and was first identified in humans in the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa the contact with camels or camel products is considered to be the cause of human infection mers continued to emerge and reemerge between 2012 and december 2019 a total of 2465 laboratory-confirmed cases of mers-cov infection including 850 deaths 344 mortality were reported from 27 countries 12covid-19 outbreak brings back memories of the spanish flu pandemic in 19181920 which was caused by h1n1 strain of the influenza virus this pandemic had caused over fifty million deaths worldwide the mortality rate ranged between 10 and 20 13the death toll associated with covid-19 highly surpasses the other two coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov and the outbreak is still ongoing which represents a considerable threat to global public health and economies 14as for many respiratory viruses diagnosis relies on two main compartments clinical manifestations as fever fatigue dry cough dyspnea and gastrointestinal symptoms while the paraclinical diagnostic tools vary between the polymerase chain reaction pcr and computed tomography ct 15 rapid and accurate diagnosis is vital in such a pandemic from one side rapidity may enhance management effectiveness and accelerate the application of more suitable isolation measures leading to less contiguity while on the other hand coupling rapidity with less costly procedures may permit especially to low-income countries more examinations to be applied thus faster and more effective community-scale managementin this review we will shed light on the established diagnostic methods which were applied to help manage the outbreak furthermore we intend to include some under-development techniques that may be potentially useful in this context the practical intent of our work is to provide a realistic perspective on the diagnosis of covid-19 through reviewing different biological radiological and pathological aspects of this disease diagnosisto this end we searched for research articles reviews letters and other types of publications when needed research included major data bases and search engines trying to include as much as possible of novel and high value informationmost patients with confirmed covid-19 have developed fever and symptoms of acute lower respiratory tract illness dry cough dyspneathe rapid global spread of the virus and the limited testing capacity may preclude testing all patients with suspected covid-19 therefore it is crucial to set priorities and criteria for conducting confirmation laboratory testshigh-priority individuals include hospitalized patients especially critically ill patients with unexplained respiratory failure symptomatic health care workers with features of respiratory illness and symptomatic individuals who have underlying chronic health conditions or risk factors for severe disease 16under-treatment or soon-to-be-treated cancer and autoimmune disorders patients may be at high risk for covid-19 when receiving chemotherapy or immune- comprising treatmentsthis group of high risk individuals may also include patients to-be-transplanted both of organ and hematopoietic stem cellthese patients must be screened using pcr before applying aforementioned treatmentsin case of test impossibility they should be put under quarantine for 14 days prior to treatment initiation 17 18 19at least patients who meet the testing criteria should undergo testing for sars-cov-2during such an outbreak it is likely that preferences for specific activities will change with the outbreak it seems that these changes will create a global economic burdenin 2003 the sars-cov virus bought the world output down by 50 billion initial estimates indicate that the economic impact of the covid-19 outbreak might be much more significant maybe around 360 billion 20a year of lockdown will take down the globes economy by approximately 22 with a cost of 42 trillion furthermore the high death toll of this pandemic is considered to be firstly a humanitarian disaster but also an economic burden as some estimate the value of the lost lives as 95 million per life 21in many low and middle-income countries covid-19 test cost exceeds government per head health spending this may impose restrictions on the applicability of the test to all for example in some countries each test costs around 75 whereas the health per head expenditure is around 34  22even for some high-income european countries with a testing cost around 135 euros and a limited capacity per laboratory only the individual suspected to have the infection with specific criteria may be accepted to conduct the test of where the necessity to find simpler and more affordable diagnostic tools 23highly conserved and abundantly expressed genes are considered as attractive targets of sarscov-2 rt-pcr assays such as the structural spike s and nucleocapsid n genes and the nonstructural rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene and the open reading frame orf1ab which encodes a replicase polyprotein 1ab required for viral rna replication and transcription 27a study conducted by chu et al described two rt-pcr assays to detect orf1b and n regions of the viral genome separately results reported that these assays are sensitive and specific to only sarbecoviruses furthermore the n gene rt-pcr assay was found to be more sensitive in detecting 2019-ncov rna in different respiratory samples sputum and throat swab 28it is recommended to use specific primers and probes in the orf1ab and n gene regions when both targets test positive the case would be considered a confirmed infection with covid-19 2930the cycle threshold values ct-value of rrt-pcr determine the copy number of sars-cov-2 rna in a specimen a ct-value of less than 37 is defined as a positive test and a ct-value of 40 or more is defined as a negative test a medium viral load is defined when ct-value of 37 to less than 40 and may require confirmation by repeating the test 30in a study conducted by chan et al three novel rt-pcr assays targeting the rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrphelicase hel spike s and nucleocapsid n genes of sars-cov-2 were developed then these assays were compared to each other and to that of the reported rdrp-p2 assay which is used in many laboratories in europeamong these three novel assays the covid -19 -rdrphel assay had the lowest limit of detection and the highest analytical sensitivity at 95 detection probability furthermore the covid-19 rdrphel assay was significantly more sensitive than the established rdrp-p2 assay for the detection of viral rna in both respiratory tract specimens nasopharyngeal aspirateswab or throat swab and non-respiratory tract specimens saliva and plasma as it detected viral rna in 154 additional specimens that were tested negative by the rdrp -p2 assay in contrast there was no significant difference in the sensitivity of the two assays for sputum and fecesrectal swabsexclusivity testing showed that covid-19 -rdrphel assay did not cross-react with other human sars-cov whereas the rdrp-p2 assay showed cross-reactivity with sars-cov in cell culture this is because the probes of rdrphel assay were developed to contain 79 nucleotide differences with those of human sars-cov whereas the probe of the rdrp-p2 assay contained only three nucleotide differences 31the charit algorithm berlin germany uses a two-step assay to confirm covid-19 infection the first step is a line-screening assay that detects the envelope e gene of subgenus sarbecovirus the second step is a confirmatory assay a sars-cov-2 specific rt-pcr assay that targets rdrp cross-reactivity with alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses was not detected 32another method established by the university of hong kong to detect subgenus sarbecovirusu uses n-gene screening assay followed by a confirmatory orf1b assay positive patients should be considered as sars-cov2 confirmed cases as none of the sarbecoviruses have been previously detected in humans and sars was eliminated in humans as the last reported human sars case was detected in 2004 33a retrospective study was conducted by chen et al with a total of 249 patients diagnosed with covid-19 results showed that the clinical progression of covid-19 in patients presented two phases the first phase was represented by fever cough fatigue and other systemic symptoms in the course of this phase upper respiratory specimens were tested by rt-pcr for viral rna and the majority of the patients showed positive results for sars-cov-2 in the second week of the disease progression symptoms began to relieve in most of the patients in parallel half of the patients showed pcr negative results with their upper respiratory tract samples the estimated median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase pcr tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 daysa proportion of 28 of patients had a story of direct contact with confirmed covid-19 cases these patients were asymptomatic with positive rt-pcr results in their throat-swab samples in these asymptomatic patients pcr turned out to be negative two days 1 2 3 after admission 34it is strongly thought that involving various specimens from multiple sites could lower false negatives and improve sensitivity an important issue is how and where to collect samples for testing actual guidelines as the current public health england guidance 35 suggest samples from the upper respiratory tract the question remains whether there is a significant difference in sensitivity between nasopharyngeal np nasal or oropharyngeal op throat throat swabs may appear to be uncomfortable for patients and could induce coughing while lingual swabs are more comfortable and some consider that they can achieve comparable resultsthe total positive rate of rrt-pcr for throat swab samples has been reported to be about 3060 at initial presentation 2536a cohort study conducted by ye et al showed that the positive rate of throat swabs 440 is higher than that of lingual swabs 363 for the detection of covid-19 this difference was only seen when the samples were taken by a single experienced nurse these results indicate that standardized sampling by the same nurse could improve the detection rate 37another cohort by yang et al examined 205 throat swabs and 490 nasal swabs in 213 hospitalized covid-19 patients it was reported positive test rates in favor of the nasopharyngeal specimen or nasal swabs in both mild and severe cases and at different time points of illness onset day 07 815 and 15 unfortunately no significance calculation was performed these results contrast with another german smaller study by wolfel et al conducted on 9 covid-19 patients with no discernible difference in viral loads or detection rates when comparing nasal and throat swabs 38in research conducted by wang et al the authors described the testing of covid-19 in 1070 specimens from 205 infected patients using rrt-pcr investigators detected covid-19 rna in lung wash 14 of 15 samples 93 sputum 72 of 104 72 nasal swabs 5 of 8 63  lung biopsy 6 of 13 46  throat swabs 126 of 398 32  feces 44 of 153 29  and blood 3 of 307 1  the 72 urine specimens all tested negative 39notably this raises concerns about ruling out covid-19 based on combined pharyngeal and nasal swabs obtained at a single time point based on these limited available data and its quality its not possible to assess the sensitivity of each test and there is no enough data for performing both nasal and throat swabs on the other hand it may be recommended when its possible to collect a lower respiratory tract specimen in the form of sputum which appears to be the highly sensitive of all specimens as a non-invasive exam 40 sensitivity will also depend on technical issues related to testing performance delay after illness onset and methods of sampling 39in most symptomatic covid-19 patients viral rna may be detected in the nasopharyngeal swab as early as 1 day of symptoms initiation this positivity starts to decline by week 3 and subsequently becomes undetectable 41 as shown in fig 1
live coronavirus sheds at high concentrations from the nasal cavity even in asymptomatic infected individuals thus it can be detected by pcr before symptoms initiation 42gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea nausea and vomiting have been frequently reported in patients infected with sars-cov-2 sometimes alone or alongside other general or respiratory manifestationsmany studies had confirmed the presence of the live virus in stool samples thus stool samples can also be diagnostic furthermore it worth studying whether stool specimen collection may eventually reduce medical staff infections compared to respiratory swabs specimensa study conducted by xiao et al confirmed the presence of the virus in feces samples feces samples were positive for viral rna and the cycle threshold values were 2334 for the open reading frame 1lab gene and 2082 for the nucleoprotein gene 43regarding the collection of samples it worth mentioning that pcr samples in general can be obtained by dacron or polyester flocked swabs and should reach the laboratory as soon as possible after collection 44a study conducted by zhang et al revealed that 357 of confirmed covid-19 patients had a positive stool sample of viral nucleic acid it was shown that the accuracy of fecal specimen detection may be equivalent to oropharyngeal swabs results 45another publication by zhang et al enrolled three pediatric patients with mild covid-19 infection results suggested the long existence of viruses in feces all patients recovered soon with negative sarscov2 nucleic acid in throat swab specimens while the three remained positive in the fecal specimens within 10 days after recovery and discharge 46chen et al found that 6667 of laboratoryconfirmed covid19 patients were tested positive for sarscov2 rna in stool specimens furthermore it was in consistency with zhang et al that the positivity of stool samples is not associated with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of illness a proportion of 6429 of patients remained positive for viral rna in the feces after the pharyngeal swabs turned negative concerning the duration of viral shedding from the feces it was found that it is 7 days 6 7 8 9 10 after negative conversion in pharyngeal swabs 47the long existence of viral rna in feces indicate that the fecaloral route may serve as an alternative infection route and this suggested that the replication of virus in the gastrointestinal tract may not be consistent with that in the respiratory tract 47 48 49these finding raise concerns about whether patients with negative respiratory swabs are truly virus-free or sampling of additional body sites is needed therefore it may be important to routinely detect viral rna in stool specimens of covid19 patients during the hospitalization and recovery stage and to perform transmissionbased precautions for patients until the negative conversion of viral rna in feces according to reports to date no patients showed positive results for viral rna in pharyngeal swabs reversibly after the anal swabs turned negative 47loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp assay is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique with high specificity efficiency and rapiditylamp showed advantages over rrt-pcr with simplified sample preparation and one single protocol hence results can be obtained in less than an hour furthermore the diagnostic sensitivity of tests based on lamp-reaction assays was higher 95 compared to that in rrt-pcrduring the avian influenza pandemic the lamp assay showed success in the rapid detection of the h5n1 virus as this assay was used in a point of care devices 20this may suggest that the lamp assay could be a candidate for the point-of-care device application in the rapid detection of covid-19it is strongly thought that serological testing can be an approach in the surveillance of covid-19 as it takes 12 weeks for positivity after the onset of infection serum samples were tested using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisaa study conducted by zhao et al enrolled a total of 173 confirmed cases of covid-19 by the use of rrt-pcr on samples from the respiratory track reported that the seroconversion sequentially appeared for the total antibody ab igm and then igg with a median time of 11 12 and 14 days respectively besides the presence of antibodies was  40 among patients in the first week of illness and then rapidly increased to 1000 943 and 798 respectively since day 15 after onset this may conclude that the total antibody is more sensitive than igm and igg for detecting sars-cov-2 infectionin contrast the positive rate of rna decreased from 667 5887 in samples collected before day 7 to 455 2555 during days 15 to 39 thus antibody detection can be an essential supplement to rna detection during the illness course probably combining rna and antibody detections may significantly improve the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for covid-19 patients p  0001 even in the early phase of 1-week since onset p  0007moreover results revealed a correlation between clinical severity and antibody titer up from 2- week after illness onset as higher titer of ab was independently associated with a worse clinical outcome p  0006 50in cases where nucleic acid amplification test naat assay is negative and there is a strong doubt or epidemiological link to covid-19 infection travel to highly infected areasetc paired serum samples acute and convalescent-phase could support the diagnosis cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses can be very challenging but commercial and noncommercial serological tests are currently under development and evaluation 51a simple point-of-care device was developed to detect igm and igg antibodies against the sars-cov-2 virus in blood samples within 1520 min this provides the possibility to identify a more significant number of infected patients mainly asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus spreaddepending on clinical studies to validate the clinical efficacy uses the overall testing sensitivity was 8866 and specificity was 9063 this test is commercially available with 87 accuracyfurthermore the igmigg combined assay showed advantages over a single igm or igg test with better utility and sensitivity it can be used for the rapid screening of sarscov2 carriers symptomatic or asymptomatic in hospitals clinics and test laboratories 52this antibodies test could also have an impact since it can be available for the massive population on the lockdown strategy so it can be used for massive immune confirmation especially with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients who no longer represent threats for others in case of seroconversionbecause of the impact attributed to the point of care poc devices in terms of management of infections epidemics several manufactures have made efforts to build devices for poc testing the samples are ordinarily nasal or throat swab many poc devices use molecular testing rapid pcr testing using nucleic acid fluorescent probes1 a cartridge in genexpert machine cepheid results could be obtained within 45 min as claimed 2 a cartridge in m2000 machine abbott time to obtain results is approximately 13 min as claimed 3 a cartridge in vivalytic machine bosch time to obtain results is 150 min as claimedwhile on the respi-strip coris bioconcept is an immune-based test using monoclonal antibodies to nucleocapsid protein this tests results can be obtained within 15 min as claimed 53 54 55 56 57 58apparently abnormally high values of procalcitonin pct are associated with a 5-fold higher risk of more severe sars-cov-2 infection or 476 95 ci 274829 furthermore it seems that serial procalcitonin measurements may play a key role in predicting evolution towards a more severe form of the diseasea possible explanation is that the production sustainability and release of procalcitonin from extrathyroidal source is reinforced by il-1 tumor necrosis factor tnf- and il-6 at the same time its synthesis is inhibited by interferon inf- which is usually high in viral infectionas a result it has not to be surprising that procalcitonin concentration seems to be normal in non-complicated covid-19 patients while they tend to climb higher in more severe forms 59in a recent publication sars-cov-2-specific cd4 and cd8 t cells responses were measured in covid-19 cases using flow cytometry among other approaches sars-cov-2-specific cd4t cell were seen in all covid-19 cases and cd8 t cell responses were seen in most thus flow cytometry could present a potential for covid-19 diagnosis alongside other potential laboratory indicators like pctetcit is worth noting the pre-existing sars-cov-2-crossreactive t cell responses in healthy donors indicating some potential for pre-existing immunity in the human population 6061while the rrt-pcr test plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of covid-19 false-negative results have been recorded in the initial diagnosis which highlights the importance of recruiting additional techniques in the diagnosis and management criteria the national health commission of china has published the 6th version of the diagnosis and treatment program which recommends the use of radiologic techniques in the diagnosis and management of sars-cov-2 infection 2562in a study of ai et al results shown in table 1
 demonstrated the high sensitivity of ct scan as a conventional rapid and practical diagnostic method in screening and managing critical cases in epidemic areas also 42 of cases eventually improved in follow-up scans before the turning of rrt-pcr results in negative which recommends the use of a ct scan in the follow-up however the study revealed many limitations including the low specificity due to the false-positive cases with the common imaging characteristics with other viral pneumonia 25in a recent retrospective study by li et al including 51 patients with covid-19 and two other patients with adenovirus all of them were diagnosed by rrt-pcr a low rate 39 of covid-19 misdiagnosis was detected missed cases however some ct features on the initial examination overlapped with ct features of sars and mers including consolidation and septal thickening 63 another study on 51 patients by fang et al revealed 98 sensitivity of ct compared to 71 sensitivity of rt-pcr 64the most common ct features according to multiple reported cases were bilateral ground-glass opacities patchy consolidation mainly located along with the bronchial bundle with reactive thickened adjacent pleura and mild bronchiectasis no lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion was detected in these reports 65 66 67 68the study by chung et al revealed 21 with normal findings 57 with ground-glass opacity 29 with ground-glass opacity and consolidation while 71 had two or more lobes involved and 76 had bilateral disease 69besides a comprehensive review by the european society of radiology had defined ct features of covid-19 the most common findings were ground-glass opacity ggo 98 multifocal patchy consolidation up to 64 considered as an indicator for disease progression reticular pattern or thickened interstitial septa crazy paving pattern which ends up from acute interstitial inflammatory and alveolar edema bronchiolectasis which is defined as gelatinous mucous-filled bronchi on a background of the airless lung pleural thickening and fewer commonly pleural effusion subpleural curvilinear lines fibrosis small bubble-like air-containing space or the bubble sign less common features were small multifocal nodules halo sign which refers to nodules surrounded by ground glass and atoll sign or reversed halo sign which is a focal ground glass opacity ggo surrounded by ring-shaped consolidation 7071similar findings were described in another study on 99 patients with patchy bilateral ggo in 75 and unilateral involvement in 25 72furthermore according to a retrospective study comparing ct features in deceased and recovered patients air bronchogram and extensive multifocal consolidations were more common in the mortality group which suggests a worse prognosis for these abnormalities 73in one of the retrospective cohort studies including 81 patients from wuhan the most common abnormal pattern on ct scan was ggo 65 mainly involving the right lower lobe with ill-defined margins 81 air bronchograms 47 and interlobular septal thickening 35 most of cases demonstrated bilateral involvement 79 and peripheral distribution 54 slightly predominating in the right lower lobeless common features were bronchiectasis 11 cystic changes 10 although previous cases didnt demonstrate features of lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion this study included five patients with lymphadenopathy 6 and four patients with pleural effusion 5the study revealed that asymptomatic patients could also present with abnormalities on ct scan and that abnormalities showed a rapid increase within two weeks after symptom onset followed by a gradual decrease in the third weekthese results highly suggested that the clinical course of the disease correlates with radiological evolution however these features were not specific for covid-19 and they also present in pneumonia caused by other viruses and bacteria 74in a multi-center recent retrospective study on a total of 424 patients from china and the united states radiologists compared ct abnormalities between covid-19 and non-covid-19 pneumoniatheir results revealed that non-covid-19 pneumonia was more likely to manifest with air bronchogram 23 compared to 14 for covid-19 pleural thickening 33 vs 15 pleural effusion 39 vs 4 central with peripheral distribution 35 vs 14 and lymphadenopathy 102 vs 27 while covid-19 pneumonia was more likely to manifest with ggo 91 vs 68 for non- covid-19 fine reticular opacity 56 vs 22 reverse halo sign 11 vs 1 vascular thickening 59 vs 22 and bilateral peripheral distribution 80 vs 57 75another study by dai et al conducted another comparison of ct manifestations between covid-19 pneumonia other viral types of pneumonia and common bacterial pneumoniaaccording to their findings common bacterial pneumonia manifested with multiple consolidations involving lung parenchyma with bronchial wall thickening and centrilobular nodules covid-19 pneumonia was characterized by bilateral ggos progressing massively during the clinical course crazy paving pattern diffuse consolidations and even white-lung appearance in the advanced stage while other viral pneumonias had high-attenuation reticular patterns interstitial inflammation atelectasis and localized pulmonary edema 76however further studies are required in order to evaluate the accuracy of ct scan and to define its diagnostic role in covid-19 patients in complement to clinical and laboratory resultsin such a pandemic rapid and accurate diagnosis plays a vital rolecoupling rapid detection with high sensitivity of viral infection may allow better control of viral spread and provides faster and more effective community-scale managementaccording to results from recent studies chest ct abnormalities have been identified in patients prior to the detection of viral rna from upper respiratory specimens in endemic areas 152564in a study of 1014 patients in wuhan who underwent both rrt-pcr testing and chest ct for evaluation of covid-19 investigators found that chest ct achieved higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of covid-19 as compared with initial rrt-pcr from pharyngeal swab samples results showed indicated that 59 of patients had positive rrt-pcr results and 88 had positive chest ct scansin patients with negative rrt-pcr results 75 n  308 had positive chest ct findings besides analysis of serial rrt-pcr assays and ct scans was performed the mean interval between the initial negative to positive rrt-pcr results was determined to be 51  15 days and the initial positive to the subsequent negative rrt-pcr result was 69  23 days using rrt-pcr results as the reference standard the sensitivity specificity and accuracy of chest ct in diagnosing covid-19 were 97 25 and 68 respectively 25 the low specificity may be related to other etiologies causing similar ct findingsin consistency with the previous study fang et al reported that the sensitivity of chest ct was higher than that of rrt-pcr 98 vs 71 respectively 64in addition a retrospective analysis conducted by chunqin long et al showed that the sensitivity of ct examinations was 972 3536 patients were positive at presentation whereas the sensitivity of initial rrt-pcr was 846 3036 patients were positive in the second rrt-pcr round three patients had a positive result and the other three were positive in the third round of rrt-pcr 15 these findings indicate among others that rrt-pcr should be repeated to avoid misdiagnosisthe results of rrt-pcr tests must be cautiously interpreted as it may be affected by various external factors including sampling operations specimens source sampling timing different periods of the disease development and performance of detection kits a number of factors could lead to a negative result in an infected individual including poor quality of the specimen containing insufficient patient material the specimen was collected late or very early during the infection timeline the specimen was not handled and shipped appropriately or because of technical reasons inherent in the test eg virus mutation or pcr inhibition in case of strong clinical or geographical doubt with a negative test especially from upper respiratory tract sampling a second test can be conducted preferably from the lower respiratory tract 51although ct has been well-recognized as the first-line radiologic investigation for covid-19 recent studies by the american college of radiology suggest using cxr as a first-line tool to decrease the risk of cross-contamination caused by ct suites as well as to minimize the economic burden in radiology departments and increase the availability of its service 77in a retrospective cohort study by wong et al on 64 patients with covid-19 infection confirmed by rrt-pcr cxr had a sensitivity of 69 compared to 91 for rrt-pcr and 97 for ct the most common findings were bilateral peripheral consolidation with lower zone dominance which showed its highest peak 1012 days after symptom onset ground glass opacities were less common features interestingly six patients in the study revealed chest x-ray abnormalities before confirming positivity on rrt-pcr however due to the low sensitivity of cxr compared to ct further evidence is needed to support its use in the initial screening 7879few studies have recently revealed pathological characteristics of covid-19 demonstrating the importance of histological diagnosis however to the best of our knowledge no complete autopsy pathological report has been recorded yet xu et al first autopsied the lung and extra-pulmonary organs of a deceased 50-year-old male who was diagnosed with covid-19 infection associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome ards their findings demonstrated end-stage diffuse injury 80tian et al reported early-stage changes when studying samples of biopsies from two patients who underwent surgical resection for lung adenocarcinoma while accidentally diagnosed with an early phase covid-19 pneumonia 81early pathological manifestations included proteinaceous exudate pulmonary edema inflammatory clusters with multinucleated giant cells vascular congestion reactive epithelial hyperplasia and suspected viral inclusions while end-stage pathological changes included fibromyxoid exudate diffuse alveolar damage and hyaline membrane formation in addition to the presence of atypical pneumocytes characterized by amphophilic granular cytoplasm large nuclei and prominent nucleoli with no identified viral inclusionsboth studies with a literature review of pathological features of severe acute respiratorysyndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and covid-19 found that they share multiple pathological characteristics however subsequent systematic autopsy might better explain the clinic-pathological features of covid-19 80 81 82recently an interesting approved animal study was performed on golden syrian hamsters that were inoculated with sars-cov2 isolated from a laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patient in hong kong several tissue organs were dissected and underwent histological examination tracheal tissue examination revealed epithelial desquamation with focal cilia loss and mononuclear infiltration while microscopic examination of the infected lungs revealed the formation of hyaline membranes with mononuclear cell infiltration large multinucleated syncytial bodies and alveolar lumens filled with cellular debris hemorrhage also the proliferation marker ki67 was extensively expressed in bronchiolar cells demonstrating marked cellular proliferationfurthermore multiple extra-pulmonary organ tissues were studied reduction in the spleen size was markedly observed with red and white pulp depletion and a decrease in the size and number of follicles pale eosinophilic lymph with sinus ectasia was observed in the mesenteric and bronchial lymph nodes interestingly the intestinal mucosa was highly affected demonstrating increased mononuclear cell infiltration in the lamina propria with massive necrosis in the epithelial cellsthese pathological changes revealed a possible explanation of the extra-pulmonary symptoms of the disease 83the covid-19 is a relatively new disease thus all opportunities must be explored in order to find the most effective mean of diagnosis prevention and treatmentthese efforts may also benefit from new technologies including molecular biology and radiology techniques but maybe also from artificial intelligence medical applications 84rapidity and accessibility may also represent important objectives for new researchesmeanwhile strict and well-applied measures of prevention and detection could help enhancing virus detectability 85most importantly the combination of well-conducted clinical examination with adequate laboratory tests and adapted radiological exams are still the most potent arsenal against this diseaseta has received honorarium from biotest france sas rs si ms and aa declare no conflict of interests for this manuscriptsince the emergence of the novel respiratory virus sars-cov-2 during december 2019 in the region of wuhan china the virus has spread rapidly all over the world causing a pandemic coronavirus disease covid-19 1 adequate diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection is essential for prompt therapeutic management of patients control of the epidemic and the establishment of infection control measures even though rt-qpcr is considered the reference method for screening and diagnosis the sensitivity of this method may vary depending on the quality and origin of the sample the time of infection and the viral load 23on 30 january 2020 the world health organization who declared the covid-19 outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern and shortly thereafter called for research on in-vitro diagnostics for use at the community level 4 in response several serological tests including the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa the chemiluminescence immunoassay clia and lateral flow rapid testing are now under development or have already entered the

the gathering of important epidemiological information providing more realistic data on the spread of the epidemic and on morbidity and mortality in addition the detection of antibodies against sars-cov-2 will play a key role in determining appropriate lockdown exit strategies and in vaccine development 2 3 4 5 6 7 however data concerning the performance of these assays are scarce 89 the

statistical analysis was performed with spps software a receiver operator characteristic roc curve was constructed and used for comparisons of the area under the curve auc of the roc curves the cohen kappa index was calculated for agreement between all analysed assays a p value  005 was considered statistically significant sensitivity specificity positive predictive value ppv and negative predictive value npv were calculated for each serological testsensitivity and specificity obtained with quantitative elisa and clia serological assays are summarized in table 1
 overall the elisa assay showed higher sensitivity than the clia 84 versus 64 respectively in contrast the specificity of clia igm 100 was greater than that observed for elisa iga 86 both tests showed similar specificities of igg at 99 for clia and 100 for elisa as shown in table 2
 during the first week after the onset of symptoms the elisa iga analysis was significantly more sensitive than the clia igm p  0001 although not-statistically significant higher sensitivity was also observed for the elisa igg compared to the clia igg p  045 the sensitivity of the clia iggigm increased one week after symptom onset reaching levels equivalent to those of the elisa iggigm assay from the third weekamong the negative control samples ten false positive results were observed with elisa iga 138 six of these cross-reacted with serum containing antibodies against ebv n  2 m pneumoniae n  3 anti-pl12 n  1 and four were without any known confounding factor no false positive results were obtained with the clia iggigm testthe distribution of the negative data points for both tests fig 1 fig 2

flow assays labon time and avioq 915  cohen kappa index of 0829 the absence of agreement between the five serological assays observed during the first week following symptom onset lessened 14 days after symptom onset with all assays achieving 97 to 100 agreementserological testing is a complementary test in covid-19 diagnosis and a strategic vehicle in the second phase of the pandemic necessary for epidemiological study and lockdown exit programmes immunoassays could provide identification of non-contagious and potentially protected individuals to support progressive de-confinement strategies in the process of gradually restoring safe economic and social activity 1011 different types of serological tests are available on the market and could be applied to the massive testing challenge the world is currently facingfully automated clia and elisa assays allow the quantitative determination of antibodies against sars-cov-2 by clinical laboratories with increased screening capacity in this study the elisa iggiga was tested on a fully automated microtiter plate analyser the workflow for elisa tests depends on the analyser used in our laboratory the capacity was 90 tests per 3-4 hours in contrast the clia iggigm assays are fully automated random-access tests this technology allows up to 180 tests per hour depending on the platform used with the results delivered in about 40 minutes the performance of maglumi iggigm tests has been successfully evaluated by padoan et al showing the reliability of these immunoassays for assessing the immunological response in the sera of covid-19 patients these tests show that it takes at least 12 days to reach 100 sensitivity for igg and a 88 positive rate for igm 12 in another study that compared the maglumi iggigm and euroimmun iggiga 100 sensitivity was observed with maglumi igg 10 days following onset of symptoms these authors reported a lower sensitivity for the maglumi igm 60 compared to the euroimmun iga 100 13 in the current study the maglumi iggigm tests also showed overall lower sensitivity than the euroimmun iggiga test 643 vs 844 but in contrast their specificity increased to 100 the mean days since symptom onset in the population tested for this study was 1146 days median of 10 days this can explain the lower sensitivity of the maglumi iggigm tests in our study as compared to those in the literature obka et al 8 also described higher sensitivity observed in the euroimmun iga test than in the euroimmun igg test 836 vs 617 this was particularly evident in the two first weeks after symptom onset but with less specificity for the former test 861 vs 986recently many commercial lateral flow assays have been developed and ce-labelled in this study three of these were also evaluated the results showed that their global sensitivity specificity npv and ppv were equivalent to the elisa iggiga or the clia iggigm tests in addition excellent concordance between the five immunoassays tested in this study was observed 14 days after the onset of symptoms similar results were reported by li et al showing good sensitivity 886 and specificity 906 with a rapid test in a large cohort of patient samples in china they observed similar performances with serum plasma and fingerstick blood 14 rapid serological tests can be performed in the laboratory or used as point-of-care tests poct the latter will provide accurate results within 10 to 15 minutes with equivalent sensitivity and specificity as the quantitative automated immunoassays particularly two weeks after onset of symptoms the opportunity to test outside of the clinical laboratory by lateral flow assay makes it possible to reach larger population groups without saturating the capacity of the laboratories poct may play an important role in large-scale testing in order to evaluate herd immunity against sars-cov-2 however mistakes in the interpretation of results in situations that are not under the control of trained staff must be taken into consideration for this reason the development of automated reader devices could help to reduce errors and increase sensitivity in addition such a device could support the transmission of the results to a public health institution to provide real-time information about seroprevalence at the population levelwhile still awaiting the results of large seroprevalence studies in the community wu et al report a detection rate of around 10 of sars-cov-2 igg in asymptomatic subjects from a single-centre investigation 15 the causal relationship between humoral response and illness severity is still unclear zhao et al revealed a strong positive correlation between clinical severity and antibody titres two weeks after illness onset 16 yongchen et al highlight the complementary role of immunoassays to rt-qpcr in the diagnosis of covid-19 particularly in critical patients with a negative rt-qpcr they observed seronegative asymptomatic patients four weeks after positive rt-qpcr results 17 in the current study two asymptomatic patients tested seronegative by all the immunoassays 20 days after a positive rt-qpcr result further studies in asymptomatic patients are necessary to understand better the humoral responses in this population and to understand the role of the real herd immunity in determining lockdown exit strategiesthis study has some limitations first this is a retrospective study performed with residual samples and the lack of fresh serum could impact the accuracy of the results second no reliable gold standard for serological tests is currently available for comparative studies and little literature exists concerning a comparison of immunoassay methods for sars-cov-2 detection furthermore the criteria for assessing the time of illness onset were recovered from medical records and may contain imprecisions due to subjectivity in the perception of symptoms and timingin conclusion this study shows the accurate and equivalent performance of five serological antibody assays elisa clia and three lateral flow tests in detecting sars-cov-2 antibodies 14 days after the onset of covid19 symptoms making them compatible for application in the clinical context and in developing epidemiological strategies for the covid-19 pandemicthe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest 2019-ncov iggigm rapid test

angleur belgium have offered the reagents for validationthis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorsthe novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 was first reported in late 2019 to cause coronavirus disease covid-19 the rapid global spread and exponential growth of the pandemic wave have stretched the limits of the available healthcare and intensive care unit capacity since the initial notification of an outbreak on december 31st the global response has transitioned from the initial policy of active case finding and containment to an increasingly complex package of confinement measures including closures of schools implementation of travel restrictions and physical distancing measures at present given the global circulation of sars-cov-2 the consensus is that elimination of the virus is no longer feasible and that longer-term strategies are needed that strike a balance between the economically and socially damaging near lockdown approaches and full release of any control measures there is wide agreement that in the latter situation rapid resurgence would be very likely with modeled epidemic peaks potentially exceeding the current healthcare capacity1the so-called exit strategy is defined as the transition from the current approach which focuses entirely on flattening the peak of the covid-19 emergence curve to the transition phase in which restrictions are gradually lifted the gradual lifting of control measures will require active surveillance to allow early detection of new cases or clusters coupled with contact tracing and quarantine most likely combined with continued physical distancing recommendations and enhanced protection of those at-risk from most severe disease a key knowledge gap is the level and duration of protective immunity in the population at large and in specific groups including persons with different clinical severity12to assess the extent of virus circulation in the community and the likelihood of protection against a re-infection there is a crucial need to add serology to the testing algorithms the required performance of a serological assay will depend on the specific aim of testing which may be either population screening in the general population or at-risk populations or diagnostic support we recently showed that antibodies directed against the s1 subunit of the sars-cov-2 spike protein and specifically to the receptor binding domain rbd within the s1 subunit strongly correlate with virus neutralization3 the likelihood of predicting protective antibody responses will thus increase when using either s1 antigens or rbd in the assay the specificity of serological tools detecting antibodies against sars cov-2 might be hampered by the presence of antibodies against other circulating coronaviruses in the population and thus testing for cross reactivity is crucial when selecting an appropriate assay for a specific purpose decision making should include the available knowledge on antibody specificities kinetics and functions4 the limited knowledge on antibody kinetics in emerging virus infections is always a challenge for design and validation of serological assays during an outbreak recent studies in covid-19 patients have shown that in both hospitalized patients and patients with mild disease seroconversion rates reach 100 after 1014 days and that antibody levels may correlate with clinical severity235 this is in line with observations in middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov infection in which antibody responses varied depending on disease severity with mild and asymptomatic infections resulting in weaker immune responses6 therefore for meaningful interpretation of serological assays and extrapolation of results to population screening sufficient samples from persons with mild and asymptomatic disease should be included in validation studiesin our study we compare three platforms which are widely used in diagnostic laboratories three rapid tests four elisas and a high throughput chemiluminescent assay clia which can be used to address different needs for individualized home testing as supplement to diagnostics and in population screening we analyze their performance in correlation to an in-house virus neutralization assay3 which is currently the gold standard when assessing protective immunity against sars cov-2serological testing to support clinical diagnostic work-up is mostly requested in hospitalized patients this can be for example when sars cov-2 rna diagnostic testing remains negative in a patient despite a strong clinical suspicion or for patients whose samples during the symptomatic phase were not collected other patients in whom antibody testing can be very valuable are those who have been hospitalized for weeks and in whom a pcr test continues to be positive with increasing cycle threshold values in these patients the detection of virus neutralizing antibodies can help with the decision to stop using personal protective equipment in these patients usually the serological results are interpreted by laboratory staff and there is a possibility to test follow-up sera or perform confirmation serological testing when comparing the laboratory assays in patients with different severity and stages of disease overall and in patients tested more than 14 days post-onset of disease the rbd antigen based wantai total ig assay performed best fig 1 table 1 both igg assays targeting the s antigen euroimmun and liaison lacked sensitivity in hospitalized patients as the sample set included early time-points the s1 based iga assay by euroimmun in contrast had a good sensitivity and showed the best quantitative relationship specifically once neutralizing titers were higher than 80 prnt50 units upon which the rbd ig assay becomes non-linear iga testing will detect both early and memory iga responses and will thus be a useful addition to igg assays the possible relevance of quantitative antibody measurements will need to be assessed when results of longer-term patient follow-up studies become available an alternative of the prnt50 can be the use of a surrogate virus neutralization test for sars cov-2 as recently produced by genscript usa which allows direct quantification extensive studies on the performance have however not yet been publisheddespite the differences in sensitivity all laboratory assays had sufficient positive predictive value ppv in covid-19 hospitalized patients when assuming an expected seroprevalence in this population of 50 table 1 or when using serology as an adjunct to rt-pcr testing to monitor the clinical course of illness their application as sole diagnostic howeverfor instance in primary care where the seroprevalence will be much lowerwill be more challenging as illustrated by the variation in ppv of the assays with a seroprevalence estimate of 4 which is the level currently observed in the netherlands7in addition to specialized elisa assays used in laboratory settings a wide range of rapid diagnostic tests rdt has been put on the market triggering the question whether they can be used in patient care or for triage in a medical care facility we selected three rdts by following criteria 1 preferably targetting the spike of sars-cov-2 2 at least european conformity ce marking or other authorization and 3 sufficient production capacity the rdts provide qualitative yesno results which does not allow quantification or the definition of a cut-off for neutralization fig 1fh all three rdts had a sufficient ppv in high seroprevalence scenarios which implies that there might be a role for the rdts when used for the individual patient with a sufficiently high pretest probability as an add on to pcr based diagnostics the high negative predictive value npv of the rdts in a low seroprevalence scenario could offer opportunities for the use of the test in the general population if the aim is to rule out the presence of sars cov-2 antibodies table 1population screening during a pandemic phase requires a highly specific assay to assure an acceptable ppv in populations with a low sero-prevalence3 and additionally a reasonable sensitivity table 1 this condition was met for the wantai elisas and euroimmun igg elisa the euroimmun iga and liaison  clia analyzer performed less well with specificities 95 when testing serum samples from persons exposed to a range of viruses table 18 this led to very low ppvs of respectively 39 and 26 for the euroimmun iga and the clia analyzer in low prevalence settings while the wantai total ig continued to perform reasonably well tested specimen were obtained from patients with mild moderate and severe disease all patients had detectable antibodies by prnt50 from day 18 supplementary data the severity of disease did not affect the range of detected neutralizing titers or sensitivity of selected assays table 1 supplementary data due to limitations in sample volumes of mild patients these were not equally tested in all assays in addition future studies are recommended to address the performance of alternative high throughput assays like the roche elecsys anti-sars-cov-2 or abbott sars-cov-2 igg in correlation to neutralizationfor the rdts the specificities varied from 85 to 99 table 1 although  the overall performance of the cellex assay with 99 specificity was hampered by its low sensitivity of 80 generally the use of the selected rdt is not recommended in population screening where estimated seroprevalence is mostly 5 and the ppv will be too low for a reliable interpretation table 1 a final question in population screening is whether the antibody measurements correlate with functional antibodies that can protect a population during a subsequent exposure in our analyses samples testing positive in the wantai ig elisa with an od ratio  10 all had detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies which suggests thatusing a cut-off- in this assay could be used to indicate presence of neutralizing antibodies the exact kinetics and functionality of these antibodies in offering protection remains to be determinedin conclusion our presented data support decision making for the use of serology in either individual patient care or population-level serological testing we conclude that for the aim of detecting protective antibodies the rbd based wantai elisa had the best overall performance including the potential to set a cut-off indicating the presence of protective antibodies the global performance of the selected rdts is not robust enough for over the counter personalized testing in the populationall specimen used in the study have been collected and delivered to our diagnostic laboratory for patient diagnostics and not following a predefined covid-19 research protocol to determine specificity of the assays we used a well-defined panel of 147 serum and plasma samples from 147 individuals exposed to human coronaviruses hcov-229e nl63 or oc43 sars mers or with a range of other respiratory viruses adenovirus human metapneumovirus influenza ab rsv ab rhinovirus bocavirus parainfluenzavirus 1 and 3 enterovirus specimen from patients with recent cytomegalovirus cmv epstein barr virus ebv or m pneumoniae infection were included as these have a high likelihood of causing cross reactivity sera were collected from 23 weeks upon the respiratory infection and during the acute phase of cmv or ebv the variation in the number of samples tested per assay was caused by limited sample volume and by the limited  availability of rdts during the study periodsensitivity was calculated by using a total of 187 sera from 107 individuals in the netherlands in whom covid-19 was confirmed by rt-pcr and antibodies were detected by prnt50 disease severity varied from 1 mild non-hospitalized 2 moderate hospitalized and 3 severe admitted to the intensive care unit specimen were taken at different time-points post-onset of disease supplementary data fig 1 all specimen were stored at 20 c until use the variation in the number of samples tested per assay is caused by the fact that validation was part of the acute diagnostic response during the first phase of the covid-19 pandemic initially a set of 75 patient sera was tested in all assays these sera were mostly collected from hospitalized patients and involved only three sera from mild patients to assess the performance of the assays in population screening it is important to involve sera from mild patients so we increased the number of tested sera in the wantai elisas liaison and rdts the selection of these assays was based on the best overall performance of wantai elisas in the first analyses and the likely application of liaison and rdts in population screening the exact number of specimen tested per assay varied due to availability of serum figure 1 depicts the outcome of the assays per time interval analyses in mild patients are shown in table 1 source data can be found in the supplementary data 1the use of specimen was approved by the erasmus mc medical ethical committee mec approval 2014414 which allows the use of clinical data and left-over material from the specimen delivered to our laboratory for diagnostics unless patients have declared they opted out of this scheme in addition the erasmus mc institutional research committee regulated that all covid-19 patients admitted to erasmus mc are asked for permission to use their

total evaluable results were 194 fig 2 there were 33 evaluable results from the primary analysis where findings from the rt-pcresi-ms disagreed with the clinical virology 31 of these had sufficient

table 1b the results for individual pathogens shown in table 2b accuracy of rt-pcresi-ms did not differ significantly between adult and paediatric patientstime to first result from sample preparation to detection of rt-pcresi-ms was 8 h1 h of dnarna extraction 4 h of rt-pcr and 3 h of processing in esi-ms estimated throughput of rt-pcresi-ms was 300 samples with 2 technicians working 8 hthis hospital-based pilot study was designed to describe the preliminary performance of a novel rt-pcresi-ms platform versus the current diagnostic algorithm used in the clinical virology laboratory in clinical specimens the findings demonstrate that the assay has high throughput and was able to detect simultaneously and type multiple clinically relevant respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with suspected viral infections with 824 accuracy compared to conventional clinical virology laboratory testing this study also shows that pathogens not detectable by conventional clinical virology methods could be detected successfully by the rt-pcresi-ms platformadvantages of the rt-pcresi-ms platform over conventional testing include rapid turnaround capacity to detect multiple respiratory pathogens simultaneously with high throughput and provision of more detailed pathogen characterization ie semi-quantitation typing and subtyping of species the commonly used diagnostic methods in less well-equipped clinical virology laboratories are culture-based which may take days to yield results are labour-intensive and costly anzueto and niederman 2003 although some rapid antigen tests offer faster detection times for individual pathogen clinical utility is limited as the pathogenic agent is usually not known a priori and these tests have sub-optimal sensitivity and specificity ginocchio 2007 as demonstrated in this study that the rapid antigen tests detected only small proportions of influenza and rsv in clinical specimens the sub-optimal sensitivity restricts the wider utilization of these rapid tests in clinical settings compared to diagnostic algorithms used commonly in hospitals fig 1 the rt-pcresi-ms platform provides a more straightforward approach for identification of clinically relevant respiratory viruses and may serve as a diagnostic adjunct ultimatelydata demonstrating capacity of rt-pcresi-ms platform to type and subtype while not shown here comes from a pilot study by our group in which 26 of 29 novel h1n1 influenza a viruses detections were confirmed by additional state laboratory testing using the centers for disease control and prevention novel h1n1 influenza a pcr typing method supporting a role for this platform for surveillance in clinical or public health settings gaydos 2010 viral load quantitation capacity of the assay not detailed here was being performed in a separate pilot study from this group demonstrating that readouts of viral genome copywell by rt-pcresi-ms correlate positively with the type of detection method employed by clinical virology chen et al 2008methods for evaluating the performance of novel assays which are potentially more accurate than the current reference tests remain controversial some researchers employ other similar assays ie secondary pcr based assay to confirm findings from the novel assays discordant with conventional culture or rapid antigen test liolios et al 2001 pabbaraju et al 2008 while others propose using adjunctive clinical data as reference doring et al 2008 although this retrospective study design did not permit detailed clinical data collection for reference the secondary analysis was performed using a secondary pcr assay however the secondary pcr assay itself is still not perfect in diagnosing every type of respiratory virus in clinical samples as a result two of four adenovirus detections for which the luminex assay had poor sensitivity to detect pabbaraju et al 2008 were not able to be confirmed in this study and may have underestimated the performance of rt-pcresi-ms platform for adenovirusesin the subgroup analysis differences were not found in the performance characteristics of the platform among different clinical subgroups of the study population as hypothesized which could be due to small sample size of this pilot however specimens from the clinical virology laboratory negative groups were found to contain significantly lower viral load in the rt-pcresi-ms platform compared to the positive group data not presented which could be explained by the better sensitivity of the nucleic acid amplification tests mahony 2008 further studies to confirm performance among patients with different demographic characteristics are meritedthe current study has several important limitations although the optimal design to determine whether the candidate assay performs potentially better than the gold standard is to have a third confirmatory test done for every sample the limited volume of the excess nasopharyngeal aspirate samples precluded this type of detailed evaluation accordingly readers should be cautioned to interpret results of the secondary analysis carefully since they could be overestimating performance of the assay hadgu et al 2005 because of the same reason specimens with bocavirus detected by rt-pcresi-ms could not be confirmed another limitation is that rt-pcresi-ms testing on excess nasopharyngeal aspirate samples was performed several months after initial clinical samples were obtained and tested by clinical virology although the effect of length of storage of nasopharyngeal aspirates has been shown to be minimal within 2 months ward et al 2004 another study suggests nucleic acid degradation may be associated the 70 c storage frisbie et al 2004 and the impact of longer periods of storage remains unknown furthermore the majority of the study population was comprised of paediatric patients 18 years of age which limits generalizability of the findings to the adult population future validation of the performance of the rt-pcresi-ms platform on adult population is necessary lastly this ibis t5000 respiratory virus surveillance ii kit was not designed to detect rhinovirus one of the most prevalent respiratory viruses however a modified respiratory virus surveillance kit is under development to include rhinovirus the accuracy and reliability of this type of platform merits further studies using prospective clinical respiratory specimensin conclusion the innovative rt-pcresi-ms technology could detect most viruses identified by conventional virology methods rapidly and accurately and allowed identification of mixed pathogens in clinical specimens detection of conventional viruses missed by the clinical virology algorithm and unconventional viruses required additional confirmatory testing to further evaluate performance characteristics of this assay the rt-pcresi-ms method is a promising diagnostic platform for rapid identification of conventional and unconventional viruses and merits further prospective evaluationestablishing rapid and widespread testing for coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is essential to containing the pandemic and reopening society the current gold standard test measures viral nucleic acids extracted from clinical swabs by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction qrt-pcr this assay requires trained medical personnel specialized instrumentation supply-limited reagents and significant technical labor isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests are an alternative to conventional pcr methods that do not require expensive instruments or trained personnel to perform the reaction or quantify the results specifically loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp with simultaneous reverse-transcription rt-lamp allows for rapid and sensitive detection of nucleic acids within one hour in an easily interpretable colorimetric assay that requires only a heat source12several groups around the world are currently developing lamp-based protocols for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 the virus causing covid-1937 the sensitivity of lamp compares well to the limit-of-detection of qrt-pcr on purified rna samples and may achieve higher sensitivity on crude clinical samples5 the robustness of the lamp bst polymerase to pcr inhibitors makes it especially well-suited and widely used for pathogen detection in unpurified samples8 this confers a major potential advantage over current testing protocols as it enables skipping the cost- labor- and reagent-consuming step of rna extractionsaliva is a promising sample for expanding and facilitating testing due to the ease safety and non-invasive nature of its collection and its relatively high viral load910 recognizing these benefits the fda approved a saliva collection and preservation device for downstream covid-19 testing direct comparison of saliva to nasopharyngeal np swabs from the same individuals revealed that saliva samples provided more consistent and sensitive results for covid-19 detection11 these saliva-based methods however still employ rna extraction followed by qrt-pcrhere we sought to establish and optimize a simple lamp-based assay for the qualitative detection of sars-cov-2 virus directly from saliva without an rna extraction stepto develop our assay we first compared the performance of five sets of recently developed lamp primer sets targeting different regions of the sars-cov-2 genome36 we used a commercially available neb colorimetric enzyme mix to perform lamp reactions on quantitative in vitro transcribed rna standards corresponding to regions targeted by lamp primers12 of these the neb gene n-a3 and lamb et al4 primers targeting the nucleocapsid gene n and orf1ab regions respectively had the highest sensitivity and lowest rates of false positives in the water-only control supplementary figure 1 demonstrating specificity to sars-cov-2 these primers had no cross-reactivity with mers coronavirus controls these primer sets were prioritized for further testingnext we validated these primer sets on both rna standards and heat-inactivated viral particles spiked into water or human saliva to simulate clinical samples figure 1a across both sets of lamp primers and for both rna and particles saliva strongly inhibited lamp detection of sars-cov-2 compared to water fig 1b particles were weakly and inconsistently detected in saliva whereas their detection in water was on par with detection of rna fig 1c this suggests the presence of an inhibitor in saliva rather than an inaccessibility of particle-associated rna we observed time sensitivity of the colorimetric assay especially from saliva with many samples tinting yellow after prolonged incubation in the lamp reaction longer than 40 minutes we found that a 30-minute incubation provided a more reliable readoutto neutralize or otherwise reduce inhibitors in human saliva we tested several approaches that have been demonstrated to improve viral rna detection in crude samples including saliva1317 we tested simple dilution of particle-containing saliva into water and various heat and chemical treatments first we found that dilution of saliva into water enabled sensitive detection of sars-cov-2 particles using lamp figure 2a top a heat treatment of 55c for 15 minutes followed by 98c for 5 minutes further improved lamp sensitivity fig 2a middle identical heating steps plus the addition of proteinase k increased lamp sensitivity relative to dilution alone fig 2a bottom but not markedly more than heat treatment importantly we found that the combined heating steps above or proteinase k treatment improved sars-cov-2 particle detection in undiluted human saliva samples fig 2b and conferred a consistent limit of detection on the order of 102 particles per reaction we experimented with additional heat and chemical pretreatments including the hudson protocol heating unextracted diagnostic samples to obliterate nucleases14 and various detergents but all of these conditions decreased assay sensitivity or interfered with colorimetry supplementary figure 2ac we also varied the amount of crude sample input to the lamp reaction we found that adding up to 8 l of direct saliva was compatible with the assay but increased volume did not improve sensitivity supp fig 2dto further improve the accuracy of our assay we sought to multiplex lamp primer sets in a single reaction combining primers can potentially increase sensitivity through additive signals of simultaneous amplification reactions1819 including multiple primer sets will also confer diagnostic robustness against mutations that arise in the sars-cov-2 genome20 non-specific primer interactions however could result in potential false positives we compared pairwise combinations of neb gene n-a primers with the other four primer sets targeting various regions across the sars-cov-2 genome encouragingly all pairs of primer sets outperformed the neb gene n-a primer set alone with no apparent increase in spurious background amplification supplementary figure 3we next tested whether multiplexing primer sets could improve signal detection in untreated and heat and chemical treated particle-containing saliva figure 3a as before we found that heat treatment 55 for 15 minutes 98 for 3 minutes alone gave a marked improvement in sars-cov-2 particle detection from saliva fig 3b p  1e-5 two-sided t-test this effect was consistent across all primer sets the same heat treatment plus proteinase k further improved assay sensitivity compared to heat alone p  0003 two-sided t-test multiplexed primer sets slightly improved the sensitivity of the assay pushing the limit of detection to the order of 101 particles per reaction at this sensitivity the multiplexed lamp assay would detect the vast majority of covid positive samples based on reported saliva viral loads median 102103 per ul1011 as viral loads peak around day zero of symptom onset lamp would have the most accuracy at this critical timepoint21to benchmark the performance of our extraction-free protocol on qrt-pcr we performed qrt-pcr using the cdc gene n1 probe set directly on untreated and treated simulated saliva samples we found that qrt-pcr had similar sensitivity to lamp on crude samples reliably detecting sars-cov-2 in all samples down to 101 particles per reaction fig 3c 100 particles were not reliably detected in this assay we observed strong improvements in cycle thresholds ct using either heat alone or heat plus proteinase k p  1e-3 two-tailed paired t-tests these results provide further evidence that saliva pretreatment can significantly increase the sensitivity of viral rna detectionwe obtained saliva samples collected at day zero of hospital admission from six presumptive covid-19 positive individuals one sample was excluded because its viscosity prevented pipetting the other five were aliquoted into 3 tubes for either no treatment heat inactivation 55 for 15 minutes 98 for 3 minutes or the same heat treatment plus proteinase k following pretreatment the rt-lamp reaction was performed with the neb gene n-a primers photographs were taken at 10 20 and 30 minutes to track colorimetric shifts over time figure 4a an aliquot of 104 viral particles in saliva was used as a positive control after 30 minutes 4 of the five samples were clearly positive in the heat plus proteinase k treated samples fig 4a bottom right positive and negative controls were positive and negative in all reactions at the 30-minute timepoint allowing an interpretable readout of the assay untreated samples showed positivity for samples 35 and heat-alone indicated clear positivity for samples 24 these differences may reflect altered ratios of free viral rna to particle-associated rna in these samples which could be differentially affected by our heat treatment proteinase k treatment both protects free rna by inactivating nucleases and releases particle-bound rna incorporating quantitative colorimetric decomposition and analysis will enhance sensitivity and interpretability of borderline samples in future experiments22we did not have corresponding gold-standard qrt-pcr results from these samples instead we performed qrt-pcr with the cdc n1 probe directly on the untreated and treated samples along with our positive and negative controls qrt-pcr results were qualitatively concordant with the rt-lamp results identifying 4 clear positives samples 25 ct  40 fig 4b sample 1 tested negative in all lamp treatments and qrt-pcr and an attempt to purify rna from this saliva sample was unsuccessful this may indicate rna degradation prior to lamp and qrt-pcr further work is needed to establish best practices for upstream handling of saliva specimens toward this end we have shown that the lamp reaction is compatible with samples in te buffer 10 mm tris 01 mm edta diluted hudson buffer 25 mm tcep 05 mm edta and rnasecure supplementary figure 4aas with lamp our pre-treatment regimens significantly improved nucleic acid detection by qrt-pcr fig 4c heat treatment 55 for 15 minutes 98 for 3 minutes with and without proteinase k outperformed untreated samples p  001 and p  0001 respectively proteinase k did not further significantly improve sensitivity compared to heat alone extrapolation of viral loads in clinical saliva samples by comparing to our quantitative positive control yielded estimates of 14  101  98  102 particles per l and demonstrates the sensitivity of our assay on real clinical samples further validation and optimization on additional positive and negative saliva specimens are necessary for clinical assay deploymentto enable significant scale-up of testing capacity using the lamp assay on human saliva we adapted our protocol to a 96-well plate format spectrophotometric plate scanning before and after the assay provided an unbiased quantitative interpretation initial plate scanning was implemented to normalize for baseline differences induced by variation in ph across human saliva samples heat treatment 55 for 15 minutes 98 for 3 minutes with and without proteinase k enabled sensitive detection of viral particles in human saliva samples down to 102 particles per reaction with some detection at 101 and even 100 particles per reaction figure 5a this assay was quantitative over at least four orders of magnitude quantification of the limit-of-detection and assay validation on clinical specimens are ongoingisothermal lamp is well-suited to point-of-care testing because it requires only a heat-source we sought to avoid the 98 c heating step to make the saliva pre-treatment compatible with a single isothermal heat source whereas a mild heat treatment consisting of 50 c for 5 minutes and 64 for 5 minutes did not enable sensitive detection of sars-cov-2 in undiluted saliva sup figure 2b a 64 c treatment for 15 minutes of saliva that had been diluted 11 in either te 10 mm tris 01 mm edta or dilute hudson buffer 25 mm tcep 05 mm edta improved detection sup fig 4b addition of rnasecure a non-enzymatic ribonuclease inhibitor that does not require heat-inactivation boosted assay sensitivity to 102 viral particles per reaction sup fig 4b sars-cov-2 in samples treated with a thermolabile version of proteinase k inactivated by incubation at 65 for 10 minutes was not detected in a sensitive fashion sup fig 4c finally we found that guanidine hydrochloride 40 mm was compatible with the lamp reaction and that both rnasecure and primer multiplexing provided further enhancements to sensitivity sup 4d these pretreatment methods will enable the use of saliva in lamp reactions using a single heat step simplifying point-of-care testingour proposed approach combines three promising avenues to enable rapid and widespread covid-19 detection 1 colorimetric rt-lamp 2 self-collected saliva specimens and 3 compatibility with crude saliva samples without rna-extraction this approach solves two major bottlenecks in massively scaling up covid-19 nucleic acid testing sample acquisition and rna extraction and it enables test results in less than an hour viral shedding likely begins several days prior to onset of any symptoms and viral load peaks during this period21 colorimetric rt-lamp directly on saliva would enable rapid and frequent testing of pre- or asymptomatic carriers enabling their isolation prior to unwitting viral transmission such testing is critical to curtailing the ongoing pandemicdue to its ease of use rapid amplification of nucleic acids high specificity arising from the use of six primers and high tolerance of reaction inhibitors8 rt-lamp has been widely used for pathogen detection sensitive diagnostic assays have been developed for viruses including zika1923 and such assays are being developed for sars-cov-2 by several groups including ours37182428 speed cost turnaround time and a simple colorimetric readout make rt-lamp an effective solution to ramping up testing further because it does not require specialized equipment or training for performing or interpreting the assay rt-lamp is especially well-suited for point-of-care detectionsample acquisition is currently limited by the reliance on np swabs which need to be carefully performed by a trained health-care worker and require the use of ppe mid-nasal swabs are a promising alternative to np swabs because they can be self-administered and contain high viral loads2931 however due to potential swab shortages we instead focused on expectorated saliva due to its ease of collection and high viral load11 our work adds to the growing body of evidence that saliva will facilitate the adoption of widespread testingseveral groups are optimizing workarounds to avoid the rna extraction step for pcr based sars-cov-2 testing while maintaining sensitivity13151729 here we have demonstrated a variety of saliva pre-treatment protocols that enable sensitive detection of sars-cov-2 by both rt-lamp and qrt-pcr rna in saliva likely comprises a mixture of free and particle-associated rna capsid release of rna and nuclease inactivation by heat or chemicals may damage free viral rna so a careful balance must be achieved to maximize sensitivity despite requiring brief inactivation at 98c proteinase k treatment to release viral rna and inactivate ribonucleases and other inhibitors in saliva worked well to increase sensitivity in both rt-lamp and qrt-pcr alternatively te buffer guanidine hudson buffer and rnasecure allowed us to perform a heat step isothermal with the lamp reaction conditions while maintaining high assay sensitivity this version of the protocol is compatible with point-of-care testing our proof-of-concept validation on actual clinical samples suggests high sensitivity of the current assay to detect sars-cov-2 directly from treated saliva further optimizations may improve assay sensitivity and robustnessdaily screening of employees especially health-care workers is feasible with this approach due to its rapid turnaround low complexity and low cost as viral loads are correlated with transmission only weakly infectious carriers risk false negative results which is also true for the current gold standard colorimetric rt-lamp on saliva has broad potential to increase covid-19 screening speed and capacity as demonstrated by our adaptation of this assay to a plate-based format similar approaches by others have now been validated on clinical samples deployed for disease surveillance and adapted for home testing and point-of-care use2728in summary we have optimized rt-lamp reaction conditions to enable sensitive sars-cov-2 detection from unpurified saliva samples this optimization overcomes the burden of rna extraction reagent need for sophisticated instrumentation and the time and labor bottlenecks of the current gold standard nucleic acid-based tests our assay can be deployed as a point-of-care test or in a centralized laboratory facility while non-exhaustive our current optimizations have enabled reliable detection below 102 viral genomes per reaction from simulated saliva samples using these conditions we observed high performance of this

in many geographical regions it is clear that the total number of actual covid-19 cases is much higher than the number of confirmed ones in most of the confirmed covid-19 cases the patients are symptomatic showing fever dry cough and pneumonia but also more atypical symptoms such as gastrointestinal manifestations as well as anosmia and ageusia however the virus has been detected in completely asymptomatic individuals eg in a recent study from italy showing that 44 of the laboratory-confirmed cases lacked symptoms 10 the knowledge concerning the actual number of asymptomatic vs symptomatic infections is still limited the same is true for the potentially growing herd immunity where almost no data is available to datein the present study we evaluated a commercially available assay the covid-19 iggigm rapid test cassette zhejiang orient gene biotech co ltd huzhou zhejiang china developed for detection of sars-cov-2-specific antibodiescapillary blood samples or serum from 29 pcr-confirmed covid-19 patients or convalescents and capillary blood samples from 24 healthy volunteers without any known history of sars-cov-2 infectioncovid-19 were included in the study anonymous blood donor sera from healthy adults n  80 and 20 serum samples from babies 612 months collected before or during 2018 from the uppsala academic hospital were used as negative controls clinical samples that had been deposited in uppsala biobank were anonymized and used in accordance with local ethical guidelines they were all used with informed consent according to the swedish biobank law which allows anonymized diagnostic patient samples to be used for purposes similar to those of the original sampling the 29 samples from covid-19 confirmed individuals as well as the 100 negative controls and the 24 healthy volunteers were all from unique individuals all samples were analyzed anonymouslythe test was run according to the manufacturers instructions covid-19 iggigm rapid test cassette whole bloodserumplasma productmodel gccov-402a lot 2003242 zhejiang orient gene biotech co ltd huzhou zhejiang china 11 briefly 5 l of serum or one drop of capillary blood were added to the test slide followed by 80 l of the buffer provided in the kit the results were read after 10 min max 15 min by the naked eye only tests in which the control line changed its color were regarded as valid 3 out of 156 19 cassettes did not function if a line was observed for igm andor igg the test was considered positive the intensity of the color was not judgednone of the 80 negative sera from healthy blood donors tested igm positive in the assay while one tested igg positive 180 125 95 confidence level 003677 tables 1 and 2 the single igg-positive sample was re-analyzed and remained igg positive in the second test none of the 20 serum samples from the 612 months old babies tested positive for either igm or igg

none of the 24 healthy volunteers without any known history of sars-cov-2 infectioncovid-19 tested positive for igm or iggaltogether 20 of 29 69 samples from pcr-confirmed covid-19 patients tested igm positive and 27 tested 931 igg positive tables 1 and 2 when the patients were grouped into two groups depending on the time between onset of disease and testing seven out of ten patients in the first group 917 days and 1319 patients in the second group 1829 days tested igm positive nine out of ten patients in the first group 917 days and 1819 patients in the second group 1829 days tested igg positive figure 1 there was no statistical difference between the two groups for neither igm or igg seropositivity all samples that were igm positive were also igg positive
based on the results described above and summarized in tables 1 and 2 the assay showed a sensitivity of 69 2029 and 931 2729 for igm and igg respectively the assay showed an overall specificity of 100 124124 and 992 123124 1 false positive for igm and igg respectivelyusing pcr-positive cases as true positives the accuracy of the test was 941 144153 and 980 150153 for igm and igg respectively the positive and negative predictive values the likelihood of being a case given a positive test result and the likelihood of being healthy given a negative test result for igm were 100 2020 and 932 124133 respectively for igg the corresponding values were 964 2728 and 984 123125in this study we evaluated a commercial rapid test for detection of sars-cov-2-specific igm and igg for the evaluation samples from covid-19 cases obtained during disease or convalescence and previously confirmed by pcr were used as true positives this means that in the pcr-positive cases for which antibodies may not yet had time to develop or in potential cases with immune defects it is possible that the negative igm or igg results were in fact true negatives if this was the case for one or more of the included patients the actual sensitivities should be higher ie when evaluated only on samples known to contain detectable levels of sars-cov-2-specific igm andor igg for a more optimal evaluation of the assay sensitivity a gold standard for sars-cov-2-specific antibodies would have been needed this is however unfortunately not available to dateaccording to the manufacturer the specificity has been evaluated on 14 pcr-negative samples and was found to be 100 for both igm and igg while the sensitivity evaluated on covid-19 cases was calculated at 879 for igm and 972 for igg the results by li et al 11 indicated an overall testing sensitivity of 887 and 906 specificity our results showed a lower sensitivity for igm a similar sensitivity for igg and specificities in between the results of the two evaluationsa recent study on three chinese covid-19 cases found that seroconversions occurred between 7 and 12 days after the onset of symptoms 12 however larger studies on the detailed kinetics of the antibody responses eg iga igm igg neutralizing antibodies are now urgently needed for a better understanding of the dynamics of the immune response during covid-19 the results of our study showed detectable igm and igg in some patients at day 9 while in other patients the seroconversion seems to occur later the impact of early or late seroconversion on the case severity is not known and must now be explored interestingly there were no igm positives that were not igg positive generally igm is produced first and later there is a switch towards igg production 13 but studies on sars-cov suggest that igm and igg often develop around the same time 1415 our results are in line with this figure 1 but more detailed studies on long-term sequential samples from patients are now needed it may be worth looking into whether this is a problem with the test or a constant finding within the immune response to sars-cov-2there were no false igm positive samples indicating a very high specificity of the test one false positive igg result was observed for one healthy adult blood donor this sample was re-tested and the result was consistent indicating a cross-reaction to another coronavirus serological cross-reactions have earlier been observed between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 16 there are other human coronaviruses nl63 oc43 229e and hku1 that are globally endemic or epidemic 17 and it may be possible that this reaction represented a cross-reaction due to a previous infection with one of those human cov nl63 has been shown to use the same receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as sars-cov and sars-cov-2 18 which may indicate potential cross-reactive epitopes how common the covs are as causative agents for common colds is not known in detail but there has been estimates that up to 20 of cases could be caused by covs 19the specificity and sensitivity for igg detection of the rapid test evaluated here is well in line with those of a recently reported enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa which had a specificity and a sensitivity of 975 20while this study showed a satisfactory performance of the rapid test it is limited by being compared only to clinical cases and pcr-positivity and as a next step it is necessary to compare this assay to other serological tests in contrast to li et al 11 we found less indications for using this test for clinical diagnosis nevertheless it might contribute to detecting potential asymptomatic infections as well as getting a notion of the magnitude of the spread in different geographical areas which might be a key to taking the appropriate decisions and policies forward the high negative predictive value indicates that the rapid test will be useful for detecting past infections and possible immunity which may be crucial for restoring social functions after lockdowncoronavirus outbreak continues to surprise the world to date over one million people across the two hundred countries have been infected according to the last updates of the world health organization who approximately sixty thousand confirmed deaths among the cases are reported 1 humanity had not faced a pandemic through the history that spreads rapidly all over the earth if a defined brand new virus is able to spread from person to person while infecting the contacts easily with a sustained and efficient way then it is called a pandemic the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov fulfills all those definitions strongly at the end of the year 2019 wuhan city of china cradled the first case of the novel coronavirus now from europe to america its deadly effects threaten the whole world the who named the 2019-ncov epidemic disease on february 11 2020 as coronavirus disease covid-19 2019-ncov is a new member of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus family sars-cov and labeled as sars-cov-2 2with its spike surface for binding to receptors see figure 1
 sars-cov-2 presents the covid-19 with the symptoms of fever sore throat and following pneumonia with severe acute respiratory distress 3 for all that the respiratory symptoms are not in a specific form there are so many isolated cases ie the existence of the covid-19 may not appear at the first clinical symptoms 4 the rapid spreading nature of the coronavirus and the serious respiratory effects to humans make the diagnosis of the covid-19 an urgent situation 5 today health specialists use the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test for the detection of the nucleic acid forms stem from the sars-cov-2 in the process the respiratory specimens such as oropharyngeal swabs or nasopharyngeal sampling are collected and the very important issue when doing this is the receipt place of the specimens the operation is categorically open to malfunctions by the expert mistakes 6 besides the operation procedure the pcr test is a time-consuming process because a patient has to be isolated in non-suitable circumstances for hours until getting the test results in addition these types of tests have a low detection rate of between 30  50 hence most of the times they need to be repeated to make a confirmation 7to be able to procure an atmosphere where the patients could get quick treatment and care is a crucial task in the fight of the covid-19 because of the fast-spreading essence of the pandemic patients apply to the health center in batches at this point the need for rapid diagnosis methods is a very important issue for monitoring the sars-cov-2 infections to diagnose there is another option of visualization using the radiological images for instance chest x-rays or computed tomography ct former studies prove that covid-19 causes abnormalities that are visible in the chest x-rays and ct images in the form of ground-glass opacities with a strong suggestion a diagnostic with radiological images could be a first step in monitoring the covid-19 9 although the radiological images based diagnostic is a faster way and also it has some advances over the pcr testing in terms of the detection rate in earlier stages of the covid-19 the backbone of the system is the need of experts in comprehending the images intrinsically artificial intelligence ai based diagnostic options can encourage the experts to gain a rapid and accurate explication over the x-ray images on the way of the detection of the covid-19 10for this motivation there are several studies in the literature including the analysis conducted on ai-based diagnostic of the covid-19 with the help of the radiological images 11 12 13 14 15 in 15 the authors propose a transfer learning model that processes a dataset including the ct images of the covid-19 infected patients they obtain a test accuracy of 793 the study 14 indicates a three-class model that can distinguish the covid-19 influenza-a viral-based pneumonia and healthy cases the segmentation-based study reaches the 867 accuracy value with the ct images dataset in 13 the authors propose a rapid ai development cycle using a deep learning-based ct image analysis heretofore the mentioned studies in the literature use non-public datasets through developing a deep learning-based diagnostic of the covid-19 the studies 11 12 provides public datasets including the covid-19 x-ray images of infected patients in 11 the authors propose a combined public dataset besides a deep learning model called covid-net for the detection of covid-19 covid-net architecture relies on a tailored convolutional neural network cnn model which uses the chest x-rays as inputs the authors reach a test accuracy of 924 with restricted covid-19 class images in our study we use the same dataset of the 11 to be able to outperform the existing covid-net accuracy in detecting the covid-19 in addition there are several more studies that we can consider in covid-19 detection using chest x-rays 16 17 18 19 with a detailed pre-processed dataset our study captures the flag with a specially designed deep learning modelthe usage of deep learning models in medical image processing and analysis is a challenging topic in the ai field 10 20 in 21 the authors propose a cnn model for pneumonia detection the authors of the study 22 propose a vessel extraction from the fundus images in 23 an expert system is proposed for brain tumor detection in high-resolution brain magnetic resonance images to this end in our study we use a specially designed deep learning model called squeezenet first proposed in 24 the proposed deep learning model for the diagnostic of the covid-19 is based on squeezenet architecture as because it has a smaller structure compared to the well-known pre-trained network designs 25 26in this study we introduce a covid-19 detection ai model covidiagnosis-net based on deep squeezenet with bayes optimization with a view to obtain a higher accuracy rate the hyper-parameter optimization of the deep learning models is a crucial task 27 the backbone of the proposed model ie the dataset is a public dataset that is detailed in 11 differently from the study 11 we perform a multi-scale augmentation process to overcome the imbalance problem of the proposed public dataset since the focus is on covid-19 diagnosis we perform a detailed offline augmentation process for the limited number of covid-19 infected chest x-rays of the patients with the help of the offline well-defined augmentation process and bayes-squeezenet our proposed diagnostic model for covid-19 outperforms the covid-net 11 while reaching a test accuracy of 0983 in building our model we first perform a detailed augmentation after obtaining the augmented dataset the data split is generated on the shuffled database to form the train validation and test datasets we manage the training process of the deep squeezenet while performing a bayes optimization with the validation phase at the same time through the training the best model is determined and the final network design is tested with the separate test dataset package on through those developments the proposed deep bayes  squeezenet obtains a higher detection rate in the diagnosis of the covid-19 using the chest x-ray imagesherein we can describe the contributions of our proposed model as listed below1presents a novel model for the rapid diagnostic of the covid-19 based on deep bayes-squeezenet called covidiagnosis-net2overcomes the imbalance problem of the public dataset a multi-scale offline augmentation is performed3proposes an easy to implement deep learning network for embedded and mobile systems that could aid the health experts for a stable diagnosis of the covid-19 in the control of the current epidemic
the composition of the rest of the article is as follows section 2 describes the materials and methods with details of the proposed deep bayes-squeezenet along with the model components ie squeezenet architecture bayesian optimization and dataset description section 3 presents the explanation of what we design in experiments with evaluation criteria findings and a comparison sub-section to draw the big picture of where our study stands among the other state-of-the-art methods finally section 4 briefs a conclusion of the studythe overall architecture of the deep bayes-squeezenet based rapid diagnostic system is presented in figure 1 the proposed system is composed of three main stages as offline augmentation of the raw dataset training of the bayesian optimization-based squeezenet model and decision-making of the network with the testing phase the proposed method classifies the three-class x-ray images labeled as normal no infection pneumonia bacterial or none-covid viral infection and covid covid-19 viral infectionin the first stage the offline augmentation method is utilized to the raw input x-ray images due to their uneven sample distributions this method is preferred for smaller classes with fewer sample numbers in order to increase the size of the classes by a transformation factor after the augmentation the augmented dataset is divided into three subsets as train validation and test sets train and validation sets are set as the input of the training and optimization stage the test set is used for the testing input in the training and optimization stage the squeezenet convolution network is utilized and it uses the squeeze and expands layers of the fire modules to construct a smaller and more effective cnn architecture squeezenet is a pre-trained cnn model and it is pre-trained on the ilsvrc-12 challenge imagenet dataset 30 31 this supporting dataset is completely different from x-ray images and the squeezenet model needs to be fine-tuned to classify the covidx classes in order to obtain the best decision-making model the cnn network is optimized with the bayesian-based method which is a sequential design strategy during training a validation error is used to update the optimization process finally the best squeezenet model is obtained and used for the decision-making process with the test set the obtained best network model classifies the infection classes and classification performances are determinedsqueezenet is a convolution network that executes better performance than alexnet with 50x fewer parameters 23 24 30 squeezenet consists of fifteen layers with five different layers as two convolution layers three max pooling layers eight fire layers one global average pooling layer and one output layer softmax the architecture of the network is given in figure 2
as shown in figure 2 kk notation represents the receptive field size of the filters s denotes the stride size and l is the feature map length respectively the input of the network has 227227 dimensions with rgb channels the input images are generalized by convolution and max pooling is applied convolution layer convolutes between the weights and small regions in the input volumes with 33 kernels each convolution layer performs an element-wise activation function as the positive part of its argument squeezenet utilizes from the fire layers which constructed of squeeze and expansion phases between the convolution layers the output tensor scale and input of the fire are consistent the squeeze phase uses the filter of size 11 whereas expansion uses the filters of size 11 and 33 firstly the input tensor hwc passes through the squeeze and the number of convolution is equal to c4 of the number of input tensor channels after the first phase the data passes through the expansions and depth of the data is expanded to c2 of the output tensor depth both squeeze and expansion phases are connected to the relu units the squeeze operation compresses the depth and expansion increases the depth by keeping the same feature size finally expansion outputs are stacked in the depth dimension of input tensor with concatenate operation figure 3
summarizes the fire layer and sub-operations assuming fm and c define the feature maps and channels the output layer fy of the squeeze operation with the kernel w can be expressed as 321fyfm11fmc1cwcfxcfm1
here fyrn and wrc1fm2 the squeeze outputs can be defined as a weighted combination of the feature maps of the different tensors in the network max pool layers execute a down-sampling operation along the spatial dimensions and global average pool convert the feature maps of the classes into one value at the end of the network softmax activation function gives the multiclass probability distributions
table 1
presents the detailed layer configuration of the squeezenet architecture the motivation for designing the squeezenet architecture in covid-19 diagnosis is that the network provides three main advantages 23 24 1 the network is more efficient because it has fewer parameters 2 applications developed for this network are easy to move and require less communication 3 it has a model size of less than 5 mb and it is easy to implement to embedded systemshyperparameters have a key role in both machine learning and deep learning algorithms inasmuch as those parameters are tightly managing the acts of the training algorithms and they affect the performance of the models significantly therefore the optimization of hyperparameters is a crucial task especially when it comes to deep learning in medical image processing in general there exist two ways of hyperparameters optimization called manual and automatic searching the manual searching as the name suggests looks for the hyperparameters by hand hence manual searching requires expertise unfortunately when dealing with big data and so many model parameters for tuning even expertise may be insufficient 27 33 to handle the difficulties of manually searching automatic searching alternatives take place in the literature grid search and random search algorithms can be considered in this topic nevertheless there are still problems remaining in both methods such as the curse of dimensionality and unavailability of the highly efficient performance with the time-consuming operations 27 34tuning of hyperparameters is such an optimization problem that the objective function of it is latent and unknown in other words it is a black-box function as its name suggests stemming from the bayesian theorem the bayesian optimization is an efficient algorithm dealing with such kind of optimization problem 27 35 bayesian optimization relies on a typical kind of approximation dealing with an unknown function requires an approximation with the help of some known samples ie prior knowledge it is like the concept of the posteriori probability here the food of the algorithm is observations generated by the model evaluations in which the outputs of the online learning this means that in bayesian optimization we need a training process during the training the model will trace a function that we only have its knowledge from the learned data in the center of the bayesian optimization algorithm the main purpose is to obtain the related hyperparameters that make learning outline maximum 36 in mathematical expression we can consider a global maximization or minimization problem of the black box unknown functionf2xargmaxxxfx
here x stands for a searching space ofx caused by the nature of the bayes theorem 35 bayesian optimization calculates the posteriori probability pdl of a model d with the aid of the learned data l posteriori probability is proportional to the likelihood pld of observations l and the multiplication of the prior probabilitypd3pdlpldpd
equation 3 reflects the main behavior of the bayesian optimization 27 in brief bayesian optimization searches for the best model amid many of them at this point one can recall the cross  validation method however it is very hard to find the best model in many samples of pre-listed hundreds of alternatives thus bayesian optimization accelerates the operation by reducing the computational cost and we do not need expertise to guess the outputs though 37 the algorithm combines the prior distribution of thefxfunction with the samples of the prior knowledge to obtain the posteriors those posteriors calculate the value which describes the maximization point of thefx herein the criterion of the maximization process is the expression called acquisition function we introduce a pseudo-code format of bayesian optimization via algorithm 1 table in the algorithm n1i-1xnynn1i-1 reflects the training dataset which includes i-1 observations of the ffunctionin the flow we can clarify the two basic parts of the algorithm 1 it updates the posterior distribution and 2 it maximizes the acquisition function bayesian optimization process continues repeatedly until the defined maximum iteration value is reached alternatively it can also be quitted when it catches a threshold value which is the difference between the actual value and the obtained optimal value 27 36in the proposed deep bayes-squeezenet model the most important hyperparameter of the deep network design called initial learning rate is optimized beside the l2-regularization and the momentum values we also provide a validation dataset to be able to track the validation error object function in the online training please find the experiment details of the bayesian optimization in section 3as declared before the general detection method for covid-19 disease is the rt-pcr testing that identifies sars-cov-2 rna from sputum or nasopharyngeal swab however rt-pcr testing has a long time complex process and it is very troublesome 6 another detection method is chest radiography imaging due to the abnormalities in chest x-ray images of patients infected with covid-19 2 11 therefore we have selected a distinctive and public dataset including chest x-ray images to respond to the need for a rapid disease diagnosis system 11 in order to compose a special covid-19 dataset two different publicly available datasets were combined as covid chest x-ray dataset 12 and kaggle chest x-ray pneumonia dataset 38 the obtained covidx dataset 11 consists of a total of 5949 posteroanterior chest radiography images for 2839 patient cases the dataset includes 1583 normal 4290 pneumonia and 76 covid-19 infection cases in the pneumonia samples diseases were caused by none-covid-19 viral and bacterial effects considering the number of cases there are a total of 1203 uninfected normal patients 1591 pneumonia cases with none-covid-19 and 45 covid-19 patient cases the dataset includes three classes and figure 4
shows a batch of images that are randomly selected from class samples the images are transformed to rgb with 8-bit depth and have variable pixel-based resolution valuesthe main purpose of the selection of covidx dataset is that it is public available so it is accessible for researchers and to be extensible therefore further studies based on this database may be more helpful in the diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 casesin the classification process of both classical machine learning and deep learning algorithms the imbalance ratio of the class distribution of the dataset has a huge impact on the performances of the models in the study 39 the authors conduct systematic research on how imbalance data affects the classification performance of cnn the findings of the study point out a detrimental effect of the imbalanced class distribution on classification performance in our dataset there are very few covid-19 class images compared to the other classes to overcome this unfavorable situation we perform a detailed offline augmentation over the covid-19 class images in our dataset firstly we obtain the mirrored version of the original images by flipping each image then the listed augmentation technics are applied to both original and flipped images1
noise adding gaussian noise to images2
shear shearing the images in affine form3
brightness decrease decreasing the brightness of the images by subtracting 30 from every pixel4
brightness increase increasing the brightness of the images by adding 30 to every pixel
as figure 5
describes we obtain twelve different images from a single image with the aid of the augmentation techniques and their combinations the same operations depicted in figure 5 are also implemented to the flipped images which are the mirrored versions of the original images at the end of the day we gain twenty-four different images for a single image thus the number of images in the covid-19 class is augmented offline in the pre-processing of the dataset resulting in an acceptable amount figure 6
shows a sample image both in original and flipped mirrored versionin order to evaluate the quantitative performance of the proposed method such evaluation metrics accuracy acc correctness cor completeness com specificity spe f1 score and matthew correlation coefficient mcc are statistically computed from the confusion matrix acc measures the classification performance cor gives the rate of the truly classified x-ray images among the classes while com defines the truly detected negative images spe represents the correctly classified the rate of opposite disease classes f1 is a harmonic average and gives the combination of cor and com mcc measures the quality of the classification performance according to the confusion matrix the selected evaluation metrics are defined as4accntpntnntpnfpntnnfn

here ntpntnnfpnfn define the number of correctly classified diseases number of correctly classified opposite classes number of incorrectly classified diseases and number of the misclassified diseases respectively the classification procedure proves and determines the robustness effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method using the aforementioned evaluation metricsin the experimental setup firstly we perform an offline augmentation to the raw covidx dataset after the pre-processing the augmented dataset is divided into three packages as training validation and testing sets the triple split of the dataset packages is formed as 80 for training 10 for validation and 10 for testing training and validation datasets are designed for the bayesian optimization-based online learning structure as because of the bayesian contribution of our model it needs a validation result to minimize the objective function error after the bayesian optimization-based online training process we reach the best network model to implement the testing phase with a separate test dataset the obtained best model is evaluated all the input images are resized to 227227 pixel size and transformed to rgb with 8-bit depth in the meantime all the dataset packages are shuffled to overcome the negative effect of the overfitting thus we reach a robust decision-making performance for the classification of the infected patient cases in the training process mini-batch size is given as 32 and all images are normalized with the mean subtracting operation
table 2
shows the class distribution of the raw and augmented dataset in the pre-processing we achieve 1536 images after the augmentation of covid-19 class since other classes have sufficient images each we perform the augmentation to just covid class we also provide a balanced dataset fixing the all class image numbers to 1536 samples to gain a robust training performance of the model briefly our offline augmentation model enhances the covid class approximately 20 times in our proposed model we improve the existing dataset by increasing the covid class imagesproposed deep bayes-squeezenet includes the bayesian optimization in the training stage with validation process the objective function of the optimization process is given in figure 7
 it can be seen that function evaluation ends with 35 iterations because of the model saturation at the end of the 10th iteration the minimum observed objective is achieved to construct the best modelthe optimized parameters ie initial learning rate initiallearnrate momentum and l2 regularization are listed in table 3
along with iterations model result run time and observed - estimation values of the objective function during the optimization process it is clearly seen that after catching five different best models bayesian optimization points out the model of the 10th iteration as selected best model after the training process the obtained best model parameters are used in the proposed deep bayes-squeezenet network and highlighted in table 3in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our augmentation improvement we first present the raw dataset results here our aim is to prove the negative effect of the imbalance distributions in the raw dataset over the performance it should be noted that we tune the squeezenet with the best model parameters for a regular training process the re-training and testing processes are performed with the train and test packages of the related dataset please see table 2 figure 8
demonstrates the confusion matrix of the test process of the re-trained squeezenet in the confusion matrix presentation accuracies and errors of each row and columns are given as the percentage value in the lower and right cells respectively the accuracy rates of each column show us the correctness value of each class and the accuracy values for each row state the single accuracy values of the classesas shown in figure 8 the false classification rate appears majorly within normal and pneumonia pneumonia class achieves nearly the perfect classification whereas covid class has 70 accuracy within 10 test samples in the normal class distribution 141 samples are misclassified as pneumonia this situation shows the negative effect of the imbalanced distribution of the dominant pneumonia classin table 4
 we can see the detailed classification results of the squeezenet for the raw dataset the obtained results show that normal class has the lower values of acc com and f1 as 3889 3889 and 5583 respectively the model with the raw dataset just reaches the 7637 overall accuracy and 7000 single accuracy value of the covid class while the highest accuracy is presented by pneumonia class the lower values of mcc and spe in pneumonia point out poor classification performancethe second phase of our experiments is performing the augmented dataset testing process in this phase the proposed deep bayes-squeezenet model which is obtained by the bayesian optimization approach is validated with the separate test dataset it should be noted that the obtained best model is trained with the augmented dataset to overcome the above-mentioned imbalance effects as well as achieving a rapid system for covid-19 diagnosis with a robust and sustainable structure figure 9
presents the confusion matrix of the test phase here we can see a tremendous performance boosting on all classes and overall accuracy the deep bayes-squeezenet model catches all the covid samples in the x-rays perfectly there are just eight misclassified samples among 459 test samples the error rate of the normal class is 2 while it is 33 in pneumonia in addition the most misclassification rate is presented by pneumoniawe can interpret the detailed test results from table 5
 in the decision-making system covid class reaches the perfect classification rate as showing the 100 test accuracy and completeness values f1 and mcc values also prove that it is obtained a stable classification the overall accuracy is 9826 with a com of 9826 it draws a picture that our model is well-trained and robust although pneumonia accuracy decreases to 9673 compared to former experiments all other performance criteria of the related class are boosted and exhibit an effective prediction the classification performance of the normal class is visibly enhanced and it reaches to 9804 acc valuein order to analyze the performance comparison between the experiments of the raw dataset and the augmented one we report the increase rates of the performance values as in figure 10
 the sharp bounce is experienced in the normal class by a boosting of 25 times as it is the focus of our model when we concentrate on the performance of the covid then we detect 25 times boosting in pneumonia class there is a decreasing percentage of 206 considering just the accuracy value the overall accuracy rate has also a performance increasing at the rate of 2866 the overall accuracy rate has also a performance increase at a rate of 2866for a detailed visual analysis we provide a class activation mapping images as shown in figure 11
 class activation mapping is a way of generating visual explanations of the predictions of deep learning models misclassified or unreasonable predictions sometimes can rely on reasonable explanations by the aid of the class activation mapping we can investigate useful knowledge of the prediction regions activation mapping also defines the bias regions in the training images the first column of figure 11 defines the original input images while the second column includes the heat map images of the predicted samples when all the class activation mappings are examined in figure 11 a  c the probability values of the predictions are nearly 100 according to the heat maps of the images the trained network distinguishes the classes with an acceptable feature mapping to form an outlier example figure 11 d presents a misclassified class sample ie normal class is confused with pneumonia the probability values are 025 and 074 for normal and pneumonia respectivelyfig 12
the proposed deep bayes-squeezenet with its low model size is easy to implement in hardware deployments as shown in table 6
 the model size of the proposed network is less than 7731 times lower compared to the alexnet which is the inspiration of the squeezenet architecturethe overall experimental results show that proposed model has a significant and robust performance value over the covid-19 patient cases this study proposes a complete and compact solution using the chest x-ray images for rapid diagnosisthe coronavirus disease 2019 was announced as an outbreak by who on february 11 2020 1 due to the covid-19 outbreak the early diagnosis of this disease has become a key topic for clinicians and radiologists in the world the ai techniques regarding the image classification approaches can help in early diagnose of the disease considering ai cnn methods achieve better and faster results compared to the traditional diagnosis methods in this paper a rapid robust and efficient covid-19 diagnosis method which is namely deep bayes-squeezenet is proposed the proposed method performs the x-ray images into multiclass as normal pneumonia and covid in order to evaluate the proposed cnn model the general performance comparison of our study with the state-of-art methods is given in this section in the model evaluations the related studies depend on the multiclass classification of the chest x-ray images with various ai techniques table 7
shows the comparison results with the related studies uses the same or similar datasetsli and zhu 16 propose a densenet based covid-xpert architecture classifying the three-class chest x-ray images they use transfer learning and obtain an overall accuracy of 0889 wang and wong 11 present covid-net design to the diagnosis of the covid-19 and in their study the main model is based on the tailored cnn machine-driven design is used to improve the model architecture the overall accuracy com and cor metrics of 11 can be listed as 0923 0887 and 0913 respectively the authors also share and collect the covidx dataset used in our study afshar et al 17 introduce a deep learning model based on a capsule network using a four-class dataset their model produces a 0957 overall accuracy farooq and hafeez 18 present a resnet based framework in a four-class dataset with augmentation the model accuracy has remained as 0962 chowdhury et al 19 explain a bundle structure that includes various deep learning models using four different chest x-ray datasets amid the performance metrics that table 8
gives our model outperforms similar studies that use chest x-rays in the diagnosis of the covid-19 although it seems that some of the performance values have been achieved the same with the study 19 the whole performance of the proposed method in our study is better than itin table 8 the performance values of the listed studies are given in terms of covid-19 class accuracy while chowdhury et al 19 have the same overall accuracy with our study the covid-19 class accuracy stays behind the proposed method farooq and hafeez 18 obtain the same accuracy of covid-19 class but our study outperforms it in the overall accuracy in addition the test dataset of the study includes just eight samples of covid-19to the best of our knowledge the proposed model reveals the excellent classification performance for the covid-19 diagnosis with chest x-rays the proposed model has a great advantage of owning a practical network architecture with a robust and stable operation with its nature of including fewer parameters our network is more favorable for embedded systems among existing deep learning modelsa rapid diagnosis method has a key role in the control of infectious diseases and pandemic situations like the up to date covid-19 some limitations of the rt-pcr nucleic acid-based test modules reveal a need for fast alternative methods to be able to serve the front-line experts to make them reach a quick and accurate diagnosis in this study we propose an ai-based decision-making system including the recognition of input x-ray images under the roof of a very practical deep learning model this study is an important attempt including an easy to implement deep learning model which has an accuracy performance of 983 among normal pneumonia and covid cases and 100 for the single recognition of covid-19 among other classes in these difficult days of the global covid-19 pandemic our model has a strong potential to build a tool design for covid-19 monitoring we would like to note that that the rt-pcr test method to detect the sars-cov-2 is still important however it is proved that there are also undeniable shortcomings along with the rt-pcr test method which can be listed as follows 1 its possible methodology lacks 2 strict dependence on the level of the disease timing 3 the possibility for collecting the specimens in mistaken localizations and 4 its response time delay 6 7 in our model working with a deep learning-based practical structure the early stage detections of the covid-19 cases could be done to manage and control the pandemic disease in medical image processing while deep learning methods are preferred in many areas it is becoming more and more important especially in the interpretation of radiological images as such our model which is extremely satisfactory even with its initial results opens the door for the implementation of a comprehensive product that can work mobile and appeal to the end-userbackbone of our model is the deep bayes-squeezenet decision-making system for the covid-19 diagnosis from x-ray images squeezenet with much less model size is a state-of-the-art deep learning model which is inspired by the well-known alexnet with its practical structure and generalization performance the squeezenet is preferable in the embedded applications we improve the squeezenet structure with bayes optimization algorithm to build a robust and sustainable learning model bayesian optimization helps us to build a best-performed model with a validation dataset the diagnosis system is trained using the public dataset proposed in 11 with its augmented form a separate test which is independent of train and validation sets performs the experiments our experimental results also present the performance boosting of the augmentation contribution to the dataset pre-processing thus model training can be performed with a rich image set of x-rays of covid-19 after comprehensive literature research the up to date studies which use the same or similar public datasets are detected and we evaluate our model with those the proposed diagnosis model for covid-19 using the x-ray images the deep bayes-squeezenet outperforms its competitors we believe that with increased training dataset it is expected to get higher resultsin further works we aim to plan our model to be able to work mobile appealing to the health care experts for diagnosis of the covid-19 in addition the possibility of presenting this diagnostic system as a solution for other medical image processing cases will also be exploredthe authors declare

 the world health organization who announced a new name for the disease coronavirus disease covid19 by 31 march 2020 more than 700 000 covid19 cases were confirmed in over 100 countries and regions to date the rapid spread of sarscov2 has caused considerable harm to public health and the economy

 clinical manifestations of covid19 include fever dry cough and fatigue approximately half of the infected patients developed severe pneumonia and nearly onethird of the patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome

 however there is currently no specific treatment for covid19 due to the obstacle of collecting highquality throat swab samples in different stages of infection nucleic acid test for sarscov2 showed high false negative rate it is difficult to identify and quarantine the infected individuals to effectively break the spread chain and curb the infection therefore it is of urgent need to develop a more sensitive diagnostic method that can rapidly identify sarscov2 infected patients with high accuracycurrently the viral nucleic acid realtime polymerase chain reaction rtpcr test based on patient nasopharyngeal and throat swabs is the standard method for clinical diagnosis of covid19 despite its crucial role in identifying sarscov2 infection in patients at the start of the epidemic the limitations of this method soon became obvious for example one recent study demonstrated that rtpcr only showed a positive test rate of 38 in a total of 4880 specimens with a significant number of false negative cases

 it is accepted that igm is the early immunoglobulin in response to the virus invasion and igg has the highest opsonization and neutralization activities in humoral immune response previous studies have reported that igmigg seroconversion can start as early as 4 days after the onset of sars infection

 li et al

 has developed a rapid pointof carelateral flow immunoassay that can detect igm and igg levels within 15 minutes for the rapid screening of sarscov2 infection at different stages therefore testing for antibodies specific to sarscov2 protein in patient serum samples might be an alternative method for rapid and highly sensitive laboratory diagnosispresently there are relatively few reports on covid19 patient diagnoses through serological tests here we retrospectively describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 56 patients with covid19 diagnosed using igmigg antibody tests all patients were admitted to unit z6 in the cancer center of wuhan union hospital this study may provide a reference for clinical profiles of patients with covid19 confirmed using antibody detectionin this study 56 patients were enrolled from unit z6 at the cancer center of wuhan union hospital between 15 and 25 february 2020 most patients were admitted to the hospital due to fever or respiratory symptoms nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were used for respiratory pathogen testing serum levels of igmigg antibodies targeting sarscov2 were tested upon patient admission medical history about when the clinical symptoms appeared was asked and the time interval between clinical symptoms and antibody testing was recorded in detail physical findings and hematological and biochemical results were also collected all patients enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to the 5th edition of the guideline on diagnosis and treatment of covid19 established by chinas national health commission

hyperlipidemia 1 179 hyperuricemia 1 179 multiple myeloma 1 179 and chronic hepatitis b virus infection 1 179 the most common symptoms at onset were fever 42 75 cough 23 4107 and chest tightness 20 3571 less common symptoms were fatigue 16 2857 abdominal distension and diarrhea 9 1607 sore throat 7 125 muscle soreness 4 714 and chills 3 536 table 2interestingly there were differences in laboratory findings between the groups with severe and nonsevere covid19 symptoms this included higher neutrophil counts neutrophil percentage neu and fibrinogen level and lower lymphocyte counts and lymphocyte percentages lym p  05 figure 1 the median ddimer level was increased in the group with severe symptoms but the difference was not significant procalcitonin and hypersensitive creactive protein levels were in the normal range in the majority of patients table 3igmigg antibody levels in patients in the groups with severe and nonsevere symptoms during the same time period are shown in figure 2a igg maintains high levels after sarscov2 infection igm increased in 1 week and then started to decline 4 to 5 weeks after the onset of illness in contrast to the profiles of immune responses against acute virus infections a simultaneous or earlier igg response against sarscov2 compared with igm was observed igmigg levels between the two groups were further analyzed and significant differences were noted figure 2bc pearson correlation was used to explore the relationship between immune activation and sarscov2 infection igg levels showed no correlation with neu and lym in either group while igm levels showed a weak correlation with neu in patients in the severe group r  34 p  0468 suggesting that igm could be considered an indicator of severe inflammation during acute infection table 4 figure 2din this study we analyzed the clinical features and immunological characteristics of 56 patients with covid19 despite negative nucleic acid test results all patients showed high specific igg concentrations suggesting sarscov2 infection of the 56 patients over 50 developed severe illness and required intensive care common symptoms were fever cough and chest tightness

 compared with patients with nonsevere symptoms patients in the severe illness group had numerous laboratory abnormalities such as higher neutrophil counts neu fibrinogen levels lower lymphocyte counts and lower lym igm was lower while igg was higher in patients with severe symptoms in addition a weak correlation between igm and neu was noted these findings suggest that patients in the severe illness group might experience a longer virus exposure time and develop a more severe inflammatory responsecurrently the nucleic acid test based on individual nasopharyngeal and throat swabs is the standard diagnostic method for covid19 although the rtpcr method is sensitive and effective it still suffers from some limitations such as being laborintensive and timeconsuming furthermore the respiratory tract might not be the only route for sarscov2 transmission
13
 while nucleic acid testing of pharyngeal swabs suggest negative results whether subjects carry the virus in other organs such as the intestine remains unclear thus rapid lowcost and universal detection methods for sarscov2 are needed our study showed that the virusspecific antibody test had a significantly higher positive result rate than the nucleic acid test in addition to the self limitation of pcr test kits the timing for specimens collection and pcr detection also does great impact on pcr results in our study due to the urgency condition and limitation of pcr kits supply in wuhan most patients might miss the best chance for early sarscov2 screening specimens collected in the late stage of illness while viral copies may have declined below detectable limits which may lead to low positive rate for pcr and high titers of igm and igg furthermore this may be one of the possible explanations for a large proportion of severe cases in our studytwo consecutive negative results of the nucleic acid test in a 24hour interval are considered as clearance of covid19 however several reports showed that a small portion of such recovered patients tested positive for infection through the nucleic acid test again during a followup visit these results only indicate the presence of the sarscov2 virus in the patients not whether reinfection or recurrence has occurred one possible solution for this is to detect the titer of igg in these patients as the level of igg usually increases with reinfection of the same virusalthough the igmigg test is an important index for the diagnosis of covid19 limitations still exist the variation of the methodology and antigens used in the igm and igg antibody detection kits are essential for the testing sensitivity and specificity li et al
11
 reported the testing sensitivity as 8866 and specificity as 9063 in the igmigg combined antibody testing kits by using receptor binding domain of sarscov2 spike protein as the antigen another study suggested a very poor sensitivity of vivadiag covid19 igmigg rapid test which could not be recommended for diagnosis of covid19

 considering the kits used in our study the e protein functions to assemble the virions and n protein is the most conserved and stable protein among the cov structural proteins however false positives might appear if crossreactivity with other coronaviruses occurs hence more studies with larger sample sizes and controls are needed to further verify the specificity and accuracy of this test in summary the combination of nucleic acid testing and the igmigg antibody test is the optimal method for diagnosing sarscov2 infectionall the authors declare that there are no conflict of interestshh and yg secured the funding for this study designed the study participated in data analysis and extensively reviewed the manuscript jx and cd analyzed the data and drafted the manuscript other authors contributed to clinical and laboratory data acquisition and reviewed the manuscripton 30 january 2020 the world health organization who declared sars-cov-2 as a global public health emergency 1 covid-19 originated from wuhan province in china has led to bans on travel and public gatherings and has negatively impacted the world economy 23 covid-19 is characterized with high morbidity and low mortality therefore representing great threat particularly to immunocompromised elderly people and individuals with pre-existing health problems the data so far suggest that the virus has a case fatality rate of around 1 4 it is thus several times more severe than typical seasonal influenza with a severity falling somewhere between the 1957 06 and 1918 2 influenza pandemics 4 but it appears to be lower than sars 95 and middle east respiratory syndrome 344 5in addition the average person infected with covid-19 spreads the disease efficiently to two or three others an exponential rate of increase there is also strong evidence that the virus can be transmitted by infected individuals that are asymptomatic or experiencing mild symptoms 6 this in turns complicates containment or disease control measures compared to diseases caused by other coronaviruses like middle east respiratory syndrome mers-cov or severe acute respiratory syndrome sars-cov thus far covid-19 has caused approximately ten times as many cases as sars-cov in a quarter of the time 7 unlike mers-cov camel as intermediate carrier and sars-cov civet cat as intermediate carrier the source of covid-19 remains unknown according to who 89 but recent studies suggested intermediate carriers could be snakes 9 or pangolins 10 and bats are speculated to be the reservoir host 11the median incubation period of covid-19 is four days range 024 days and the longest incubation period observed is 24 days 12 particularly some covid-19 infected individuals do not develop obvious clinical symptoms 1314 the long incubation period and asymptomatic infections imply a huge risk of community transmission of sars-cov-2 1516 rapid point of care tests is required to detect the virus in suspected cases at community clinics hospitals and possibly for househouse testingamong the measures for stopping the spread of covid-19 is the availability of reliable and aggressive testing presently samples collected from suspected cases presenting at community clinics and hospitals are being processed at a centralized clinical laboratory where expensive pcr equipment and technical expertise are available the turnaround time of the results can be up to 72 h such delays in turnaround time could lead to anxiety and the continued spread of the virus since self-isolation is not absolutely assured after testing with standard real-time rt-pcr at a centralized clinical laboratory 17 however a point of care covid-19 test can help reduce anxiety eliminate prolonged turnaround time and reduce the spread of the virus a point of care device that is rapid robust and cost-effective can be used onsite and in the field and does not necessarily require trained personnel to operate 18 is crucial and urgently needed for the detection of sars-cov-2 the importance of testing to reduce the spread of an outbreak like covid-19 has been shown to dramatically control infectious diseases 192021 figure 1since the outbreak of covid-19 regulatory bodies like us food drug administration fda has fast-tracked covid-19 diagnostics including isothermal amplification technology platform like nicking enzyme-assisted reaction near as emergency use authorization this has led to increased uptake of covid-19 diagnostics from commercial companies research institutions and in-house development of the tests by clinical laboratories and these tests are largely based on pcr technology however this technology is not completely amenable to onsite or field conditions in addition the introduction of rapid immunoassay coupled on lateral flow strip as point of care test has been developed this test can detect either sars-cov-2 antigens or antibodies like igm and igg developed against the virus while this testing method has the advantage of absolutely reducing the turnaround time to less than 10 min and highly cost effective but are likely to be less sensitive and specific based on the experience with influenza viruses rapid immunoassay 2324252627an alternative and comparable technology to pcr is required to enable a timely detection of sars-cov-2 this technology should also be comparable to rapid immunoassay regarding providing point of care testing in less than 30 min and cost effective this review provides a brief description of common isothermal technologies loop-mediated amplification and recombinase polymerase amplification that could be potentially deployed as point of care tests at community clinics and hospitals these technologies have been proven to have the potential to replace pcr especially in resource limited settings that is characterized with inadequate expertise and infrastructure for pcr setup there are limited publications on the application of isothermal technologies for testing covid-19 only few studies have demonstrated its comparability with pcrthe lamp reaction mechanism simply involves nucleic acids unwinding amplification and elongation this approach has been described in an animation by eiken chemical httploopampeikencojpelampanimhtml which is really helpful in understanding how the principle works essentially lamp uses a bst dna polymerase with strand-displacement activity coupled with two inner primers fip bip and outer primers f3 b3 that recognizes six separate regions on a dna template additional loop primers lf lb may be added to speed up the reaction by binding to and amplifying newly formed loop amplicons in the reaction these additional primers further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the reaction figure 2 lamp reactions are incubated at a constant temperature ranging from 6065 c with time to amplification that is a positive lamp result in less than 60 min 39 lamp and near are also compatible for the detectionamplification of rna templates directly with bst 3 dna polymerase new england biolabs melbourne australia or with a reverse transcriptase in the reaction 48a lamp positive reaction can be determined visually and quantified based on turbidity colorimetry and fluorimetry the insoluble byproduct magnesium pyrophosphate which is formed during the lamp reaction can be seen with the naked eye cloudiness figure 3a 34 recently this endpoint detection was improved by using calcein a fluorescein complex which fluoresces visible color change in the presence of magnesium pyrophosphate figure 3b 3450 nucleic acid intercalating dyes including sybr green can be added to detect visible color change and quantify the loop amplicons formed this detection system allows real-time monitoring of the reaction using isothermal equipment equipped with fluorescence detectors this commercial equipment has been optimized and is highly adaptable across a wide range of iat including near lamp and rpa figure 3cthere is paucity in the literature on the application of iat for covid-19 diagnosis the studies so far showed that one-step rt-lamp test is comparable with rt-qpcr lin yu et al 29 showed rt-lamp test could detect synthesized rna equivalent to 10 copies of sars-cov-2 virus and the clinical sensitivity was 976 4243 with samples validated by rt-qpcr their test targeted orf1ab region of the virus and it could be performed between 2040 min while renfei lu et al 30 targeted rdrp gene and showed limit of detection as 3 copies of synthesized sars-cov rna and 100 sensitivity 1717 as determined by rt-qpcr in 40 min in addition their test did not cross react with 15 clinical samples that were positive for respiratory viruses like enterovirus respiratory syncytial virus a and b groups parainfluenza viruses type 13 influenza ac human rhinovirus human metapneumovirus adenovirus bocavirus and human coronavirus strains unlike other studies laura lamb et al 31 detected 102 fg of sars-cov-2 fragments and used simulated patient samples by spiking saliva urine serum oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs with fragments of synthetic sars-cov-2 without extractions their reaction test time was less than 30 min and it was highly specific as it does not cross react with mers beta-coronavirus england-1 or murine hepatitis virus when spiked into patient samplesthe amplification of nucleic acids using rpa is faster than lamp at 37 c or less 51 rpa employs recombinase proteins that forms a complex with primers that scan for homologous sequences and unwind double stranded template figure 4 2843 the amplified products can either be monitored in real time or sandwiched on a lateral flow strip and the two commonly used detection systems are possible with unique probes which are the same in design except for internal modifications figure 5 28 usually the test design by the diagnostic developer determines the choice of probe the exo probe is used for real-time monitoring while nfo is suitable for lateral flow strip the recombinase proteins and monitoring devices including lateral flow strips are commercially available from companies like twistdx cambridge uk hence the developer only needs to design and screen primers and probe that targets pathogen of choice interestingly pcr primers could also be adopted for rpa assay development unlike lamp primers to date no study has been demonstrated using this technology for covid-19 diagnosis but rpa has been deployed during the last ebola virus outbreak that was declared as a global public health epidemic by who 52near is driven by two enzymes nicking endonuclease and dna polymerase and with reaction buffer deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate and primers a linear amplification of dna template is achieved this amplification eventually leads to exponential increase of amplified products 53 and it can be coupled on a fluorometer briefly near reaction occurs at 60 c and it involves five steps a the dna template is hybridized with primers that are conjugated with nicking endonucleases restriction site cleaving the double stranded dna b from the 3 end of the primer dna polymerase extends nucleotides forming a double stranded dna c nicking endonucleases identifies the restriction site on the primers and nicked one of the strands exposing the 3end d dna polymerase extends from the nicked site by employing uncleaved strand as a template for a new double stranded dna displacing the former strand for another cycle of dna synthesis but restriction site is recovered on the newly synthesized double stranded dna e these steps continuously amplified targeted dna template via cleavage extension and recovery figure 6normally respiratory samples collected as either nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs in viral transport medium are processed in class ii or iii biologic safety cabinet 56 this level of containment is not feasible at community clinics and hospital collecting the swab samples directly into lysis buffer containing inactivating agent like guanidinium and non-denaturing detergent would be suitable for direct testing with iat like lamp the guanidinium and detergents are able to inactivate any viable coronavirus and prevent rna degradation respectively 575859 combined with personal protective equipment latex hand gloves laboratory coat appropriate face mask and eye goggle makes sars-cov-2 iat testing safe for non-laboratory personnel at clinics and hospitalslamp has already been shown to possess the ability to withstand inhibitory substances present in cell-based clinical samples and it was associated to its complex primer assembly on the dna or its complementary strand 39 unlike lamp rpa is yet to demonstrate direct detection of target from clinical samples this means that rpa could probably be inhibited with cell-based samples respiratory samples for covid-19 are free of cells suggesting rpa potential to directly test this type of sample for example rpa has been demonstrated to directly test urine samples for chlamydia trachomatis 60 however heating of the respiratory samples should be avoided to prevent rna degradation which could impact on the outcome of the iat test outcomepresently at least two different targets of sars-cov-2 are required for confirmation of covid-19 this is to avoid cross reaction with other potential endemic coronaviruses and genetic drift of sars-cov-2 56 these targets could be envelope e helicase hel transmembrane m structural proteins envelope glycoproteins spike s and nucleocapsid n 616263 or species-specific accessory genes that are required for viral replication rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp hemagglutinin-esterase he and open reading frames orf1a and orf1b 1417616264 studies on sars-cov-2 are still evolving and the extent of the virus mutations is still not clear notwithstanding an ideal nucleic acid test design should include at least one conserved region and one specific region in order to mitigate against the effects of sars-cov-2 genetic drift as the virus evolves within new populations 63 the us centers for disease control recommends two nucleocapsid protein targets n1 and n2 64 while who recommends first line screening with the e gene test followed by a confirmatory test using the rdrp gene 17 for iat to be cost-effective and efficient a multiplex test targeting two genes will be appropriate for clinical decision to date the published rt-lamp tests did not evaluate sars-cov-2 using two target genes however these rt-lamp studies and commercialization of iat are urgently required to help prevent the spread of the virus at community level there is high expectation from diagnostic developers that iat hold promise to reduce the spread of covid-19 at resource limited settings where central laboratories are far away from the transmission of the diseaselamp near and rpa do have potentials for their simplicity sensitivity specificity and quick result as demonstrated by incorporation with other technologies like lateral flow strip and portable detection reader these iat shows their ability to be easily amenable to different detection platforms notwithstanding clinical evaluation are expected for multiplexing of the targeted genes in order to further assess the capability of iat to confirm the diagnosis of covid-19 like pcr only a pair of primer is required for rpa reaction making the assay design relatively easy however the multiplexing ability is yet to be fully explored notwithstanding rpa has been used to multiplex food pathogens like staphylococcus aureus vibrio parahaemolyticus and salmonella enteritidis coupled on a lateral flow strip and the test line intensities were quantified using a test strip reader 65 it will be useful to see this recent strategy deployed for sars-cov-2 multiplexing as wellcurrently there is urgent demand for tests that could confirmed cases of covid-19 and not just for screening so it will be helpful to know the extent of contribution of lamp near and rpa in this regard however lamp has been used to multiplexed influenza a and b 66 with genie ii fluorometer as the detection platform figure 3c this device shows amplification signals and time to completion of reaction in real time sample melting temperature tm is also shown on the device mahony james et al 66 employed the tm strategy in the differentiation of influenza a and b and it was easily differentiated because the tm did not overlap this strategy could be deployed for sars-cov-2 multiplexing as well but it will require a technical training for point of care testers without a background in nucleic acid testingthe advantage of real-time rt-pcr testing is the amplification and analysis are done simultaneously in a closed system to reduce false-positive results commonly linked with amplicons and the capacity of the test to process up to 96 samples at once among all the nucleic acids tests the integration of sample preparation amplification and detection into a single platform has been a challenge especially with sample preparation 67 as a result sample preparation is still processed in isolation of amplification and detection by most test applications interestingly rt-lamp could directly be performed on clinical samples without rna extractions and this has been demonstrated with the published covid-19 rt-lamp studies 293031 but the throughput is 16 samples if gene ii fluorometer is used for amplification and detection which could slow the testing process considering the high demand for covid-19 test at point of carein addition the inclusion of a thermolabile uracil-dna glycosylase ung in lamp reactions could help prevent cross-contamination between samples as already demonstrated by laura lamb et al 31 this approach simply works by introducing uridine triphosphate utp in the reaction along with thymidine triphosphate ttp and the other nucleoside triphosphates during amplification few utp replaces ttp creating a mix of utp and ttp amplicons the utp amplified products are cleaved by ung to prevent it from being re-amplified in the next cycle the introduction of ung in isothermal reactions especially when coupled with lateral flow strips makes the system suitable for point of care where non-laboratory staff may not be proficient enough to handle nucleic acid testingas the current covid-19 pandemic continues urgent point of care tests like the id now covid-19 abbott laboratories illinois il usa and comparable with the standard rt-pcr are needed lamp near and rpa have the potentials to reduce the spread of sars-cov-2 but diagnostic developers scientific community and commercial companies are required to make contributions in this regard importantly our review is

was last updated on 1 april 2020the primary goal of epidemic containment is to reduce disease transmission by reducing the number of susceptible persons in the population or by reducing the basic reproductive number r0 this number is modulated by such factors as the duration of viral shedding the infectiousness of the organism and the contact matrix between infected and susceptible persons 18 given the lack of effective vaccines or treatments 19 the only currently available lever to reduce sarscov-2 transmission is to identify and isolate persons who are contagiousdeployment of sarscov-2 testing has varied widely across the globe a few asian countries have illustrated the power of preparedness flexible isolation systems and intensive case finding south korea dramatically slowed the epidemic by implementing an unprecedented testing effort 20 using innovative measures south korea performed more than 300 000 tests 58286 tests per million persons in the 9 weeks after the first case was identified 20 21 singapore used a broad case definition aggressive contact tracing and isolation 10 moreover to identify infected persons not meeting the case definition singapore screened patients with pneumonia and influenza-like illnesses in hospitals and primary care settings severely ill patients in intensive care and deaths with a possible
infectious cause 10 taiwan and hong kong used similar approaches 22 these countries rapidly deployed resource-intensive strategies that prioritized aggressive testing and isolation to interrupt transmission 20 22in the face of widespread transmission the role of diagnostic testing is contingent on the type of testing available the resources required for testing and time to obtain results for example rapidly identifying cases among hospitalized patients remains a high priority to properly allocate personal protective equipment and to prevent nosocomial spread with subsequent community transmission 23 24 likewise specific treatment decisions and enrollment in ongoing clinical trials require prompt diagnosisdespite the remarkable speed with which accurate diagnostic tests have been developed and made available for sarscov-2 25 current tools only partially meet several clinically relevant needs figure 1 illustrates different indications for diagnostic testing among persons with proven or suspected covid-19 for each of these the most important consideration is the clinical decision a test result will help to inform test designs must account for several parameters such as whether the test detects infection directly such as the virus itself or indirectly such as host antibodies test turnaround time the ability to perform many tests at the same time that is throughput the need to have a minimum number of specimens before testing that is batching and the ability to perform the test in low-infrastructure settings such as on cruise ships or in remote communities the
potential for use at the point of care depends on test complexity the us food and drug administration fda categorizes diagnostic tests by their complexity waived tests are available for use at the point of care whereas moderate- and high-complexity tests must be performed in a laboratory the intended use also determines which specimen types are ideal or feasible finally it is important to recognize that the acceptable diagnostic accuracy of a test may vary according to use case for example sensitivity and specificity requirements of an assay used to confirm results of a screening test need not be as stringent as those of a method used for standalone diagnosis because the pool of persons being tested is already enriched with true infections the foundation for innovative new diagnostics has published a detailed assessment of priority use cases to be considered by test developers and policymakers 26in response to the rapidly evolving covid-19 pandemic countries have used different testing approaches depending on testing capacity public health resources and the spread of the virus in the community in the united states diagnostic testing indications and capacity were limited at the beginning of the outbreak largely because of regulatory hurdles for the use of new tests to expand access to testing the fda released policies to allow laboratories to use their validated assays in a more timely manner 27 on 4 march the centers for disease control and prevention cdc removed restrictive testing criteria recommending that clinicians use their judgment to determine whether a test should be performed 28 because testing capacity remains suboptimal 27 the implementation of this recommendation remains a challenge the cdc still
recommends priority for testing 3 groups hospitalized patients with presentations compatible with covid-19 other symptomatic persons at risk for poor outcomes and persons who had close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed covid-19 within 14 days of illness onset or have a history of travel in an affected area 28 these patients should be evaluated with a molecular diagnostic test as described later the cdc does not recommend testing asymptomatic personsthe current diagnostic strategy recommended by the cdc to identify patients with covid-19 is to test samples taken from the respiratory tract to assess for the presence of 1 or several nucleic acid targets specific to sarscov-2 25 a nasopharyngeal specimen is the preferred choice for swab-based sarscov-2 testing but oropharyngeal mid-turbinate or anterior nares samples also are acceptable 31 32 samples should be obtained by using a flocked swab if available to enhance the collection and release of cellular material swabs with an aluminum or plastic shaft are preferred swabs that contain calcium alginate wood or cotton should be avoided because they may contain substances that inhibit pcr testing ideally swabs should be transferred into universal transport medium immediately after sample collection to
preserve viral nucleic acid samples taken from sputum endotracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage also may be sent directly to the microbiology laboratory for processing and may have greater sensitivity than upper respiratory tract specimens 33 inadequate sample collection may result in a false-negative test after specimen collection samples undergo rna extraction followed by qualitative rt-pcr for target detectionin the united states the cdc has developed the most widely used sarscov-2 assay the kit contains pcr primerprobe sets for 2 regions of the viral nucleocapsid gene n1 and n2 and for the human rnase p gene to ensure the rna extraction was successful this assay differs from the world health organization primerprobe sets which target the sarscov-2 rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp and envelope e genes 25 both assays have high analytic sensitivity and specificity for sarscov-2 with minimal cross-reactivity with other circulating strains of coronaviruses and both use a cycle threshold of less than 40 as the criterion for positivity the cdc kit may be used by state public health laboratories other laboratories determined by the state to be qualified and clinical laboratories that meet the regulatory requirements of the clinical
laboratories improvement amendment clia to perform high-complexity testing 27 dozens of laboratories have applied for emergency use authorization eua from the fda for their own laboratory-developed assays 34 the fda also has granted an eua for several commercial assays 35 further expanding the ability of clinical laboratories to use these platforms tablethe lack of an established reference standard use of differing sample collection and preparation methods and an incomplete understanding of viral dynamics across the time course of infection hamper rigorous assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of the many newly introduced sarscov-2 assays 36 serum and urine are usually negative for the presence of viral nucleic acid regardless of illness severity 33 of importance the ability of rt-pcr assays to rule out covid-19 on the basis of upper respiratory tract samples obtained at a single time point remains unclear conversely after a patient has had a positive test result several authorities have recommended obtaining at least 2 negative upper respiratory tract samples collected at intervals of 24 hours or longer to document sarscov-2 clearance 37 38low-complexity rapid results within 1 hour molecular diagnostic tests for respiratory viral infections that are clia waived fda approved for use outside the laboratory by nonlaboratory personnel include cartridge-based assays on platforms that include the abbott id now abbott laboratories biofire filmarray biomrieux cobas liat roche diagnostics and genexpert cepheid 39rapid point-of-care assays for sarscov-2 on instruments such as these will be critical to expand point-of-care testing the xpert xpress sarscov-2 test cepheid has received an fda eua and is performed on the genexpert platform which is already widely used for tuberculosis and hiv testing especially in low- and middle-income countries this capacity might be useful to scale up testing across the world as well as in settings where rapid results at the point of care would enable clinical decisions although testing throughput may be a limiting factortests that detect respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus antigens by immunoassay directly from clinical specimens have been commercially available for decades are of low complexity and may provide results within minutes at the point of care 40 current tools for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus suffer from suboptimal sensitivity to rule out disease 41 42 the same challenge would probably exist for sarscov-2 and tests would need to be implemented with clear guidance on correct interpretation prototypes of such tests for other novel coronaviruses have not received regulatory approval 43 44 but are under development 45 monoclonal antibodies against the nucleocapsid
protein of sarscov-2 have been generated which might form the basis of a future rapid antigen detection test 20serologic tests that identify antibodies such as iga igm and igg to sarscov-2 from clinical specimens such as blood or saliva such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays may be less complex than molecular tests and have the potential to be used for diagnosis in certain situations 46 however their utility for diagnosing acute infections is probably limited around the time of symptom onset when viral shedding and transmission risk seem to be highest 32 antibody responses to infection take days to weeks to be reliably detectable 46 negative results would not exclude sarscov-2 infection particularly among those with recent exposure to the virus cross-reactivity of antibody to nonsarscov-2 coronavirus proteins is also a potential problem whereby positive results may be the result of past or
present infection with other human coronaviruses 47 serologic assays might be more relevant in scenarios in which patients present to medical care with late complications of disease when rt-pcr may be falsely negative because viral shedding drops over time 48the development of serologic assays that accurately assess prior infection and immunity to sarscov-2 will be essential for epidemiologic studies ongoing surveillance vaccine studies and potentially for risk assessment of health care workers immunoassays are already on the market in some countries but their diagnostic accuracy and optimal use remain undefinedmany centers have evaluated the utility of chest imaging for diagnosis on chest radiography bilateral pneumonia is the most frequently reported feature range 118 to 100 and is more common than a unilateral focus 49 50 computed tomography is regarded as more sensitive than radiography with several cohort studies reporting that most patients 778 to 100 had ground glass opacities other features commonly reported with covid-19 on chest computed tomography include a peripheral distribution fine reticular opacities and vascular thickening 51 compared with serial nasopharyngeal sampling chest computed tomography may be more sensitive than an rt-pcr test at a single time point for the diagnosis of covid-19 52 53 in addition
artificial intelligence may help distinguish covid-19 from other etiologic agents of community-acquired pneumonia 54 however these findings are not completely specific to covid-19 and do not exclude a co-infection or an alternative diagnosis 55the most common laboratory features reported in patients with covid-19 include decreased albumin 758 95 ci 305 to 100 elevated c-reactive protein 583 ci 218 to 947 and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels 570 ci 380 to 760 and lymphopenia 431 ci 189 to 673 56 other biomarkers that have been reported include increased erythrocyte sedimentation rates elevated aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase and creatinine kinase levels leukopenia leukocytosis and increased bilirubin and creatinine levels 5759 such findings are not surprising because these biomarkers represent an inflammatory host response to sarscov-2 or are early markers of end-organ dysfunction similar to that seen in patients with sepsis 60 no biomarker or combination of
biomarkers currently exists that is sensitive or specific enough to establish a diagnosis of covid-19 or to pragmatically predict its clinical coursein the face of a public health emergency important first steps to expand testing capacity include relaxing and streamlining regulatory requirements and procedures local public health laboratories and academic diagnostic laboratories in the united states are being rapidly enabled to perform eua-granted commercial assays and laboratory-developed tests using research useonly reagents 61 university research laboratories could also add capacity although concerns exist regarding quality control and the absence of protocols for managing clinical specimens flexibility regarding nucleic acid extraction methods and amplification instruments when using cdc protocols is being introduced 34 national agencies are expeditiously making materials for test development and validation available to clinical laboratories and diagnostic test manufacturerssafely evaluating clinically stable persons for covid-19 at traditional health care access points is resource intensive and slow and risks exposing staff to infection many jurisdictions are enabling innovative testing venues such as external tents or drive-through or phone booth testing as well as home assessment teams to expedite specimen collection while limiting potential exposures 62 telemedicine combined with at-home nasal swab self-testing also has been proposed 63 of importance in jurisdictions without universal health care coverage policy solutions must be introduced to eliminate financial barriers to testing for uninsured and underinsured patients efforts to increase accessibility of testing for multiple use cases need to be coupled to appropriate public health interventions to isolate infected persons and their contactsnasopharyngeal swabs are the recommended specimen for molecular analysis the sudden demand for flocked nasopharyngeal swabs and viral transport medium generated by the pandemic has put enormous pressures on supply chain capacities for these products as of 19 march 2020 the cdc made oropharyngeal mid-turbinate and nasal swabs acceptable specimen types if nasopharyngeal swabs are not available 31 early-morning posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples coughed up by clearing the throat also have been assessed as useful specimen types and would not require use of a swab 48 the cdc has released a standard operating procedure for laboratories to create their own viral transport medium 64 other solutions also may be used if viral transport medium is unavailable including phosphate-buffered saline liquid amies and normal saline
65 the fda has provided guidance on its web site for alternative materials to collect and transport samples for rt-pcr sarscov-2 assays 34 the diagnostic value of molecular testing of nonrespiratory specimens currently is unclearalthough excellent tools exist for the diagnosis of symptomatic patients in well-equipped laboratories important gaps remain in screening asymptomatic persons in the incubation phase as well as for the accurate determination of live viral shedding among patients in the convalescence phase to inform de-isolation decisions figure 2 further it is critical to advance solutions that require less well-equipped laboratories to curb the pandemic globally the foundation for innovative new diagnostics find and others have created online resources to collate the rapidly evolving set of assays at various stages of development from proof of concept to full regulatory approval 20 53 simple antigen-based tests if sensitive enough might be useful in lower-resource and home settings to inform quarantine and spatial distancing measures for
patients without severe illness and their contacts novel technologies such as clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats crispr-based diagnostics are being used to develop rapid simple low-cost portable temperature-stable assays for deployment in the field in nontraditional and resource-limited settings such as airports and border crossings 20 51 54 other technologies might be deployed to lower-resource settings if they can be standardized for example it might be possible to leverage existing loop-mediated isothermal amplification testing networks established for other diseases such as human african trypanosomiasis surveillance 66critical considerations for diagnostics used for epidemic diseases of public health importance include the quality assurance and regulatory frameworks surrounding testing mature regulatory agencies have developed mechanisms to account for emergencies such as the fdas eua stream but pragmatic solutions must be found to facilitate wide-scale independent evaluation of emerging testsinitially the need for elaborate biosafety precautions and inconsistent recommendations for their application across regions severely hampered covid-19 testing although these continue to evolve current recommendations in canada and the united states acknowledge that nonpropagative work for molecular testing may be performed in containment level 2 conditions found in routine diagnostic laboratories and provide specific guidance on diagnostic testing of specimens conducted outside a biosafety level 2 laboratory such as rapid respiratory testing performed at the point of care 67 the covid-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted the essential role of diagnostics in the control of communicable diseases intensive diagnostics deployment probably contributed to the success of a few countries in controlling transmission urgent clinical and public health needs now drive an unprecedented global effort to increase sarscov-2 testing capacity finally the blinding speed with which covid-19 has spread illustrates the need for preparedness and long-term investments in diagnostic testingamong the coronaviruses the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov have caused threats to public health in 2002 and 2012 110 by the end of december 2019 another zoonotic human coronavirus has emerged in wuhan hubei province of china 51020 initially 27 patients with clinical manifestations of pneumonia fever difficulty in breathing and chest radiographs with bilateral lung infiltrative lesions were observed 1013162022 all patients were clinically tested negative for both the mers-cov and sars-cov 13 an abrupt increase in cases of viral pneumonia of unknown etiology led the chinese authorities to report the situation to the world health organization who on december 31 2019 1112 during the ongoing scientific investigations who initially proposed the interim name of this novel virus as 2019-ncov but later covid-19 was designated as the official name of this disease 23 following a thorough assessment of phylogeny taxonomy and established practice the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv formally recognized this virus to be related to sars-covs and designated this virus as sars-cov-2 24sars-cov-2 falls into the genus betacoronavirus with a sequence homology of 8089 with coronaviruses discovered in humans bats and other wild animals for instance sars-cov and bat sars-like cov 35716182022 due to an increase in the risk of a potential spread of this virus to countries with weaker health systems the who have declared the sars-cov-2 outbreak as a disease of public health emergency of international concern 25 owing to the current disease situation this novel coronavirus may remarkably become the third coronavirus posing significant threats to public health worldwidethe impediment of further spread and transmission of this disease requires rapid and reliable identification especially in areas with limited laboratory capacity concurrently in hospitals the identification of the causative agents of recurrent acute respiratory infections requires routine and confirmatory diagnosis through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction qrt-pcr in recent years the loop-mediated isothermal amplification lamp method that includes an exponential amplification of specific nucleic acid sequences at a constant temperature has been widely utilized for the rapid detection of virus-specific genes 2627 the specificity and sensitivity of this method is generally comparable to those of the conventional pcr and qrt-pcr the lamp assays merged with reverse transcription steps have been developed for the detection of rna viruses including sars-cov mers-cov influenza and other respiratory viruses 2632in the present study a single-tube reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp assay has been developed for the detection of the sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid n gene through colorimetric visualization the study was aimed to develop a rapid simple and sensitive molecular detection assay for the novel coronavirus that can differentiate it from other currently circulating human coronaviruses including oc43 229e nl64 and mers-cov as well as other respiratory viruses this method enables the detection of sars-cov-2 within 30 min excluding rna extraction with the detection limit of 102 rna copies which is close to qrt-pcr furthermore by combining the amplification process with colorimetric detection the assay is suitable for rapid and simple diagnosis within poorly equipped primary hospitals and laboratories and in situations where an urgent diagnosis is neededthe rt-lamp primers were designed for the detection of sars-cov-2 based upon the already available sequences in global initiative on sharing all influenza data gisaid wwwgisaidorg the sequences were aligned using clc genomics workbench 1001 qiagen usa a conserved region was identified in the target n gene sequence genbank accession no nc045512 position 2828528529 that was used as a template for the designing of the rt-lamp primersto identify the most efficient primer set seven sets of specific rt-lamp primers were initially designed using the primerexplorer v4 eiken chemical co ltd tokyo japan programme based upon the published sequence of the n gene primer sets included two external primers forward outer primer f3 and backward outer primer b3 two internal

gibco-invitrogen carlsbad ca usa containing 10 fetal bovine serum fbs and 1 antibiotics and incubated at 37 c in 5 co2 intact viral rna was extracted using rneasy mini kit qiagen usa followed the manufacturers instructions the viral rna was stored at 80 c till further use the complete experimental work with sars-cov-2 was conducted in enhanced biosafety level 3 bl-3 facility at chungbuk national university as approved by the korea center for disease controlto optimize the sensitivity and specificity of rt-lamp detection different primer concentrations 2520 m for external primer f3 and b3 2080 m for internal primer fip and bip and 540 m for loop primer lf and lb were tested for a 10 l rt-lamp reaction a master mix solution was prepared containing of warmstart colorimetric lamp

serially diluted 1  1011 to 1  100 synthesized viral rnas in the rt-lamp concomitantly same samples were subjected to qrt-pcr according to the shared protocol developed by the national institute of infectious diseases of japan which showed one of the highest sensitivities in the comparison study 3334 briefly sars-cov-2 qrt-pcr was performed using itaq universal probes one-step kit bio-rad hercules ca usa with conditions including reverse transcription at 55 c for 30 min initial denaturation at 95 c for 15 min 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 15 s and annealing at 60 c for 1 min using cfx96 touchtm real-time pcr detection system bio-rad hercules ca usa the cycle threshold ct values in qrt-pcr analysis were determined based upon the set baseline threshold value of 100 the ct values of in qrt-pcr results analysis were determined based upon the set baseline threshold value 100 validated by standard curve graph generated from serially diluted copies of templates with correlation coefficient value of 099to evaluate the time efficiency of the developed assay optimization of the rt-lamp reaction was done at varying reaction time points 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min using the determined limit concentration of viral rna ten repeats of the rt-lamp reaction were performed using the determined viral rna concentrations with incubations of 30 and 60 min for comparison the detection limit of qrt-pcr was also determined by performing ten repeats of the reaction using 100 101 102 and 103 rna copies positive rt-lamp reactions resulted in a colour change of phenol red ph indicator from pink to yellow due to decreased ph in the presence of an extensive dna polymerase activity thus the results could be directly observed by naked eye the results from rt-lamp reactions were also confirmed through 2 agarose gel electrophoresisthe sensitivity of the developed rt-lamp assay to detect sars-cov-2 was confirmed using the cell propagated cultures of sars-cov-2 that were grown and passaged twice in vero cells this intact viral rna was ten-fold serially diluted to 109 and processed for parallel testing with rt-lamp assay and qrt-pcr the serially diluted rna 2 l was mixed with the optimized master mix and subjected to rt-lamp assay as described previously 32to determine the specificity of the optimized rt-lamp assay for targeting sars-cov-2 the assay was tested across three-panel sets of different rna samples that were extracted from patients nasal swabs andor cell-propagated isolates of respiratory disease-causing agents the rt-lamp was cross-tested against a panel set of rna samples of related coronaviruses which includes human coronavirus 229e 229e human coronavirus nl63 nl63 human coronavirus oc43 oc43 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov tested using the developed rt-lamp assay the optimized rt-lamp assay was also tested against a panel of human infecting and avian influenza viruses the rna samples of acalifornia042009 h1n1pdm aperth162009 h3n2 bbrisbane602008 victoria lineage and bphuket30732013 yamagata lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses including h5n1 h5n6 h5n8 and h7n9 and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses including h2 h4h12 were also tested for any reactivity 32 furthermore a panel set of other respiratory disease-causing viruses including adenovirus adv parainfluenza virus piv human metapneumovirus mpv human bocavirus hbov human rhinovirus hrv respiratory syncytial virus a rsva and respiratory syncytial virus b rsvb were tested clinical samples of human respiratory viruses were obtained from the chungbuk national university hospital in the republic of korea the mers-cov korean isolate mers-covkorknih002 052015 genbank accession no kt029139 was kindly provided by the korea centers for disease control and prevention kcdc all work with mers-cov was conducted in enhanced biosafety level 3 bl-3 facility approved by the korea center for diseases control at chungbuk national university the sars-cov-2 qrt-pcr was performed following the protocol used for the optimization and the sensitivity assay all viruses used in the panel were also confirmed for viral rna using one-step rtpcr using their specific primers the detailed information about the primers and pcr conditions used for these panel viruses is presented in supplementary table 3fourteen nasal swabs collected from covid-19 patients in the national medical center republic of korea were processed for viral rna extraction purified rna was used for the clinical evaluation of the rt-lamp assay in comparison to the qrt-pcr method as described above an agreement between the two tests was also evaluated using cohens kappaclinical samples were collected from the national medical center south korea samples were collected under the approved guidelines and relevant regulations the ethics committee and institutional review board of national medical center irb no h-2002-111-002 approved all experimental procedures all experiments were performed following the approved guidelinestwenty-eight sequences of sars-cov-2 deposited in gisaid were aligned we designed the oligonucleotide primer sets to target the conserved region of the n-gene sequence which exhibited zero mismatches with the highly conserved region specifically from position 28285 to 28529 figure 1a and b we performed the rt-lamp assay using in vitro transcribed 2 l of 1 ngml rna 12  107 number of copies of the sars-cov-2 n gene a successful rt-lamp reaction results in a colorimetric reaction which includes a change in the colour of phenol red ph indicator from pink to yellow figure 1c moreover successful amplifications were indicated by a typical ladder-like pattern when electrophoresed in 2 agarose gel figure 1c
to optimize the rt-lamp and determine its limit of detection a ten-fold serial dilution of the rna transcript 1  100 to 1  1011 per reaction was used as the template in both the rt-lamp 65c 60 min figure 2a and qrt-pcr figure 2b assays the standard curve for the qrt-pcr and associated linear regression was created using graphpad prism supplementary figure 1 for this serial dilution the rt-lamp assay was able to detect down to 102 copies per reaction ten repetitions of the rt-lamp assay containing 103 102 and 101 rna copies per reaction resulted in 100 90 and 30 detection rate respectively while the qrt-pcr detected 100 in 103 102 and 101 rna copies and 0 in 100 rna copies per reaction figure 2a and b nonetheless compared to rt-lamp qrt-pcr method consistently detected up to ten-fold lower 101 rna copies across ten reactions qrt-pcr mean ct3743 supplementary table 4
while discerning the optimal reaction time for the rt-lamp assay a clear colorimetric change was evident at 30 min the clarity of the colorimetric change at 20 min was hard to discern by eye however a ladder-like pattern was exhibited through agarose gel electrophoresis figure 2c further assessment between 30 and 60 min incubation times showed 100 positive detection with 103 copies of rna per reaction to be observed at both time points across ten repetitions for 102 copies per reaction the positive detection rate was 90 for 30 min and 100 for 60 min across ten repetitions moreover during the ten repetitions the rt-lamp was observed to possess an equal detection rate of 30 for detecting 101 rna copies at both the time points figure 2din terms of overall time efficiency excluding the rna extraction qrt-pcr takes 100 min to complete and obtain results figure 2e the rt-lamp assay developed in the present study has shown a capability of sensitive detection within 30 min similar to that of 60 min incubation hence for the succeeding evaluation the rt-lamp assay was set in 30 min incubation time pointthe sensitivity of the rt-lamp assay was tested to detect the intact viral rna that was extracted from the cell culture supernatants of two isolates from covid-19 patients the sensitivity was observed to be ten-fold lower than that of the qrt-pcr which was similar to that of the rt-lamp assay performed using the synthesized rna both assays were able to detect sars-cov-2 in a reaction in which intact viral templates were used figure 3a and b interestingly sars-cov-2 positive samples were confirmed in both assays both the qrt-pcr and rt-lamp reactions were able to detect intact viral rna concentration in the range of 102 to 107 dilutions significantly qrt-pcr exhibited ten-fold 108 higher detection rate for the two intact viral rna samples the mean ct values observed across three repetitions are indicated in figure 3c and d
the detection limit of rt-lamp was determined using ten repetitions of serially diluted templates 106 107 and 108 for 30 and 60 min incubation figure 3 e and f 100 detection was observed in all ten replicates of rna diluted to 106 in both the patient isolates regardless of incubation period however the rna samples of 107 concentrations were observed with lower detection rate of 50-60 in 30 min and 60-70 in 60 min incubation moreover ten replicates of similar serially diluted templates 107 108 and 109 were subjected to qrt-pcr which demonstrated a ten-fold higher detection rate in agreement with the rt-lamp results using the synthesized rna as template supplementary table 4we have examined the specificities of sars-cov-2 rt-lamp assay against coronaviruses such as human coronaviruses oc43 nl63 and 229e mers-cov influenza viruses and other respiratory disease-causing viruses no amplification was observed in rt-lamp assay for any of the viral rna panel of related coronaviruses figure 4a upper panel this was further confirmed after the gel electrophoresis figure 4a middle panel the presence of viral rna was confirmed for all samples through rt-pcr and gel electrophoresis as shown in the lower panel of figure 4a
since the signs and symptoms of sars-cov-2 are similar to those of influenza virus infection a panel of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and human infectious influenza viruses was tested figure 4b no cross-reactivity was observed in rt-lamp either through colorimetric detection or agarose gel electrophoresis similar results were obtained when the developed rt-lamp assay was tested using a panel of avian influenza viruses figure 4c these results suggest that the developed assay has a high specificity for sars-cov-2 against all viruses tested which manifest andor cause respiratory clinical signs and symptomsa total of 154 clinical samples were evaluated which comprised of 14 positive nasal swab specimens collected from previously diagnosed patients with covid-19 in national medical center republic of korea and 85 nasal swab specimens collected during the outbreak and previously confirmed in the hospital for other respiratory disease-causing viruses in addition 55 samples confirmed for other respiratory disease-causing viruses and collected prior to the outbreak were also evaluated in the collected specimens 16 out of 154 samples were observed to react positively in the rt-lamp assay table 2 out of 16 samples 14 were from respiratory samples of covid-19 patients out of 140 negative samples used for this evaluation two 133 samples were observed to show a positive reaction table 2 using qrt-pcr we confirmed that both specimens exhibited a false-positive reaction in rt-lamp data not shown we also tested 14 respiratory samples through qrt-pcr results revealed that all collected specimens showed positive amplification with ct value ranging from 2111 to 3276 the results of the developed rt-lamp assay showed a calculated sensitivity of 100 and a specificity of 9870 which suggests that the primers used in this assay can be used for a sensitive and specific early detection method to identify sars-cov-2 cases
in the rt-lamp method primers that were designed to target the nucleocapsid n protein gene were utilized in general the gene encoding n protein was found to have the most abundant expression of subgenomic mrna sgmrna during infection 3537 the coronavirus n protein lacks the glycosylation site and possesses distinctly unaltered immunological characteristics 38 hence this protein has been selected as the main target for nucleic acid amplification apart from being the most abundant throughout the infection the gene encoding n protein is highly conserved among all coronavirus structural proteins based upon their reported pair-wise patristic distances ppd value differences the emergence of sars-cov-2 ppd 26 was completely independent of sars-cov ppd 016 that emerged in 2002 24 hence this explains how specific mers-cov or sars-cov primers limitedly detect this virus and supports why the primers utilized in the rt-lamp assay are highly specific to sars-cov-2 n genethe limit of detection revealed that the developed assay is highly capable of detection and nearly as sensitive as qrt-pcr we have demonstrated that the rt-lamp assay is specific for sars-cov-2 and it possesses rare cross-reactivity with other viruses that manifest similar respiratory disease moreover this assay can discriminate currently co-circulating common human coronaviruses and mers-cov the data presented supports that the rt-lamp is as specific as qrt-pcr in detecting sars-cov-2 in in silico analysis the cross-reactivity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov andor bat sars-like cov would be low based upon the sequence length of the rt-lamp primer binding regions 104-123 supplementary figure 2 in addition the rt-lamp assay using the synthesized rna of sars-cov n gene showed positive amplification with 107 rna copies per reaction across three repetitions this result shows 10000-fold lower cross reactivity compared to that of sars-cov-2 n gene 102 rna copies supplementary figure 3 furthermore using cohens kappa the level of agreement between qrt-pcr and rt-lamp was revealed to be almost perfect agreement kappa value  08261 39 this supports the high sensitivity and specificity results obtained during the clinical evaluation using both assaysgenerally rt-lamp methodology is regarded as new generation diagnostics 40 however along with its advantages this tool may also have some technical shortcomings such as false-positive single read-out and sensitivity to aerosol contaminants during assay manipulations 31 the inclusion of rna extraction step also limits this assay to be genuinely used for bedside testing in patients other lamp methodologies were able to develop assay without any need to conduct rna extraction while some utilized a one-step syringe filter system 4142 even though the optimized assay has false positive reactions we have envisioned that this developed rt-lamp assay can be utilized as a primary screening method in the rapid detection of sars-cov-2 hence all positive reactions may be subjected for a subsequent confirmatory diagnosis through qrt-pcr it would be of best interest if this developed assay be optimized using real-time amplification in order to hasten time reaction and minimize false positive reactions this rt-lamp would be an ideal point-of-care-test for covid-19 if all these limitations are met in future studiesin summary we have developed an rt-lamp assay that can be of use in clinical laboratories in support of the preliminary detection of sars-cov-2 in suspected patients especially during the testing of an abundant number of samples with high sensitivity and specificity this assay has a simple methodology low cost and is time efficient further a single-tube isothermal colorimetric method does not require any expensive equipment with the declaration of public health of international concerns against sars-cov-2 our method would significantly contribute to the public health responses and disease control of countries in providing preliminary counter detection measures especially to those with limited laboratory capacitiescoronaviruses are frequent causes of respiratory and neurological diseases in human six major species are known to cause respiratory and neurological diseases in human 1 these species include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov and less virulent species hku1 oc43 nl63 and 229e 2 an unknown pneumonia widely broke out in the word genetic sequencing of isolates obtained from patients with pneumonia identified a previously unknown coronavirus 2019-ncov 3 which has been recently denoted covid-19 by who 4 based on genomic characteristics of coronavirus figure 1 the current diagnostic tests for coronavirus include rtpcr rrtpcr realtime reverse transcription pcr rtlamp reverse transcription loopmediated isothermal amplification as well as realtime rtlamp 59the epidemiology aetiology and clinical characteristics of covid-19 have recently been described in detail 31013 the current diagnostic of covid-19 includes detection of virus by genomic techniques using either pcr-based method or deep sequencing 111415 within days of chinese researchers releasing the sequence of the virus on 11 january scientists developed pcr-based tests to detect novel coronaviruses covid-19 from patients 16 although diagnostic test kits have been approved the low efficiency and low accuracy of these test kits makes severe situation that is difficult to keep up with the increasing number of patients up to april 14 2020 over 192 million confirmed cases and 119000 death worldwide however these detection methods heavily rely on the presence of viral genome in sufficient amounts at the site of sample collection that can be amplified missing the time-window of viral replication can provide false negative results similarly an incorrect sample collection can limit the usefulness of qpcr-based assay a false negative diagnosis can have grave consequences specially at this stage of the pandemic by allowing infected patients to spread the infection and hampering the efforts to contain the spread of virus 17 additional screening methods that can detect the presence of infection despite lower viral titres can be beneficial to ensure timely diagnosis of all infected patients therefore its urgently needs to develop a diagnostic method with simple quick and high accuracy to diagnose emerging pathogen infectiousthe discovery and recently advance in the biology of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr and crispr-associated cas proteins have led to rapidly research expansion and most recently molecular diagnostics figure 2 the development of crispr-cas based systems for genome editing should acknowledge the efforts from different fields in the past of 30 years 18 the crispr locus were first discovered in 1987 and described to be arranged as highly homologous repeats with spacers in escherichia coli 19 a subsequent sentinel discoveries were unveiled the functions and mechanisms of crispr-cas system setting up a new era of crispr-cas mediated adaptive immunity in 2007 20 in 2013 the first application of crispr-cas9 technology has revolutionised the field of gene editing targeting mammalian cells accelerating the advance of novel applications in other crispr-cas systems for basic sciences and clinical medicine 2122 the crisprcas9-based tools were firstly used to detect zike virus in 2016 23 and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 2017 24 the discovery of rna-guided rna-targeting crispr effector cas13a 25 and subsequently founded cas12a 26 set up a stage of crispr-cas12 orand -cas13 based nucleic acid detection that used for clinical diagnosis 27 recently crispr-cas13 based sherlock protocols described by prof feng zhang et al provides a rapid and accurate diagnostic assay for emerging 2019 novel coronavirus covid-19 pneumonia therefore crisprcas based technology have a good potential for application as a fast accurate and portable diagnostic assay for emerging infectious diseasecrispr-cas systems act as rna-guided dna or rna-targeting technique which confer prokaryotes with heritable adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements including bacteriophages and plasmids from bacteria and archaea 202834 excellent comprehensive reviews have summarised the main processes of crisprcas-mediated immunity which include adaptation crrna maturation and interference 33 based on the composition of the interference complex crispr-cas systems are divided into class 1 crispr-cas systems types i iii and iv and class 2 crispr-cas systems iicas9 vcas12 and vicas13 3435 class 1 crispr-cas systems utilise crrna together with multi-effector complex to recognise and cleave the target sequence whereas class 2 systems utilise single multi-domain cas protein together with the crrna for interference 3437 to date class 2 crispr-cas systems have been widely used for genome editing and accurate and rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases 21232427 crispr-cas12a -cas13a and -cas13b have been recently applied to develop practical and sensitive detection assays for human pathogens including bacteria and virus 252738type ii crispr-cas9 based technology has been reported by several groups for infectious disease diagnostics 232439 pardee et al developed a novel method that combine crispr-cas9 with an isothermal amplification technique called nasba nucleic acid sequence-based amplification to differentiate zikv strains in singlebase discrimination 23 the investigators exploited the dsdna an intermediate of the nasba amplification process which serve as substrate for the cas9 endonuclease sgrna-cas9 complex cleave the resulting dsdna resulting in the truncated or full-length dna fragments formed upon cas9 cleavage with or without a strain-specific pam respectively full-length strands but not the truncated dna fragments triggered the toehold switch leading to a colour change to distinguish the different strains guk et al developed a method to detect methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa via combination crispr-cas9 with fishdna fluorescent in situ hybridization 24 in this method dcas9sgrna complex targets and recognises target meca gene which is associated with methicillin resistance in mrsa 40 dcas9 does not induce dna cleavage when the dcas9sgrna complex recognises the target dna sequence which can be detected by fish and the corresponding fluorescence intensity reflects the concentration of mrsa its easy to detect mrsa at a detection concentration of 10 cfuml and rapid distinguish between s aureus isolates in the presence or absence of meca gene however a new meca homologue mecalga251 shared 70 nucleotide homology with meca 41 which results in possible false negative results by using this method meanwhile the detection of the meca gene is not specific to mrsa because a small proportion of methicillinsusceptible staphylococcus aureus mssa with meca gene and a large proportion of mrsa strains lack of meca 4243 combination crispr-cas9 with optical dna mapping was also applied to identify bacterial antibiotic resistance genes 39 in this assay cas9grna complex specifically recognises and cleaves nucleic acid sequences of resistance genes then fluorescent dye yoyo-1 and netropsin independently and selectively binds to the resulting dna based on at-rich regions resulting in a difference emission intensity allows to detect different resistance genesidentification of crispr-cas12 systems type v have expand the crispr-cas arsenal for genomic editing 44 cpf1 was characterised firstly and renamed as cas12a 45 c2c1 cas12b 46 and other type v members were identified subsequently 374748 chen et al reported a technique named detectr dna endonuclease-targeted crispr trans reporter which provides a straightforward platform for molecular diagnostics 38 detectr achieves attomolar sensitivity for dna detection by combination the activation of non-specific single-stranded deoxyribonuclease of cas12a ssdnase with isothermal amplification that enables fast and specific detection of virus from patient samples in this assay crrna-cas12a complex binds to target dna and induces indiscriminate cleavage of ssdna that is coupled to a fluorescent reporter the author used detectr to differentiate between different types of human papillomavirus from cultured human cells and clinical samples within 1 h 38 in addition another technique combines crispr-cas12 with a fluorescence-based point-of-care poc system is recently reported for rapid and detection for accurate african swine fever virus asfv 49 in this method cas12acrrna detects and binds to targeting dna the cas12acrrnadna complex becomes activated and degrades a fluorescent ssdna reporter the author used this method to detect asfv at a detection limit of 1 mm within 2 h a detection limit of 100 fm can be achieved after 24 h of incubationseveral subtypes of type vi crispr-cas13 systems have been reported to serve as potential tools for rna editing 5052 generally type vi crispr-cas13 systems contain a single effector protein designated cas13a which combines with crrna form a crrna-guided rna-targeting crispr effector complex to cleave ssrna rather than dna 345053 the first platforms based on type vi crispr-cas13 systems is termed sherlock specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking which integrates isothermal rpa recombinase polymerase amplification or reverse transcription rt-rpa with nuclease activity of cas13a 25 a crrna-cas13a complex specifically binds and cleaves target nucleic acid as well as nontarget rna coupled to a fluorescent reporter which provides a fluorescent signal for rapid and real-time detection of pathogen even at low concentrations using sherlock gootenberg et al identified escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa and differentiated these bacteria with mycobacterium tuberculosis klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates of k pneumoniae that possess different drug-resistant gene including new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 resistance ndm or carbapenemase kpc can be distinguished moreover the most powerful applications of sherlock allowed for the discrimination of targets that differed in only a single base pair and successfully distinguished such targets as african and american strains of zikv different serotypes of denv five healthrelated gene alleles from human saliva and various cancer-related mutations in suspensions of cell-free dna several important characteristics including the estimated cost of the reagents and materials is less than 1 per test a paper-based test can be used reagents are stable and the detection can be performed within 2 h which make it feasible for use the revised method based on sherlock termed sherlockv2 can simultaneously detect one dna target and three ssrna targets in a single reaction 26 in this modified method cas13 together with csm6 an auxiliary crispr-type iii associated nuclease 5455 which can increase about 35-fold signal sensitivity 26 this method can be applied to detect specific nucleic acid with high sensitivity it takes less than 90 min to accuratly detects zika virus dengue virus and synthetic dsdna 26 moreover myhrvold et al developed a novel technique based on sherlock together with hudson heating unextracted diagnostic samples to obliterate nucleases 27 which allows pathogen detection directly from bodily fluids of the patient without nucleic acid extraction this method with high sensitivity detection that can identify dengue virus in the saliva whole blood and serum of patient samples within 2 h recently a protocol for detection of covid-19 using crispr-based sherlock described by feng zhang et al figure 3 the author mentioned that the test can be performed starting with rna isolated from patient samples and can be read out using a dipstick in less than an hour this protocol will provide reference for researchers interested in further advancing this diagnostics system for covid-19 or other emerging infectious diseasethe limitation in overall performance characteristics of traditional diagnostic methods makes novel molecular tools were quickly integrated into clinical use tremendous advances in novel methods associated with pcr and dna sequencing allow rapidly identified the pathogen of emerging infectious diseases and facilitate timely treatment of infections however an ideal diagnostic reagent is characterised by rapid reliable inexpensive and easy-to-use perhaps non-specific dna or cleavage observed in crispr-cas type ii cas9 v cas12 and vi cas13 systems provides a promising advance in crispr-based diagnostics for emerging infectious diseases these three different techniques based on class ii crispr-cas systems applied a combination of the crisprcas based system with other technique to achieve described applications in diagnosis although there is an urgent need for fast accurate and inexpensive tests and the possibility that the crispr-cas based diagnosis may set up a novel stage in terms of the accuracy and the speed of detection these emerging advanced techniques based diagnostic methods will require careful validation and field testing to guarantee their functionalitythe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 is a new type of coronavirus belonging to the genus  on 11 mar 2020 world health organization who declared coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as a pandemic 1 viral culture and pcr are the gold standards in the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection 2 however it takes hours to detect the nucleic acid and days to isolate the virus in addition specialized instrument and expertise is required for rapid diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection rapid antigen detection rad tests for qualitative determination of sars-cov-2 antigen are available rad tests detect viral antigen by the immobilized coated sars-cov-2 antibody on the device the test results of rad can be interpreted without specialized instrument and available within 30 minutes hence rad tests can relieve the workload in diagnostic hospitals and laboratories and improve the turn-around time however according to who the role of rad tests for antigen detection for sars-cov-2 needs to be evaluated and is not recommended for clinical diagnosis 3the purpose of this evaluation is to assess the diagnostic use of the commercially available biocredit covid-19 ag test the aim of the first part of the study was to assess the limit of detection lod between rad test rt-pcr and viral culture and the second part was to evaluate performance of rad test in detecting sars-cov-2 virus in different types of respiratory specimensthe sars-cov-2 culture isolate strain hcov-19hong kongvm200010972020 the first sars-cov-2 case detected in hong kong was used to perform a serial tenfold dilution to determine lod between different assaysto evaluate the cross-reactivity of the rad test 13 non-sars-cov-2 respiratory virus isolates were tested they were influenza ah1 influenza ah3 influenza b adenovirus coronavirus type oc43 coronavirus type 229e parainfluenza virus type 1 parainfluenza virus type 2 parainfluenza virus type 3 parainfluenza virus type 4 respiratory syncytial virus rhinovirus and enterovirusfrom february 1 2020 to april 21 2020 respiratory samples from individuals confirmed with sars-cov-2 infection by sars-cov-2 virusspecific real-time rt-pcr targeting the rdrp gene were retrieved for this evaluation samples were placed in viral transport media vtm or phosphate-buffered saline pbs for rna extraction the remaining part of the suspension was stored at 70 c until use in this study virus concentrations in samples were estimated from cycle threshold ct valuethe public health laboratory services branch phlsb in hong kong has been designated as who covid-19 reference laboratory since april 2020 and all confirmed cases in hong kong were either diagnosed or confirmed by phlsb 4 total number of 368 confirmed covid-19 samples collected with sufficient quantity were available for this study in descending order throat saliva n  122 nasopharyngeal swab and throat swab nps n  103 nasopharyngeal aspirate and throat swab npa  ts n  81 sputum n  62we evaluated the only commercially available rad kit in hong kong at the time of starting the evaluation biocredit covid-19 ag for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infectionthe intended use for biocredit covid-19 ag kit is for nasopharyngeal swab specimen as npa  ts nps  ts sputum and throat saliva had either been eluted in vtm or suspended in pbs the test was carried out with modified sample processing methodsthese samples do not need preparation 100 u l sample was added directly into a sample well of the devicethe swab provided by the kit was used to collect the samples and the swab was immersed in the provided assay diluent tube the subsequent procedures were carried out according to the manufacturers instructionsin an effort to compare the performance of two sample processing methods ie methods for handling less viscous and viscous samples lod was determined using a serial tenfold dilution of virus the results were then compared with rt-pcr and viral cultureviral culture was conducted by inoculating specimens onto vero e6 cells when virus-induced cytopathic effect was examined identification of sars-cov-2 virus in culture fluid was confirmed by the rt-pcrthe in-house developed rt-pcr was used to detect the presence of sars-cov-2 virus nucleic acid in all samples it was conducted using nxtscript enzyme and master mix roche diagnostics gmbh germany each 10 l reaction mixture contained 5 l rna samples 2 l reaction mix 5x 006 l adpta taq dna polymerase 50ul 005 l

amplification was performed in the lc480 system roche diagnostics gmbh germany according to the following program 1 cycle of 50 c for 10 min 1 cycle of 95 c for 30 s 40 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 56 c for 30 s and holding at 4 cthe lod of the rad test was 1000 fold less sensitive than viral culture when 100 u l sample was added directly into a sample well of the device rad 10-2 viral culture 10-5 pcr is the most sensitive assay for detecting sars-cov-2 virus 10-7for the rad test there were marked differences in sensitivity when using the provided swab to transfer the sample to the assay diluent tube and then adding 100 u l of the suspension into a sample well the fold difference between two rad sample processing method was at least 100 fold table 1
 it seemed to be related to the volume of sample used and the dilution effect in the assay diluent tubeas shown in table 1 the lod for the rad test was 10-2 the corresponding ct value of the samples that can be detected by pcr were estimated to be 1857 this ct value was estimated from the 10-4 dilution of virus ie 10-4 ct  2517 10-2 2517-66  1857 respiratory samples of various ct values up to 30 were selected which is close to the limit of detection for viral culturea total of 35 samples each for npa  ts nps  ts were selected to evaluate the rad test since sputum and throat saliva are rarely used for the rad tests an additional 10 more samples each for sputum and throat saliva were selectedwe retrospectively tested 160 pcr-positive clinical samples from 152 different patients for the rad test all 70 npa  ts and nps  ts samples were handled with less viscous samples processing method for the 90 sputum and throat saliva samples 83 samples were handled with less viscous samples processing method seven samples sputum  3 throat saliva  4 were handled with viscous samples processing method because of the viscous nature of the original specimenrespiratory samples were divided into two groups based on the ct values samples with ct values 1857 were classified as high viral load while samples 1857 were classified as normal viral load of the 160 samples tested 64 and 96 samples were classified as high viral load and normal viral load samples respectively the corresponding mean ct value ct value range and sensitivity for npa  ts nps  ts sputum and throat saliva samples among these two group of samples were shown in table 2
 review of the ct values showed that samples missed by the rad test had relatively high ct values fig 1
 the rad test detected between 286 and 818 of real-time rt-pcr-positive high viral load samples from covid-19 patients however it only detected between 0-211 for normal viral load samplesin the cross-reactivity test using virus isolates all were tested negative by the rad testin this study we determined the performance characteristics of the rad test the biocredit covid-19 ag for detecting sars-cov-2 virus in respiratory samples and compared the results with real-time rt-pcr as the gold standardalthough our data indicated that rad test was capable of detecting sars-cov-2 virus in npa  ts nps  ts sputum and throat saliva with different sensitivities this method was less sensitive than sars-cov-2 rt-pcr consequently the negative results from this rad method cannot exclude sars-cov-2 virus infection confidently and thus results should be verified by further pcr testing additionally the low prevalence of high viral load samples further limits the use of rad test in clinical setting at the time of writing this report may 2020 among the sars-cov-2 positive samples received in phlsb only 166 2181311 were high viral load ct1857  218 npa  ts  80 nps  ts  68 sputum  13 throat saliva  57 ct1857  1093 npa  ts  268 nps  ts  318 sputum  101 throat saliva  406the limitations of this study include the fact that we employed a modified sample processing method to perform the rad test we added some sample directly into a sample well of the device instead of using the swab provided by the kit to collect the samples immerse the swab in the provided assay diluent tube and add the suspension into a sample well of the device however we were capable of determining the viral load dependent effect on its sensitivityother limitations of our study include the fact that the samples were refrigerated after completion of rt-pcr and only tested for this study after storage a period of time which may have led to antigen degradation however because our findings of viral load dependent effect for npa  ts and nps  ts samples were consistent with those of the test results using serial tenfold dilution of the sars-cov-2 culture isolate the antigen degradation is unlikely the maximum ct values for npa  ts nps  ts samples that were detectable by the rad test were 2099 and 1752 respectively the lod for rad test using serial tenfold dilution of the sars-cov-2 culture isolate was estimated to be 1857in summary it was shown that testing of patients suspected of sars-cov-2 infection with antigen-based assay may produce more false negative results in clinical practice a recent study evaluating another rad test showed that an overall sensitivity of 302 was found for the 106 sars-cov-2 pcr positive samples 5 application of such assays alone in clinical settings is not recommended in favor of continued molecular diagnostics the balancing between cost turnaround time ease of performance and sensitivity in adopting antigen-based assay should be considered 6

all laboratories asked to join agreed to do so and to work according to a set of rules on confidentiality of data these rules specified that data and information shared among the members of the research project would be used only to advance the project in a collaborative way specific scientific data could be shared outside the network with the approval of the laboratory from which the data or other information originated to avoid discrepancies between official national case notification and laboratory information data on cases and samples were treated separately from epidemiological information such open sharing among academic competitors required trust and willingness to work togetherthe collaboration is continued through daily teleconferences and use of a secure who website to post electron microscopy pictures of candidate viruses protocols for testing phylogenetic trees pcr primer sequences and results of various diagnostic tests these arrangements allow the simultaneous analyses of samples from the same patient in several laboratories with different approaches and real-time sharing of results laboratories in areas with sars cases including canada germany france hong kong the uk the usa and singapore regularly exchange samples with each other and dispatch materials to laboratories in the netherlands and japan which were initially spared sars cases in early april laboratories from beijing and guangdong province china joined the networkon march 17 2003 the network laboratories reported on available samples reviewed past and planned intervention strategies and catalogued available laboratory experience and capacities initially bacterial viral rickettsia and chlamydia pathogens primarily associated with respiratory disease and pathogens for which respiratory symptoms might be secondary were targeted for detection methods used include light and electron microscopy immunohistochemistry animal inoculation bacterial and cell-culture isolation techniques serology and pcr analyseson march 18 participating laboratories in germany reported paramyxovirus of singaporean origin on electron microscopy isolated in respiratory samples from a sars patient in frankfurt and directly linked to singapores index case simultaneously the chinese university of hong kong shared equivocal results from generic and more specific human metapneumovirus pcr primers in samples from patients who had developed sars after contact with hong kongs index case pcr primers were tested in three additional patients and the findings were positive for human metapneumovirus sequences of all primers were shared electronically on the networks secure websitethe next day the singapore laboratory noted a pleiomorphic virus on electron microscopy in respiratory samples from sars patients the rotterdam laboratory where human metapneumovirus was first discovered sent a car to frankfurt overnight to obtain samples from sars patients29 the japanese laboratory reported negative results of pcr for bronchoalveolar lavage and of serum antibody obtained from the index case in hanoi the laboratory found no evidence for influenza a and b viruses respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza viruses human metapneumovirus nipah virus hendra virus hanta virus and lassa ebola marburg and crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever viruseson march 20 human metapneumovirus primers were tested in four additional laboratories the chinese university of hong kong found paramyxovirus-like particles in respiratory samples the rotterdam laboratory detected no human metapneumovirus in samples from frankfurt the rotterdam laboratory sent test kits for human metapneumovirus to singapore and hong kong laboratories and shared via the website the phylogenetic tree of the isolated paramyxovirus the laboratory in canada shipped convalescent sera to rotterdam for further testing of isolates during the daily conference call the singapore laboratory reported round pleomorphic structures in samples and scientists in germany and hong kong described similar findingsduring the march 21 teleconference the laboratory in rotterdam established that all respiratory samples from the cluster tested in germany singapore patients were negative for human metapneumovirus on pcr the laboratory also isolated an agent that caused a cytopathogenic effect in vero and monkey kidney cell lines laboratories in the uk also detected h3n2 influenza virus in two suspected sars cases the laboratory in canada detected human metapneumovirus by pcr in samples from two patients and provided an electron-microscopy picture of small virus particles around 20 nm seen in bronchoalveolar lavage at the same time a german laboratory isolated the agent in vero cells and in the murine cell line l929 the laboratories also ruled out the presence of respiratory pathogens such as influenza a and b viruses respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza viruses type 1 2 and 3 adenovirus rhinovirus enterovirus human metapneumovirus mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniaelater in the day the scientists at hong kong university sent an e-mail indicating that they had isolated an agent from two patients with sars the agent isolated in continuous rhesus monkey kidney cells produced a cytopathogenic effect indicating growth of a virus in addition in an immunofluorescence assay of virus infected cells done in a blinded trial sera from sars patients had rising antibody titres to the new virus isolate by contrast sera from blood donors taken long before the disease emerged in hong kong had no antibody to this virus furthermore virus-like particles in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane were seen in thin electron microscopic sections from infected cells these findings proved to be the turning point in the search for the sars causative agenton march 22 the laboratory in the usa isolated a virus that caused a cytopathogenic effect in vero e6 cells from a patient from thailand and showed the presence of coronavirus-like particles on electron microscopy size 70100 nm in samples from the same patient the us laboratory found positive pcr signals with primers for picornavirus which was later identified as rhinovirus the government virus unit in hong kong and the us laboratory sent electron microscopy pictures of the coronavirus-like particles to be posted on the website simoultaneously laboratories in canada paris and at the chinese university detected paramyxovirus human metapneumovirus or both on electron microscopy or pcr in various samples the singapore laboratory detected human metapneumovirus with a test kit supplied by the rotterdam scientists the government virus unit in hong kong provided the laboratory in the usa with convalescent sera the laboratory in canada found more particles of 20 nm size on electron microscopy and posted the phylogenetic tree of human metapneumovirus sequences on the secure websiteon march 23 the laboratory in the usa confirmed the classification as a coronavirus based on a coronavirus-like sequence of the pcr-amplified product and posted initial primers for amplification on the website the government virus unit in hong kong tested in-house coronavirus primers and found coronavirus rna in two of eight samples the usa laboratory reported the presence of coronavirus in postmortem kidney samples from hong kong it also developed an immunofluorescence assay for detection of seroconversion trials in non-human primates were started by intratracheal infection with nasopharyngeal swabs taken in singapore and hong kong the laboratories in paris and canada found a coronavirus in respiratory samples on electron microscopy and pcr respectively suckling mice and hamsters inoculated 3 days previously at the pasteur unit in lyon with samples from frankfurt and hanoi were described as still healthy and have remained so laboratories in germany japan and singapore isolated a cytopathogenic-effect-causing agent in vero cells the laboratories in the uk detected with specific pcr four pneumovirus sequences in respiratory samples from probable and suspected cases consistent with human metapneumovirusfrom march 24 to 26 a coronavirus was detected on pcr and electron microscopy in more laboratories laboratories in germany and hong kong developed and shared refined primers that detected the new coronavirus in a german laboratory pcr products were sequenced two of which matched at the protein level the polymerase gene of known coronaviruses several laboratories reported coronavirus particles on electron microscopy in respiratory samples and faeces sequencing of the new coronavirus began at laboratories in germany rotterdam and hong kong a german laboratory and the hong kong university laboratory posted on the website the first phylogenetic trees of what the group collectively had discovered a new coronavirus30
from march 27 to 31 hong kong university made available their virus isolate to members of the network monkey trials continued and the first coronavirus isolates were obtained hong kong university and the us laboratory reported negative results for antibodies to the new coronavirus in large numbers of blood-donor serum samples virus antibodies and rna on pcr were however consistently detected in increasing numbers of sars patients in many of the network laboratories the laboratory in japan received samples from singapore and hong kong and identified the new coronavirus which was also confirmed by seroconversions they also developed pcr primers and an immunofluorescence assay system for igm hong kong university reported that 27 of 27 paired sera from patients with clinically typical sars showed rising titres of antibody to the new coronavirus and detected rna in faeces in five of ten sars patients the government virus unit in hong kong reported consistently positive pcr for the new coronavirus in faeces from sars patients between days 6 and 16 after onset of clinical signs a laboratory in germany found rna of the new coronavirus in conjunctival liquid of one patient on the day of onset of clinical symptoms human metapneumovirus continued to be detected in samples from sars cases in various countries which suggests that sars might be caused by co-infection with two viruses coronavirus-primers were used in various laboratories resulting in an increasing number of positive samples in parallel human metapneumovirus was isolated and found on pcr in various samples from patients in canadafrom april 1 to 9 in the netherlands laboratory monkeys were infected with the new coronavirus the human metapneumovirus or bothfirst with coronavirus followed by metapneumovirus animals infected with the coronavirus alone developed full-blown disease animals infected with the human metapneumovirus developed only mild rhinitis the monkeys infected with coronavirus and metapneumovirus did not develop more serious disease than monkeys infected with metapneumovirus alone on the basis of these findings the network scientists collectively agreed that the coronavirus alone can cause the symptoms of sars seen in human beings however co-infection with other agents including chlamydia and human metapneumovirus could result in a more severe clinical courseelisa tests developed by the laboratory in the usa detected antibodies from day 20 after onset of clinical signs the hong kong university laboratory reported on indirect fluorescence detection of antibodies igm from day 10 additional mice and hamster infection trials were started at the pasteur unit in lyon in-vitro ribavirin efficacy trials began in rotterdam and germany and the laboratory in japan began human interferon efficacy trials the chinese laboratory in beijing continued to report chlamydia in postmortem samples from sars patients the chinese laboratory in guangdong reported positive coronavirus findings by pcr in two samplesmany laboratories have now isolated the new coronavirus in vero cells serological evidence is mounting on the possibility of dual infection by coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in sars patients sequencing of the new coronavirus continues in germany rotterdam hong kong and the usa chlamydia pathogens have been found in samples from germany laboratories in japan france and rotterdam and the government virus unit in hong kong have extended studies on the comparative performance of pcr primers the laboratory from canada has shared via the website a comprehensive report on coronavirus and human metapneumovirus findings in canadian sars patients up-dated phylogenetic trees and more sequencing information on the new coronavirus from the laboratories in the usa and rotterdam have been posted first inactivation experiments in germany have revealed that the infectivity of the virus in serum is destroyed by incubation at 56c for 30 minon april 16 1 month after the network began to function participating laboratories collectively announced conclusive identification of the new coronavirus as the causative agent of sars the announcement was made based on the results from the monkey studies done in the netherlands laboratory this virus was found in many sars patients from several countries the virus causes a cytopathogenic effect in two cell lines vero cells and fetal rhesus kidney cells electron microscopy of cell culture and respiratory samples from sars patients show coronavirus-like particles immunofluorescent assays with serum from convalescent patients detect cells infected with the virus in cell culture reactivity with this new coronavirus could not be detected in serum from several hundreds of non-sars individuals in the usa canada and hong kong generic coronavirus primers can detect the new coronavirus rna in cell culture and in samples from sars patients specific primers have been developed in several laboratories and are currently being compared for sensitivity hyperimmune sera against transmissible gastroenteritis virus feline infectious peritonitis virus and 229e human coronavirus react with the virus antigen in cell culture partial sequencing of the new coronavirus in several laboratories has confirmed its affiliation to the genus coronavirus but shown dissimilarities with known members belonging to each of the three existing groups of this genusthree diagnostic tests are now available but all have limitations since the elisa detects antibodies reliably only from about day 20 after the onset of clinical symptoms it cannot be used to detect cases before they potentially spread the infection to others the second test an immunofluorescence assay detects antibodies reliably after day 10 of infection various versions of real-time and block-based pcr tests are currently being developed to improve their low sensitivity and reduce the number of false-negative test results all existing tests used individually or in combination can only confirm the disease in suspected or probable sars cases more work is needed before reliable easy-to-use and sensitive tests become available in all countries work towards this objective is continuing and is proceeding at a rapid pace each laboratory has contributed substantially to the rapid identification and characterisation of the new coronavirus associated with sars31 32 33
lower respiratory tract infections lrtis cause significant hospitalization among children under 5 years old 12 although these infections are usually relatively mild some children develop respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation and admission to the paediatric intensive care unit picu the aetiology of severe lrti is often difficult to establish however the majority of lrtis in this young age group is believed to be caused by respiratory viruses for the detection of respiratory viruses two conventional methods are commonly used viral culture and direct immunofluorescence dif assays in addition a third method based on molecular techniques has now become available namely real-time pcr specifically the real-time pcr format provides rapid results within a clinically relevant period of time it allows quantitative virus detection and no post-pcr processing needs to be performed moreover compared with standard format pcr the risk for contamination is strongly reduced with real-time pcr rendering false-positive results with real-time pcr highly unlikely 3currently there are no guidelines regarding which viral tests are appropriate for young children with lrti in the picu 4 conventional detection methods have several disadvantages compared with real-time pcr viral culture has been considered the gold standard for the detection of respiratory viruses but its limitation is that it can only detect a small number furthermore the yield of viral culture depends on the quality of sampling the correct transport and storage of samples and the type of cells used in addition the technique has a turnaround time of several days to weeks and is therefore unable to guide initial patient management the results of dif assays are available more rapidly and this has been shown to improve patient outcome with less antibiotic use and shorter hospital stay 5-7 unfortunately the dif assay is less sensitive than culture for the detection of certain pathogenspcr has been shown to be more sensitive than conventional techniques and is fast 8-11 additional advantages of pcr include its ability to identify multiple viruses simultaneously and to detect viral and atypical pathogens that cannot be cultured or for which no dif is commercially available for example coronaviruses human metapneumovirus hmpv chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae rapid and sensitive testing for a broad range of respiratory viruses is vital in the picu and it can improve our understanding of severe viral respiratory infections furthermore it can be used to guide cohorting strategies that may protect other critically ill children and to guide initial therapy finally evaluation of viral tests may be of future importance when antiviral therapy becomes more widely availablein the present study conventional methods viral culture and dif were compared with real-time pcr for their ability to detect respiratory viruses in young children with lrti admitted to the picu secondary objectives were to describe the presence of viral pathogens and bacterial infection in lrti patients in the picuchildren aged under 5 years admitted to the picu of the wilhelmina childrens hospital with lrti were enrolled during one winter season from december 2004 to may 2005 wilhelmina childrens hospital is a tertiary university hospital with a 14 bed picu facility and serves as a referral centre for the central part of the netherlandspatients were eligible if they had an admission diagnosis of probable bronchiolitis probable pneumonia or respiratory failure exclusion criteria were a primary cardiac or central origin of respiratory failure and overt sepsis at the time of admission the study described here was conducted as part of normal patient care therefore according to the medical ethical research council of our institution there was no need for patient consentethical approvalsputa andor nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from all eligible patients for viral testing by viral culture dif and real-time pcr assays in addition sputum and blood samples when available were cultured and processed in accordance with standard microbiological

data and the following clinical characteristicsoutcomes were extracted and entered into standardized forms gestational age underlying disease length of picu stay need for mechanical ventilation and death five criteria were used to classify the presence of bacterial infection at admission or during the picu stay new infiltrate on the chest radiograph increased need for supplemental oxygen fever temperature of 385c or greater increased infectious parameters c-reactive protein 40 mgl andor white blood cell count 15  109l and positive bacterial culture blood or sputum for the purpose of this study no bacterial infection possible bacterial infection and proven bacterial infection were defined as the presence of fewer than two two to three and more than three of the above criteria respectivelyfor the analysis of continuous variables an unpaired t test was used to compare means categorical variables were analyzed using a two-tailed fishers exact testtwenty-six picu patients met the inclusion criteria one patient was admitted with a positive rsv test result from an outside hospital and no further testing was performed at our institution another patient diagnosed with a bacterial pneumonia was subjected to no virus tests and insufficient material was obtained from a third patient to perform all respiratory tests consequently 23 patients were included in the subsequent analysisthe median age of the patients was 26 months and the majority were referred from an outside hospital table 1 the picu patients formed a heterogeneous group with many patients having underlying conditions resulting from preterm birth or birth defects patients stayed in the picu for a median of 10 days 20 87 patients needed mechanical ventilation two patients in the study group died one child suffered from bronchiolitis with progressive bronchospasms which in the end could not be controlled the second child had complex underlying conditions after eliminating all treatable causes including lrti the patient died from central hypoventilationviral culture identified a respiratory virus in six picu patients rsv and adenovirus were detected in four and two patients respectively table 2 the dif assay appeared to be more sensitive to detect respiratory viruses than viral culture in our population identifying a virus in 11 48 patients including the six patients diagnosed by viral culturereal-time pcr detected a total of 33 respiratory viruses in 22 96 patients all positive results found by conventional techniques were confirmed by real-time pcr rsv was the single most common respiratory virus found and was detected in 16 70 patients in addition rhinovirus was found in six 26 patients and influenzavirus adenovirus and coronavirus were each detected in three 13 children piv-3 and hmpv were both found in one patient 4 piv-2 and piv-4 and the atypical pathogens mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae could not be detected in any of the lrti patientsin eight 35 children more than one virus was detected six children had a dual infection one had a triple and one had a quadruple respiratory virus infection rsv was detected in seven of the eight children infected with multiple viruses including all three patients infected with a coronavirus of the 14 children with a single infection nine had rsv the other five patients had an infection with rhinovirus n  2 influenzavirus n  1 adenovirus n  1 or hmpv n  1no statistical differences were found between children with a single and multiple virus infection with respect to age sex gestational age underlying disease length of picu stay mechanical ventilation and the presence of bacterial infectionbacterial cultures were performed in 14 patients in eight 57 patients bacterial pathogens were identified most commonly streptococcus pneumoniae moraxella catarrhalis haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus the details for each patient regarding viral and bacterial infections including length of stay are presented in additional data file 1 according to the predefined classification six 26 children in the study group had proven 11 48 had possible and six 26 had no bacterial infection of the six patients with a proven bacterial infection two infections developed after more than 48 hours of mechanical ventilation overall 19 83 patients received antibiotics during their stay on the picu for a median of 7 days patients with a proven bacterial infection stayed in the picu for a mean of 18 days versus 9 days for patients with possible or no bacterial infection p  0026in the present study conventional methods viral culture and dif were compared with real-time pcr for their ability to detect respiratory viruses in young children admitted to the picu with lrti the use of real-time pcr increased the diagnostic yield from 48 to 96 and all viruses found by conventional methods were confirmed by real-time pcr whereas with conventional methods no double infections were found real-time pcr revealed multiple virus infections in 35 of patientsthe high diagnostic yield of pcr compared with conventional techniques is in agreement with the findings of others when conducting a medline search 1966 to september 2005 with the search terms lrti pcr and rsv or respiratory viruses we identified 11 hospital-based paediatric studies that compared pcr with conventional techniques for more than two respiratory viruses 8-1116-22 pcr was found to have excellent sensitivity in all studies if conventional methods were considered the reference standard 091100 in summary these studies showed that pcr increased the diagnostic yield by by up to 25 as compared with conventional techniques however most studies selected patients on the basis of respiratory test results rather than selecting patients by admission diagnosis exceptions include the studies conducted by weinberg and coworkers 22 and jennings and colleagues 9 weinberg and coworkers 22 tested samples from 668 hospitalized children and selected patients on admission diagnoses by the new vaccine surveillance network pcr assays were used to test for rsv influenzaviruses and piv 13 with viral culture 89 13 specimens were positive as compared with 185 28 positive specimens with pcr jennings and colleagues 9 enrolled 75 hospitalized children using a case definition of acute respiratory infection and performed viral diagnostics for a broad range of viruses pcr identified 39 additional viruses adding up to a total of 87 viruses found in 65 87 children 9the clinical relevance of detection of respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus and coronavirus is a matter of debate rhinovirus 23 and coronavirus 14 are well recognized as causes of the common cold on the other hand there is increasing evidence that they are also important causes of severe lower respiratory disease rhinovirus infections have been reported in elderly adults with lrti or pneumonia 2425 and in immunocompromised patients 2627 coronavirus infection has also been reported in cases of lrti 14252829 real-time pcr will provide insight into the role played by such viruses in the aetiology of lrtithe high yield of pcr compared with conventional techniques could theoretically be the result of contamination however with using real-time pcr the likelihood of false-positive results caused by carry-over contamination is reduced to a minimum this is achieved by the use of modified nucleotides dutp and uracil-dna glycosylase ung for control of contamination in the pcr-based amplification of cdna as well as the closed-tube detection system 3 in addition during the procedures of dnarna isolation and amplification several negative controls are included to monitor for possible false-positive findingsan additional advantage of real-time pcr over standard-format pcr is that it allows high-throughput screening of patient samples for the presence of many different pathogens our real-time pcr assays included testing not only for rsv influenzaviruses and pivs but also for rhinoviruses adenoviruses the recently discovered hmpv 30 coronaviruses oc43 229e and the newly identified coronavirus nl63 31 and the atypical pathogens mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae thus real-time pcr allows for maximal detection of multiple viral and atypical infections in children with lrti with a negligible risk for false-positive resultsin the picu patients studied we found a high prevalence of multiple viral infections 35 including triple and even quadruple infections in previous studies the detection of multiple infections varied considerably ranging from 06 to 27 a low prevalence was found in studies using pcr for rsv influenzaviruses and pivs only 1822 in contrast a high prevalence was found in studies that included a broad range of respiratory viruses including rhinovirus adenovirus coronavirus and hmpv 9 interestingly in the latter study most coronaviruses were identified as part of multiple virus infections three out of four which is in accordance with our findingsthe prevalence of possible or proven bacterial infection in our study group was high 74 the fact that almost half of the children were diagnosed with a possible bacterial infection indicates the difficulty of precluding this diagnosis in addition previous studies showed that viral infection may pave the way for bacterial infection 32 the only study that compared viral diagnostic methods in a similar population of picu patients did not report on the prevalence of bacterial infections and so we can not compare this finding with those from other studies 16 in contrast to the high prevalence of possible or proven bacterial infection found in our study group we did not demonstrate infections with atypical pathogens such as mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae it can be speculated that atypical pathogens do not play an important role in children with severe lrtithe small study group included in our study represents a limitation it did not allow us to find an association between clinical characteristics and multiple infections furthermore the samples that were negative by conventional methods and positive by real-time pcr could not be confirmed using a true gold standard because such a standard for respiratory viruses does not exist this is a problem encountered in all studies of respiratory virusesthe finding that real-time pcr increases the yield of viral diagnoses for picu patients with lrti has implications for clinical practice the rapidity and sensitivity of real-time pcr test results can help the clinician to initiate appropriate cohorting strategies to prevent other critically ill children from nosocomial viral infections a reliable and rapid viral test result can also be taken into account when prescribing or discontinuing antibiotic treatment our study was not designed to determine when antibiotic treatment for lrti in the picu is warranted the high percentage of possible or proven bacterial infections in our viral lrti patients indicates that antibiotic treatment poses a dilemma in the picu the clinical impact of the high prevalence of multiple virus infections detected in our picu remains unclear because they were not associated with different clinical characteristics further research with larger numbers of patients and age-matched control groups is needed to determine the real clinical impact of multiple infections and to determine whether the use of real-time pcr prevents unnecessary antibiotic treatment however real-time pcr offers a rapid sensitive and highly reliable new technique that may improve our understanding of the epidemiology of severe lrtisreal-time pcr for a broad range of respiratory viruses was found to be highly sensitive in children with severe lower respiratory tract infection in the picu in addition real-time pcr increased the diagnostic yield of positive samples by twofold compared with conventional methods viral culture and dif whereas conventional methods identified no multiple infections real-time pcr found the prevalence of multiple infections to be 35 because real-time pcr is a rapid and sensitive technique it is able to guide initial patient cohorting strategies and therapy in the picu 	real-time pcr for the detection of respiratory viruses is a sensitive and reliable method in picu patients with lrti and it increases the diagnostic yield compared with conventional methods 	real-time pcr allows detection of multiple viral infections found in 35 of patients in this study that are not identified using conventional methods 	the rapidity and sensitivity of real-time pcr test results can help the clinician to initiate appropriate cohorting strategies to prevent other critically ill children from acquiring nosocomial viral infectionsdif  direct immunofluorescence hmpv  human metapneumovirus lrti  lower respiratory tract infection pcr  polymerase chain reaction picu

response can occur and for asymptomatic carriers this is critical in making decisions on public health measures such as movement restrictions and quarantine duration nucleic acid testing that is detecting the viral rna is a feasible and practical method currently the most common method for nucleic acid diagnosis is based on real time rtpcr drosten et al 2002 mackay et al 2002 espy et al 2006 for example bgi in china httpswwwbgicomkit and the us cdc httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019-ncovabouttestinghtml provide reagents primers and probes to support rtpcr diagnosis for sarscov2 although realtime rtpcr is sensitive and reliable it is timeconsuming 2 h and requires a specific detection device or instrument which limits its broad application to current huge demand for the global pandemic of covid19to address this challenge a fast and simpletooperate test kit would be highly desirable with such a test virus infected patients could be identified at an early stage and quarantined to prevent the spread of the infection whilst the noninfected individuals could carry on with their life as usual ideally the test kit is mobile without the need of any complicated instrument and the test result can be read by the naked eye hence it can be used at airports railway stations and hospitals particularly regional hospitals and medical centres in rural areasloopmediated isothermal amplification lamp is a rapid technology of dna amplification notomi et al 2000 tomita et al 2008 which has been applied to pathogen detection such as virus bacteria and malaria thai et al 2004 boehme et al 2007 mori and notomi 2009 law et al 2015 reboud et al 2019 the lamp reaction generally takes place in a constant temperature and the target dna can be amplified in 30 min tomita et al 2008 the lamp method employs 4 or 6 primers to bind six regions of a target dna and the specificity is extremely high notomi et al 2000 tomita et al 2008 since the lamp method only needs one constant temperature usually 65c the device can be simple initially the lamp uses 4 primers notomi et al 2000 tomita et al 2008 later it is found that the addition of two loop primers can shorten half of the time required for the original lamp reaction nagamine et al 2002 the availability of warmstart rtx reverse transcriptase new england biolabs uk makes it possible to combine both reverse transcription and lamp in one reaction since sarscov2 is a rna virus with the length about 30 kb wang et al 2020 the single reaction of reverse transcription rt and lamp together can significantly shorten the reaction time without the dna purification step from rt thus a rapid detection of sarscov2 can be achievedin this work we developed a covid19 diagnosis kit for the rapid detection of sarscov2 using onestep reverse transcription and loopmediated isothermal amplification rtlamp the whole reaction can be as short as 20 min at a constant 65c the detection limit is 80 copies of viral rna per ml sample a simple colour change indication can be visualized by the naked eye to confirm the result of viral rna amplification the kits were validated by 16 clinical covid19 samples this new technique can also provide a rapid and feasible approach for the detection of various viruswe designed four sets of lamp primers o117 s17 n1 and n15 which target rna encoding orf1ab spike glycoprotein and two regions in nucleocapsid protein of sarscov2 respectively fig s1 each set has 6 primers table 1 sarscov2 is a single stranded rna virus with the length of about 30 kb orf1ab is about 21kb long encoding the replicase polyprotein woo et al 2010 o117 primers were designed to cover the conversed region of 5end of the viral rna in orf1ab fig s1 s17 primers target the s gene which encodes spike glycoprotein a key for this sarscov2 virus to bind human ace2 protein and to invade human cells menachery et al 2015 cui et al 2019 walls et al 2020 the n gene for nucleocapsid protein is at the 3end of the viral rna conserved to sarslike coronavirus cui et al 2019 during sampling and rna extraction processes the viral rna might be attacked by rnase degrading from 5 to 3 so we designed n1 and n15 to ensure the detection of 3end of the viral rna of sarscov2 even though it is partially degraded the targeted sarscov2 rna fragments of these four sets of primers fig s1 and table 1 are about 240260 bp long enough to be targeted by 6 primers and short enough to achieve a rapid amplificationin all experiments of lamp and rtlamp the experiments were carried out with more than three biological replicates and the results were consistentto verify their specificity we first tested these primers using synthetic target dna of sarscov2 n1 and n15 primers were able to amplify dna fragments of the n gene but not human genomic dna fig 1a and b by adding the fluorescent dye provided by neb new england biolabs uk positive results can be visualized directly from the pcr tubes under uv exposure the fluorescent intensity in the amplificationpositive tubes was stronger than that in the amplificationnegative tubes although fluorescence background was also present in the negative tubes fig 1a and b the fluorescent readouts are consistent to the results by electrophoresis gel however the fluorescent signal background might cause ambiguous reading and it requires fluorescent sensitive instrument to analyse the result so we changed it to colorimetric reading later in this studysimilarly o117 and s17 primers can also specifically amplify the synthesized dna fragments of orf1ab gene and s gene respectively but they were unable to amplify human genomic dna fig 1c and d the addition of human genomic dna to the viral dna in the reaction mixture did not interfere with the amplification performance lane 4 in fig 1a and b lane 5 in fig 1c and d which is essential for using rtlamp to detect viral rna in a human sample the lamp reaction time for all experiments was 30 min positive amplification products were obtained even for 2 copies of the synthetic viral dna fragment template in 30 min when using the s17 primers lane 4 in fig 1d demonstrating that the lamp reaction was rapid and sensitiveto assess the potential of rtlamp in detecting rna virus of sarscov2 we then tested the performance of these primers with synthesized rna fragments of the n gene s gene and orf1ab gene obtained from in vitro transcription appendix s1 it shows that reverse transcription and lamp can be integrated into one single rtlamp reaction to specifically amplify viral rna fragments fig 2we evaluated the sensitivity of rtlamp by diluting the copy number of rna target from 200 to 2 copies per reaction in total 25 l reaction solution and examined the efficiency by sampling the reaction mixture at 15 20 and 30 min after the reaction started it shows that 2 copies of target rna can be amplified to detectable level using n1 primers within 20 min whilst it requires 30 min using n15 primers fig 2ac the sensitivity and efficiency of rtlamp were also tested on s17 and o117 primers as shown in figure 2 2 copies of s gene rna can be detected using s17 primers in 30 min whilst the detection limit using o117 primers is 20 copies of orf1ab gene rna in 30 min the results suggest that rtlamp is sensitive enough to detect viral rna within a 30min reaction and the sensitivity can be 2 copies in 25 l reaction 80 copies viral rna per ml by employing primers n1 and s17it is also observed that the higher copies of rna the shorter time is needed to obtain the products fig 2 when the copy number of rna is 200 per reaction the amplification result can be observed as short as 15 min fig 2since resultreporting using fluorescent dye requires a specific instrument fig 1 we also tried to read the results using the naked eye since the nucleic acid amplification releases pyrophosphate and hydrogen ion which decreases the ph of reaction solution a sensitive ph indicator can be used to show the positive or negative result of rtlamp tanner et al 2015 poole et al 2017 hence rtlamp result can be visualized by a ph indicator such as phenol red which shows pink 8286 and becomes yellow when ph drops using the warmstart colorimetric lamp 2 master mix dna  rna from new england biolabs a visible colour change from pink to yellow could be observed if the amplification of the target sequence has taken place fig 3 we show that the colorimetric rtlamp assay can reliably detect n genes of sarscov2 viral rna and the colour change could indicate the number of target sequence semiquantitatively fig 3colorimetric reading is dependent on ph change during rtlamp however in clinical application many factors might interfere ph change for example patient sample conditions can be different introducing uncertain factors to ph change in the rtlamp reaction in addition viral rna of sarscov2 might be eluted by various buffers which might be compatible to rtlamp reaction but could significantly affect the colorimetric reading fig s2 to overcome the uncertainty and ensure the reliability of the diagnosis results we also designed another set of fip primers which 5end was conjugated with fluorescent fam 6carboxyfluorescein table 1 figure 4 shows that the application of 5famfip primers was able to display both colorimetric and fluorescent readings and both results were consistentto validate the performance of rtlamp in diagnosing covid19 a test kit consisting of three tubes 1 o117 primers 2 n15 primers 3 human actin primers see materials and methods was sent to shenzhen luohu peoples hospital for clinical validation rtqpcr and rtlamp tested the 16 clinical samples 8 positive and 8 negative samples in parallel which were taken by swab from patients in a standard way the samples were initially tested by conventional rtqpcr then rtlamp was used to test the same samples using rtlamp tubes 1 and 2 of each testing kit turned yellow which indicate the presence of target viral rna in all 8 positive samples whilst tube 1 and 2 remained pink for all 8 negative samples figure 5 this shows the rtlamp assay has a good agreement with the conventional rtpcr results in diagnosing covid19 samples fig 5 and fig s3 tube 3 of all test kits remained pink in both positive and negative samples which indicates the human actin primers are not able to detect the actin gene transcripts within the patient samples comparing the results between rtqpcr and rtlamp it shows that the rtlamp was able to detect viral rna with ct  36 by rtqpcr table 2 suggesting that rtlamp with visually colour change reading is very sensitivecell samples can be processed in one single step to obtain nucleic acid amplification heating cells at the same temperature of rtlamp 65c should lyse cells or virus and release rna in this study we tested the onestep process using human episomal induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs which were suspended in 085 saline figure 6 shows that the nucleic acids of actin gene in ipsc cells can be directly amplified using rtlamp within 40 min after 30 min only the purified human rna can be amplified showing the colour change fig 6a however after 40 min the tube with human cells changed the colour whilst the tube without human cells and blank water control remained unchanged pink colour fig 6b the onestep process is sensitive enough to detect human 10 cells per 25l reaction this onestep process took 10 min longer than rtlamp to rna because it takes about 510 min time to lyse cells and release nucleic acids the result suggests that it should be possible to use one single step to achieve the detection of specific nucleic acids in cells further test is needed to validate its practical feasibility on clinical swab samples containing sarscov2here we described a fast and simpletooperate method to diagnose covid19 we applied rtlamp to achieve a rapid testing of sarscov2 using different primers o117 s17 n1 and n15 to target orf1ab gene s gene and n gene we showed that a 30 min reaction could detect down to 2 copies of target rna per 25 l reaction 80 copies per ml figs 1 and 2 however this extreme sensitivity is also a doubleedged sword carryover contamination was common in lamp reactions which usually cause false positive results hsieh et al 2014 ma et al 2017 we also observed carryover contamination after the rtlamp reactions were performed several times in the laboratory we suspect the aerosol formed from the rtlamp products were able to spread everywhere in the laboratory contaminating labcoats pipettes reagents materials and equipment used for the next reaction thus for clinical use all components required in the rtlamp reaction need to be prepared in a separate laboratory space with good practice of molecular biologythe colorimetric display of the testing outcome is easy without the need of expensive or complicated instrument however the colour change of rtlamp reaction is based on ph indicator phenol red tanner et al 2015 poole et al 2017 the elution buffers of the various rna extraction kits will significantly affect the result hence in all of our experiments including the clinical tests the rna samples were eluted in dnasernasefree water to ensure the rna elution buffer has a minimal impact of ph indication in rtlamp reactions the viral rna clinical tests work well to match the results of rtqpcr to tube 3 all samples were negative suggesting that rna of human actin gene transcript was not amplified in the samples fig 5 the fourprimer design for human actin poon et al 2005 might require a longer reaction time than 30 min in rtlamp assay in the future the better human control should be applied for example the primers for human rnase gene can be used as a positive controlthe ultimate aim is to develop an enclosed device that integrates rna extraction purification reverse transcription rt and loopmediated isothermal amplification lamp to detect the sarscov2 virus directly from a throat swab sample it has been wellknown that colony pcr can be done directly using cells huang et al 2005 heating cells can cause cell lysis and nucleic acid release which can be used as template for the amplification of nucleic acids we tested onestep rtlamp for nucleic acid amplification and it worked well fig 6 the advantage is that the same temperature 65 c for rtlamp was able to lyse cells and the cell lysis in pure water or with low salt did not affect the reaction of rtlamp this preliminary work suggests that it is possible to combine rna extraction rt and lamp in one single step which will significantly simplify the detection process and shorten the detection time current criteria of the test in china are 300 copies ml1 the preliminary results of onestep rtlamp should meet this requirementproving the practicability of rtlamp in diagnosing covid19 is the first step towards developing a more accessible diagnostic kit testing is crucial not just for getting treatment to those in need but also to curb the spread of disease within a region as we face a global shortage of testing kits amid this global pandemic our work will be vital to address this need in clinical practice as well as to extend towards a homebased or personal diagnostic systemwith this proofofconcept work it is possible to develop a simple low cost and onestep testing kit which can be used to screen individuals for sarscov2 virus at the pointofcare testing poct there is a need for an onsite rapid test for the infection which can be operated easily with minimal training and without the risk of getting infected existing methods to detect sarscov2 are either based on detecting the virus rna itself using reverse transcription realtime polymerase chain reaction rtqpcr technologies or based on specific igm and igg from patients blood generated several days after the infection currently these tests would require a laboratory with specific machines operated by skilled scientists and technicians that take at least 2 h to perform the ultimate goal will be development of a rapid 3045 min enclosed test device with onestep operation for the detection of sarscov2 virus multiple sites on the viral rna are detected to ensure specificity and sensitivity and an internal control is embedded to prevent false positives and false negatives this study will pave the way to move forward for rapid and largescale screening and diagnosis where patients exhibiting suspected symptoms can all be tested in the early stageshuman episomal

with acute severe respiratory illness the eds of 2 urban medical centers participated in this project the annual ed census is around 100000 for one medical center and 80000 for the other the study period included january 2017 through march 2018 we defined the prerespiratory panel system implementation period as january 2016 through december 2016 12 months and the postrespiratory panel system implementation period as january 2017 through march 2018 we had 200 multiplex pcr kits of which 22 were used for rapid pcr respiratory panel system calibration the remaining 178 kits were aimed for use among the study patients however at the planned end date of the study we could not reach the target sample size therefore a 3-month extension in the experimental group was made to collect sufficient samples the trial was approved by the institutional review board for human research at each participating centerpatients aged 65 years or older presenting to the ed with acute severe respiratory illness were eligible for inclusion we defined a case of severe acute respiratory illness according to the world health organizations case definition we defined severe acute respiratory illness in adults as physician-diagnosed lower respiratory tract infection with a pulse oxygen saturation spo

collected on the day of admission an episode of lower respiratory tract infection was defined as acute pulmonary disease with or without acute respiratory failure including pneumonia influenza-like illness or an acute exacerbation of a chronic respiratory illness including an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma or bronchiectasis the exclusion criteria included if the patient was receiving palliative care or declined nasopharyngeal swabbing all participants provided written informed consentthe filmarray respiratory panel biofire diagnostics inc detects 17 viruses

pertussis mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae we collected a nasopharyngeal swab using a nylon flocked swab that was immediately placed in universal transport media utm the study nurse collected all samples and specimens in utm and they were tested according to the manufacturers instructions blood samples were collected within 24 hours of admission pct concentrations were measured using an immunoluminometric assay with a detection limit of 006 ngml brahms pct-sensitive kryptor thermo fisher scientific brahms gmbh respiratory swab and blood samples were tested as soon as they were received in the laboratoryduring the study period the study nurse identified eligible patients and explained the study protocol to the treating physicians and patients eligible patients received a rapid molecular test with 17 respiratory viruses and a pct test the results of the respiratory panel or pct tests were communicated to the treating physicians directly by the study nurse as soon as they were available and were kept in the medical records the study nurse reminded the treating physician of the recommendation of antibiotic treatment based on different viral and pct testing results the detection of influenza initiates isolation or neuraminidase inhibitor use the detection of a virus with an elevated serum pct level 025 ngml may indicate the possibility of a superimposed bacterial infection and justify the continual use of antibacterial treatment in patients with noninfluenza virus infection and combined antiviral and antibacterial treatment in patients with influenza infection a positive result for respiratory virus with a low serum pct level and stable clinical manifestation may allow early discontinuation or de-escalation of empiric antibiotics de-escalation was defined as changing to a narrower-spectrum antibiotic or shifting the intravenous antibiotics to oral form a negative respiratory virus test result with a low serum level of pct 025 ngml would prompt clinicians to consider noninfectious causes of respiratory distress such as acute exacerbation of obstructive airway disease acute decompensated heart failure or fluid overloadinformation regarding laboratory tests antibiotic or antiviral therapy administration duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment length of intensive care unit stays length of hospital stay and 30-day mortality was obtained from electronic health records we compared the outcome and duration of intravenous antibiotic use with a historical cohort with similar baseline characteristics and clinical presentations the clinical impact was measured via the proportion of stopping or de-escalating antibiotics neuraminidase inhibitor uses in the ed duration of intravenous antibiotics treatment length of hospital stay length of intensive care unit stays 30-day mortality and overall all-cause mortalityto evaluate the clinical impact of combining the respiratory panel and pct testing on the outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory illness we established a historical cohort including all patients presenting to the ed with severe acute respiratory illness from january 1 2016 to december 31 2016 the database included the following demographics clinical presentations presenting viral signs laboratory data image results ed and admission medications used in the ed and hospitalization course and discharge status we then used a ps-matching technique to select a group of patients with similar demographics comorbidities diagnoses vital signs and laboratory results to the experimental cohort that received the respiratory panel and pct test to increase the statistical power for analysis we performed a 1-to-3 matching the final cohort includes 169 older adult severe acute respiratory illness patients who received the respiratory panel and pct test and 507 ps-matched control patients this composite cohort was used to assess the clinical impact of the rapid respiratory viral surveillance and pct testsbaseline characteristics were summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics the categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage and compared using the chi-squared test the continuous variables were presented by median with interquartile range and compared by nonparametric mann-whitney u tests the numbers of different respiratory viral isolates and mean serum level of pct for different viral infections were shown by bar graph to select control patients we built a ps for matching ps was defined as the conditional probability of being tested with respiratory panel and pct which was derived from the logistic regression model that included the following potential predictors demographics comorbidity presenting vital signs laboratory results and admission diagnoses to verify the balancing of baseline covariates after ps matching we made a standardized difference plot to ensure minimum differences in the baseline covariates between 2 groups of patients supplementary figure 1 in the ps-matched cohort we compared the outcome between the current cohort and the ps-matched historical cohort using the logistic regression model adjusting for the residual difference in the baseline covariates all statistical analyses were performed by sas 94 sas inc cary nc and a p value of  05 was deemed significantthe demographics presenting vital signs laboratory test results and underlying comorbidity of the experimental and control cohorts are shown in table 1
 in the experimental cohort the mean age was 812 years and 698 were males diabetes cancer and chronic pulmonary disease were the leading 3 comorbidities and pneumonia chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation and acute respiratory failure were the most prevalent diagnoses the control cohort had a comparable distribution on the aforementioned characteristics except for including fewer patients with dementia or chronic liver diseasein the experimental group 36 patients tested positive for respiratory virus including 13 influenza a or b virus 77 9 rsv 53 9 human rhinovirusenterovirus 53 2 coronavirus 12 2 parainfluenza virus type 3 12 and 1 human metapneumovirus 06 in the control group 20 patients 33 were diagnosed with influenza which was significantly lower than in the experimental group p  049 table 2

this prospective cohort study reports the clinical impact of rapid molecular diagnosis of respiratory pathogens in conjunction with pct testing on older adult patients presenting to the ed with severe acute respiratory illness the results showed 213 of older adult severe acute respiratory illness patients to be having respiratory virus infection with influenza rsv and human rhinovirusenterovirus being the 3 leading pathogens we demonstrated that the new diagnostic approach was associated with increased discontinuation or de-escalation of antibiotics reduced length of intravenous antibiotics treatment and improved influenza detection and antiviral usethese findings are consistent with those of previous studies brendish et al8 showed that patients receiving respiratory panel testing were more likely to undergo single doses or brief courses of antibiotics treatment respiratory panel testing was also associated with a reduced length of stay and improved influenza detection and antiviral use however they did not find that routine use of respiratory panel testing could reduce the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics which they ascribed to the initiation of antibiotics before the results of pct in many patients a pre-post study showed that the use of the respiratory panel decreased the time to diagnosis of respiratory viruses hospital admission rate length of stay number of chest radiographs and duration of antimicrobial use13 gelfer et al21 combined the respiratory panel and pct tests but found no significant differences in overall antibiotic exposure between the experimental and standard-of-care groups nevertheless they found significantly fewer patients discharged on antibiotics and a shorter duration of therapy in a subgroup of patients with positive viral and negative pct testing results they stressed the importance of proactive communication between the antibiotics stewardship team and physiciansour results showed that the proposed diagnostic approach could reduce intravenous antibiotics treatment duration by 444 days without compromising patient outcomes historically it has been advised to complete the course of intravenous antibiotics treatment despite the resolution of clinical symptoms however there is little evidence to support this practice22

23 overuse of antibiotics was associated with increased risk of clostridioides difficile infection and a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics may increase the risk of adverse drug events organ dysfunction or mortality24 it is noteworthy that the identification of respiratory virus alone may not be sufficient to reduce antibiotic use because of the concerns regarding mixed virus-bacteria coinfection especially influenza with pneumococcus infection25 low serum level of pct may help alleviate the concerns of mixed infection in addition communicating the results to the treating physicians is important13

16 although we did not have a formal antibiotic stewardship team the study nurse communicated the results to the treating physicians and promoted antibiotics stewardship another finding is the underdiagnosis of influenza in older adult patients older adult patients were less likely to undergo a provider-ordered influenza test they usually lack the typical presentation of influenza-like illness and may present with respiratory distress or confusion26 a recent study showed that the diagnosis of influenza based on clinical grounds alone was associated with a suboptimal sensitivity of 36 and a specificity of 7827
the proposed algorithm for respiratory virus infection diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship may also have implications for nursing home nh residents acute respiratory virus infection outbreaks are a common problem in nhs28

29 a recent systematic review reported a 121 to 852 annual incidence of influenza or rsv infection in long-term care facilities28 other than influenza and rsv human metapneumovirus is the third most common causative pathogen for nh respiratory infection outbreaks30 nhs often do not have on-site equipment to evaluate suspected infection therefore a lower threshold for antibiotic prescription is common it is estimated that approximately two-thirds of nh residents received antibiotics each year and up to 75 of the treatment is inappropriate nhs become the reservoirs for resistant bacteria within a community31 although the present protocol cannot be implemented in nhs it can be used among severe nh patients who are transferred to the ed in a less severe outbreak the nasopharyngeal samples of nh residents can be collected and sent to contracted laboratories for respiratory panel testing the early detection of acute respiratory infection enables early isolation of infected patients and early antiviral drug administration which can prevent or contain a respiratory virus infection outbreakcost is an important consideration for the large-scale clinical implementation of rapid multiplex pcr testing previous analyses showed that rapid multiplex pcr testing was the most cost-effective testing strategy for the detection of influenza in children12

32 the cost-effectiveness of respiratory panel testing is highly influenced by the prevalence of influenza and the proportion of patients treated with antivirals the significant improvement in influenza diagnosis and antiviral treatment in our study suggests that a combination of respiratory panel and pct testing may be cost-effective in our study setting such speculation however requires future validationour results have to be interpreted in light of several limitations first pct tests were not used in the comparison cohort we cannot determine the impact of the viral panel and pct tests separately second the study nurse only enrolled patients during working hours of weekdays selection or spectrum bias is less likely because we did not find significant difference in the outcomes of patients presenting to the ed on different time shifts third the postdischarge follow-up data of the historical comparison cohort cannot be retrieved we therefore could not compare the duration of oral antibiotics between the 2 cohorts the reduction of intravenous antibiotic duration alone is important because it has been shown to be a strong risk factor for the development of resistant bacteria strains fourth the generalization of the results to other settings should be taken into consideration the long hospitalization duration in our study was due to old age severe illness and low hospitalization cost33

34 lastly the incidence of various respiratory viruses may have varied across the 2 seasons of the study period the strengths of our study include the older adult population the twin-center prospective cohort design the simple antibiotic stewardship algorithm and the comparison to a ps-matched cohortthe findings of our study support the use of rapid multiplex pcr respiratory panels in conjunction with the pct test for early diagnosis of respiratory viral infection and to inform optimizing antibiotic use in older adult patients presenting to the ed with severe acute respiratory illness respiratory viral infection outbreak is common in nursing homes performing the proposed diagnostic approach on patients transferred from nhs may enable early detection of the causative pathogens and early isolation of infected patients as the cost per test is still high institutions should develop a protocol to prevent indiscriminate testing with multiplex pcr and provide proactive real-time feedback to treating physicians for antimicrobial stewardship further studies are needed to assess the incremental value of multiplex pcr viral testing compared with pct testing alone in the management of patients with severe acute respiratory infection in the edrespiratory tract infections are a significant contributor to the global burden of respiratory tract illnesses with up to 4 million deaths worldwide in 2013 1 several pathogens including viruses and bacteria can cause respiratory tract infections as clinical presentations often overlap identification of the underlying pathogen based solely on clinical criteria is challenging 2 even though most respiratory tract infections are self-limited in immunocompetent hosts many are treated as shown in a recent study highlighting the increase in unnecessary antibiotic use in this group 3 in other patient groups including immunocompromised patients elderly patients and critically ill patients complications from respiratory tract infections often occur with poor outcomes including increased morbidity and mortality 46 thus the ability to rapidly and accurately diagnose respiratory tract infections is critical for optimal patient care additionally rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential for the timely administration of antiviral therapy when available and the institution of contact and droplet precautions to prevent health care-associated transmission 7 8 several instruments and multiplexed molecular panels are currently approved by the us food and drug administration fda for the rapid and sensitive detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal swab nps specimens these methods differ based on several criteria including the degree of multiplexing 4 to 22 targets complexity of the method moderate to high throughput low to high and turnaround time tat 1 h to 8 h 9 in general performance characteristics of these multiplex panels are significantly better than those of conventional methods including viral culture and antigen tests and have replaced these methods in many laboratories on the other hand the increased cost of multiplexed molecular panels compared to the cost of conventional methods has raised questions on their costbenefit ratio particularly as many viral targets on these panels have no specific treatments however given their utility in the rapid diagnosis of infections especially in immunocompromised patients infection control and prevention practices and antibiotic stewardship the interest in multiplexed pcrs remains highthe

and s2 in the supplemental materialof the 3235 samples eligible for testing with the eplex rp panel 154 had invalid results 48 after repeat testing 8 samples were not evaluable due to final invalid results 7 prospective samples and 1 contrived sample the final validity rate was 998 95 ci 995 to 999 the eplex rp panel detected a potential respiratory pathogen in 1212 of 2462 prospectively collected nps specimens tested for a positivity rate of 49 the ppas and npas with 95 cis of the eplex rp panel targets with comparator methods are provided in tables 2 to 4 separately for retrospectively collected samples and prospectively collected samples and with all samples combined additional data for fresh and frozen prospectively collected samples are presented in table s3 in the supplemental materialthe overall percent agreement between the eplex rp and biofire rp results was 95 for all targets tested the ppa ranged from 851 95 ci 802 to 889 for coronaviruses to 951 95 ci 890 to 979 for influenza a 2009 h1n1 virus with npas of 995 95 ci 991 to 997 and 998 95 ci 995 to 999 respectively table 4 for 6 samples eplex rp was negative for the influenza a virus target but positive for either the 2009 h1 n  5 or h3 n  1 subtype and 9 samples were positive for the influenza a virus target without a subtype being identified of note influenza a h1 virus was not detected and very few chlamydia pneumoniae n  4 isolates were detected during the study period for these targets at least 50 specimens with the pathogen spiked into negative nps specimens were contrived all were detected by eplex rp data not showndiscordance resolution results table 5 demonstrate that while eplex rp had a high level of agreement with the biofire rp and detected the same targets in nearly all samples each assay detected targets that the other did not in table 5 samples with targets that were detected by eplex rp but not detected by biofire rp fp are counted as true-positive samples if the target was detected by discordance testing tpd samples with targets not detected by eplex rp but detected by the biofire rp fn are counted as true-negative samples if the target was not detected by discordance testing tnd given the number of discordant samples between the two panels for coronavirus detection additional repeat testing by both the biofire rp and eplex rp was performed as part of the discordance analysis this additional testing demonstrated evidence of decreased sample stability over time or variability in aliquots tested thus for coronaviruses a fn sample was counted as a true-positive sample if the target was detected by repeat testing by eplex rp tpd a total of 26 samples were not tested by pcr assays for a variety of reasons including an insufficient volume for repeat testing which included 8 samples with fn results 1 for coronavirus 1 for hmpv 4 for hrvev and 2 for influenza a virus and 18 samples with fp hrvev resultsof the 2462 prospectively collected samples 164 had codetections by at least one of the assays data not shown the eplex rp panel identified a total of 135 prospective samples with multiple pathogens detected or 55 of all prospectively collected samples while the biofire rp detected a total of 116 samples with multiple pathogens or 47 of all prospectively collected samples of the 135 samples with multiple pathogens detected by eplex rp 118 48 had two pathogens 14 06 had three pathogens and 3 01 had four pathogens detected of the 135 samples with codetections 57 samples 23 included one or more pathogens that were not detected by the biofire rp method the comparator method identified a total of 32 13 codetections with one or more pathogens not identified by the eplex rp panel discordance resolution results are included in the analysis presented in table 5each of 3 sites performing the reproducibility study collected 35 to 36 results for each target at each concentration for a total of 107 to 108 samples per site for the moderately positive and the negative panels the percent agreement was 100 95 ci 966 to 100 for all 7 panel targets for the low-positive panel the percent agreement was 100 95 ci 965 to 100 for 6 of

samples yielded a valid result upon initial testing upon repeat testing all but one specimen yielded a valid result for a final validity rate of 997 95 ci 983 to 999 no significant sources of variability were found for any of the targets on the panel across cartridge lots operation days technologistsoperators or sites data not shownthe time to identification from receipt to result was determined to be 1 h 45 min and 57 s with hands-on times hots per sample of 1 min and 35 sin this multicenter clinical study the performance characteristics of the new eplex respiratory pathogen panel on the genmark eplex instrument were estimated by measuring agreement with the results of the biofire rp a commercially available multiplex respiratory panel the eplex rp panel was recently fda cleared and expands the available options for laboratories interested in the rapid diagnosis of respiratory tract infections using broadly multiplexed molecular assay on nps specimens similar to the biofire rp eplex rp offers a large panel of both viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in a simple sample-to-answer format with minimal hands-on time and a rapid turnaround time to resultsas with all molecular diagnostic test methods both the biofire rp and eplex rp have the potential to generate false-positive and false-negative results as confirmed in this study by additional testing with target-specific pcrs with bidirectional sequencing the unavailability of an established gold standard prevents a true measure of correctness requiring the use of agreement measures with a nonreference standard instead to establish the performance characteristics of a new test 13 thus data presented in this study reflect only the agreement between the results of the two platforms in spite of these limitations the overall performance of eplex rp was comparable to that of the biofire rp with an overall percent agreement true-positive and true-negative results of 95 for all available targets tested in line with our results a recent study by nijhuis and colleagues evaluating the performance of the eplex research-use-only ruo rp panel compared to laboratory-developed assays found an overall agreement of 974 with discordant results occurring primarily for samples with low pathogen loads as estimated by using cycle threshold ct values ie high ct value 35 10the highest numbers of discordant results were observed for adenovirus coronavirus and rhinovirusenterovirus targets this finding may be explained by the large diversity of genotypes present within each of these groups of pathogens or the prevalence of these pathogens in the population tested for adenovirus the performance of diagnostic tests is particularly important for young children and immunocompromised hosts however the detection of adenovirus can be challenging in this study eplex rp detected more adenoviruses than did the biofire rp a recent report on the performance of biofire rp v17 for the detection of adenovirus highlighted the decreased sensitivity of the assay for samples with low viral loads or those positive for species a d and f 14although the eplex rp panel detects 4 genotypes of coronaviruses hku1 oc43 229e and nl63 results are reported without the genotyping information there are currently no treatments for coronaviruses and the utility of the genotyping information may lie in its value for epidemiological studies reports of severe coronavirus infections have been reported for immunocompromised hosts but there has not been any indication that severity is associated with a particular genotype 15similar to the biofire rp eplex rp detects a wide range of rhinovirus and enteroviruses genotypes but given their high degree of genetic similarity it does not reliably differentiate between these two species based on discordance analysis performed by pcr and bidirectional sequencing most samples were positive for rhinovirus a trend that is expected given that rhinoviruses are the most common cause of the common cold 16the overall agreement for influenza viruses was high as the prospective collection periods for this clinical study occurred during the 2013 and 2016 respiratory seasons there was an expected lack of clinical specimens positive for influenza a h1 virus 17 most of the influenza virus infections during that time period were due to the 2009 h1 and h3 viruses hence the evaluation of the influenza virus a h1 target was performed entirely by using contrived nps samples similar to the biofire rp results instances of samples positive for influenza a virus without subtypes or positive for an influenza a virus subtype only were identified such results may be caused by low virus titers or a novel influenza virus subtype and thus require additional testingonly a limited number of samples were positive for chlamydia pneumoniae and the evaluation was conducted primarily with contrived samples the performance for c pneumoniae was similar to that reported in the biofire rp clinical study which was also conducted by using primarily contrived samples 12 both chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae are associated with atypical community-acquired pneumonia cap with no seasonality and nonspecific symptoms 18 therefore the inclusion of both bacteria in large multiplex panels has the potential to significantly improve the diagnosis of capa notable difference between the eplex rp panel and the biofire rp is the absence of bordetella pertussis-bordetella parapertussis targets among the bacterial targets it is noteworthy that unlike other bacterial targets on the panel infection with bordetella
pertussis-b parapertussis has a relatively specific epidemiology with higher incidences typically being reported for children less than 2 months old and more recently for unvaccinated populations or vaccinated patients with waning immunity 19 thus exclusion from a highly multiplexed respiratory panel may be warranted in addition the utilization of the single-copy pertussis toxin promoter target ptxp in some multiplex panels has been shown to be less sensitive for the detection of b pertussis than pcr tests targeted to the multicopy is481 insertion sequence 20 as a result when b pertussis infection is suspected an fda-cleared b pertussis molecular test may be more appropriatesimilar to other broadly multiplexed respiratory panels the eplex rp panel allows the detection of coinfections in this study coinfections were identified in 55 of samples with human rhinovirusenterovirus being the most common virus detected in coinfected specimens the importance of detecting coinfections was highlighted in a recent study showing that viral-bacterial coinfection during severe cap in adults resulted in a more complicated disease course and was associated with complications 21 in other studies human rhinoviruses were frequently detected in association with bacterial pathogens in a hematopoietic stem cell transplant population suggesting that this commonly detected virus may be a significant cause of severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients 22 23the initial rate of invalid results with eplex rp was 48 with repeat testing resulting in a final rate of invalid results of 02 this value falls in the range of rates of invalid results reported for other multiplexed respiratory panels including nanosphere verigene rv 97 xtag rvp 1 to 2 and the biofire rp 1 to 3 2427the eplex instrument consists of a stand-alone system with no additional accessories eg computer and a touch screen making it a great option for space-constrained laboratories the eplex instrument is available in configurations ranging from one to four towers with each tower containing six random-access testing bays this supports single-shift 8 h testing volumes ranging from 24 samples to 96 samples with a tat of less than 2 h and an hot of less than 2 min providing a flexible capacity for laboratories of all sizes additional features available on the system include the ability to generate customized reports eg statistical and trending reports and the potential for a bidirectional interface with laboratory information systemsin conclusion the eplex rp panel provides a rapid sensitive broadly multiplexed sample-to-results option with minimal hands-on time the assay performance was equivalent to that of the biofire filmarray rp for all targets this new fully integrated instrument is easily expandable and offers a great option for the implementation of a multiplex assay in larger-volume laboratoriesthe coronavirus-induced respiratory disease 2019 covid-19 caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov outbreak at the end of 2019 in wuhan china1 it soon continuously impacts our daily life in all aspects worldwide alone the increasing infected numbers the death rates death person versus confirmed cases within selected area seem to be less than 3 but much higher in new burst out countries most of the aged people are in dangerous status especially the one also has served medical history the clinical symptoms of covid-19 may be found but not all in infected patients include fever infrared thermo-sensor can be used to detect high temperature persons coughing myalgia fatigue some with productive cough headache hemoptysis and even diarrhea some patients will have severe pneumonia with difficulty in respiration 18 calculated from record in china1 more recently some patients were found to be with a disability to distinguish smell andor tests neurological disorder so far there is no effective way to distinguish healthy one from infected targets even they do have some flu-like symptomsmoreover lots of sars-cov-2 infected patients are found asymptomatic since no one knows who has already been infected and becomes infectious to others they are at the same time freely to go out for their daily activities which unfortunately easily causes covid-19 transmission this situation causes a serious problem during the establishment of prevention network in every country in taiwan to avoid the false-negative case it requires at least three sequential negative tests of the sars-cov-2 before the case can be confirmed negative combined with the positive or negative result to influenza virus according to the taiwan model to quarantine any suspicious individuals for a period time according to the activities and contact history of the confirmed cases can efficiently slow down the transmission of covid-19 however it could profoundly disturb the daily life of a large population if related cases are confirmed positive for sars-cov-2 in general for personal epidemic prevention of covid-19 avoiding contact from hands nose and eyes and droplets is the primary task how to foresee the sars-cov-2 infected targets and to just isolate selected population for advanced treatments while keeping others healthy and free from quarantine is one of the important goals during this global war against sars-cov-2to develop a sars-cov-2 detection system that can accurately identify viral macromolecules either the rna genome or viral proteins the full understanding on the specific infection process of this virus is the first step also will benefit to the development of anti-sars-cov-2 drugs according to the current data the sars-cov-2 virus has similar infection route to the sars-cov24 both viruses utilize the surface protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 which expresses in certain types of human cells such as type 2 alveolar cells as a receptor for its spike protein to attach to the host cells3 the entry of the attached virus requires endocytosis through priming the s protein by host tmprss2 serine protease4 and is regulated by the ap2-associated protein kinase 1 aak1 disruption of aak1 might interrupt the entry of the virus into host cells and the intracellular assembly of virus particles5 the structures of several sars-cov related proteins including the spike proteins main protease of sars-cov-2 and ace268 have been resolved to provide valuable information for the following development of new detection sensors or even the design of anti-sars-cov-2 drugsin this review article we present available approaches that can identify sars-cov-2 from the routine laboratory tests to the rapid diagnostic tests with great application potential to help reducing the labor of routine laboratory test hopefully with proper applications of these tools we can finally stop the fast transmission of covid-19 in the whole worldthe major laboratory assay to confirm whether patients are infected with sars-cov-2 or not is through the nucleic acid amplification tests naats that is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr method carried out in the hospital or disease control center of the government in taiwan such method is relatively mature since the breakout of sars in 2003 however it still takes around 4 hours to get the results including 2 to 3 hours of reaction and around 1 hour of medical consultations and sampling moreover to carefully confirm the infection three regions of the sars-cov-2 rna sequences are selected for the assay coding region for spike protein orf1 and orf8 to shorten the reaction time some company tried to develop new instruments and related kits for this purpose for example the taqpath covid-19 combo kit thermo fisher scientific inc xpert xpress sars-cov-2 test cepheid and autosat with related kit etc these improvements may shorten the examination reaction within 15 hoursat protein level the detection time might be shortened since there is no excess time needed to amplify the detected signal on the other hand such protein level detection needs precise recognition and high sensitivity at least two groups claimed that they can detect the sars-cov-2 within 15 minutes9one group from guangzhou medical university china developed the test for patients serum to check if the patients have the specific antibody against sars-cov-2s antigen since this method is not a direct detection of sars-cov-2 virus there could exist blind spot when the samples are found to be negative two possible situations should be clarified one is that the case is not infected the other is that the case has not produced antibody against sars-cov-2 yetthe other group from genomics research center academia sinica taiwan developed a novel sensitive test with a specific monoclonal antibody mab immunoglobulin g against the nucleocapsid protein of sars-cov-2 the mab does not cross react with other sars related proteins from sars-cov or middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov this method can be quickly developed for application by applying the specific mab onto current commercially available test kit such as replacing the anti-flu antibody with the specific mab in flu test kit thus a rapid diagnostic test kit for sars-cov-2 will be soon produced for large demands nevertheless these new methods still need to be through clinical trials with real samples from suspected populations and infected cases through sampling from nasopharyngeal swab sputum or lower respiratory track aspiratein the meantime scientists around the world continuously introduced alternative methods for the detection of sars-cov-21012 for example a new powerful gene-editing tool clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crisprs technique has been applied to successfully detect synthetic sars-cov-2 rna sequences1112 as described in the latest reports the testing reaction can be restricted within 60 minutes with relatively low cost12 such proof of concept idea has been emerged and will also be tested in the real samples to confirm its detection efficacymore recently a unique idea that combines a modified rna amplification reverse transcription enzymatic recombinase amplification rt-era and a fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret-based probe was proposed13 the key to this new method is to use fam and bhq1 as a fret quenching pair which means that bhq1 will quench the fluorescence of fam when they are located close together a specific exonuclease ii recognizing thf site will be utilized to cut the double-strand status due to targeted rna sensed the rna of sars-cov-2 such exo fret probe is designed to be located within the targeted amplicon once this cut happens it allows the restore of the fam fluorescence since the quencher bhq1 leaves the authors claim that the sensing limit of this ultrasensitive detection method can be as low as 032 am 032  1018 m of rna13from the above descriptions on various types of detection methods for sars-cov-2 rrt-pcr is still taking the heavy works corresponding for the official confirmation however the increased susceptive populations nearly exhaust the routine test procedure in many countries indeed some of the new emerged approaches has potential for the future rapid diagnostics to release the heavy loading of rrt-pcr test if their specificity and efficacy can be proved through clinical trial for example the antibody-based test developed by academia sinica has a great potential for fast exam since it can be adapted in the commercial flu-like test the challenge will be the amplification of mab which is the rate-limit stage for large production of this kit on the other hand another novel method combining a modified rna amplification technique with fret quenching concept provide convincing results for future usage finally in addition to the above example the fret-based strategy can also be applied to detect the binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein to human ace2 receptor or the activity of sars-cov-2 protease using specific peptide sequence as substrate between the fret pair fluorescent proteinsthis study was supported by ministry of science and technology of taiwan most 105-2320-b-075-002 108-2745-8-075-001- and taipei veterans general hospitalswe would like to acknowledge drs robeth viktoria manurung yu-fen chang chien-chang huang for the suggestions on the articleon march 10 2020 the world health organization declared a global pandemic due to widespread infection with novel coronavirus covid19 coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 initial testing protocols from the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc for covid19 for detection in patients with possible infection recommend that samples also should be first sent for influenza viruses along with respiratory panels for detection of parainfluenza virus adenovirus human rhinovirus respiratory syncytial virus bordetella pertussis chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae

the problem with testing for coinfections in suspected covid19 patients is that the presence of a positive upper respiratory pathogen nucleic acid detection rpna test for viruses other than sarscov2 may suggest to the clinicians alternate explanations for the patients symptoms the cdc continues to strongly encourage to test for other causes of respiratory illness
1
 therefore a positive rpna test could potentially lead to failure to test for covid19 thereby increasing exposure risks if a patient has a coinfectioninitial investigations of patients with covid19 in wuhan china showed a low to nonexistent rate of coinfection with other respiratory viral pathogens
2
 
3
 however a more recent study in presumably cooler climates have shown an increasing presence of coinfections up to 50 typically influenza or rhinovirus
4

because of the large variations in data and the lack of experience with comprehensive testing for covid19 along with other respiratory pathogens we elected to look retrospectively at our own experience with testing such data could help in weighing the pros and cons of strategies or algorithms that involve respiratory pathogen panels or flu testing as a decision point for covid19 testingthis study is a retrospective analysis of data from an academic medical center with 2 hospitals and 2 urgent care centers in san diego california during the initial 2 weeks of sarscov2 testing march 10 2020 to march 23 2020 the hospitals have collective inpatient beds of 1000 with 85000 emergency department ed visits each year and the urgent care uc centers have about 28000 visits each year all located in suburban communities in the region this study was approved by the institutions human subject protections programcovid19 testing was targeted toward highrisk patients with the following known criteria as per the cdc guidelines that were consistent during the study period patients presenting with symptoms concerning for covid19 infection fever and cough or shortness of breath travel within 14 days to countries with high rates of infection at that time china iran italy japan and south korea or risk factors for infectious complications including age or comorbid conditions or the patient was a health care worker who could potentially expose others at risk patients with suspected covid19 had nasal and throatswab specimens from the upper respiratory tract obtained and maintained in viraltransport medium samples had sarscov2 confirmed by realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr eplex sarscov2 test genmark diagnostics carlsbad caon all patients suspected of covid19 ed clinicians were encouraged to simultaneously collect an rpna or influenza test if that was positive it would lessen the suspicion for covid although formal testing was pending sample pharyngeal swabs were often simultaneously tested for rapid influenza direct antigen testing abbott diagnostics chicago us andor an rpna test via rtpcr genmark eplex respiratory pathogens panel which tests for the following viruses and other organisms adenovirus nonsarscov2 coronavirus 229e hku1 nl63 oc43 metapneumovirus rhinovirusenterovirus influenza a h1n1 h12009 h3 influenza b parainfluenza

3
 therefore it would make sense to not only suspect covid19 if prevalent but also be suspicious for other respiratory illnesses such as influenza influenza was still active in the region with 500 cases reported a week during the first 2 weeks of march with the majority being influenza a a positive test for other respiratory pathogens on routine flu swab or rpna could easily result in diagnosing a routine viral illness and potentially missing sarscov2 the cause of covid19 therefore early testing strategies incorporating stepwise screening have the potential to miss many cases if covid19 becomes an epidemic within any localitycoinfection with other respiratory viruses before covid19 has been described and should not be surprising one study found that there was codetection of 2 or more viruses in 78 of patients requiring hospitalization for respiratory illness
5
 of those coinfection with human coronavirus nonsarscov2 together had an increased association with pediatric icu admission adults also have been reported to have coinfections at a much lower rate with 1 study showing only 2 of 232 outpatients with communityacquired pneumonia testing positive for dual viral pathogens
6
 so in a noncovid19 series respiratory coinfection with 1 viral pathogen occurs but rarely in adultsthe low rate of coinfection or codetection of other respiratory pathogens in covidpositive patients is consistent with what was seen in wuhan initially
2
 
3
 one study showed that none of the 99 initial sarscov2 positive patients had any other respiratory viruses detectable on pharyngeal swabs rtpcr for influenza a b rsv parainfluenza adenovirus severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndromemers
2
 another series of 41 sarscov2positive patients had respiratory specimens tested for common viruses including rsv adenovirus parainfluenza sars and mers using realtime rtpcr assays approved by the china food and drug administration
3
 although not explicitly stated they reported no coinfections in their sarscov2positive patientsmore recent studies show that in fact coinfection is not entirely zero as initially thought researchers described how all covid19positive patients from both quingdao and wuhan were simultaneously tested with indirect immunofluorescence for serum immunoglobulin m antibodies that detect the following 9 common respiratory pathogens rsv adenovirus influenza a and b parainfluenza mycoplasma chlamydia legionella and coxiella
4
 of the 230 patients admitted in qingdao 24 had immunoglobulin m antibodies against other respiratory pathogens for a positive coinfection rate of 80 versus only 26 1 in the 38 patients from wuhan of note the most common coinfections detected were influenza a 60 and b 53 followed by m pneumoniae and l pneumophila this is starting to be seen in other areas of the world including the simultaneous presence of influenza and sarscov2
7

in published series so far for adults influenza is the most common coinfection seen in sarscov2positive patients as was seen in our single case a recent series of 116 sarscov2positive samples from northern california showed an astounding rate of 75 24 with 1 or more nonsarscov2 pathogens
8
 the most common coinfections were rhinovirusenterovirus rsv and nonsarscov2 coronaviridae there are no details on testing platform which in addition to local epidemiology could explain the stark difference in results the reason some areas may have more coinfections may depend on the seasonal prevalence of other viruses because of weather or other epidemiological factorsmost of the initial studies looking at coinfection were in adults pediatric studies show a higher rate of coinfection than seen in most adult series in a series of 20 sarscov2positive patients 8 40 had other pathogens detected on pharyngeal pcr swabs
9
 the predominant coinfections were influenza a and b 15 and mycoplasma 20 on pharyngeal respiratory viral swabsto conserve resources the cdc and many local health authorities including hospital systems have recommended to test for flu andor respiratory pathogens in patients being screened for suspected covid19
1
 if those are negative then one is to proceed with covid19 testing unfortunately that strategy would have missed the 1 covid19 case in our series who tested positive for flu as well based on the increasing reports of higher coinfection rates and the advent of more expanded testing one cannot recommend that as a general screening strategy although only 1 viral coinfection of 51 patients positive for sarscov2 was detected the upper limit of the 95 confidence interval for 151 196 extends as high at 103 therefore it is not surprising that that sarscov2 is being added to the next iteration of the diagnostic testing assay for respiratory pathogens which will prove most useful as this pandemic unfoldstherefore based on our experience and review of the literature in patients with respiratory illness who need testing for sarscov2 or another respiratory virus one should consider testing for both sarscov2 regardless of preliminary testing if done and for flu or other respiratory pathogens as this new virus continues to be a common cause of respiratory infection any patient with cough dyspnea andor fever should be suspect for covid19 regardless of the preliminary testing results for other respiratory pathogensthe authors declare no conflicts of interestedward m castillo christopher j coyne and christian a tomaszewski contributed to conception and design of the study edward m castillo and jesse j brennan led development of the data analysis plan jesse j brennan conducted the data analysis edward m castillo and christian a tomaszewski drafted the article which all authors reviewed revised and approvedin pediatric patients respiratory viruses rvs are considered important pathogens in acute respiratory tract infections resulting in hospitalization and acute care visits 123 for which diagnostic evaluations for rvs are frequently performed 4 however diagnostic evaluations for rvs are rarely performed in adult patients because such viruses cause only benign respiratory tract infections 4 recently with the advent of more sensitive molecular techniques clinical cases of pneumonia associated with variable rvs have been reported with increasing frequency in adult patients 56 the importance of rvs in adult patients has also been emphasized with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome avian influenza a h5n1 and pandemic influenza h1n1 in 2009 3 in the near future rv detection tests may be considered an essential part of the diagnostic work-up for adult patients with acute respiratory tract infections however physicians treating adult patients are not yet familiar with rv detection tests we investigated the current utilization of a multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr test for rvs in adult patients in clinical practice the multiplex rt-pcr test allows the detection of a large number of rvs simultaneously with a higher sensitivity than viral culture 7 we hypothesized that utilization data and results from current multiplex rt-pcr tests would be helpful in identifying the benefits and problems associated with multiplex rt-pcr utilization in adult patientsthis study was performed at chung-ang university hospital an 850-bed tertiary care teaching hospital in seoul republic of korea adult patients  16 years of age who underwent multiplex rt-pcr testing between january 2012 and april 2013 were identified and their electronic medical records and chest radiographs reviewed demographic characteristics underlying diseases multiplex rt-pcr results the presence of respiratory symptoms and clinical outcomes were investigatedan upper respiratory infection uri was defined as the presence of  1 of the following respiratory symptoms cough sputum production rhinorrhea sore throat and dyspnea pneumonia was defined as the presence of a new or progressive infiltrate on chest radiography plus two or more of the following symptoms or signs fever sputum production rhinorrhea sore throat dyspnea and the attending physicians diagnosis of pneumonia a nonrespiratory infection nri was defined as neither a uri nor pneumonia if a patient had an episode of acute infection within 2 days after admission and underwent multiplex rt-pcr testing for the episode he or she was considered to have received a test for a community-acquired infection the flu season was defined as between january and april in 2012 and between january and april in 2013 the flu season was determined based on the weekly surveillance reports for influenza and other respiratory viruses of the korea centers

usastatistical analyses were performed using spss version 180 spss inc chicago il usa continuous variables were compared using student t test or the mann-whitney u test categorical variables were compared using a chi-square test or fisher exact testduring the study period multiplex rt-pcr testing was performed for 291 respiratory samples from 282 adult patients during the same period rapid influenza antigen detection tests were performed for 5890 nasopharyngeal swab samples and bacterial cultures were performed for 38195 respiratory samples in the study hospital thus the frequency of multiplex rt-pcr testing was only 49 of rapid influenza antigen detection tests and 08 of respiratory bacterial cultures the mean turnaround time for the 81 positive multiplex rt-pcr tests was 661 hours sd 242 range 204 to 1197 a turnaround time of  48 hours was observed in 259 2181 of the 81 positive tests the characteristics of the 291 cases are summarized in table 1 the mean patient age was 595 years and more than half were male 176 605 the most common underlying disease was diabetes mellitus 179 followed by chronic lung disease 79 solid tumor 76 hematologic malignancy 52 and chronic renal failure 38 multiplex rt-pcr testing was performed most frequently in cases of pneumonia 584 followed by uri 213 and nri 203 the majority of multiplex rt-pcr tests were performed for admitted patients 979 with community-acquired infections 842 during the flu season 825 patients who underwent multiplex rt-pcr for an nri had the following diseases urinary tract infections acute gastroenteritis acute hepatitis febrile neutropenia meningitis mediastinitis pulmonary tuberculosis mumps chickenpox acute cholangitis escherichia coli bacteremia of unknown origin enteric fever clostridium difficile infection acute appendicitis cellulitis cervical lymphadenitis hemorrhagic cystitis cerebrovascular accidents seizure hyperventilation syndrome and angina in patients with an nri multiplex rt-pcr testing was performed due to the presence of a fever of unknown origin during the flu or nonflu seasonthe list of detected rvs is presented in table 2 rvs were identified in 81 of 291 samples 278 with influenza as the most commonly identified 4781 580 influenza 274 vs 141 p  002 and human coronavirus 64 vs 12 p  004 were more frequently detected in patients with a uri than in those with pneumonia the rates of rv positivity were not different between patients with community- and hospital-acquired infections 286 vs 239 p  052 for any individual rv there was no difference between the rates of rv positivity in community- and hospital-acquired infections of 59 patients with an nri 12 203 had positive multiplex rt-pcr results for influenza 6 adenovirus 2 parainfluenza virus 2 human enterovirus 2 hrv 1 and rsv 1the characteristics of the 166 patients with pneumonia four duplicates excluded who underwent multiplex rt-pcr testing were compared according to pathogen type table 3 approximately one quarter of these patients had an rv infection 265 44166 and a bacterial infection 241 40166 respectively nine patients 54 9166 had bacterialviral coinfections the remaining 91 patients 548 had no identified pathogen in patients with an rv infection 20 had rvs other than influenza 2044 454 patients with a single rv infection and those without an rv infection did not differ in terms of their baseline characteristics underlying diseases symptoms and in-hospital mortality except that rhinorrhea was more frequently observed in patients with a single rv infection during the flu season in patients coinfected with an rv and a bacterium rsv and hematologic malignancy were more common features than in patients infected with a single rv the in-hospital mortality rates were higher in patients with a bacterialviral coinfection 889 than in those without an rv infection 164 and with a single rv infection 114multiplex rt-pcr testing was performed primarily for adult patients with community-acquired respiratory infections admitted to a tertiary care center during the flu season and especially for patients with pneumonia the test was performed infrequently and the test results were often reported late the rv-positive rate 286 for community-acquired infections was not different from that for hospital-acquired infections 239 p  052 rvs were identified in more than a quarter 265 of the 166 patients with pneumonia nearly half of the patients with rv-associated pneumonia had rvs other than influenza 2044 454in our hospital multiplex rt-pcr testing was most frequently performed for adult patients with community-acquired respiratory infections admitted during the flu season thus the test was primarily used to diagnose influenza in adult patients especially those with pneumonia for clinicians who experienced the influenza a h1n1 pandemic in 2009 the use of multiplex rt-pcr as a diagnostic test for influenza infection is understandable at other hospitals the perception of multiplex rt-pcr testing by physicians may be similar given the predominance of influenza among rvs and the presence of effective anti-influenza therapies 9 therefore the multiplex rt-pcr test should be performed to diagnose influenza during the flu season especially considering the low sensitivity of rapid influenza antigen detection tests 9 however in our hospital the multiplex rt-pcr test was performed infrequently compared to rapid influenza antigen detection tests additionally the test was rarely performed in outpatient departments at the study hospital these findings are understandable given that the test results are not available on-site unlike the rapid influenza antigen detection test moreover the test is not covered by national health insurance of south korea and is relatively expensive more than 100000 krw compared to the cost of a respiratory bacterial culture 21619 krw or the rapid influenza antigen detection test 18000 to 28000 krw consequently infrequent ordering resulted in less routine pcr testing in the clinical laboratory not every day but three times a week at our hospital this may explain why a turnaround time of  48 hours was observed in only 259 of the positive tests forty-eight hours is the most appropriate time period for the introduction of anti-influenza drugs after the onset of symptoms 9 considering these problems and the continuous threat of influenza infection our current utilization of multiplex rt-pcr testing requires improvement which may increase the diagnostic sensitivity for influenza and decrease the number of patients who receive delayed therapyin our study the rv positivity rate for community-acquired infections did not differ from that for hospital-acquired infections there were no differences in viral pathogens between community- and hospital-acquired infections in a recent study of viral infections in patients with severe pneumonia requiring intensive care unit admission patients with community-acquired pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia had similar rates of rv positivity 406 vs 343 and similar rv pathogens 6 regarding these findings experts suggest that rv infections are not directly influenced by previous healthcare interventions or exposure to antimicrobial agents but rather they mirror circulating viruses in the community 10 although hospital-acquired infections and healthcare-associated infections are different a similar explanation may be applied to our findings considering the frequent detection of rvs in our patients with a hospital-acquired infection multiplex rt-pcr testing should not be limited to patients with community-acquired respiratory infections the test may be required for patients with serious hospital-acquired respiratory infections of unknown cause based on our study findings the test may be needed for hospital rv infection control 4 although the turnaround time may not be optimal for that purposethe causal role of rvs other than influenza has not been determined in adult patients with pneumonia and effective treatment with antiviral agents is largely unavailable in clinical practice thus the detection of rvs other than influenza may be regarded as unnecessary for adult patients with pneumonia especially during the non-flu season considering the fact that the multiplex rt-pcr test represented only 08 of sputum bacterial culture tests however clinical studies of pneumonia associated with rvs other than influenza have reported increased infection rates in both immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients 35611121314 additionally a few antiviral agents are recommended for severe pneumonia caused by rvs other than influenza especially in immunocompromised patients 315 in this study although most of the tests were performed for the diagnosis of influenza infection during the flu season rvs other than influenza were found in 454 2044 of the patients with rv-associated pneumonia furthermore in more than half 69 of the patients with a bacterialviral coinfection rvs other than influenza including rsv hmpv and hrv were detected this group of coinfected patients had higher rates of mortality than either the group with a single rv infection or the group without an rv infection although the association with higher mortality may be due to more serious underlying diseases such as hematologic malignancy 222 and the impact of bacterial infections in this group the significance of rvs other than influenza should not be neglected the clinical significance of rsv hmpv and hrv in adult patients with pneumonia has recently been reported 16171819 our study suggests that rvs other than influenza should be considered in adult patients with pneumonia and that the clinical impact of these rvs should be evaluated in future clinical studiesin our study 203 of patients with an nri had positive multiplex rt-pcr test results the clinical presentation of an rv infection may vary according either to the pathogenic potential of the rv or the degree of host immunity against rvs and respiratory symptoms or signs in some patients with an rv infection may be minimal or absent asymptomatic carriers of rvs are another possible explanation as suggested in a previous study 11this study has several limitations first it was not designed to compare the clinical management outcomes and medical costs of patients who underwent multiplex rt-pcr testing with patients who did not thus our study does not include direct evidence for the clinical usefulness of the multiplex rt-pcr test for rvs prior studies have shown conflicting results for the cost-effectiveness of the multiplex rt-pcr test 4 additional studies are required before the multiplex rt-pcr test for rvs can be strongly recommended in south korea second the platform for multiplex rt-pcr testing was changed during the study period which might have affected the multiplex rt-pcr results and the positivity rates however the rv7 test was performed only in 240 of 291 cases third clinical data were retrospectively collected unrecognized clinical factors may have resulted in biases in the study analysis fourth our data cannot be generalized to other centers with different characteristicsin conclusion the multiplex rt-pcr test was performed most frequently for adult patients admitted for community-acquired respiratory infections during the flu season at a tertiary care center the test was performed infrequently and reporting of the test results was often delayed the utilization of multiplex rt-pcr testing should be encouraged to more effectively diagnose infections with influenza and other rvs both inside and outside the hospital
influenza virus influenza viruses have segmented rna genomes and are classified as type a b or c the 2 envelope glycoproteins are important targets of neutralizing antibody 5 hemagglutinin h initiates infectivity by binding to cellular sialic acid residues and neuraminidase n protein cleaves newly synthesized virus from sialic acid on cell surfaces allowing spread of virus to adjacent cells at least 16 antigenically distinct hemagglutinin h1h16 and 9 neuraminidase n1n9 molecules of influenza a have been identified h1h3 viruses cause most cases of human disease whereas the others generally are pathogens of aquatic birds and other mammals antigenic variation in h and n contributes to the epidemic nature of influenza by 2 mechanisms antigenic drift is due to minor changes in neutralizing epitopes of h and results in epidemics and necessitates annual adjustment of vaccine formulations antigenic shift occurs when 2 influenza a viruses exchange h or n genes during infection of the same host shifts with resultant influenza pandemics occurred in 1918 h1n1 virus 1957 h2n2 virus and 1968 h3n2 virusalthough annual winter epidemics occur predictably lasting 68 weeks in one locale time of onset and severity are highly variable influenza is efficiently transmitted via small particle aerosols generated by coughing and sneezing and has a 23-day incubation period which facilitates explosive outbreaks in closed settings such as nursing homes table 2 since 1977 h3n2 h1n1 and b viruses have circulated with epidemics of h3n2 infection causing the greatest morbidity in the elderly population older persons may be relatively resistant to severe h1n1 disease because of frequent exposure prior to 1957 the impact of influenza on the elderly population is substantial and is greatest among persons with chronic diseases it is estimated that at least 63 of the 300000 influenza-related hospitalizations and 85 of the 36000 influenza-related deaths in the united states involve persons aged 65 years a group that constitutes only 10 of the total population 6the clinical manifestations of influenza in elderly persons may differ from those of classic influenza ie abrupt fever myalgias and headache seen in younger adults with older persons having a lower frequency of upper respiratory tract symptoms among elderly outpatients cough fever and acute onset of illness had only a 30 positive predictive value in contrast to a positive predictive value of 78 for young adults 7 in a study of older adults hospitalized with documented influenza cough was nearly universal and fever temperature 38c was seen in 70 8 fever and altered mental status may be the only signs of influenza pneumonia in older persons with cognitive impairment gastrointestinal complaints fever and myalgias help to distinguish influenza from other winter respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus rsv table 3in the classic description of influenza-associated lower respiratory tract complications during the h2n2 pandemic of 19571958 louria et al 9 described 4 syndromes 1 no radiographic pneumonia 2 viral infection followed by bacterial pneumonia 3 rapidly progressive diffuse viral pneumonia and 4 concomitant viral-bacterial pneumonia today pure viral pneumonia is uncommon perhaps because prior infection and vaccination has induced immunity among older persons as well as the rarity of rheumatic heart disease we found that 26 of highly vaccinated elderly persons ie 90 in the community developed influenza each season of whom 5 had pneumonia only 30 of hospitalized patients with influenza have radiographic infiltrates whereas a equal percentage have findings consistent with congestive heart failure or other diseases 10 the true incidence of secondary bacterial pneumonia during influenza is unknown largely because there are difficulties involved in accurate diagnosis of bacterial infection in our recent study 10 bacterial infection was identified in 10 of hospitalized patients with influenza with only 1 episode of streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia dual viral-bacterial infections were more severe than were viral infections alone as evidence by higher rates of intensive care use and morbidity
rsv rsv is the secondmost commonly identified cause of viral pneumonia in older persons first isolated in 1956 from a chimpanzee with a cold it was subsequently shown to be the leading cause of lower respiratory infections in young children rsv is an rna virus belonging to the paramyxoviridae family and it causes characteristic syncytia formation in cell culture two major antigenic groups of rsv a and b cause annual winter epidemics of respiratory disease in temperate climates 11 unlike influenza virus rsv does not undergo major periodic antigenic changes and yet immunity is incomplete reinfection in young adults usually produces mild illness however the likelihood of severe disease and pneumonia increases with advancing agersv pneumonia was first described in older adults in the 1960s however it was not appreciated as a significant pathogen until outbreaks of infection in nursing homes were reported in the 1980s 12 rates of pneumonia and death ranged from 5 to 55 and 0 to 53 respectively in composite these studies indicate that 10 of nursing home residents develop rsv infection annually of whom 10 develop pneumoniarsv infection is also a problem among elderly persons who live in the community investigators at the centers for disease control and prevention linked viral surveillance data with national death databases and estimated that rsv infection accounts for 10000 deaths among elderly persons each year 13 in a study of 1200 adults with cap rsv 44 of cases was the thirdmost commonly identified pathogen compared with s pneumoniae 62 of cases influenza viruses a and b 54 of cases and mycoplasma pneumonia 41 14 we found that during each season rsv infection occurred in 37 of prospectively monitored healthy elderly persons and in 410 of high-risk adults pneumonia occurred in 27 of infected persons 10 in addition rsv infection accounted for 11 of winter discharge diagnoses for pneumoniathe clinical manifestations of rsv pneumonia are difficult to distinguish from those of other viral or bacterial pneumonias dyspnea and cough are common 6080 of cases but are not unique to rsv infection the typical rsv illness begins with nasal congestion which gradually progresses to wheezing and difficulty breathing compared with influenza rsv infection is more often associated with rhinorrhea sputum production and wheezing whereas fever and gastrointestinal complaints are more common with influenza table 3 14 15chest radiographs typically show patchy bilateral alveolar infiltrates and interstitial changes in culture-proven cases of rsv pneumonia infiltrates tend to be small and ill-defined although consolidation has been described 14 seventy percent of patients with rsv pneumonia have a normal wbc count compared with 55 of patients with atypical pneumonia and 40 of those with bacterial pneumonia eleven percent to 30 of rsv-infected patients may have evidence of mixed viral-bacterial infection
human metapneumovirus hmpv hmpv is a newly described respiratory pathogen that was identified by dutch researchers in 2001 in young children with respiratory illnesses resembling rsv bronchiolitis 16 hmpv is an rna virus belonging to the paramyxoviridae family and metapneumovirus genus and it has worldwide distribution with universal infection by the age of 5 years in temperate climates the virus circulates predominantly in the winter months overlapping with other seasonal viruses several studies suggest there may be significant year-to-year variation in incidence rates 17because hmpv is a newly identified virus clinical data are still relatively limited and most studies describe children with bronchiolitis and pneumonia asymptomatic infection colds asthma exacerbations and flulike illnesses have been documented in older children and healthy young adults 18 comprehensive studies of hmpv as a cause of cap among adults have not yet been published in a 2-year study of elderly subjects and high-risk adults hmpv infection was identified in 41 with rt-pcr and serologic testing used for diagnoses 17 impact was greatest among those with cardiopulmonary diseases who were ill twice as long as healthy elderly subjects of the hospitalized persons 25 had infiltrates noted on chest radiographs illness may be more severe in frail elderly subjects as evidenced by a canadian study in which pneumonia was documented in 40 of hmpv-infected nursing home residents 19the clinical characteristics of hmpv pneumonia in older adults do not appear to be distinctive from those of illness due to other winter respiratory viruses hmpv infection may be somewhat less severe than rsv infection and influenza with lower rates of mechanical ventilation and death noted in one study 17
parainfluenza viruses pivs pivs are paramyxoviruses that cause croup bronchitis and pneumonia in young children piv type 3 infection is endemic year round and infections due to piv types 1 and 2 tend to peak during the fall months 11 infection recurs throughout adulthood accounting for 115 of acute respiratory illnesses with occasional reports of pneumonia in young adults in the elderly population piv has been less well studied than rsv but pneumonia has been reported 20 investigators in sweden found that 11 of community-dwelling elderly persons with pneumonia and 7 of those with acute respiratory tract illness had serologic evidence of recent infection due to piv type 1 or 3 21 prospective studies in nursing homes have documented piv infection in 414 of respiratory illnesses and fatal cases of bronchopneumonia have been reported 22 piv has also been implicated as a precursor to an outbreak of invasive pneumococcal disease in a long-term care facility clinical syndromes characterized by fever rhinorrhea cough and sore throat are not distinctive
coronaviruses coronaviruses are rna viruses that derive their name from the crown-like appearance of club-shaped surface proteins they were discovered in 1965 and are second to rhinoviruses as a cause of the common cold studies of human illness have been limited by the inability to grow the virus under routine conditions over the past 4 decades oc43 and 229e strain infections have been diagnosed in all age groups by serologic testing 23 recently 2 new human strains nl63 and hku1 were identified by rt-pcr 24 25 interest in coronaviruses intensified in 2002 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic which spread quickly from china and was proven to be due to a novel coronavirus sars-covoc43 and 229e most often occur in late winter and early spring demonstrating 23-year periodicity 26 in healthy adults infection is characterized by low-grade fever malaise and nasal symptoms pneumonia has been reported in young children immunocompromised patients and elderly persons 27 28 coronaviruses were identified by rt-pcr in 17 of elderly persons in the community with acute respiratory illnesses in a recent dutch study and 50 of patients had lower respiratory tract symptoms 28 most studies to date have not reported radiographic findings thus the frequency of coronavirus pneumonia remains unknown
rhinoviruses rhinoviruses the most frequent cause of the common cold circulate throughout the year but activity peaks in the fall and spring infections are common among persons of all ages including elderly persons and account for 2550 respiratory illnesses among community-dwelling elderly individuals 29 outbreaks have also been documented in long-term care facilities and senior daycare centers 30 31 prominent nasal congestion cough and constitutional symptoms characterize illnesses the role of rhinoviruses in pneumonia remains somewhat controversial because replication is restricted at core body temperature rhinoviruses were once dismissed as a cause of pneumonia recent evidence indicates that rhinoviruses can be recovered from lower airways after experimental challenge and cases of pneumonia have been described in very young children and severely immunocompromised patients 32 comprehensive studies of older adults with cap using new sensitive molecular techniques have yet to be performedviral diagnostic methods include culture rapid antigen detection rt-pcr and serologic testing with availability and sensitivity varying on the basis of the specific virus respiratory secretions appropriate for testing include nasal swab or wash specimens sputum specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples nasal wash samples the preferred sample for children are difficult to obtain in frail or cognitively impaired elderly persons although they are slightly less sensitive than washes nasal swab samples are acceptable alternativesviral culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis and is available in many clinical laboratories but optimal results require prompt transportation of the specimen on ice for immediate inoculation influenza is relatively hardy and grows well in culture but the 23 days required for detection is unsatisfactory when one must make decisions regarding antiviral therapy culture is insensitive for diagnosis of rsv infection because rsv is labile and adults typically shed low titers pivs and rhinoviruses can be detected by culture using standard techniques but hmpv and coronaviruses have special growth requirements necessitating research facilities for isolationrapid antigen testing is commercially available for influenza viruses a and b and rsv offers immediate results and in some cases can be done at the point of care for diagnosis of influenza in adults these tests offer a sensitivity of 5060 and specificity of 90 many institutions screen patients with rapid tests and only perform culture if rapid testing is negative this allows quick identification of many patients while not sacrificing the sensitivity of culture given the rate of false-negative results for rapid tests patients for whom influenza is highly suspected during epidemics should be isolated and treated with antivirals if appropriate while awaiting culture results 5 rapid rsv antigen tests are useful in young children who shed high titers of virus but results are disappointing in adults compared with serologic tests and rt-pcr the sensitivity of commercially available tests is low 020rt-pcr is very sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of all the common respiratory viruses and has been pivotal in defining adult disease for rsv hmpv rhinoviruses and coronaviruses although rapid these assays are expensive and not widely available outside of major medical centers however a multiplex rt-pcr hexaplex prodes is commercially available for the diagnosis of infection due to multiple common respiratory virusesbecause infection with respiratory viruses with the exception of sars-cov represents reinfection in adults the presence of preexisting antibody precludes a single serologic test to detect igg antibody igm assays have generally not been useful serologic testing provides retrospective diagnosis when a 4-fold increase in a specific antibody is detected by complement fixation or eia because rhinovirus has 100 serotypes serologic testing is impractical for diagnosis whereas serologic tests for detection of hmpv and coronavirus are only available in research settingsbecause of overlapping clinical syndromes diagnosis of viral pneumonia requires laboratory confirmation this is particularly important for influenza because treatment is available and infection-control issues arise in hospitals and nursing homes figure 1 therefore during the winter months we recommend screening by rapid antigen tests for patients who are admitted to the hospital and residents of long-term care facilities who have suspicious clinical syndromes once influenza is active in the community we recommend screening all patients with pneumonia with rapid tests followed by influenza culture if the results of the rapid test are negative full respiratory viral cultures and rt-pcr are desirable to identify other viral pathogens but if resources are limited these tests may be restricted to immunocompromised or severely ill patients for whom use of unproven therapies is sometimes attempted because of its retrospective nature serologic testing is more useful for investigation of nursing home outbreaks of respiratory disease rather than for individual patient carefour antivirals amantadine rimantadine zanamivir and oseltamavir have been approved for the treatment of influenza table 4 amantadine and rimantadine are active against influenza a whereas zanamivir and oseltamavir are active against both influenza a and b these agents are 7090 effective for prophylaxis and also reduce illness severity duration of symptoms and viral shedding when given 48 h after symptom onset in uncomplicated influenza cns adverse effects limit the utility of amantadine in the elderly population as does the issue of resistance which develops quickly for both amantadine and rimantadine zanamivir and oseltamivir are associated with fewer adverse effects although zanamivir should be avoided in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and those with asthma because of bronchospasm 5 the benefit of antiviral agents for influenza pneumonia is unknown because placebo-controlled trials for pneumonia have not been conducted although definitive data are lacking most authorities feel that it is reasonable to administer an antiviral agent to elderly patients who are hospitalized with influenza pneumoniathe treatment of rsv pneumonia in elderly adults is largely supportive antiviral therapy with aerosolized ribavirin and rsv-specific immunoglobulin have been approved for high-risk infants but no controlled data are available in adults 11 12 although the general use of ribavirin cannot be recommended use of this agent may be considered in selected cases such as those involving immunocompromised patients anecdotal experience suggests that for adults who are not undergoing intubation high-dose short-duration therapy 60 mgml for 2 h given by mask 3 times a day is better tolerated than tent treatment ribavirin has in vitro activity against piv and hmpv but there are no clinical data involving humans no antivirals are approved for the treatment of coronavirus and rhinovirus infectionsimmunization remains the most effective means of reducing morbidity and mortality associated with influenza in the elderly population currently 2 vaccines are available standard trivalent inactivated killed virus vaccine and the recently introduced live attenuated virus vaccine 5 most studies have shown a 3050 reduction in influenza hospitalization rates when there is a good antigenic match between the vaccine and circulating strain 33 in a study of nearly 300000 community-living elderly subjects administration of trivalent inactivated virus vaccine was associated with 4850 reduction in the rate of deaths due to all causes and with significant reductions in rates of hospitalization for pneumonia and influenza cardiac disease and stroke compared with rates among nonimmunized persons 34 in contrast a recent analysis found no decrease in morbidity and mortality rates among older persons even as vaccine uptake increased from 20 in 1980 to 65 in 2001 suggesting that better influenza vaccines are still needed 35 although live attenuated virus vaccine is efficacious in young children and adults aged 49 years the vaccine has not been studied in older persons 5 currently there are no licensed rsv vaccines for children or adultstransmission of influenza may occur via small particle aerosols and thus respiratory isolation of patients with documented or suspected influenza during periods of high influenza activity is appropriate hand washing is also very important especially for patients who are receiving amantadine or rimantadine to prevent nosocomial spread of drug-resistant virus the other major respiratory viruses are spread via fomites and large particle droplets therefore respiratory isolation is not requiredin summary viruses account for a substantial portion of cases of respiratory illness and pneumonia in the elderly population as diagnostic tests continue to improve new agents and the relative importance of known agents may change presently influenza virus a h3n2 and rsv are the most-commonly identified viral pathogens in older adults with viral pneumonia because clinical features and periods of peak activity overlap during the winter months laboratory confirmation of influenza is recommended for seriously ill or institutionalized patientsthe fight against infectious diseases caused by viruses remains a challenging and endless task despite the tremendous efforts and significant advances in public healthcare infectious diseases pose a significant risk to human health and have led to approximately one-fourth of deaths worldwide 12 coronaviruses belong to the family of coronaviridae and may cause respiratory and neurological diseases 3 until now six human coronaviruses hcovs have been identified namely hcov-229e hcov-hku1 hcov-oc43 hcov-nl63 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov 4 in particular sars-cov and mers-cov once caused pandemic 5recently the emergence of novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has been challenging the global public health community to confront a novel infectious disease coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 as of 22 february 2020 there were 77816 confirmed cases of covid-19 and 2012 deaths httpswwwworldometersinfocoronavirus in this epidemic the detections of sars-cov-2 rna were shown to be useful for the early diagnosis of covid-19 which would be beneficial to controling the sources of infection and help patients to prevent the illness progression the rapid and accurate detection of coronavirus is therefore becoming increasingly importantwith the advance in molecular biology technology nucleic acid detection methods have developed rapidly and become a revolutionary technology for virus detection especially the method based on polymerase chain reaction pcr is characterized by rapid detection high sensitivity and specificity which has been regarded as the gold standard for virus detection novel pcr-based methods also have been reported to enhance both the specificity and sensitivity of the assay besides several molecular tests which employ non-pcr-based methods such as isothermal nucleic acid amplification loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification were developed for the detection of coronavirus rna in this work we reviewed various approaches currently available for detection of coronavirus it is anticipated that this will assist researchers to develop rapid and accurate detection techniquespcr is an enzymatic method to produce numerous copies of a gene by separating the two strands of the dna containing the gene segment marking its location with a primer and using a dna polymerase to assemble a copy alongside each segment and continuously copy the copies it is widely used to amplify minute quantities of biologic materials so as to provide adequate specimens for laboratory study owing to its large range of applications high sensitivity and high sequence specificity the pcr-based method has become a routine and reliable technique for detecting coronaviruses 67 generally coronavirus rna is transferred into cdna by reverse transcription afterwards the pcr is performed and followed by the detection of pcr product through specific detection methods or instruments among these gel visualization and sequencing after pcr are the conventional methods for the detection of coronaviruses 89 however due to its time-consuming process and high cost these methods are not commonly used in clinical samplesreal-time reverse transcriptase-pcr rt-pcr detection is currently favored for the detection of coronavirus because of its advantages as a specific and simple quantitative assay moreover real-time rt-pcr is more sensitive than the conventional rt-pcr assay which helps much for the diagnosis in early infection 1011 therefore the real-time rt-pcr assay still is a predominant method to be applied for the detection of all kinds of coronaviruses 1213 including sars-cov-2 14even so massive efforts are invested to improve the real-time rt-pcr assay since the rt-pcr methods are prone to contamination and require time-consuming sample handling and post-pcr analysis van elden et al 15 described a taqman-based real-time rt-pcr that can easily be implemented in the routine diagnostic setting for the detection of hcov moreover to further improve the sensitivity yip et al 16 designed a real-time quantitative rt-pcr assay for sars-cov with the use of 2 taqman probes instead of 1 probe this simple modification using dual taqman probes for quantification has wide applications in areas in which ultrasensitivity is critically required with the sars-cov detection limit of 1 copy rna per reactionin clinical detection the lack of safe and stable external positive controls epc could become a serious problem in the diagnosis of coronavirus and plenty of attention has been focused to address this problem however such problems could be well avoided in real-time rt-pcr assays where epc is an important component yu et al 17 developed a real-time rt-pcr assay in which the armored rna was used as epc to detect the sars-cov with a detection limit of 10 copiesl meanwhile the rapidly mutating nature of coronaviruses highlights the need for accurate detection of genetically diverse coronaviruses therefore to improve the ability to detect coronavirus precisely and reduce the risk of eliciting false-negative results caused by genome sequence variations researchers have established multiplex real-time rt-pcr methods with favorable sensitivity for multitarget detection of coronavirus hadjinicolaou et al 18 developed a real-time rt-pcr assay using mismatch-tolerant molecular beacons to distinguish between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains the assay incorporated four beacons targeting four genes in addition to an internal positive control it was validated using clinical samples which exhibited target detection ability and specificity with detection limit of 5 copies per reactionthe lamp is a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method with high efficiency it is commonly used for the amplification of dnas and rnas which exhibits great sensitivity and high specificity as a result of its exponential amplification feature and 6 different target sequences identified by 4 different primers simultaneously respectively 19 the lamp assay is rapid and does not require expensive reagents or instruments therefore the application of lamp test might help to reduce the cost for detection of coronavirus 20 herein a number of lamp-based coronavirus detection methods have been developed and applied in clinical diagnosisgel electrophoresis is commonly used to analyze the amplified products for an endpoint detection poon et al 21 reported a simple lamp assay for sars diagnosis and demonstrated the feasibility of using this technology for detection of sars-cov the orf1b region of sars-cov was chosen for sars diagnosis and amplified by lamp reaction in the presence of 6 primers then the amplified products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis the detection rates and the sensitivity for sars-cov in the lamp assay are similar to those of conventional pcr-based methods pyrc et al 22 successfully applied lamp to the detection of hcov-nl63 which was conducted by agarose gel electrophoresis with favorable sensitivity and specificity in cell cultures and clinical specimens notably the detection limit was found to be 1 copy of rna template per reactionamplification can be detected as the precipitation of magnesium pyrophosphate or fluorescence dye this enables the methods to be carried out in real time by monitoring the turbidity of the pyrophosphate or fluorescence which has effectively overcome the limitations of the endpoint detection 23 a useful rt-lamp assay for the diagnosis and epidemiologic surveillance of human mers-cov was developed in this way by shirato et al 24 which is capable of detecting as few as 34 copies of mers-cov rna and is highly specific with no cross-reaction with other respiratory viruses thai et al 25 developed a one-step single-tube accelerated real-time quantitative rt-lamp assay monitored by real-time measurement of turbidity in a photometer for the early and rapid diagnosis of sars-cov in clinical samples the assay was found to be 100-fold more sensitive than conventional rt-pcr with a detection limit of 001 plaque forming units pfuhowever if the methods rely on nonspecific signal transduction schemes such as the fluorescence dyes intercalation into any double-stranded dna amplicons or solution turbidity due to the release of pyrophosphates during polymerization the possibility of unexpected signals derived from primer dimer or non-primer reactions cannot be excluded 26 a sequence-specific and robust method for monitoring lamp and other isothermal amplification reactions that can readily separate true signal from nonspecific noise would address this problem shirato et al 27 improved the rt-lamp assay by using a quenching probe qprobe to monitor signal which has the same performance as the standard real-time rt-pcr assay in the detection of mers-cov additionally huang et al 4 established a nucleic acid visualization technique that combines rt-lamp and a vertical flow visualization strip rt-lamp-vf to detect mers-cov as illustrated in fig 1a two loop primers lf and lb involved in isothermal amplification are labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc and biotin respectively after amplification the amplicons labeled with biotin can bind to colloidal gold particles conjugated with streptavidin to form a complex which is subsequently captured by an anti-fitc antibody coated on the text line of the strip fig 1b thus presenting a colored line that is visible to the naked eye in this instance mers-cov rna can be detected with a detection limit of 10 copieslscientists from ellingtons group did plenty of work to both improve the specificity of lamp detection and make readout simpler and more reliable they replaced the intercalating dye typically used for monitoring in real-time fluorescence with a toehold-mediated strand exchange reaction termed one-step strand displacement osd and applied it for real-time sequence-specific verification of lamp amplicons 28 29 30 the resulting assays could detect 002 to 02 pfu 550 pfuml of mers-cov in infected cell culture supernatants within 3050 min and did not cross-react with common human respiratory pathogens 31 other strand exchange signal transductions were developed to make lamp reaction user-friendly as shown in fig 2 by combining lamp with a thermostable invertase du et al can directly transduce mers coronavirus templates into glucose signals which can be easily read by a commercial glucometer with a sensitivity as low as 20100 copiesl equating to atto-molar or low zepto-mole 32 the human chorionic gonadotropin hcg was also used as the signal as its analyte was already sensitively detected by commercial pregnancy test kits the hcg was site-specifically conjugated to a dna oligonucleotide thereby allowing signal transduction via strand exchange into both capture signal-off and release signal-on of hcg in the lamp based virus assay 33 the incorporation of an engineered hcg reporter protein led to lamp-to-hcg signal transduction on low-cost commercially available pregnancy test strips this assay reliably detected as few as 20 copies of virus templates in both human serum and salivameanwhile lamp shows optimal performance at around 65 c which always limits its applications cai et al 34 developed a version of lamp that used phosphorothioated primers ps-lamp to enable more efficient hairpin formation and extension at the termini of growing concatamers which therefore worked at much lower temperatures the sensitivity and selectivity for amplicon detection with ps-lamp at 40 c were comparable with a regular lamp reaction at 65 cthe rolling circle amplification rca has attracted considerable attention in nucleic acid determination 3536 in isothermal conditions rca is capable of a 109-fold signal amplification of each circle within 90 min an efficient assay for the detection of sars-cov by rca was set up in both liquid and solid phases 37 and presented preliminary results on a small number of clinical respiratory specimens the main advantage of rca is that it can be performed under isothermal conditions with minimal reagents and avoid the generation of false-positive results which is frequently encountered in pcr-based assaysthe microarray is a detection method with rapid and high throughput for this method the coronavirus rna will first produce cdna labeled with specific probes through reverse transcription then these labeled cdnas will be loaded into each well and hybridize with solid-phase oligonucleotides fixed on the microarray followed by a series of washing steps to remove free dnas finally the coronavirus rna can be detected by the detection of specific probes due to its superiority the microarray assay has been widely used in the detection of coronavirus 38shi et al 39 designed a 60mer oligonucleotide microarray according to the sequence of tor2 and successfully applied it to the detection of sars coronavirus in clinical samples however considering the rapid mutation of sars-cov guo et al 40 developed a microarray to detect 24 single nucleotide polymorphism snp mutations among the spike s gene of sars-cov with 100 accuracy in sample detection since coronavirus may lead to a sudden outbreak it is of great significance that diagnostic assays are able to detect a wide range of coronaviruses and are be deployable at or near the point of care poc therefore luna et al 41 designed a nonfluorescent low-cost low-density oligonucleotide array for detecting the whole coronavirus genus with a sensitivity equal to that of individual real-time rt-pcr and hardick et al 42 evaluated a novel portable and near-poc diagnostic platform based on the microarray chip the mobile analysis platform map which has a good performance in identifying virus and acceptable detection limitthe rna-targeting crispr associated enzyme cas13 has recently been adapted for rapid and portable sensing of nucleic acids 4344 zhangs group demonstrated that cas13 can be programmed to target and destroy the genomes of diverse mammalian single stranded rna viruses fig 3 45 they developed a platform termed sherlock specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking that combined isothermal preamplification with cas13 to detect single molecules of rna or dna 46 it can detect dengue or zika virus single-stranded rna as well as mutations in patient liquid biopsy samples their lately protocol for covid-19 entitled a protocol for detection of covid-19 using crispr diagnostics has been reported on website httpsbroadiosherlockprotocol which may provide some reference points for researchers interested in further advancing this diagnostics system highlighting its potential as a multiplexable portable rapid and quantitative detection platform of nucleic acidscurrently the diagnosis of covid-19 mainly relies on the detection of the coronavirus rna it is of great importance to select appropriate detection methods however each of the methods described above has its own unique advantages and inevitable disadvantages pcr is widely used for virus identification with high sensitivity and specificity but its analysis requires various equipment and educated analysts which is only possibly accomplished by a well-established laboratory lamp is an ultrasensitive nucleic acid amplification method that can often detect small numbers of dna or rna templates within roughly an hour but the requirement for high temperatures still limits its applicability as for the microarray the high cost inevitably limits its further application in the detection of coronaviruses therefore it is still necessary to develop more effective and practical methods to overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods in the futureto date considerable efforts have been made to improve the detection of coronavirus and a variety of improved or new approaches have been developed in practical applications several methods are usually combined to avoid the drawbacks of using single method as much as possible in short with the rapid development of new technologies and methods we believe that there will be more excellent and efficient detection methods developed in the future which would provide scientistsclinicians with more choices at the same time only by balancing the advantages and disadvantages of various detection assays according to specific purposes can we obtain the most economical and optimal optionthe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interestsars-cov-2 is a large positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid rna virus that comprises of four structural proteins ie nucleocapsid protein np that holds the viral rna spike protein sp envelope protein ep and membrane protein mp that create the viral envelope it has a diameter of 50200 nm and possesses spikes on its surface up to 20 nm in length that provide it the crown-like appearance a characteristic of coronaviruses covs the lung disease caused by sars-cov-2 was given the name of covid-19 by the world health organisation who on feb 11 2020 who declared covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern pheic on january 30 2020 and a pandemic on march 11 2020 although china was the epicenter of the pandemic in the beginning europe was declared as the new epicenter on march 13 2020 as the number of cases and deaths in europe exceeded that of china however as the number of covid-19 cases has increased significantly in the united states recently it could become the new epicenter of covid-19 as mentioned by the who on march 24 2020since its discovery in the hubei province of wuhan city in china in late december 2019 sars-cov-2 has now spread to 204 countries worldwide and also affecting two international conveyances ie the diamond princess cruise ship and the holland americas ms zaandam cruise ship the number of confirmed covid-19 cases worldwide exceeds 1 million 12 while the number of global deaths exceeds 53000 the united states of america usa has the most covid-19 cases with over 245000 cases representing about 24 of the global covid-19 cases italy spain and germany follow it with over 115000 112000 and 84000 cases respectively however italy is the most affected country as evident from the high mortality rate due to covid-19 of over 14000 deaths while spain and the usa are also seriously impacted with over 10000 and 6000 deaths respectively the last few weeks have led to an exponential increase in the number of cases in the usa uk iran and the european union eu however singapore south korea and china have managed to successfully contain the spread of covid-19 by taking all essential measures to deal with the pandemicsars-cov-2 was transmitted to humans via humananimal contact at the live animals market in wuhan china in late december 2019 3 chinese researchers found its origin in bats but the intermediate hosts for sars-cov-2 have not yet been identified 4 the genomic sequence of sars-cov-2 has about 82 sequence homology to the human sars-cov and about 89 with bat sars-like-covzxc21 5 the aged population age above 65 years and persons having decreased immunity or chronic diseases such as hypertension diabetes mellitus cardiovascular diseases and lung disease are at a higher risk for developing severe covid-19 if they are infected with sars-cov-2 therefore they must take special precautions to prevent the infection the who has stressed the need for more intensive testing of suspected cases to identify covid-19 infected people so that they can be quarantined in order to avoid the further spread of infection it is also evident that the existing real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain rt-pcr assays are unable to detect the covid-19 in the early stages of infection and there are reports where it has given false negatives in subjects for up to two weeks 67 the reason of false negative results by rt-pcr could be due to the improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical materials and insufficient cellular material for detection a chest computerized tomography ct scan act as a complementary diagnostic tool that enables physicians to effectively detect covid-19 infection in several such rt-pcr false-negative cases 89 therefore there is a need for developing better in vitro diagnostic ivd assays that can detect the sars-cov-2 infection reliably in persons even at the initial stage the specific biomarkers involved during the early stage of covid-19 infection should be investigated and employed for the development of diagnosticsthe structure of sars-cov-2 comprises of spikes which are formed by the sp figure 1 sp is a major glycoprotein mol wt 180 kda that consists of two subunits ie s1 and s2 10 s1 contains a receptor binding domain rbd which is responsible for recognizing and binding with the host cell receptor ie angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor ace2 found in the lower respiratory tract 11 on the other hand s2 contains other basic elements needed for the membrane fusion sp is the common target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccines while the amino-terminal s1 subunit of sp is the most variable immunogenic antigen additionally sars-cov-2 has np mol wt 40 kda the most abundant viral phosphoprotein produced and shed during infection the template mrna of np is the most abundant subgenomic rna np exhibits high immunogenicity and can be detected in either serum or urine samples during the first two weeks of infection with peak viral shedding around ten days after infection 12 being a large protein it can be detected via a sandwich immunoassay furthermore sars-cov-2 contains mp which is the most abundant protein on the complete virion particle the ep is the smallest major structural protein of sars-cov-2 which is involved in viral assembly release of virions and pathogenesisseveral serological immunoassays have been developed by ivd companies for the detection of sars-cov-2 viral proteins and antibodies in the serum or plasma the most widely used biomarkers for the detection of sars-cov-2 infection in commercial immunoassays rapid lateral flow immunoassay lfia tests automated chemiluminescence immunoassay clia manual elisa and other formats are igm and igg antibodies produced in suspects from the 2nd week of viral infection igm can be detected in the patient samples from 10 to 30 days after sars-cov-2 infection while igg can be detected from 20 days onwards 13 the igm response occurs earlier than that of igg but it then decreases and disappears on the other hand igg can persist after infection for a long time and may have a protective role several manual elisa kits are also commercially available for the detection of np and sp but these are used mainly for researchthe most widely used ivd assays for the confirmatory diagnosis of covid-19 are based on rt-pcr that have been employed globally to deal with the pandemic a novel and robust real-time rt-pcr assay was developed by tib-molbiol germany in collaboration with various partners by the 2nd week of january 2020 14 it was highly specific for sars-cov-2 rna and did not cross-react with other coronaviruses the test detects the sars-cov-2 rna via envelope e and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene assays the e-gene assay was used for first line screening while the rdrp gene assay was employed for confirmatory testing in another approach the researchers developed one-step rt-pcr assays to detect orf1b and n regions of sars-cov-2 in 1 h and 15 min 15 the n gene assay was used for screening while orf1b was used as confirmatory test however as the assay involved the detection of orf1b and n regions that are highly conserved among sarbecoviruses it could also bind to sars-cov and other closely-related viruses the authors mentioned that they could distinguish the sars-cov-2 from sars-cov via sequence analysis of positive amplicons if the rt-pcr results are positive of interest was the development of real-time rt-pcr assay for the detection of rdrphelicase h genes of sars-cov-2 which did not cross-react with other human coronaviruses and respiratory viruses 16 due to its high sensitivity it can be used for covid-19 detection in samples that have low viral loads and for testing saliva plasma and upper respiratory tract samples many rt-pcr assays have already been developed by many companies and researchers worldwide the most prominent real-time rt-pcr rapid test is the xpert xpress sars-cov-2 test by cepheid usa which provides results in just 45 min using genxpert benchtop system 17 it is a rapid and automated point-of-care poc molecular test that enables the qualitative detection of sars-cov-2 in nasopharyngeal swab nasal wash or aspirate specimens from suspects the test requires only a minute for sample preparation employs cepheids xpert xpress cartridge technology and targets multiple regions of the viral genome it has also received food and drug administration fda emergency use authorization eua another prominent advance is the vivalytic covid-19 test by bosch germany 18 which detects sars-cov-2 infection in suspects in less than 25 h the test was developed by bosch in collaboration with randox laboratories uk it is a fully automated and rapid poc molecular test that can simultaneously detect sars-cov-2 and nine other respiratory viruses including influenza a and b the sample is taken from the nose or throat of suspect using a swab and placed inside a vivalytic cartridge containing all the assay reagents the cartridge is then plugged into a small benchtop vivalytic analyzerabbott id now covid-19 test is the most recent breakthrough ivd assay that detects sars-cov-2 in just 5 min 1920 it is a molecular poc test that utilizes the isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology for the qualitative detection of viral rna from sars-cov-2 the test can be used in any location such as hospitals clinics physicians offices or in outbreak hotspots of covid-19 it requires just a portable touchscreen-operated instrument ie id now which is lightweight 66 pounds and compact the size of a small toaster it employs a molecular test for the rdrp gene and can take throat nasal nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs as samples the kit contains 24 tests positive and negative controls swabs for sample collection and pipettes it has just received the fda eua and is being seen as a remarkable achievement worldwideapart from the molecular diagnostics numerous lfia based rapid poc tests have been developed by several companies which enable the detection of igm and igg antibodies produced in suspects in response to sars-cov-2 infection one of the most prominent rapid tests is the covid-19 test developed by biomedomics usa which detects igm and igg antibodies in suspects in just 10 min 21 it requires minimal sample volume ie 20 l of finger-pricked blood or 10 l of serumplasma it does not require any instrument or trained staff and thus it can be employed at any place and time especially in developing nations with limited healthcare resources and remote settings the assay is ideal for primary healthcare workers for the rapid testing of covid-19 suspects another prospective test is the sars-cov-2 rapid by pharmacyt ag germany 22 which employs only two drops of finger-pricked blood sample from the suspects and can provide results in 20 min the results obtained by the rapid test correlated well with those achieved by rt-pcr the most exciting advance is the dpp covid-19 igmigg test launched recently by chembio diagnostics usa which has already received fda eua it is a poc rapid lfia test that provides results in just 15 min using finger-pricked blood sample however the distinct feature of the test is that it does not rely on the visual detection by naked eye but employs optical readout via microreader 1 and 2 analyzers produced by chembio germany 23 a large number of rapid igmigg tests have been developed by several ivd companies such as beijing lepu medical technology sona nanotech jiangsu medomics medical technologies innovita biological technology guangzhou wondfo biotech zhejiang orient gene biotech biomerica xiamen amonmed biotechnology sugentech chil zhenjiang orient gene biotech sure bio-tech however there are very few peer-reviewed publications 24 that show the accuracy of the covid-19 diagnostic results obtained by the rapid tests with respect to rt-pcr tests rapid tests could be used as a complementary ivd assay to the existing rt-pcr assays which could lead to much better diagnosis of covid-19 and provide additional information about the immune status of the suspects however the clinical accuracy of rapid tests needs to be stringently evaluated before they are authorized for the mass screening of covid-19 the recent reports from many european countries suggest that most of the rapid tests for covid-19 procured from china did not show good analytical performance and did not work for over 70 of covid-19 cases 25262728 furthermore as igm and igg could only be detected in suspects about two weeks after the onset of infection there is an immense need to include other biomarkers of the early stage of sars-cov-2 infection for developing improved covid-19 rapid testsan exciting development is the dz-lite sars-cov-2 clia igm and igg tests developed by diazyme usa that have received fda eua 29 the tests are based on the principle of chemiluminescence immunoassay clia and run on an automated diazyme dz-lite 3000 plus chemiluminescence analyzer with a throughput of 50 testsh similarly snibe china has developed automated clia tests on maglumi clia analyzers for the detection of igg and igm in the patient sample in 30 min 30 the main advantages of automated clia analyzers based covid-19 assays compared to rapid lfia tests is the very high throughput of samples that can be analyzed and the ability to perform more clinical tests for other biomarkers such as c-reactive protein crp which also need to be monitored in covid-19 suspectsseveral ce marked manual elisa kits have also been developed by various ivd manufacturers such as euroimmun ibl international drg diagnostics gmbh and epitope diagnostics most of them target the igg and igm produced in subjects in response to sars-cov-2 infectionother prospective ivd assay formats such as those based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification rt-lamp lab-on-a-chip microfluidics and multiplex detection are currently being investigated by researchers it would also be useful to develop an automated and fully integrated poc ivd assay that can perform molecular and immunological testing on a single analytical platform an ideal ivd assay for the poc detection of covid-19 in the near future would be the smartphone-based poc electrochemical test for sars-cov-2 biomarkers similar to the ihealth align device developed by ihealth usa for smartphone-based blood glucose monitoring 31 smartphones are omnipresent powered by internal battery and equipped with large storage capacity advanced processing power and a large screen display moreover they have global positioning system gps for spatiotemporal tagging of data internet connectivity and capability to store the processed results in the internal device memory as well as to a secure cloud therefore smartphone-based poc electrochemical device for the detection of sars-cov-2 biomarkers could be very useful for the large-scale rapid testing of covid-19 suspects at the point-of-needthe accurate diagnosis of people infected with the sars-cov-2 is essential to curb the global spread of covid-19 however the current rt-pcr based diagnostic assays are not robust as they are still missing several infected cases 689 moreover they can only be performed in well-equipped central laboratories by highly skilled analysts therefore they are of limited utility and cannot be deployed widely such as in developing nations remote locations and regions with decentralized laboratories the delay in diagnosing people until after they have passed the disease onto many others is contributing to the continued global spread of covid-19 the rapid lfia and automated clia tests for igm and igg could complement the existing covid-19 testing by rt-pcr however there is a need to stringently evaluate the clinical performance of commercial tests before they are used for the diagnosis of covid-19 the biomarker discovery could also play a key role in identifying novel biomarkers that are involved in the early stages of sars-cov-2 infection the recently developed abbott id now covid-19 test that detects sars-cov-2 in 5 min is a remarkable achievement 1920 and could revolutionize covid-19 testing the ongoing efforts will further lead to reliable robust rapid and easy-to-implement ivd assays and smart diagnostics for covid-19 there are still significant knowledge gaps in health research that are crucial for an effective public health response in the case of epidemics it signifies the need for all nations to invest in health research and make it an integral part of healthcareantimicrobial resistance amr is the arguably one of the greatest threats to global human health and is driven by the overuse of antibiotics1 antibiotics are prescribed to the vast majority of patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness ari including in clinical groups where viruses are strongly implicated in their aetiology most asthma exacerbations are associated with respiratory virus infection especially rhinovirus2 and randomised controlled trials have failed to demonstrate any benefit from antibiotic treatment3 4 additionally a large retrospective observational study of nearly 20000 patients hospitalised with an exacerbation suggests that antibiotic use does not improve outcome and is associated with higher costs5 professional societies strongly discourage the use of antibiotics in asthma exacerbation through national guidelines6 7 but despite this antibiotic use in adults hospitalised with exacerbation of asthma remains very common8 9 10 patients hospitalised with exacerbation of copd are also routinely treated with antibiotics despite viruses being frequently implicated in their aetiology12 and a lack of high quality evidence for benefit in patients with non-life threatening exacerbations11 several randomised trials of biomarker-directed therapy show that antibiotics use can be safely reduced in non-critically ill hospitalised patients with exacerbation of copd and low levels of crp or procalcitonin13 14 supporting the concept that antibiotics are currently overused in this population diagnostic uncertainty regarding the aetiology of exacerbations of airways disease contributes to the ongoing overuse of antibiotics in these groupsthe uk department of health commissioned report into antimicrobial resistance specifically noted the importance of rapid diagnostic tests to help combat amr through effective antibiotic stewardship and recommended that by 2020 all prescribing of antibiotics should be informed by a diagnostic test where one exists1 rapid molecular tests for respiratory viruses could potentially fulfil this need in patients hospitalised with exacerbation of airways diseasethe respoc study was a large pragmatic randomised controlled trial that evaluated the clinical impact of syndromic ie comprehensive multiplex pcr point-of-care testing poct for respiratory viruses in adults presenting to hospital with acute respiratory illness10 it demonstrated that syndromic poct for respiratory viruses using the fimarray respiratory panel was associated with several clinical benefits compared to routine clinical care with laboratory testing including the earlier discontinuation of antibiotics without any increase in adverse events subgroup analysis from the trial suggests that these antibiotic changes occurred predominantly in patients with exacerbation of airways disease testing positive for viruses with little difference seen in antibiotic use in other clinical groups such as patients with community acquired pneumonia or in patients testing negative for viruses several observational studies support the findings of respoc demonstrating a reduction in unnecessary antibiotics with rapid molecular testing for respiratory viruses in a variety of clinical setting15 16 in addition a post hoc analysis from the trial itself suggests that the very rapid turnaround times for results seen with poct compared to laboratory testing are critical in modifying antibiotic use in hospitalised patients17
several rapid molecular test platforms for respiratory viruses are now available with the potential for deployment as pocts in clinical areas and their use in hospitals is becoming more widespread18 however there is a lack of evidence to inform clinicians and hospitals in the choice between multiplex syndromic panels such as the filmarray rp which test for a comprehensive range of respiratory viruses and platforms that test for influenza only or for influenza and rsv rapid accurate influenza detection is clearly a priority for hospitals during periods of intense influenza transmission to correctly and rapidly administer influenza antivirals and to efficiently utilise infection control facilities in addition multiplex syndromic panels are more expensive than uniplex tests for influenza and it is not currently clear what additional clinical value is gained by testing for the other virus types in hospitalised patientsin this further analysis we examine in detail the changes in antibiotic use associated with syndromic molecular poct among patients with exacerbation of airways diseases and determine the importance of changes in antibiotic management occurring due to the detection of non-influenza virusesearly discontinuation of antibiotics was defined as receipt of less than 24 h of antibiotics before stopping including those that only received a single dose where rhinoenterovirus was co-detected with influenza or rsv they influenza and rsv were considered to be dominant and the patient was classified accordinglystatistical analyses were done using prism version 70 graphpad software la jolla ca usa and stata version 131 statacorp college station tx usa we compared duration of antibiotic use between groups using median differences and the kruskalwallis test and differences in proportions using chi squared test or fishers exact test as appropriate kaplanmaier curves for the duration of antibiotics were generated and compared using the log rank testthere were 143 patients with exacerbation of airways disease in the poct group 62 with asthma and 81 with copd and 118 83 of these received antibiotics there were 140 patients with exacerbation of airways disease in the control group 57 with asthma and 83 with copd and 111 79 of these received antibiotics difference in antibiotic use between poct and control group of 4 95ci  6 to 13 p  055 in the poct group 62143 43 patients tested positive for respiratory viruses and 4962 79 of these received antibiotics 81143 57 patients tested negative for viruses and 6981 85 of these received antibiotics difference in antibiotic use between poct positive and negative patients of 6 95ci  7 to 20 p  038 baseline characteristics of patients testing positive and negative by poct and control patients were well matched including physiological observations and laboratory results only 48140 34 patients in the control group were tested for respiratory viruses using laboratory pcr and the median turnaround time for results was 311 h compared with 16 h for those tested with poct p00001 table 1
of those testing positive for viruses by poct and who received antibiotics 1749 35 had early discontinuation of antibiotics versus 969 13 in those testing negative and 7111 6 in control patients p00001 the median duration of antibiotic was 55 days in those testing positive by poct versus 63 days in those testing negative by poct and 64 days in the control group p  0012 the median duration of iv antibiotics was 1 h ie a single dose in those testing positive by poct versus 65 in those testing negative and 26 h on the control group p  009 antibiotic use by poct result and in control patients is shown in table 2
 kaplanmeier curve analysis for duration of antibiotics is shown in fig 1
 although the curves for the three groups poct positive poct negative and control becomes similar after approximately 6 days from starting antibiotics the curves show that there is a sharp reduction in antibiotic use early on for those testing positive for viruses by poct p  0034of those tested for viruses by poct 12143 8 were positive for influenza a or b 26143 18 positive for rhinoenterovirus and 24143 17 positive for other viruses combined rsv parainfluenza 14 human metapneumovirus and human coronavirus fig 2
 there were 4 co-detections rsv with rhinoenterovirus2 influenza a with human coronavirus and rsv with hmpv and human coronavirus in patients who received the poc test and had early discontinuation of antibiotics 326 11 had influenza detected 626 23 had rhinoenterovirus detected 826 31 had other viruses detected and 926 35 had no virus detected fig 3
among those positive for viruses receiving antibiotics the proportion with early discontinuation of antibiotics was not different between the virus types 310 30 for influenza 621 29 for rhinovirus and 818 44 for other viruses combined p  054 antibiotic use by virus type is shown in table 3
 a higher proportion of patients with influenza received iv antibiotics compared to those with rhinoenterovirus or other virus types 53 vs 23 and 21 p  0044 but the median duration of iv antibiotic or any antibiotic was not different between the virus types although the small numbers of individual virus types make definitive statement difficult survival analysis did not show any differences in early antibiotic discontinuation between virus types p  053 fig 4
this study shows that syndromic molecular poct for respiratory viruses in adults presenting to hospital with exacerbation of airways disease leads to a reduction in antibiotic use due to early discontinuation in those testing positive for viruses most viruses detected in these patients were non-influenza viruses with rhinoenterovirus being the most commonly detected single virus type and there was no difference in the rate of antibiotic discontinuation between different virus types as noted in the respoc study poct did not lead to a reduction in the proportion treated with antibiotics compared to routine clinical care however this is unsurprising as patients are started on antibiotics very early in their patient journey when admitted to hospital and this was often before the results of poct can be made available the reason that antibiotics are stopped early in patients with exacerbation of airways disease testing positive for viruses is unknown but is likely to be due to clinicians feeling the detection of a virus adequately explains their acute illness and giving them confidence that a bacterial infection is unlikely and no longer needs to be covered with antibiotics in combination with other data such as crp level and radiology resultsas expected rhinoenterovirus was the most frequently detected virus in this group but the type of virus detected did not seem to influence the decision to stop antibiotics early although as the numbers in each groups were small we cannot definitively exclude a difference this suggests that for patients with exacerbation of airways disease respiratory virus testing should be performed at the point-of-care using a comprehensive syndromic multiplex panel rather than a molecular poct for influenza alone which would not detect the majority of viruses associated with early antibiotic discontinuation it could be argued that for many of the patients in the study treated with antibiotics that they should not have been treated in any case on clinical grounds alone given that antibiotic use in patients with asthma exacerbation is already strongly discouraged by national society guidelines however despite these guidelines inappropriate antibiotic use in hospitalised patients with asthma remains very common8 9 10 and diagnostic uncertainty regarding the possibility of bacterial infection especially in the early part of hospital admission before all diagnostic information is available is likely to be a key driver of this practice the early provision of accurate results regarding exacerbation aetiology seems to assist in rational antibiotic decision making and is a potential alternative or complementary strategy to biomarker-directed therapythere are additional reasons beyond the antibiotic stewardship benefits for choosing to test using a comprehensive syndromic poct for a range of respiratory viruses rather than with a poct for influenza alone although some molecular poct platforms for influenza have diagnostic accuracy comparable to laboratory pcr others have demonstrated inferior sensitivity in non-industry sponsored real world studies20 potentially reducing their usefulness in the hospital setting where missed diagnoses have serious consequences including nosocomial transmission of influenza although influenza may represent a priority for hospital infection control teams during peak influenza season the detection of other respiratory viruses is also important for infection control purposes as other viruses also pose a serious risk of nosocomial transmission and outbreaks which are especially dangerous to immunocompromised patients in certain high risk areas such as haematology wards and renal units in some hospitals a two-step testing process is adopted where a patient with a negative influenza poct is then tested using a multiplex laboratory pcr increasing costs and prolonging the time before result are available compared with a comprehensive syndromic poct regulatory consideration are also important and rapid diagnostic platforms may not be able to be used at the poct in certain countries due to regulatory requirements for example the current filmarray system is not fully clia waived in the us a further significant consideration is obviously the higher cost associated with syndromic panels versus molecular poct for influenza and there is clearly a need for health economic studies to provide evidence for the cost effectives of such an approach considering the incremental benefits of syndromic testinga lower rate of re-admission was seen in those testing positive for viruses versus those testing negative or control patients the reason for this is not clear but it may be that non-viral exacerbations have a higher rate of subsequent exacerbations or even that clarity around the aetiology of exacerbation may reduce readmissionalthough the respoc study is the only published randomised controlled trial of syndromic respiratory virus testing at the point-of-care other non-randomised pre and post intervention studies have suggested similar benefits from rapid syndromic respiratory virus testing in terms of reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in both paediatric and adults patients presenting to hospital15 16
the strengths of this study include the randomised nature of the parent study the large overall cohort of patients studied and the pragmatic nature with broad generalisability to other uk and international centres its limitations include being a single-centre trial and the relatively small numbers of patients with asthma and copd with each respiratory virus detected although it is likely to be generalisable to other centres we cannot rule out that the changes seen are dependent on the processes of care in uk hospitals it is also currently uncertain as to how molecular poct for respiratory viruses should be best implemented within the nhs and other health systems potential models include training clinical staff to perform the testing or the development of dedicated point-of-care testing laboratories staffed by technicians and located within or close to acute areas21
in conclusion syndromic molecular poct for respiratory viruses in adults with exacerbation of airways disease is associated with early discontinuation of unnecessary antibiotics in those testing positive for viruses most viruses detected were non-influenza viruses and there was no difference in antibiotic discontinuation between different virus types these results suggest that syndromic molecular poct for respiratory viruses should be favoured over poct for influenza alone in adults with exacerbation of airways diseaseuniversity of southampton the manufactures of the molecular test

declare that they have no conflicts of intereststhe world health organization who characterized the covid-19 pandemic on 11th march 2020 1  the symptoms of covid-19 induced by the novel pathogen sars-cov-2 are difficult to differentiate from other common infections in a large proportion of those infected it is estimated that about 40 of cases will experience mild disease cough fever 40 experience moderate disease bilateral pneumonia 15 develop severe disease and 5 will have critical disease 2 a recommendation by the who has been to conduct early screening of patients to identify isolate and track those infected and prevent transmission 2reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr based methodologies have been the gold standard in confirming that the individual presenting with covid-19 has active viral shedding of sars-cov-2 3 4 however the ability to conduct wide scale testing of patients has been limited by a number of factors including suitable resources for rt-pcr based testing for the presence of sars-cov-2 in addition the standard test used has an 80 accuracy compared to chest ct scan results 5 which may depend on the specific level of viral shedding by any individual at the time of sample test moreover the time from sample collection to informing the patient is estimated to take many hours to several days according to the systems in place these complex issues hand in hand with the wide-ranging symptoms presenting in patients and the discrepant results between chest ct symptoms and rt-pcr results 5 indicates that testing for the direct presence of virus requires significant improvementwhile highly specific tests for sars-cov-2 are under development using crispr 6 and biosensors 7 8 these innovative applications will require highly specialised equipment and resources this will negatively affect less affluent areas that will be unable to access these technologies in the short time frame in order to contain the pandemic therefore there is a global challenge to enable screening without the need for sophisticated equipment and resourcesmachine learning and artificial intelligence approaches are rapidly being developed to aid clinical procedures in the current pandemic such as predicting the specificity of new therapies 9 and diagnosing covid 19 patients from radiographic patterns on ct scans 10in the current study we focused on predicting whether a person is sars-cov-2 positive or negative in the early stage of the disease the approach taken is based on the reported limitation to conduct rt- pcr tests and the need to quickly differentiate between individuals presenting with similar symptoms as seen between covid 19 and other common infections the dataset used here comes from a public challenge by mindstream-ai 11 to use artificial intelligence to predict the test result for sars-cov-2 positivenegative solely from complete blood teststhe hospital israelita albert einstein is located in the state of sao paulo brazil with a population of 12 million people had 477 confirmed cases of covid 19 and 30 associated deaths by the 23rd march 2020 the hospital publicly released full blood counts 12 from 598 anonymised patients along with the rt-pcr result for sars-cov-2 and their age quantile symptoms or patient history were not released here we present evidence that patients having sars-cov-2 can be identified by random forest machine learning and artificial neural networks ann to patients not admitted to hospital community and to patients in a regular ward setting through recognition of the altered immune cell profile these will allow for a rapid early screening purely based on the blood profileall data processed in this study is published on a public forum 12 as part of a challenge to accelerate approaches to combat the spread of sars-cov-2 this dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the hospital israelita albert einstein at so paulo brazil and who had samples collected to perform the sars-cov-2 rt-pcr and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital all data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations 11 all clinical data were standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviationdata provided included age percentile group outcome from rt-pcr sars-cov-2 test and standard full blood count

and 3rd of april 2020 of which 598 full blood count results were used for statistical analysis the remaining 5046 results were not used due to lack of full blood count datawithout in-depth data on the timeline of the tests performed in the duration of the infection analysis was performed on the basis of severity according to the location of the patient within the hospital system the blood counts are from four classifications of patients community patients not admitted to hospital regular ward semi intensive care and intensive care unit icu table 1
patients that are in semi-intensive and intensive care units are excluded from our modelling so as to ensure prediction is based on early indicators also neutrophils are not included since this is not reported for all 598 patients furthermore we exclude age from our modellingthere is a large imbalance of positive 8 vs negative 92 sars-cov-2 patients in the community  as a result it is more informative to test separately for the specificity -ge of negative patients correctly identified as negative and the sensitivity -ge of positive patients correctly identified as positive rather than solely the total accuracyof the 598 complete counts analysed 367 patients had also been tested for other pathogens adenovirus bordetella pertussis chlamydophila pneumoniae coronavirus 229e coronavirus hku1 coronavirus nl63 coronavirus oc43 inf a h1n1 2009 influenza a influenza b metapneumovirus parainfluenza 1 parainfluenza 2 parainfluenza 3 parainfluenza 4 respiratory syncytial virus or rhinovirus enterovirusfor our 2-class sars-cov-2 positive vs negative classification we employ several machine learning and artificial network modelsfor the machine learning models we apply random forest 14 15 16 and lasso-elastic-net regularized generalized linear glmnet models for classification random forest as a classifier is based on several decision trees to classify a new object each decision tree provides a classification for input data and the random forest uses the mode of those classification to decide on the classin this paper glmnet on the other hand fits a traditional logistic model but instead of using all the predictors it uses a regularized path to select the most important variables and only use them in the logistic regression for both these methods we present results for 10-fold cross-validation and their corresponding variable importance plots 17furthermore an artificial neural network ann 13 model is defined with 14 input parameters and three hidden layers and trained for 100 epochs the classification performance of the ann model is evaluated with stratified 10-fold cross validationthe performance of each model is expressed in terms of auc sensitivity specificity and accuracy they are defined as follows sensitivity is the fraction of the sars-cov-2 positive patients correctly identified specificity is the fraction of sars-cov-2 negative patients correctly identified as such accuracy is the total number of patients correctly identified by lowering the threshold of detecting sars-cov-2 positive patients the sensitivity can increase at the expense of specificity hence we also look at the commonly employed auc this is the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve the curve when plotting sensitivity vs 1-specificity upon changing the threshold the auc also known as the wilcoxon-mann-whitney statistic is the probability that a sars-cov-2 positive patient is higher ranked than a sars-cov-2 negative patient a higher auc generally implies a better performing model we note that the drawback of using accuracy alone is that in an unbalanced set of mainly sars-cov-2 negative patients as is the case in the community dataset the accuracy can be high using zero sensitivitysignificant differences p005 between 9 of the 15 blood count parameters were shown between patients in a regular ward setting who tested positive or negative to sars-cov-2 presence figure 1

 as compared to the ann both random forest and glmnet provide more insight into the most important variables figure 4
a and b and a clear indication of how the decision has been obtained additionally glmnet does a variable selection by providing a much smaller stable set of variables among 14 highly correlated predictorsanalysis of the top four variables according to glmnet that corresponded to patients in community supplementary figure 1 and regular ward supplementary figure 2 indicated a clear recognisable pattern in particular to note in patients in the regular ward is in the decreased pool of leukocytes overall increase in red blood cells and in particular a significant decrease in eosinophils community patients having sars-cov-2 have distinctively high levels of monocytes and low levels of leukocytesin order to enable a rapid prediction model for clinics 12 where clinicians may want to choose only two figure 5

c the monocytesleukocyteseosinophilsplatelets trends in supplementary figures 1 and 2 and figure 1 were analysed by adding monocytes and subtracting leukocytes eosinophils and platelets this difference indicates little overlap between patients who test positive and negative for sars-cov-2 however it must be noted that this is a simple additive formula based on normalised datafor example a simple logistic regression lr with derived variable ymonocytes - leukocytes - eosinophils - platelets shows this blood characteristic can predict the covid test outcome with an average auc  85 over 10 fold cross-validation among the patients in the community and auc  81 for patients in regular wardthe model predictions from ann random forest glmnet and the formula monocytes - leukocytes - eosinophils and m-l-e-p are summarized in table 2 and table 3

of the patients testing for sars-cov-2 and complete blood tests 366 patients were tested for other pathogens of which 188 patients were diagnosed with other infections to note rhinovirus and influenza b table 4
 collectively 51 tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus influenza a influenza b parainfluenza 1 coronavirus nl63 rhinovirus enterovirus coronavirus hku1 parainfluenza 3 chlamydophila pneumonia adenovirus parainfluenza 4 coronavirus 229e coronavirus oc43 influenza a h1n1 2009 bordetella pertussis metapneumovirus and parainfluenza 2 the similar presentation of many of these infections to covid19 may however be differentiated by the clear difference in immune response to sars-cov-2 using the ann model of full blood count analysisof the 598 patients only one tested positive for sars-cov-2 and for at least one other pathogen that patient also tested positive for influenza b and for coronavirus nl63 and was in icuin addition to the changing profile of immune cells a change in red blood cells and platelets were noted in order to describe the profile of cells the mean changes were plotted from patients in regular ward supplementary figure 3we developed multiple independent models statistical random forest and shallow learning that can predict sars-cov-2 with an auc of up to 86 for community and 94 for regular ward patients using only data collected from their normalized full blood counts this provides an initial screen of sars-cov-2 positive from negative using biomarkers at an early stage in the disease presentation this screen has been conducted on a set of data based on severity judged by the location of the patient in hospital admitted to the regular ward compared to not admitted to hospital icu patients were excluded hence the models are able to distinguish from altered blood profiles in patients who were later diagnosed with other pathogensit is well recognised that the symptoms of covid 19 are accompanied by a significant change in immune response 19 with a decreased population of leukocytes lymphocytes 20 21 and eosinophils 19 20 21 found throughout all stages of infection indeed it was suggested in one case report from wuhan that eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis 22 other early reports used similar predictive patterns found in full blood count parameters suggesting that elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio could be used as part of the diagnosis 23 in that study they investigated the change in blood parameters in a total of 93 patients severe and non severe collected together using commonly used ratios used in the diagnosis of viral respiratory diseases such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio derived nlr ratio d-nlr neutrophil count divided by the result of wbc count minus neutrophil count platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio however these parameters commonly alter in respect to other viral infections and we initiated research to identify new ratios to distinguish sars-cov-2 from other pathogenshere we show that a new simple calculation based on leukocytes monocytes eosinophils and platelets normalized monocytes - leukocytes - eosinophils - platelets can be used to predict with 85 auc the presence of sars-cov-2 for early-stage community patients further validation will be required to determine whether our model can distinguish fully from other pathogens although initial small numbers indicate a trend that is positiveleukocytes are a family of white blood cells that includes neutrophils lymphocytes monocytes eosinophils and basophils specific pathogens induce specific responses such as an increase in circulating neutrophils and monocytes typically increase during sepsis as part of the immune defence mechanism and several studies have indicated that ratios between different blood cells can be used to predict outcome the ratio of monocyte  neutrophil can be used to determine sepsis severity 24  and platelet  monocyte aggregation has been reported to be increased in patients with influenza a h1n1 25 indeed the clinical interest in using the relationship between different parameters of the full blood count is of great value and interest due to its simplicity and readily measurable parameters while not yet in common clinical use it has been shown that neutrophil  lymphocyte and mean platelet volume  platelet count could predict the outcome for critically ill patients with peritonitis and pancreatitis bacteremia 26 our results presented here clearly demonstrates that an early prediction of those infected with sars-cov-2 may be made by the relationship between monocytes eosinophils and leukocytes to differentiate them from other pathogen induced infectionsthe data analysed in this report focussed on the clear early stages in order to differentiate between patients presenting with common symptoms prior to the need to be in icu the changes in parameters of the full blood count is easily distinguishable from other pathogen-induced infections with an apparent decrease in leukocyte population consisting of a large proportion of monocytes this observation is in keeping with other tools used to diagnose the severity of covid 19 by the measurement of il6 which significantly increases throughout the progression of disease the cytokine il6 is predominantly synthesised by monocytes and macrophage which derive from monocytes and is partly responsible for the drive of the immune response to deleterious cytokine stormin order to best understand the immune response to sars-cov-2 it is useful to compare it to other similar coronaviruses there are two main example closest known example is that of sars-cov virus sars which infected 8096 people and killed 774 in 2002- 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov which in 2013 infected 2102 people and killed 780 the majority of all other coronaviruses infect the upper respiratory tract and cause mild respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in contrast the highly infectious and highly pathogenic coronaviruses sars and mers were noted to have similar effects on the immune response and more recently overlaps with the pathogenesis now witnessed with sars-cov-2 infections the sars virus directly infects human monocytes which then produces the cytokines that attract neutrophils macrophage and activated t lymphocytes 27 mers was shown to increase monocytes and their il6 production 28 in parallel this study indicates that the pathogenesis to sars-cov-2 may be linked to monocytes and the production of il6 here in our study the analysis of monocyte involvement will be crucial in the prediction of sars-cov-2 infection additionally use of ai and ml to recognise the altered pattern of key blood parameters will be a useful tool in future with the emergence of any future coronavirus that is equally pathogenic and contagiousthe decrease in platelets in patients testing positive for sars-cov-2 in the regular ward is opposite to that observed in separate reports of patients with influenza a 29 a subset of the patients included in this analysis were tested for other pathogens and a proportion of those negative for sars-cov-2 were positive for other pathogens including coronaviruses nl63 hku1 and 229e and few had influenza a or b this suggests that platelet count is a good indicator in this predictive model and may be a good way to differentiate sars-cov-2 infection from influenza athe suggests a potential decreased platelet presence in patients which is of concern due to its link to thrombocytopenia and increased internal bleeding this supports other reports of an increase in thrombocytopenia being associated with higher mortality in covid 19 patients 21 the condition of thrombocytopenia may be the reason for the recently noted rashes observed in patients especially young children 30 however there have been reports that clotting is increased in covid 19 patients and the data we show is normalised and may be misleading this normalised data also indicates an increase in platelet size mpv which suggests that there is rapid platelet production by the bone marrow indeed it is recommended that covid 19 patients are administered antiplatelet therapy to protect against thrombosis 31 overall this highlights the difficulty of interpreting mean normalised datathis report is the first to use primary patient data of full blood counts to test and train an ann to predict from patients in a regular ward as well as those in the community who will test positive for sars-cov2 this preliminary model will be further trained and adapted with the aim to address the shortfall in direct sars-cov-2 testing methods in hospitals this will enable a prediction that allows health care providers to conduct rapid cheap screening to separate patients into those who are most likely to have sars-cov-2 and those who do not early screening allows segregation of patients and early treatment interventionfundingthis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sectorsthe respplex technology qiaplex technology qiagen involves nucleic acid purification and multiplex amplification by polymerase chain reaction pcr followed by detection using a liquid-phase bead-based array technology luminex xmap the technology allows for a high degree of multiplexing with the detection of 15 pathogens from a single test the respplex i test is designed to detect bacterial respiratory pathogens whereas the respplex ii test detects respiratory viruses for each pathogen in the multiplex pcr nested gene-specific primers are designed and included in the reaction 3 these target specific primers are added at very low concentrations and are used to enrich the targets during the first few cycles of pcr the inner gene-specific primers have tag sequences that are recognized by a universal set of primers called superprimers the superprimers are added at a higher concentration than the gene-specific primers which allows for the exponential amplification of all targets present in the sample the reverse superprimer is labeled with biotin and is added at a higher concentration that the forward superprimer the asymmetric pcr yields more reverse strands for detection and eliminates the need to denature the pcr products before hybridization with probe the labeled pcr products are detected using a capture probe specific for each target these probes are covalently coupled to a color-coded bead and each specific target corresponds to a unique bead color the biotin-labeled amplified products are then detected by the addition of streptavidin-phycoerythrin detection occurs in the luminex instrument each unique colored bead is recognized by the laser and the presence or absence of the phycoerythrin-labeled product determines whether that gene-specific target is present in the sample the unique design of the resplex ii system allows for sensitive specific and reproducible amplification of multiple targetsthe respplex system has been used to identify viral and bacterial pathogens in patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection 4 5 the tests used in one study 4 were designed to detect 21 pathogens including common viral and bacterial pathogens of the 1742 respiratory samples tested 67 had 1 pathogen detected including 40 with 1 pathogen 21 with 2 and 6 with 3 for the viruses that were also detected by direct immunofluorescence testing direct fluorescent antibody dfa influenza a and b parainfluenza 13 respiratory syncytial virus rsv the respplex test had a sensitivity of 84100 compared with dfa for adenovirus the resplex test had a sensitivity of 10 compared with dfa which led to the reconfiguration of the adenovirus component of the test another study showed similar results 5 the sensitivity of the respplex ii test varied from 72 to 100 when compared with culture and monoplex real-time pcr assays with a very high specificity 99 although the sensitivity for some pathogens needs to be improved overall the respplex tests have potential as a diagnostic tool the ability to detect multiple pathogens in a single test is an important diagnostic advance and provides an approach to study the outcomes and clinical significance of coinfectionsthe respplex system has also been used to detect h5n1 influenza a virus the assay was designed to target h1 h2 h3 h5 h7 h9 n1 and n2 genes from influenza a virus as well as the ns genes from influenza a and influenza b viruses this test allowed for the detection and genotyping of influenza a and b viruses a total of 217 clinical samples were tested including 14 samples with human h5n1 infection and results were compared with those of viral culture and conventional and real-time reverse-transcription rt pcr the respplex test had a clinical sensitivity of 93 and a specificity of 100 3 providing a rapid method for identifying and subtyping influenza virusesthe respplex i test which detects 6 bacterial pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae neisseria meningitidis haemophilus influenzae legionella pneumophila mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydophila pneumoniae was used to test 26 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from fatal cases of pneumonia or meningitismeningococcemia that were confirmed by immunohistochemistry and organism-specific real-time pcr overall the respplex i test identified 20 of 23 cases with a single pathogen and 1 of 3 with multiple pathogens 6 multiplex tests have value in respiratory specimens and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue when there is a broad differential and a limited volume of specimenthe advantage of the resplex ii test is that it can identify a large number of pathogens in a single test however this is a complex test with multiple steps requiring batching of specimens with a turn-around time for results of 56 h this is not practical for near-patient testing the test needs to be performed in a clinical laboratory one of the most significant limitations of this technology is the need for postamplification manipulation of samples which greatly increases the risk of carryover contamination and could lead to false-positive resultsthe infiniti system autogenomics couples multiplex pcr with an automated microarray hybridization using the infiniti analyzer after nucleic acid extraction a multiplex conventional rt-pcr reaction is performed with primers specific for 20 respiratory viruses after amplification the amplicons are purified with an enzymatic step to remove unincorporated nucleotides and primers and are then subjected to a proprietary primer extension step within the infiniti analyzer this step attaches a specific tag on each amplicon and also incorporates fluorescent-labeled nucleotides cy5-dctp the tagged and labeled amplicons are then hybridized to anti-tags immobilized on the microarray allowing specific identification of targets three replicates of each anti-tag on the microarray provide redundancy the primer extension and tagging hybridization scanning and data analysis steps are automated and performed within the infiniti analyzera recent study by raymond et al 7 compared the microarray test with single-target quantitative real-time pcr assays for 23 respiratory viruses that commonly infect children nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children 3 years of age hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infections overall 796 of specimens were positive for 1 virus by both real-time and the microarray tests 185 were negative for all viruses by both methods 18 of the samples 4 of 221 were positive only with the real-time tests and no viruses were detected only with the microarray test the most common viruses detected were rsv influenza a coronaviruses and rhinoviruses or enteroviruses multiple viruses were found in 131 of the specimens when results were compared between the 2 methods for each specimen there was a 941 concordance the sensitivity of the microarray test was 90 for all of the viruses except adenoviruses and coronavirus nl63 overall the single real-time pcr tests were more sensitive than the microarray test although the latter required fewer manual steps for 24 specimens 5 h less hands-on time is required and throughput is higher than for the performance of the individual real-time tests the microarray test requires several steps before loading of the infiniti analyzer and is designed for batching specimens the nucleic acid extraction rt-pcr and enzyme digestion steps take 3 h once the infiniti analyzer is loaded the first result is available in 35 h and each subsequent result requires an additional 20 min based on the complexity batching and time required for results this technology is designed for the clinical laboratory and not for near-patient testingthe jaguar system handy lab recently acquired by bd diagnostics-geneohm couples an automated nucleic acid extraction method with real-time pcr technology for the detection of multiple respiratory pathogens after the clinical specimen is pipetted into the specimen tube the reagents and disposables for the nucleic acid extraction and amplification reactions are loaded onto the instrument nucleic acid extraction is performed in individual reagent cartridges which are loaded into the jaguar instrument along with the amplification cartridge the remainder of the test is completely automated the proprietary extraction method allows for the rapid and efficient purification and concentration of nucleic acid from a relatively large specimen volume 500 l to 10 ml into an elution volume of 10 l  which is then used to resuspend the amplification reagents the amplification step is performed in a cartridge that is about 7  11 cm and 2 mm thick each cartridge can accommodate 12 reactions each with a reaction volume of 4 l this small volume allows for a very rapid cycling time hence the entire test is completed in 90110 min because the system uses real-time pcr the multiplexing capabilities are limited to 26 targets however the jaguar system has several advantages it is automated and very simple to use essentially requiring a single pipette step and because it uses real-time pcr there is no postamplification manipulation of the specimen eliminating the risk of carryover contamination the ease of use and rapid time to result would allow this system to be placed in a rapid-response laboratory in an emergency department to provide near-patient testing with results available quickly enough to affect clinical managementa multiplex assay for the detection of influenza a influenza b and rsv from nasopharyngeal specimens has been developed on the jaguar system the sensitivities for the detection of influenza a influenza b and rsv were 100 90 and 100 respectively compared with tissue culture results 8 the overall specificity was 99 during a 10-day period 1232 clinical samples were tested and 134 were positive for influenza a the jaguar assay demonstrated 100 positive agreement when compared with laboratory-developed molecular tests 2 false-positive findings were noted for a 998 negative agreement of the 134 specimens 126 were subtyped and found to be 2009 h1n1 all of these were detected by the jaguar test although the assay as currently designed does not distinguish between influenza a subtypes the jaguar system required 20 min of technical and 35 h to test 24 specimensthe filmarray system idaho technologies integrates nucleic acid extraction nested pcr detection and data analysis in a single-use pouch the system is automated and enables the detection of numerous viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in a single test all of the needed reagents for the assay are enclosed in the single-use pouch after addition of water to hydrate the lyophilized reagents and the respiratory specimen the pouch is loaded into the filmarray instrument and the rest of the test is completely automated after extraction and purification of nucleic acid a nested pcr reaction is performed within the pouch the first-step pcr is a multiplexed reaction containing primers for all of the viral and bacterial targets the amplicons from the first pcr are then diluted and a second round of pcr reactions is performed in a multiwell array each well containing a single primer set targeting a specific pathogenredundancy is built into the array with each target is amplified in 3 separate wells using amplification and melt curve analysis the filmarray software generates a result for each target the system is very robust detecting a low concentration of pathogen in the presence of a high concentration of a second pathogen with results available in 1 h although nested pcr is used the system is closed so there is no risk of carryover contamination preliminary studies show that the filmarray system detects more viral pathogens and more coinfections than dfa testing a respiratory panel is under development that detects adenoviruses bocaviruses conornaviruses influenza a and b influenza a subtypes novel h12009 h1 h3 metapneumonvirus parainfluenza viruses 14 rsv and rhinoviruses as well as bordetella pertussis c pneumoniae and m pneumoniae the ability to detect multiple pathogens within 1 h with a simple set-up and fully automated system raises the possibility of near-patient testing with the filmarray technology in the emergency department or an outpatient clinic the current instrumentation is limited to a single test per run so multiple instruments may be needed depending on the required throughputscalable target analysis routine star technology primeradx integrates conventional pcr with capillary electrophoresis providing the ability to detect a large number of pathogens 20 in a single reaction it also has the unique feature of providing quantitative data star is similar in principle to real-time pcr but uses amplicon size instead of fluorescent probes to identify targets after nucleic acid extraction a multiplex pcr reaction is set up with unique primers for each specific target the thermal cycler for the amplification reaction and capillary electrophoresis device are contained in the iceplex instrument during the amplification reaction a very small sample nanoliter of the master mix is subjected to capillary electrophoresis with sequential sampling every 2 cycles starting at cycle 19 and size separation the signal for the amplicon increases the accumulation of the amplicon is plotted over time generating an amplification curve and a cycle threshold is determined for each target each different target can be identified based on the unique size of the amplicon quantification of the targets is accomplished by adding 3 standards to the master mix each at a different concentration and with a unique amplicon size a standard curve is generated by plotting the cycle threshold values for the standards against their known concentration and this curve is used to determine the concentration of the targets all of the amplification capillary electrophoresis and data analysis steps are automated with the iceplex instrumentstar technology can demonstrate a large number of pathogens in a single reaction and the ability to quantify pathogens may prove very important in distinguishing colonization from invasive disease for pathogens such are s pneumoniae because the assay requires 5 h to complete testing is performed in a clinical laboratory and samples are batched this technology is therefore not designed for near-patient testing the instrument is a closed system so there is minimal risk of carryover contamination currently a test for the quantification of cytomegalovirus epstein-barr virus bk virus and human herpesviruses 6 and 7 in transplant recipients has been developed and is being evaluated a test for respiratory pathogens is also plannedplex-id abbott molecular is a unique system that combines pcr with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry esi-ms to detect a broad array of pathogens including bacteria viruses fungi and parasites after nucleic acid is extracted and purified from the clinical specimen multiple pcr reactions are performed in 96-well microtiter plates that use primers targeting highly conserved regions of the microbial genome that flank variable regions these types of primers have been also used for sequence-based pathogen identification the plates are loaded into the plex-id analyzer which automates the desalting step esi-ms determination of base composition and data analysis the amplified mixture is injected into an electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer where the mass of each amplicon is measured from the mass of the amplicon it is possible to determine the nucleotide base composition ie the number of a g c and t nucleotides for that dna molecule by requiring the base composition for the forward and reverse strands to be complementary the number of possibilities is reduced to a single unambiguous solution the organisms in the sample are determined by comparing the base composition of the observed amplicons to a database comprising known sequence data from a wide array of pathogens compared with culture or nucleic acid probe assays which are limited to the detection of only those microbes that grow or are targeted by the assay primer sequences this broad-based approach enables the identification of known emerging or unanticipated pathogensthe plex-id system has been used to identify viral respiratory pathogens from clinical specimens with results compared with an expanded reference standard including a combination of antigen detection culture and pcr methods the plex-id system performed well with a sensitivity of 95 for the detection of influenza a and b and 88 for rsv its sensitivity for the detection of adenoviruses parainfluenza viruses and coronaviruses was 100 although the number of specimens with these pathogens was low 9 the pcresi technology has been used to examine samples obtained from military recruits during outbreaks of respiratory disease and identified a variety of bacterial pathogens including h influenzaen meningitidis and streptococcus pyogenes 10this unique technology can detect a wide array of pathogens from clinical samples and is well suited for pathogen discovery and evaluation of emerging pathogens for example the plex-id system was able to determine the mixed lineage swine avian human of the novel h1n1 influenza a virus pcresi technology was also able to identify and distinguish between a diverse collection of coronavirus species that included the acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus 11 testing can be completed in 68 h the system is designed for use in clinical laboratories and it can be adapted for high-throughput testing although the high cost of the instrumentation has to date limited its use to research studiesthere are a wide array of emerging technologies for the detection and quantification of respiratory pathogens directly from clinical specimens some of these technologies have potential for high-throughput testing and others will allow rapid near-patient testing more studies are needed to fully elucidate their performance characteristics and determine their ideal clinical application the goal is to identify the tests that will improve diagnostic testing for respiratory pathogens affect patient management decisions and lead to improved patient outcomes more appropriate use of antivirals and antibiotics andor more cost-effective delivery of carethe dynamics that underlie the rapid spread of covid-19 are currently unknown 14 however the lack of vaccine and herd immunity and the paucity of knowledge concerning human-to-human transmission at the beginning of the outbreak are potentially important contributing factors 5 6 remarkably many patients with covid-19 may present with non-specific symptoms such as fever cough and sore throat while others may remain asymptomatic the latter subjects are thought to be significant sources to propagate infection in the population 46 at the time of this report cdcs update on may 16 2020 the case count of covid-19 in the usa stands at 1470000 cases including 88237 deaths indicating a mortality rate of 6 the total count of cases worldwide stands at 4560000 cases including 308000 deaths indicating a mortality rate of 67 5 we refer the readers to the reference citation 5

principles of early diagnosis early isolation and early prevention have been implemented at the personal national and international levels several governments around the globe have activated a national emergency alert to establish infection prevention measures to contain the propagating effects of the disease healthcare organizations and medical centers provide dynamically updated guidelines to best alleviate the impact of the pandemic medical personnel exchange knowledge about the mechanisms of transmission the clinical manifestations and the therapeutic approaches clinical diagnostics and research laboratories around the world are at work to understand disease mechanisms to optimize diagnostic tests and to develop vaccines for prevention however despite incredible efforts at multiple levels one of the few certainties is that nothing yet is certainthe coronaviruses covs have become the most emerging pathogens of respiratory disease epidemics prior to the sars-cov-2 pandemic two epidemics with covs have occurred during the past two decades the sars-cov in 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers-cov in 2012 6 7 these viruses can cross species barriers and cause in humans illness ranging from mild upper respiratory infection to severe acute respiratory illness such as mers and sars indeed person-to-person transmission of sars-cov-2 among close family contacts and coworkers even without travel history is the regular route for the infection 6 7the covs are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses with nucleocapsid and a crown-like appearance under an electron microscope the subfamily orthocoronavirinae of the coronaviridae family classifies into four genera of covs alphacoronavirus alphacov betacoronavirus betacov deltacoronavirus deltacov and gammacoronavirus gammacov 7 8 the sars-cov-2 belongs to the betacov genera like mers-cov and sars-cov to date seven covs are known to infect humans and cause outbreaks with variable clinical severity 610several sequences for sars-cov-2 have been published 1 2 11 these resources allowed researchers to trace the phylogenetic tree and to recognize strains that vary according to the mutations 12 13 for instance a recent report by angeletti et al suggested that a spike mutation which probably occurred in late november 2019 triggered crossing the species barriers to humans 12 moreover the availability of the complete genome of sars-cov-2 allowed scientists to develop diagnostic laboratory tests 14 15 the synthesis of viral polyprotein 1a1ab pp1app1ab from the viral rna is achieved in the host cells in the sars-cov-2 genome at least six orfs can be generated specifically a frameshift between orf1a and orf1b guides the production of both 1a and1ab polypeptides that are processed by virally encoded proteases for producing 16 nonstructural proteins nsps other orfs encode structural proteins including spike s membrane m envelope e nucleocapsid proteins n and accessory protein chains 1 2 10 16 fig 1evolving literature links virulence mechanisms of covs including sars-cov-2 to the nsps and structural proteins for example the nsps are able to block the host innate immunity 17 and the envelope e promotes viral assembly and release in particular more information is now available about the features of the spike glycoproteins positioned on the viral surface of covs which guide the binding to host receptors and determine host tropism and transmission properties 12 16 17 each monomer of the trimeric s protein contains two subunits s1 and s2 mediating attachment and membrane fusion respectively the s1 subunit utilizes human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 hace2 an important regulator of the cardiovascular system as the receptor to infect human cells 1820 being highly conserved s2 could be a selective target for antiviral anti-s2 agents in contrast the spike receptor-binding domain presents only 40 amino acid identity with sars-cov other sars-cov-2-specific structural elements are the orf3b and orf8 that have no homology with those of sars-cov finally the n protein plays an important role in viral replication research will be needed to further determine the structural components of sars-cov-2 that underlie the pathogenicitythe pathogenic mechanism of covid-19 disease is complex and poorly understood clinical longitudinal studies will have to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the variety of clinical manifestations of this disease the expression of ace2 in the lower respiratory tract is believed to have determined the natural history of sars tropism to infect the lower respiratory tract 20 the available data indicate that sars-cov-2 infection produces an uncontrolled immune response in the host known as a cytokine storm 21 the main culprit of this storm is interleukin 6 il-6 produced by activated leukocytes il-6 can execute different actions on a large number of cells and tissues it also stimulates the production of acute phase proteins that play important roles in thermoregulation and can result in severe tissue damage and multi-organ dysfunctionclinical and epidemiologic information have been used by most countries to determine who should be tested 22 in the usa diagnostic testing indications were limited at the beginning of the outbreak secondary to regulatory procedures for the new tests subsequently the fda released policies to allow laboratories to use their validated assays on march 4 2020 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc removed restrictive testing criteria encouraging the clinicians to use their judgment to determine whether a test should be performed at present the cdc recommends two criteria for testing 23 the high priority category includes hospitalized patients with symptoms healthcare facility workers and residents in long-term care facilities or other congregate living settings with symptoms the priority category includes persons with symptoms of suspected covid-19 infection and persons without symptoms who are prioritized by healthcare providers for any reason including public health monitoring or screening according to state and local plans the cdc does not recommend testing for asymptomatic personsonce a person is identified as a person under investigation pui for covid-19 it is recommended that the clinician should immediately adapt infection control and prevention ppe measures in addition to excluding all other sources of respiratory infection the decision on who to test should be based on the cdc guidance and local epidemiological data for sampling the who recommends collecting specimens from both the upper respiratory tracts nasopharyngeal np and oropharyngeal op swabs in the spontaneously breathing patients and the lower respiratory tract in the mechanically ventilated patients researchers have proven that np swab specimen is superior to the op swab specimen for the examination of sars-cov-2 24 25 as higher viral loads were detected in the nasal area than in the throat 26 therefore np swab is the preferred sampling method for covid-19 diagnosis upon collection the swabs should be placed immediately into a sterile transport tube containing 23 ml of either viral transport medium vtm amies transport medium or sterile saline 27 and stored at 4 c potential risks of np swabs include 1 the production of aerosol during the sampling which can impose infection risks to healthcare workers 2 the inconsistent quality of np swabs between collections which may lead to false-negative results and 3 the patient may experience discomfort during the sampling procedure aiming to address these potential risks further studies demonstrated the efficacy of less invasive routes for sampling such as throat wash and sputum collection 2530 saliva collection was shown to yield greater detection sensitivity and consistency throughout the course of the infection when compared with patient-matched np samples furthermore saliva could enable self-administered sample collection for accurate large-scale sars-cov-2 testing 28 some authors suggested a potential value in testing both fecal and respiratory specimens to improve the test sensitivity 29 however this issue remains under debate as the detection of viral rna in stool may not reflect actual viral replication or infection 30the top priority for controlling the rapidly evolving sars-cov-2-associated-covid-19 is developing a diagnostic test of high performance the use of viral culture is not feasible option for rapid diagnosis as it takes 35 days for sars-cov-2 to cause obvious cytopathic changes in vitro in addition virus isolation requires biosafety level-3 bcl-3 facilities of limited availability in many medical centers serology tests have not yet been validated moreover the issue of cross-reactivity with sars-cov remains to be solved therefore at present a positive result in nucleic acid testing nat using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr is the gold standard for diagnosing covid-19 14 31 32 although the assay is highly specific the sensitivity is relatively low secondary to several factors including the viral load virus replication rna isolation method and the source and timing of swab collection in relation to the disease stage 33 therefore further optimization to mitigate the high false-negative rate has been a crucial goal of high priorityafter collection the clinical samples are subjected to rna isolation this is a time-consuming step that is also extremely important to avoid the false-negative results the optimal protocol for the isolation of rna would ideally provide pure rnase-free nucleic acid and recover rna quantitatively across a range of dilutions several protocols for rna isolation have been used by different laboratory the efficiency of rna isolation protocols for sars-cov-2 from stool samples was discussed in a recent multicenter study 34 however limited data are currently available regarding the performance of rna extraction methods from other different types of specimensafter rna isolation from the clinical sample and amplification through a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr the sars-cov-2-specific primers serve to search for the viral rna sequences that are conserved 35 in patients with confirmed covid-19 diagnosis the laboratory evaluation should be repeated to confirm viral clearance prior to releasing from isolation 36 the conserved or abundantly expressed genes such as the structural genes n and e and the nonstructural rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp as well as the orf 1ab genes are the preferred targets for the sars-cov-2 rt-pcr assays 12 16 traditionally two molecular targets should be included in the assay to avoid potential cross-reaction with other covs as well as potential genetic drift of sars-cov-2 among these assays the rdrp assay exhibited the highest sensitivity 38 rna copiesreaction at 95 detection probability and involves two probes one of the probes is non-specific which would detect other covs whereas the second probe is specific for the sars-cov-2 these rdrp assays have been used in  30 laboratories in europe 15 37 in the usa the cdc recommends assays targeting two nucleocapsid proteins n1 and n2 38 while the who recommends an initial screening with the e gene assay followed by a confirmatory assay using the rdrp gene 15 importantly the rdrp assays were designed and validated using synthetic nucleic acid technology in vitro transcription in the absence of sars-cov-2 isolates or patient specimens 16given high false-negative rates additional studies on covid-19 samples highlighted the importance of successive sampling and testing of sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr 39 yuan et al reported that pcr assays returned positive in 25 covid-19 patients after discharge 40 therefore repeated viral rt-pcr testing separated by 48 h is essential in addition other parameters d-dimer and absolute lymphocyte count etc should be combined with negative rt-pcr test as additional measures to assure that recovered patients can be released from isolation the protocols of several rt-pcr assays have been implemented and published online httpswwwwhointemergenciesdiseasesnovel-coronavirus-2019technical-guidancelaboratory-guidance one of these assays is the reverse transcripton loop-mediated isothermal amplification assays known as rt-lamp which were developed by park gs et al these assays were designed to detect sars-cov-2 specifically even at low copy numbers without detecting other human covs furthermore a colorimetric detection method was developed for this assay allowing its potential use at higher throughput 41more recently chan jf et al developed novel rt-pcr assays for covid-19 targeting a different sequence of the rdrphel helicasehemagglutinin-esterase he 42 the researchers validated these assays using both in vitro system and samples from patients with confirmed diagnosis of covid-19 the new rdrphel assay exhibited higher sensitivity and specificity without cross-reactivity with other common respiratory viruses the authors speculated that the new rdrphel assay might be employed for detecting covid-19 cases with low viral loads particularly when samples from the upper respiratory tract saliva or plasma are used for testing moreover they proposed using these assays for serial monitoring of the viral load in plasma of the covid-19 patients to detect the cases with sars-cov-2 rnaemia circulating viral rna in blood and thereby to inform prognostic and treatment decisionsserologic assays are urgently needed for 1 infection prevention measures including identifying the viral sources 2 epidemiologic and sero-surveillance studies to infer the burden of disease taking into account the rate of asymptomatic infection and the extent disease transmission to the households and 3 analyzing the results of vaccine trials and therapeutic antibodies however other than few exceptions 43 validated serologic assays are relatively lacking at presentthe lateral flow assays for sars-cov-2 igm and igg antibodies may potentially be useful in assessing the burden of covid-19 infection however important limitations exist including the low specificity of the igm responses and the delayed seroconversion of the specific igg responses therefore these assays cannot be used for acute diagnostics but may represent an indirect indication of covid-19 infection that is best utilized to confirm late covid-19 cases retrospectively or to assess the immunity of healthcare providers during the pandemic in addition they can be useful to predict which patient would benefit from repeat testing self-isolation or targeted therapies for covid-19 43 44 finally it should be noted that convalescent plasma or immunoglobulin-containing fractions obtained from recovered covid-19 cases have been successfully used to treat patients with active covid-19 disease 45 46the spike and nucleocapsid proteins are the main immunogens of the sars-cov-2 6 okba nma et al established serologic assays for detection of sars-cov-2 neutralizing spike protein-specific s and nucleocapsid-specific n antibodies using serum samples from patients with pcr-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection 47 the investigators validated the various antigens using elisa platforms and found that most of the patients with the sars-cov-2 infection seroconverted by 2 weeks after the beginning of their illness particularly the s1 subunit was more specific than s2 in detecting the sars-cov-2-specific antibodies this finding could be explained by the higher conservation of the s2 subunit in covs relative to s1 therefore s1 was identified as a specific antigen for the sars-cov-2 serology testing remarkably further validation of s1-specific iga and igg elisa assays by two different groups revealed that while the iga-based elisa was more sensitive the igg elisa showed higher specificity than the iga elisa furthermore compared with iga igg is longer lasting in patients and thus is preferred for serology studies to date no studies have addressed cross-reactivity from other non-specific proteins that can lead to false-positive result further studies and optimization of elisa assays will be necessarythe frequency of detecting antibodies to the n protein in covid-19 patients indicates that the n protein may be useful as an immunodominant antigen in the early diagnosis of covid-19 disease 4850 for testing antibodies to the n protein investigators relied on the high degree of similarity between the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 proteins estimated 90 to develop a new elisa assay in which the sars-cov n protein was used as antigen using 3 different validated elisas the investigators demonstrated that higher antibody levels are associated with the severity of infection furthermore they showed that n-specific igg seroconversion occurs in the second week after the beginning of the symptoms remarkably compared with s1 elisas the n protein elisas showed higher sensitivity in detecting antibodies in mildly infected patients and stronger correlations with the plaque reduction neutralization test however this observation requires confirmation in a larger cohort of patients with different levels of disease severity to precisely monitor the timing of seroconversion even in mildly symptomatic patients further antibodies against two different antigens should be tested to decrease false-negative results in serial disease monitoring studies 51 well-defined standard references should be developed to standardize the serologic assays developed by different laboratories to account for inter-assay variability and to unify data interpretation tools from different studies finally as research efforts are currently focused on developing a vaccine for sars-cov-2 validation and standardization of serologic testing are crucial for evaluating vaccine immunogenicity and effective induction of antibody responses for preventionrapid antigen assays are emerging new class of tests to be used in the sars-cov-2 pandemic these assays are designed to detect particles of the viral proteins in nasal swabs quickly by using simple qualitative or semiquantitative in vitro diagnostic procedure which can be performed either in the lab or at a local point of care to give results within 1 h 52 rapid antigen assays are currently being validated to enhance clinical laboratories capacity to match the urgent need for rapid covid-19 detecting in response to the pandemic the first emergency used authorization has been issued by the us food and drug administration fda to the quidel corporation for the sofia 2 sars antigen fia on may11 2020 53 this test is authorized for use in clia clinical laboratory improvement amendments certified laboratories few other rapid tests are currently being validated by the who or on the fda list an important advantage of an antigen test is the speed of the test at lower cost and the high specificity however they have high false-negative rate due to lower sensitivity therefore a negative result from a rapid antigen test requires confirmation with a pcr test prior to formalizing isolation and treatment decisionsas mentioned previously the main culprit of the uncontrolled excessive immune reaction to sars-cov-2 is il-6 which was found to increase particularly during the symptomatic exacerbation of covid-19 disease other common molecular laboratory findings in the early stage of covid-19 disease include decreased white blood cells lymphocytes and platelets as well as metablic acidosis with elevated lactate dehydrogenase ldh elevated liver transaminases muscle enzymes and reactive protein c in addition laboratory indicators of systemic shock ards and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy have been reported in the severely ill patients notably lymphopenia and elevated ldh appear to be negative prognostic factors while procalcitonin value has been reported to be normal in several covid-19 cohorts 21 54 other than the descriptive data obtained from retrospective analysis of covid-19 patients clinical records the current literature is lacking the pathogenic mechanisms clinical preclinical and pathological research will have to elucidate the pathophysiology underlying the various manifestations of the diseasethe pathomechanisms of pneumonia in covid-19 disease are poorly understood data available from histopathological slides indicate pulmonary edema of primary respiratory origin and thick proteinaceous exudates consisting of large protein globules associated with hyperplasia of the pneumocytes additionally vascular engorgement and interstitial inflammatory process involving fibrinoid material and multinucleated tissue macrophages have been reported 55current literature evidence indicates that 6093 of patients have positive chest computed tomographic ct findings consistent with covid-19 infection prior to positive rt-pcr test results 56 57 the pulmonology findings on chest ct images are more prominent approximately 10 days after the onset of the disease including bilateral pneumonia noted in 80 of cases other lung abnormalities include ground glass opacities and lobular wall thickening notably progressive consolidation can take place up to 2 weeks while fibrotic bands were recognized upon the resolution of symptoms in addition reactive lymphadenopathy that resolved within 1 month was noted in some cases remarkably any of these radiology findings were reported to change dynamically over a short period of timein light of high false-negative result rate in nucleic acid testing nat using rt-pcr technology thoracic ct imaging has become a critical diagnostic tool in combination with close monitoring of clinical features and epidemiological data for covid-19 confirmation and management more recently fang et al reported that the sensitivity of ct 98 exceeded that of rt-pcr 71 in diagnosing covid-19 56 therefore several reports suggested that the suspected covid-19 patient pui should not be prematurely cleared from quarantine and ppe measures should not be discontinued by one negative result of rt-pcr testing 56 57 rather the patients symptoms chest ct images and other laboratory parameters should be taken into account to inform the clinical decision regarding further management ppe measures and evaluating the need for repeating the diagnostic test although several studies described the imaging features of covid-19 clinical stratification of pulmonology abnormalities and their correlation with the disease course need to be conducted in the future such data may lead to identification of a prognostic matrix for the diseaseincredible efforts are being made to contain a global crisis that is aggressively testing the healthcare systems worldwide infection prevention and control officers are tasked at maximum capacities to flatten the curve of covid-19 spread clinicians are intensely challenged with limited therapeutic options and specific targets for this disease scientists are at full speed to develop diagnostic testing vaccines and new therapieslaboratory investigations to determine the structural elements of sars-cov-2 that underlie its pathogenicity are needed to identify diagnostic and therapeutic targets longitudinal clinical and preclinical studies will be tasked to explain the heterogenous clinical manifestation of the covid-19 disease prospective longitudinal studies and clinical trials will be necessary to understand the disease epidemiology and clinical course and to evaluate potential vaccines for prevention and efficacy of specific therapiesit must be acknowledged that this overview is based on initial clinical and scientific reports to date there is paucity of information regarding the impact on the cardiovascular system and congenital heart defects population 58 current therapeutic approaches to deal with the infection are mainly symptomatic and basic life support measures prevention aimed at reducing human-to-human transmission remains our best optionsirsince december 2019 the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 has emerged as the cause of a pandemic disease known as coronavirus disease 19 covid-191 on february 21th 2020 the outbreak began in italy presently the worlds worst affected country2 the diagnosis of covid 19 is based on a molecular test aimed to detect the virus rna in respiratory samples such as nasopharyngeal swabs ns or bronchial aspirate ba3 this is an imperfect gold standard which can give false negatives if the amount of viral genoma is insufficient or if the correct time-window of viral replication is missed4 testing the igm and igg production in response to viral infection might be a simple method to enhance the detection sensitivity and accuracy of the molecular test5 in addition it may be used for screening purpose to assess antibody profiles in a large population large-scale screening programs using antibody tests are currently under evaluation by different governments recently a test for the rapid detection of combined igg and igm antibodies to sars-cov-2 in human blood serumplasma has become available6 as soon as the kits were commercially available we assessed the reliability and usefulness of the 2019-ncov iggigm antibody rapid test kit beijing diagreat biotechnologies co ltd in patients with confirmed covid 19 and in a small sample of patients with suspected disease who were screened to be admitted to either a covid 19 unit or to a non covid 19 wardwe enrolled a total of 30 patients admitted to the infectious disease covid 19 unit or to the pneumology unit azienda uo policlinico-san marco catania and 7 healthy controls the study population was divided in three groups123 patients with confirmed covid 19 who had according to the who definition consistent radiologicalclinical findings and positive molecular tests for sars-cov-23
27 patients with suspected covid 19 who had suggestive radiologicalclinical findings but negative molecular tests37 asymptomatic controls with negative molecular tests
all patients had molecular testing using ns or ba as they arrived to our emergency room with covid 19 symptoms sars-cov-2 rna in the samples was detected by real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative pcr rt-pcr assay according to guidelines3
qualitative assessment of igg and igm was performed using the rapid immunochromatographic assay during hospital stay confirmed cases or upon admission to the emergency room suspicious cases following the manufactures instruction the response was obtained within 15 minutes using 200l of blood the test allowed detection of a single antibody or combinations of both the presence or absence of each antibody was expressed as  or  respectivelyin the group with confirmed covid 19 mean age 5717 yrs two patients were intubated for severe disease and 10 were treated with non invasive ventilation andor o2-therapy the time from symptoms onset to antibody testing ranged from 3 to 34 days overall the seroconversion rate for both igm and igg was 826 1923 four confirmed cases had both negative igm and igg igm-igg- among these two patients were tested at day 3 and 5 from symptoms onset since a recent report showed that the median time for igm and igg detection from symptoms onset was 11 and 12 days respectively3 we reasoned that these two were likely early tests excluding these two in the remaining patients after a median time of 18 days from symptoms onset the conversion rate was 904in the group with suspected covid 19 mean age 6715 yrs only a 40 yrs old man considered a highly probable case had igm igg after 12 days from symptoms onset and two negative molecular tests based on consistent clinicalradiological and antibody test findings he was admitted and properly treated for covid 19 all the remaining 6 patients with suspected covid 19 had two to three negative molecular testis on na confirmed by negative tests on bronchial aspirate consistently they all had igm-igg- all healthy controls had igm-igg- overall including 37 tests the concordance between rt-pcr and antibody test was 864 table 1
 cohens k 072 substantial agreement considering the molecular test the gold standard for diagnosis the sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test were 83 and 93 respectivelythe reason why two patients with confirmed covid 19 had negative iggigm at a time when seroconversion was already expected remains unclear one was a 93 yrs old woman so that immunesenescence can explain the finding however the other patient was young and immunocompetent so that we must consider an issue related to the test performance eg the lower limit of detectionthe correct timing to detect igm and igg response after infection with sars-cov-2 is so far unclear as few studies are available with divergent results5

7 our preliminary data suggest that the rapid iggigm test is reliable in evidencing seroconversion as long as the testing is not performed 6 days before symptoms onset if this finding will be confirmed in a larger sample the test could be a putative mean by which assessing population immunizationin the group with suspected covid 19 which was anyway very small we found mainly a consistency between negative molecular and negative antibody test however the antibody test was performed earlier compared to the group with confirmed disease median 9 days vs 18 days and this may have biased these results so that we will further test these patientsto our opinion this antibody test is quite reliable and useful since it has the advantage to be a point-of-care test that gives a response within minutes in those patients presenting with a discrepancy between the clinicalradiological feature and the molecular test the rapid antibody detection might be an additional element helping the clinician to make a correct diagnosis this is true as long as the test is not performed within the first days of symptoms onset indeed further studies are granted to investigate both the diagnostic and the screening value of this testthe coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 is the latest pandemic gaoling the humanity having very high spreading rate and approximately 56 of mortality worldwide this novel beta coronavirus is an enveloped non-segmented positive sense rna virus the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 genome structure comprises single stranded rna with nucleocapsid protein which are enclosed by membrane proteins envelope proteins and spike glycoproteins 1 fig 1 as a coronavirus the sars-cov-2 has high similarity with other viruses like sars-cov and mers-cov 2 the entry of the novel coronavirus to host is through the interaction between the densely glycosylated spike proteins to the receptors on host cell membrane the spike glycoprotein is a trimeric class i fusion protein consisting s1 and s2 domains 3 it is reported that there is 55 similarity in s1 domain of spike glycoproteins among sars-cov-2 and sars-cov and 91 similarity in case of s2 domain it is evident that the sars-cov-2 can infect the human respiratory epithelial cells through interaction of spike protein with the human ace2 receptor 4the coronaviruses are large rna viruses 65125 nm in diameter come under the coronaviridae family in the nidovirales order normally the coronavirus genome contains six open reading frame orfs which encodes for the structural as well as accessory proteins in the virus the nucleocapsid protein n-protein in the coronavirus binds to rna genome and forms a capsid around the enclosed nucleic acid the function of n-protein includes the interaction with membrane protein during viral assembly assists in rna synthesisfolding and affects host cell responses including cell cycle and translation the structural and accessory proteins are essential for viral replication genome maintenance and pathogenesis of the virus 5 at present the most widely used approved test for the diagnosis of covid-19 is the polymerase chain reaction pcr two different strategies are in use for pcr based assays the reverse transcriptase pcr rt-pcr and the loop mediated isothermal amplification pcr lamp pcr both methods offer high sensitivity 8590 and specificity for the covid-19 diagnosis as the methods are focusing on direct amplification of the virus genetic material the rt-pcr is quantitative in nature whereas the lamp pcr is qualitative as compared to rt-pcr lamp pcr will be more cost effective and less time consuming high throughput screening is another nucleic acid detection technology it is costly and has high equipment dependency making it less widely used even though the aforementioned methods can offer nearly 90 accurate result the improper sample collection handling and transportation may lead to false negative results obviously decreasing the sensitivity of the assaythe rt-pcr is the most common and effective method used in the market to detect sars-cov-2 in rt-pcr reverse transcriptase converts virus rna into cdna following amplification into millions of copies of dna using a set of specific primers and probes the amplification taking place in 3 steps 1 denaturation 2 annealing and 3 elongation these three steps take place at 95 c for 30 s 50 for 30 s and 72 c for 60 s respectively the primers target and amplify different regions for sars-cov-2 such as nucleocapsid protein n gene envelope protein e gene and orf1ab gene regions which can be determined within the same cycle and separately for confirmatory testing 6 the turnaround time for sample analyses is 2535 h one-step rt-pcr assay to detect e gene and rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene regions of sars-cov-2 has been developed by tib-molbiol 7 predominantly upper respiratory samples including nasopharyngeal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs are recommended for analysis there are many breakthrough assays developed by various ivd manufacturers including abbott bosch and cepheid where a specific gene of sars-cov-2 is detected within few minutes although rt-pcr is the most widely used confirmatory test for covid-19 this technique is not robust and can only be performed by skilled analysts due to various biological safety hazards making sample detection cumbersome in many cases 8even though the rt-pcr is a robust technology there are many factors contributing to false-positive and false-negative results mutations in primers targeting virus genome can lead to false negative results laboratory practices and safety procedures including collection transportation and handling also contribute to false negative results 9 the sampling timing and optimum sample types play significant role in obtaining highly sensitive and highly specific results 10 in most pcr assays two different regions of genes are targeted hence the result interpretation will be positive negative or inconclusive if both genes are amplified the result is positive if only one gene is positive that is called inconclusive and negative could be a false negative so inconclusive and negative persons should be treated as doubtfulthe efforts on minimizing length of the entire pcr process and practice of isothermal amplification has resulted in the development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification the lamp is a highly specific isothermal amplification technique with an analytical limit of detection of 75 copies per l in lamp conversion of rna to dna is followed by amplification of sample genome using 46 primers forward inner primer forward outer primer reverse inner primer and reverse outer primer targeting different regions of the dna 11 the lamp has several advantages over rt-pcr it is considered to be more user friendly with easy detection speed and less background signal when compared to rt-pcr in addition to its speed lamp shows high level of specificity and high amplification efficiency than rt-pcr 12 the recently developed chitra gene lamp-n by sree chitra thirunal medical institute and technology in collaboration with agappe diagnostics ltd detects two different regions of n gene the turnaround time of 20 min for the analysis of 30 samples is a remarkable achievement however stringent evaluations on commercial lamp kits are needed for accuracy check and processing of large samples is an impetus for covid-19 testingapart from rt-pcr and lamp united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc approved one-step real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr to quantitatively detect viral particles in more than 90 samples within 45 min 13 recently specific high sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking sherlock that allows multiplexed portable and ultra-sensitive detection of rna is a detection strategy used to combat sars-cov-2 cas13a ribonucleases used for rna sensing binds to amplified rna which when activated cleaves fluorophore-quencher probes emitting fluorescence sherlock has previously been used to detect clinical samples for zika virus 14 nevertheless there is a need for further optimisation of this technique in larger samples to achieve large scale evaluation of sars-cov-2though the rrt-pcr is considered as the gold standard in the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 it has own limitations as a pandemic screening and isolation of the infected patients is the only way to reduce the spread of covid-19 in rt-pcr the testing directly look for the presence of viral dna but serological tests detect the presence of antibodiesantigens in human blood against the covid-19 hence rt-pcr will give the positive results in 37 days of infection but serological test will take 714 days to give positive results the test cost and testing time of pcr based assays inevitably demands the development of rapid serology tests 1517 several immunoassays are developed by various ivd companies for detecting covid-19 infection in serum plasma and whole blood among these strategies lateral flow immunoassays elisa and chemiluminescence are most promising approachesthe limitation of rrt-pcr to detect covid-19 past infection and the progress of the disease increases the importance of serological assays the serological tests can detect both active and past infections if the tests are performed within the correct time frame after the onset of the disease in case of antibody detection assay both igg and igm antibodies against the covid-19 are the target analytes where igm appears in blood within a week of time and igg expression will take more than 10 days apart from antibody detection antigen detection against spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein is also under development which offers early detection of covid-19 infection in case of rt-pcr one of the important reasons for false negative results is improper sampling throat swab and transport whereas the sample of choice for serological test is serumplasmawhole blood which are easy to handle and transport serological tests like lfia for antigenantibody detection can be used as a rapid test or a point of care testing which offers quick screening of the patients with limited expertise 18 detecting antibody titre is important for convalescent plasma therapy and the development of vaccines for covid-19 apart from that serological testing would also provide valuable information regarding the course and degree of immune response as well as the durability of immunity in both infected individuals and participants in the vaccine clinical trials 19the lfia can be utilized as a preliminary testing tool for covid-19 in case of community spread or in mass population screening at present the covid-19 iggigm antibody evaluation kits based on lfia is widely available in market upon covid-19 infection the igm and igg antibodies will start to develop in our body from 710 days and 1420 days respectively though igm can be detected earlier it also decreases and disappears earlier but igg can persist for a long time after the infection even though the antibody test kits are reliable for preliminary screening the test cannot be used as a confirmatory test because of non-specific interaction of antibodies and other proteins in the blood with capture and detector molecules in the membrane which may results in false positive or false negative results 20the main advantages of lfia are that it can be used as a rapid poc test and it can be detected using finger-pricked blood or serumplasma it does not require any instruments or expertise staff for carrying out the test and it gives result in 530 min 21 the lfia antibody test for covid-19 can also be considered as a prognostic tool there by provides information about the immune status of the patient mostly the lfia results are qualitative but can be made quantitative by the use of customized color readers currently covid-19 antigen lfia test is under development which will offer more sensitive and specific result for covid-19 diagnosis and will detect the viral antigen in 3 days of infection 22the elisa and clia platforms are widely using serology techniques for the quantitative detection of specific antigen or antibody in the samples zhang et al have developed an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of covid-19 igm and igg antibody from serum sample sars-cov-2 rp3 nucleocapsid protein is adsorbed on the surface of a 96 well plate as capture molecule and anti-igg antibody conjugated with horse radish peroxidase is used as the detector molecule 23 manual elisa kits for detecting covid-19 have been developed by ivd manufactures like ibl international drg diagnostics gmbh epitope diagnostics and euroimmun for detecting the igg and igm antibodies developed in response to covid-19 infection 24 elisa and clia based covid-19 antigen detection kits are under development by ivd manufacturers worldwideautomated clia method can also detect igg and igm antibody in serum or plasma the advantages of automated clia analyzers compared to rapid lfia tests is the very high throughput of samples and the ability to detect other biomarkers like c- reactive protein simultaneously 22 dz-lite sars-cov-2 clia developed by diazyme usa and maglumi clia developed by snibe china are chemiluminescent analyzers which can detect igg and igm antibodies of covid-19besides the aforementioned specific tests certain routine biochemical and haematological tests show abnormal results in covid 19 patients upon covid-19 infection the level of prothrombin time lactate dehydrogenase ldh d-dimer alanine transaminase alt c-reactive protein crp erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and creatine kinase are elevated 25 there is a marked lymphopenia with depletion of cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes in the early phase of the disease as the disease progress patients show higher levels of interleukin-2 il-2 il-7 il-10 granulocyte colony-stimulating factorgcsf interferon gamma-induced protein monocyte chemotactic protein 1 mcp1 macrophage inflammatory protein alpha and tumour necrosis factor- tnf- its also noted that patients in intensive care show significant increase in amylase and d-dimer and in case of non survivors there is a marked elevation in the level of ferritin blood urea neutrophil count and d-dimer and creatinine levels but procalcitonin pct is not elevated in covid 19 so procalcitonin level can be used for the differential diagnosis of covid 19 from bacterial pneumonia 26 27the level of crp starts to rise at the time of mild pneumonia and reaches peak at severe pneumonia the crp is also used as a marker of inflammation and the rise correlates with the level of inflammation regardless of the factors such as age sex and physical condition it is reported that the crp levels are positively correlated with lung lesions in early stage of covid 19 cases and can be used as a key indicator for disease monitoring 28 29the nucleic acid based diagnostics methods and serological assays described above are serving as strong diagnostics tools for the covid-19 diagnosis the assurance of quality of developed diagnostics kits is having prime importance at this scenario even though recently many developments happened in the field of serological diagnosis for covid-19 still there are many concerns regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the assays the complexity cost effectiveness and limitations of nucleic acid based diagnostic tools impetus the innovative development of well standardized high sensitive specific and low cost serological assays for covid-19 diagnosisin december 2019 numerous cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in wuhan china 1 in january the novel causative virus named sars-cov-2 was identified which spread to other chinese regions and to other countries causing a world pandemic 23 the clinical presentation of this disease named coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 varied from asymptomatic or mild flu-like symptoms to severe bilateral pneumonia with acute respiratory distress and death a rapid replication of the virus within the first 24 hours from the infection and the relatively high about 3 reproduction number were described 4the available viral genome sequences allowed to soon recognize the close relationship between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov-1 the causative pathogen of the 2002-2004 outbreak presenting with severe acute respiratory syndrome sarsboth viruses belong to the coronaviridae family they are characterized by a single-stranded 30 kb positive-sense rna and enveloped spherical virions of about 160 nm the unusual large size of their genome leaves these viruses enough space to rearrange their genes recombination thus donating them some genomic plasticity 5 furthermore rna biosynthesis seems to use a virus-specific template switch which results in transcription of sub-genomic mrnas and eventually leading to homologous rna recombination 5 nevertheless by encoding a 3-5exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 nsp14-exon which is required for high-fidelity replication the mutation capacity of sars-cov-2 is debated 6 in the end somehow the plasticity allowed coronaviridae to acquire a rich strains biodiversity and the ability to jump species which already caused previous zoonotic outbreaks as for mers-cov and sars-cov 7 8 9starting from observed similarities in a short region of rdrp gene between sars-cov-2 and a bat coronavirus batcovratg13 further sequences were identified to be 96 identical at the whole-genome level corroborating the hypothesis of animals to humans spill-over 10as of june 3 more than 6 million cases of covid-19 have been declared including more than 380 thousands of deaths 11 because of the rapid and fatal spread of the pandemic the research on development of diagnostic tests was set a priority for infection control measures and patients carethe present review summarizes performances and limitations of diagnostic tests to help clinicians in the interpretation of the results and clinical managementthree of the major challenges in molecular diagnosis are 1 to detect small amount of viral rna for reducing the number of false negatives 2 to differentiate the positive signal among different pathogens for decreasing the number of false positives and 3 to have a large capacity in order to quickly and correctly test a large number of patients while avoiding false negatives and false positives molecular and serological tests were previously compared during the sars-cov-1 epidemic showing an increased sensitivity and specificity for the molecular ones for this reason real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rrt-pcr represents the validated assay for early diagnosis in patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection 12first publications showed that diagnosis was possible by targeting the spike s gene of the virus with a good specificity differentiating sars-cov-2 from sars-cov-1 but limited sensitivity 10 sensitivity was further improved when integrating other viral-specific genes such as rdrphelicase hel nucleocapside n and envelop e genes 13 a comparison between all targeted genes revealed that best results were obtained with rdrphel genes 14 and who guidelines recommend the use of rdrp e n and s genes in different combinations 12 in our institution we introduced the who recommended test described by corman et al targeting the e gene followed by confirmation with rdrp primers 13 on our fully automated molecular diagnostic platform 15 rna extraction was performed through the magna pure 96 system roche basel switzerland and the rrt-pcr was carried out on a quantstudio 7 system applied biosystems waltham united states 15 we observed low sensitivity of the rrt-pcr targeting the rdrp gene due to a mismatch in the primer also described by corman and collegues 13 and since the e gene was constantly more sensitive than rdrp we decided after having performed about 1000 tests to continue addressing the e gene only 16 this allowed us to save reagents and to be able to perform an increasing number of tests in a setting of reagents shortage due to the pandemic nature of covid-19 to detect a possible drift due to mutations and to avoid that a mutant strain escape our diagnostic test we kept targeting both e and rdrp genes once a weekrna extraction methods can generally be classified into i one-step with the rt step and the pcr reaction in the same tube and ii two-steps rt-pcr initial creation of dna copies with rt reaction followed by their addiction to the pcr reaction typically one-step pcr uses one reaction-tube minimizing the risk of contamination false positive results on the other hand two-step pcr allows for archiving the cdna sample and further testing of other genesas pointed out in a recent work from pang and colleagues 17 there are different rna extraction platforms summarized in table 1
 which can allow to improve sensitivity and tat but also sometimes increase the costsdespite the good performance of the validated naats there is still a risk of false negative results most of them concern the pre-analytic setting such as the timing of the specimen collection too early or too late in the infection course including the limit of detection due to late infections with atypical manifestations the quality of sampling insufficient material or type of specimens bronchoalveolar lavage -bal exhibits the highest sensitivity followed by induced sputum naso-pharyngeal -np swab oro-pharyngeal -op swab and feces and finally the sample transport inappropriate container exposure to extreme temperatures etc 18 19 further reasons decreasing the performance of a molecular test include the ability of the virus to mutate changing sequence of the regions in which primers are hybridizing or the pcr inhibition 20 the latter being nowadays almost insignificant in our laboratory we observed an inhibition in about 03 of the tested sampleswith the purpose of reducing the tat of naats several rapid microarray and sequencing solutions built on multi-rt-pcr panels and automated systems have been developed 17 21 an important highly performing test although expensive and not useful for a high number of samples is the genxprt sars-cov-2 test cepheid httpswwwcepheidcom which due to its simplicity and its very short tat rapidly helped patient management especially regarding isolation procedures 22finally several manufacturers already developed other advanced specific systems 23 24 25 26 27 28 and investigations showed their easiness rapidity and compatibility with automation 29 30one of the down-sides of serological assays is the limited sensitivity at early stage when the host has not yet developed specific antibodies in the specific case of sars-cov-2 data from literature showed a production of igm and igg starting after the first week from infection and generally detectable from the second 31 32 33 34 leaving some space for delayed antibody responses previously associated for mers-cov with more severe disease 35another conundrum is to avoid the cross-reactivity between antibodies against different viruses part of the same or different families this is particularly difficult since most of the human coronaviruses are antigenically closely related 36 although solvable by adding a virus neutralization test as previously suggested by who during sars epidemic in 2004 37sensitivity and specificity of serological assays can also be affected by the target antigen as highlighted by meyer and colleagues the s protein produced in more advanced stage of sars-cov-2 infection showed lower levels of sensitivity and more specificity especially the s1 subunit compared to the n protein 38 noteworthy we recently observed a coste et al data not shown that the antibodies directed against the n protein seems to decrease earlier than the s protein thus the sensitivity of assays targeting only the n protein may be impaired according to the timing of infection figure 1
 for this reason we recommend to systematically use two tests one targeting the s protein and one targeting the n protein for diagnostic purposes for sero-epidmiological studies a test targeting the s protein is recommended the added value to target the s protein is that the titers will likely better reflect protection against reinfection in table 2
we summarized the interpretation of diagnostic microbiological tests according to the time of infection the presence or absence of symptoms and the type of diagnostic test used interestingly the high specificity of the s protein was corroborated by a study on sars-cov-2 spike protein epitopes showing that even considering the homologies with sars-cov-1 the virus of covid-19 exhibits novel antibody epitopes 39 this translates in the lack of efficacy of sars-cov-1 antibodies against covid-19 40 but at the same time it reinforces our trust in the specificity of the serological test when targeting s proteinsthere are currently a huge number of tests on the market 21 ideally only high quality assays with sensitivity greater than 95 and specificity superior or equal to 98 should be used as well as for naats different platforms can be considered also for serological tests the lateral flow assays lfa often exhibits a lower sensitivity then the enzyme linked immunosorbent assays elisa and chemo-luminescent immune-assays clia 41 among the different lfa we identified the dynamiker tianjin as one of the best being both sensitive and specific coste et al2020 submitted for publication nevertheless we preferred elisa and clia which enable larger series and less hands on time in lausanne we initially started on 14th april using a elisa based assay epitope diagnostics usa that was targeting the n protein this elisa exhibited 96 of sensitivity on samples taken 15 to 30 days post-infection and a specificity of 100 on 450 samples taken before the outbreak coste et al2020 data not shown submitted for publication more recently we moved to clia the snibe run on maglumy instruments china target the n protein alike the roche clia runring on cobas instruments switzerland conversely the abbott test running on the m2000 instruments usa and the diasorin test running on the liaison instruments italy both target the s proteinas mentioned median time for seroconversion is of about 10 to 14 days 31 32 33 but early seroconversion has also been documented already 3 to 5 days post-infection 34 interestingly the appearance of igm occurs at the same time than igg thus the main advantage to also test igm is to assess the timing of the infectionthe need of developing point-of-care devices to reduce the tat and increase the number of daily tests have stimulated the research towards faster and simpler kits numerous manufacturers quickly developed rapid immuno-chromatographic point-of-care tests already available on the market 21at this point data are being gathered on the diagnostic gain obtained through these rapid kits and further and more accurate studies are warranted which can define sensitivity and specificity of the tests in relation with timing of infection and targeted proteinsin a complex scenario such as the ongoing pandemic not only the diagnoses need to be timely and accurate but laboratory testing needs also to provide epidemiological information in order to assess the magnitude of the event and the spread rate in this setting serological assays can become helpful both to complete the epidemiological link when molecular diagnosis results are negative and to alleviate the burden of laboratories implicated in molecular diagnosis 12 in this way a rapid point-of-care serological assay cheap and simple enough to be affordable by any hospital if used correctly not at an early stage of disease could allow enlarging the spectrum of tested population especially among those who did not develop enough symptoms to require hospitalization hence molecular testing at the same time if used as an asset for population screening at the right time and as adjunctive to the reference method the overall epidemiological information gained could account for the sensitivity loss in early stage of diagnosis indications for serological testing are summarized in table 3
while serological assays can represent a useful epidemiological asset naats remains the gold standard for diagnosis due to their high sensitivity even at early stages of the diseasefollowing the quantification of viral load over time and integrating that with information on sample collection technique and timing might be helpful to differentiate different stages of the disease viral quantification will also provide information regarding the value of testing different samples from different parts of the bodydue to the main respiratory tropism of sars-cov-2 best samples for sensitivity come from the respiratory tract in particular np swabs showed higher and longer persisting viral loads than op swabs 42in one hand due to the higher concentration of the virus in the lower respiratory tract it could be argued that sensitivity of np swabs is still not enough to avoid false negative results on the other hand samples from lower respiratory tract such as bal or bronchial aspirates require invasive procedures not possible without intubation in subjects already suffering from severe respiratory insufficiencyfinally the decision whether to trust or not a negative np swab should be always corroborated by the clinical presentation of the patient 43 and if possible completed by serology testing if a strong clinical suspicion is present the repetition of the test is recommended a new np swab is the first option since often the false negative np test is due to inadequate sampling of only the distal part of the nasal cavity repetition of the test with a lower respiratory tract sample will be advisable for those patients admitted to the hospital hence with heavier symptoms but stable enough to be submitted to invasive procedures if the patient is asymptomatic but still considered at risk of infection due to specific exposure investigating the serology between 10 and 15 days after the exposure could help to document an asymptomatic infectionsamples like blood and urines were found to be weakly-to-none sensitive while the virus was also found in feces and perineal swabs of patients with gastro-intestinal symptoms 44 45 indicating another sample deserving further investigationsanother consideration is whether the local respiratory gastro-intestinal microbiota play a role against the diffusion of the virus which together with the immune system diversity might contribute to the variety of clinical presentations and affect different viral concentrations 46 47finally considering this rapidly evolving pandemic and its zoonotic outbreak more knowledge needs to be gathered from further studies in the diagnostic field both investigating the specific features of this virus and novel diagnostic approaches possibly combining the molecular methods with the serologic ones in order to booster sensitivity and specificity results despite the desperate need to implement naat or serological test the introduction of these tests needs to be done with high quality criteria to assess the performance of the tests in order to avoid a massive amount of false positive and false negative results to save time the validation of these tests should be centralized to reference laboratories and then rapidly implemented in other laboratories upon validation of the performance of the testdr caruana dr croxatto dr opota dr coste dr lamoth dr jaton have nothing to disclose dr lamoth reports personal fees from gilead personal fees from msd outside the submitted work dr greub reports grants from resistell from nittobo outside the submitted workthe authors did not receive any financial support for this worknot applicabledr caruana conceived and design the study performed the literature research drafted and revised the article and finally approved the version to be submitteddr croxatto dr opota dr coste dr lamoth dr jaton contributed to the conception and design of the study critically revised the article and finally approved the version to be submitted prof greub conceived and designed the study contributed to drafting the article critically revised the article and finally approved the version to be submitted
